	1
16:4	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
meet	1
that	1
I	1
go	1
also,	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
16:5	1
Now	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
Macedonia:	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
pass	1
through	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
abide,	1
yea,	1
and	1
winter	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
bring	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
journey	1
whithersoever	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
16:7	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
see	1
you	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
way;	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
tarry	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
you,	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
permit.	1
	1
16:8	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
tarry	1
at	1
Ephesus	1
until	1
Pentecost.	1
	1
16:9	1
For	1
a	1
great	1
door	1
and	1
effectual	1
is	1
opened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
adversaries.	1
	1
16:10	1
Now	1
if	1
Timotheus	1
come,	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
without	1
fear:	1
for	1
he	1
worketh	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
do.	1
	1
16:11	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
therefore	1
despise	1
him:	1
but	1
conduct	1
him	1
forth	1
in	1
peace,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
16:12	1
As	1
touching	1
our	1
brother	1
Apollos,	1
I	1
greatly	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
brethren:	1
but	1
his	1
will	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
this	1
time;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
convenient	1
time.	1
	1
16:13	1
Watch	1
ye,	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
quit	1
you	1
like	1
men,	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
16:14	1
Let	1
all	1
your	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
charity.	1
	1
16:15	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
(ye	1
know	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Stephanas,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
Achaia,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
addicted	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
saints,)	1
16:16	1
That	1
ye	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
such,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
helpeth	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
laboureth.	1
	1
16:17	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Stephanas	1
and	1
Fortunatus	1
and	1
Achaicus:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lacking	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
they	1
have	1
supplied.	1
	1
16:18	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
refreshed	1
my	1
spirit	1
and	1
your's:	1
therefore	1
acknowledge	1
ye	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
such.	1
	1
16:19	1
The	1
churches	1
of	1
Asia	1
salute	1
you.	1
Aquila	1
and	1
Priscilla	1
salute	1
you	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
with	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
	1
16:20	1
All	1
the	1
brethren	1
greet	1
you.	1
Greet	1
ye	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
16:21	1
The	1
salutation	1
of	1
me	1
Paul	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
16:22	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
not	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
Anathema	1
Maranatha.	1
	1
16:23	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
16:24	1
My	1
love	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Timothy	1
our	1
brother,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
Achaia:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
mercies,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
comfort;	1
1:4	1
Who	1
comforteth	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
tribulation,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
any	1
trouble,	1
by	1
the	1
comfort	1
wherewith	1
we	1
ourselves	1
are	1
comforted	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ	1
abound	1
in	1
us,	1
so	1
our	1
consolation	1
also	1
aboundeth	1
by	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
afflicted,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
consolation	1
and	1
salvation,	1
which	1
is	1
effectual	1
in	1
the	1
enduring	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sufferings	1
which	1
we	1
also	1
suffer:	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
comforted,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
consolation	1
and	1
salvation.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
our	1
hope	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
stedfast,	1
knowing,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
consolation.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
we	1
would	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant	1
of	1
our	1
trouble	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
Asia,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
pressed	1
out	1
of	1
measure,	1
above	1
strength,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
despaired	1
even	1
of	1
life:	1
1:9	1
But	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
trust	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
in	1
God	1
which	1
raiseth	1
the	1
dead:	1
1:10	1
Who	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
death,	1
and	1
doth	1
deliver:	1
in	1
whom	1
we	1
trust	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
yet	1
deliver	1
us;	1
1:11	1
Ye	1
also	1
helping	1
together	1
by	1
prayer	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
gift	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
many	1
persons	1
thanks	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
many	1
on	1
our	1
behalf.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
our	1
rejoicing	1
is	1
this,	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
our	1
conscience,	1
that	1
in	1
simplicity	1
and	1
godly	1
sincerity,	1
not	1
with	1
fleshly	1
wisdom,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
our	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
you-ward.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
we	1
write	1
none	1
other	1
things	1
unto	1
you,	1
than	1
what	1
ye	1
read	1
or	1
acknowledge;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
ye	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
end;	1
1:14	1
As	1
also	1
ye	1
have	1
acknowledged	1
us	1
in	1
part,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
your	1
rejoicing,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
our's	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
confidence	1
I	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
before,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
second	1
benefit;	1
1:16	1
And	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
you	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
toward	1
Judaea.	1
	1
1:17	1
When	1
I	1
therefore	1
was	1
thus	1
minded,	1
did	1
I	1
use	1
lightness?	1
or	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
purpose,	1
do	1
I	1
purpose	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
that	1
with	1
me	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
yea	1
yea,	1
and	1
nay	1
nay?	1
	1
1:18	1
But	1
as	1
God	1
is	1
true,	1
our	1
word	1
toward	1
you	1
was	1
not	1
yea	1
and	1
nay.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
was	1
preached	1
among	1
you	1
by	1
us,	1
even	1
by	1
me	1
and	1
Silvanus	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
was	1
not	1
yea	1
and	1
nay,	1
but	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
yea.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him	1
are	1
yea,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
Amen,	1
unto	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
us.	1
	1
1:21	1
Now	1
he	1
which	1
stablisheth	1
us	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
hath	1
anointed	1
us,	1
is	1
God;	1
1:22	1
Who	1
hath	1
also	1
sealed	1
us,	1
and	1
given	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
in	1
our	1
hearts.	1
	1
1:23	1
Moreover	1
I	1
call	1
God	1
for	1
a	1
record	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
that	1
to	1
spare	1
you	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
unto	1
Corinth.	1
	1
1:24	1
Not	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
your	1
faith,	1
but	1
are	1
helpers	1
of	1
your	1
joy:	1
for	1
by	1
faith	1
ye	1
stand.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
I	1
determined	1
this	1
with	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
heaviness.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
you	1
sorry,	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
that	1
maketh	1
me	1
glad,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
is	1
made	1
sorry	1
by	1
me?	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
wrote	1
this	1
same	1
unto	1
you,	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
came,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sorrow	1
from	1
them	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
rejoice;	1
having	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
is	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
much	1
affliction	1
and	1
anguish	1
of	1
heart	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
many	1
tears;	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
grieved,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
abundantly	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
have	1
caused	1
grief,	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
grieved	1
me,	1
but	1
in	1
part:	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
overcharge	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:6	1
Sufficient	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
this	1
punishment,	1
which	1
was	1
inflicted	1
of	1
many.	1
	1
2:7	1
So	1
that	1
contrariwise	1
ye	1
ought	1
rather	1
to	1
forgive	1
him,	1
and	1
comfort	1
him,	1
lest	1
perhaps	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
with	1
overmuch	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:8	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
confirm	1
your	1
love	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
2:9	1
For	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
also	1
did	1
I	1
write,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
you,	1
whether	1
ye	1
be	1
obedient	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:10	1
To	1
whom	1
ye	1
forgive	1
any	1
thing,	1
I	1
forgive	1
also:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
forgave	1
any	1
thing,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
forgave	1
it,	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
forgave	1
I	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
Christ;	1
2:11	1
Lest	1
Satan	1
should	1
get	1
an	1
advantage	1
of	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
his	1
devices.	1
	1
2:12	1
Furthermore,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Troas	1
to	1
preach	1
Christ's	1
gospel,	1
and	1
a	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
2:13	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
rest	1
in	1
my	1
spirit,	1
because	1
I	1
found	1
not	1
Titus	1
my	1
brother:	1
but	1
taking	1
my	1
leave	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
went	1
from	1
thence	1
into	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
2:14	1
Now	1
thanks	1
be	1
unto	1
God,	1
which	1
always	1
causeth	1
us	1
to	1
triumph	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
maketh	1
manifest	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
his	1
knowledge	1
by	1
us	1
in	1
every	1
place.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
unto	1
God	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
of	1
Christ,	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
saved,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
perish:	1
2:16	1
To	1
the	1
one	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
death	1
unto	1
death;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
life	1
unto	1
life.	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
many,	1
which	1
corrupt	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
sincerity,	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
speak	1
we	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:1	1
Do	1
we	1
begin	1
again	1
to	1
commend	1
ourselves?	1
or	1
need	1
we,	1
as	1
some	1
others,	1
epistles	1
of	1
commendation	1
to	1
you,	1
or	1
letters	1
of	1
commendation	1
from	1
you?	1
	1
3:2	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
epistle	1
written	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
known	1
and	1
read	1
of	1
all	1
men:	1
3:3	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
manifestly	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
epistle	1
of	1
Christ	1
ministered	1
by	1
us,	1
written	1
not	1
with	1
ink,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
not	1
in	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
but	1
in	1
fleshy	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
such	1
trust	1
have	1
we	1
through	1
Christ	1
to	1
God-ward:	1
3:5	1
Not	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
sufficient	1
of	1
ourselves	1
to	1
think	1
any	1
thing	1
as	1
of	1
ourselves;	1
but	1
our	1
sufficiency	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
3:6	1
Who	1
also	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
able	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament;	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
spirit:	1
for	1
the	1
letter	1
killeth,	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
giveth	1
life.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
death,	1
written	1
and	1
engraven	1
in	1
stones,	1
was	1
glorious,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stedfastly	1
behold	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Moses	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
countenance;	1
which	1
glory	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
away:	1
3:8	1
How	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
be	1
rather	1
glorious?	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
condemnation	1
be	1
glory,	1
much	1
more	1
doth	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
righteousness	1
exceed	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
glorious	1
had	1
no	1
glory	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
excelleth.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
if	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
was	1
glorious,	1
much	1
more	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
is	1
glorious.	1
	1
3:12	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
such	1
hope,	1
we	1
use	1
great	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech:	1
3:13	1
And	1
not	1
as	1
Moses,	1
which	1
put	1
a	1
vail	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stedfastly	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
abolished:	1
3:14	1
But	1
their	1
minds	1
were	1
blinded:	1
for	1
until	1
this	1
day	1
remaineth	1
the	1
same	1
vail	1
untaken	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
testament;	1
which	1
vail	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:15	1
But	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
when	1
Moses	1
is	1
read,	1
the	1
vail	1
is	1
upon	1
their	1
heart.	1
	1
3:16	1
Nevertheless	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
vail	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
3:17	1
Now	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
that	1
Spirit:	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
liberty.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
we	1
all,	1
with	1
open	1
face	1
beholding	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
are	1
changed	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
image	1
from	1
glory	1
to	1
glory,	1
even	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
Therefore	1
seeing	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
ministry,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
mercy,	1
we	1
faint	1
not;	1
4:2	1
But	1
have	1
renounced	1
the	1
hidden	1
things	1
of	1
dishonesty,	1
not	1
walking	1
in	1
craftiness,	1
nor	1
handling	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
deceitfully;	1
but	1
by	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
commending	1
ourselves	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
conscience	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
if	1
our	1
gospel	1
be	1
hid,	1
it	1
is	1
hid	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
lost:	1
4:4	1
In	1
whom	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
hath	1
blinded	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
believe	1
not,	1
lest	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
glorious	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God,	1
should	1
shine	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:5	1
For	1
we	1
preach	1
not	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
ourselves	1
your	1
servants	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
God,	1
who	1
commanded	1
the	1
light	1
to	1
shine	1
out	1
of	1
darkness,	1
hath	1
shined	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
treasure	1
in	1
earthen	1
vessels,	1
that	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
4:8	1
We	1
are	1
troubled	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
yet	1
not	1
distressed;	1
we	1
are	1
perplexed,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
despair;	1
4:9	1
Persecuted,	1
but	1
not	1
forsaken;	1
cast	1
down,	1
but	1
not	1
destroyed;	1
4:10	1
Always	1
bearing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
the	1
dying	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
also	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
our	1
body.	1
	1
4:11	1
For	1
we	1
which	1
live	1
are	1
alway	1
delivered	1
unto	1
death	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake,	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
also	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
our	1
mortal	1
flesh.	1
	1
4:12	1
So	1
then	1
death	1
worketh	1
in	1
us,	1
but	1
life	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
4:13	1
We	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
spirit	1
of	1
faith,	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
believed,	1
and	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
spoken;	1
we	1
also	1
believe,	1
and	1
therefore	1
speak;	1
4:14	1
Knowing	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
raise	1
up	1
us	1
also	1
by	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
shall	1
present	1
us	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
that	1
the	1
abundant	1
grace	1
might	1
through	1
the	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
many	1
redound	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
we	1
faint	1
not;	1
but	1
though	1
our	1
outward	1
man	1
perish,	1
yet	1
the	1
inward	1
man	1
is	1
renewed	1
day	1
by	1
day.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
our	1
light	1
affliction,	1
which	1
is	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
worketh	1
for	1
us	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
exceeding	1
and	1
eternal	1
weight	1
of	1
glory;	1
4:18	1
While	1
we	1
look	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen:	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen	1
are	1
temporal;	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen	1
are	1
eternal.	1
	1
5:1	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
our	1
earthly	1
house	1
of	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
were	1
dissolved,	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
building	1
of	1
God,	1
an	1
house	1
not	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
eternal	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
in	1
this	1
we	1
groan,	1
earnestly	1
desiring	1
to	1
be	1
clothed	1
upon	1
with	1
our	1
house	1
which	1
is	1
from	1
heaven:	1
5:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
being	1
clothed	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
naked.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
we	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
do	1
groan,	1
being	1
burdened:	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
be	1
unclothed,	1
but	1
clothed	1
upon,	1
that	1
mortality	1
might	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
wrought	1
us	1
for	1
the	1
selfsame	1
thing	1
is	1
God,	1
who	1
also	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:6	1
Therefore	1
we	1
are	1
always	1
confident,	1
knowing	1
that,	1
whilst	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
we	1
are	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
Lord:	1
5:7	1
(For	1
we	1
walk	1
by	1
faith,	1
not	1
by	1
sight:)	1
5:8	1
We	1
are	1
confident,	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
willing	1
rather	1
to	1
be	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:9	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
labour,	1
that,	1
whether	1
present	1
or	1
absent,	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:10	1
For	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
of	1
Christ;	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
may	1
receive	1
the	1
things	1
done	1
in	1
his	1
body,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
	1
5:11	1
Knowing	1
therefore	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
we	1
persuade	1
men;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
God;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
also	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
your	1
consciences.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
we	1
commend	1
not	1
ourselves	1
again	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
give	1
you	1
occasion	1
to	1
glory	1
on	1
our	1
behalf,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
answer	1
them	1
which	1
glory	1
in	1
appearance,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
5:13	1
For	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
beside	1
ourselves,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
God:	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
sober,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
cause.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ	1
constraineth	1
us;	1
because	1
we	1
thus	1
judge,	1
that	1
if	1
one	1
died	1
for	1
all,	1
then	1
were	1
all	1
dead:	1
5:15	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
for	1
all,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
live	1
should	1
not	1
henceforth	1
live	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
but	1
unto	1
him	1
which	1
died	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
rose	1
again.	1
	1
5:16	1
Wherefore	1
henceforth	1
know	1
we	1
no	1
man	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
yea,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
Christ	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
yet	1
now	1
henceforth	1
know	1
we	1
him	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
5:17	1
Therefore	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
in	1
Christ,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
creature:	1
old	1
things	1
are	1
passed	1
away;	1
behold,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
become	1
new.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
reconciled	1
us	1
to	1
himself	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
reconciliation;	1
5:19	1
To	1
wit,	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
in	1
Christ,	1
reconciling	1
the	1
world	1
unto	1
himself,	1
not	1
imputing	1
their	1
trespasses	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
hath	1
committed	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
reconciliation.	1
	1
5:20	1
Now	1
then	1
we	1
are	1
ambassadors	1
for	1
Christ,	1
as	1
though	1
God	1
did	1
beseech	1
you	1
by	1
us:	1
we	1
pray	1
you	1
in	1
Christ's	1
stead,	1
be	1
ye	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
5:21	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sin	1
for	1
us,	1
who	1
knew	1
no	1
sin;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:1	1
We	1
then,	1
as	1
workers	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
beseech	1
you	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
6:2	1
(For	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
accepted,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation	1
have	1
I	1
succoured	1
thee:	1
behold,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
accepted	1
time;	1
behold,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation.)	1
	1
6:3	1
Giving	1
no	1
offence	1
in	1
any	1
thing,	1
that	1
the	1
ministry	1
be	1
not	1
blamed:	1
6:4	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
approving	1
ourselves	1
as	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
much	1
patience,	1
in	1
afflictions,	1
in	1
necessities,	1
in	1
distresses,	1
6:5	1
In	1
stripes,	1
in	1
imprisonments,	1
in	1
tumults,	1
in	1
labours,	1
in	1
watchings,	1
in	1
fastings;	1
6:6	1
By	1
pureness,	1
by	1
knowledge,	1
by	1
longsuffering,	1
by	1
kindness,	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
by	1
love	1
unfeigned,	1
6:7	1
By	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God,	1
by	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
righteousness	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
6:8	1
By	1
honour	1
and	1
dishonour,	1
by	1
evil	1
report	1
and	1
good	1
report:	1
as	1
deceivers,	1
and	1
yet	1
true;	1
6:9	1
As	1
unknown,	1
and	1
yet	1
well	1
known;	1
as	1
dying,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
we	1
live;	1
as	1
chastened,	1
and	1
not	1
killed;	1
6:10	1
As	1
sorrowful,	1
yet	1
alway	1
rejoicing;	1
as	1
poor,	1
yet	1
making	1
many	1
rich;	1
as	1
having	1
nothing,	1
and	1
yet	1
possessing	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
6:11	1
O	1
ye	1
Corinthians,	1
our	1
mouth	1
is	1
open	1
unto	1
you,	1
our	1
heart	1
is	1
enlarged.	1
	1
6:12	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
straitened	1
in	1
us,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
straitened	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
bowels.	1
	1
6:13	1
Now	1
for	1
a	1
recompence	1
in	1
the	1
same,	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
unto	1
my	1
children,)	1
be	1
ye	1
also	1
enlarged.	1
	1
6:14	1
Be	1
ye	1
not	1
unequally	1
yoked	1
together	1
with	1
unbelievers:	1
for	1
what	1
fellowship	1
hath	1
righteousness	1
with	1
unrighteousness?	1
and	1
what	1
communion	1
hath	1
light	1
with	1
darkness?	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
what	1
concord	1
hath	1
Christ	1
with	1
Belial?	1
or	1
what	1
part	1
hath	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
with	1
an	1
infidel?	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
what	1
agreement	1
hath	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
idols?	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
6:17	1
Wherefore	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
separate,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
touch	1
not	1
the	1
unclean	1
thing;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
receive	1
you.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
Father	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Almighty.	1
	1
7:1	1
Having	1
therefore	1
these	1
promises,	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
cleanse	1
ourselves	1
from	1
all	1
filthiness	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
spirit,	1
perfecting	1
holiness	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:2	1
Receive	1
us;	1
we	1
have	1
wronged	1
no	1
man,	1
we	1
have	1
corrupted	1
no	1
man,	1
we	1
have	1
defrauded	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
7:3	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
this	1
to	1
condemn	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
before,	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
live	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
7:4	1
Great	1
is	1
my	1
boldness	1
of	1
speech	1
toward	1
you,	1
great	1
is	1
my	1
glorying	1
of	1
you:	1
I	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
comfort,	1
I	1
am	1
exceeding	1
joyful	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
tribulation.	1
	1
7:5	1
For,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
our	1
flesh	1
had	1
no	1
rest,	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
troubled	1
on	1
every	1
side;	1
without	1
were	1
fightings,	1
within	1
were	1
fears.	1
	1
7:6	1
Nevertheless	1
God,	1
that	1
comforteth	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
cast	1
down,	1
comforted	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Titus;	1
7:7	1
And	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
coming	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
consolation	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
comforted	1
in	1
you,	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
your	1
earnest	1
desire,	1
your	1
mourning,	1
your	1
fervent	1
mind	1
toward	1
me;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
made	1
you	1
sorry	1
with	1
a	1
letter,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
repent,	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
repent:	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
epistle	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
sorry,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
7:9	1
Now	1
I	1
rejoice,	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
sorry,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrowed	1
to	1
repentance:	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
sorry	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
manner,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
receive	1
damage	1
by	1
us	1
in	1
nothing.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
godly	1
sorrow	1
worketh	1
repentance	1
to	1
salvation	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
repented	1
of:	1
but	1
the	1
sorrow	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
worketh	1
death.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
behold	1
this	1
selfsame	1
thing,	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrowed	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
sort,	1
what	1
carefulness	1
it	1
wrought	1
in	1
you,	1
yea,	1
what	1
clearing	1
of	1
yourselves,	1
yea,	1
what	1
indignation,	1
yea,	1
what	1
fear,	1
yea,	1
what	1
vehement	1
desire,	1
yea,	1
what	1
zeal,	1
yea,	1
what	1
revenge!	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
approved	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
clear	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore,	1
though	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
cause	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
wrong,	1
nor	1
for	1
his	1
cause	1
that	1
suffered	1
wrong,	1
but	1
that	1
our	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
appear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
7:13	1
Therefore	1
we	1
were	1
comforted	1
in	1
your	1
comfort:	1
yea,	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
the	1
more	1
joyed	1
we	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Titus,	1
because	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
refreshed	1
by	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
boasted	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
spake	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
truth,	1
even	1
so	1
our	1
boasting,	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
before	1
Titus,	1
is	1
found	1
a	1
truth.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
his	1
inward	1
affection	1
is	1
more	1
abundant	1
toward	1
you,	1
whilst	1
he	1
remembereth	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
you	1
all,	1
how	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling	1
ye	1
received	1
him.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
rejoice	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
8:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
do	1
you	1
to	1
wit	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
bestowed	1
on	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Macedonia;	1
8:2	1
How	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
trial	1
of	1
affliction	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
their	1
joy	1
and	1
their	1
deep	1
poverty	1
abounded	1
unto	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
their	1
liberality.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
to	1
their	1
power,	1
I	1
bear	1
record,	1
yea,	1
and	1
beyond	1
their	1
power	1
they	1
were	1
willing	1
of	1
themselves;	1
8:4	1
Praying	1
us	1
with	1
much	1
intreaty	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
receive	1
the	1
gift,	1
and	1
take	1
upon	1
us	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
this	1
they	1
did,	1
not	1
as	1
we	1
hoped,	1
but	1
first	1
gave	1
their	1
own	1
selves	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:6	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
desired	1
Titus,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
begun,	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
also	1
finish	1
in	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
grace	1
also.	1
	1
8:7	1
Therefore,	1
as	1
ye	1
abound	1
in	1
every	1
thing,	1
in	1
faith,	1
and	1
utterance,	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
diligence,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
love	1
to	1
us,	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
abound	1
in	1
this	1
grace	1
also.	1
	1
8:8	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
by	1
commandment,	1
but	1
by	1
occasion	1
of	1
the	1
forwardness	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
your	1
love.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
rich,	1
yet	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
he	1
became	1
poor,	1
that	1
ye	1
through	1
his	1
poverty	1
might	1
be	1
rich.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
herein	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
advice:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
begun	1
before,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
forward	1
a	1
year	1
ago.	1
	1
8:11	1
Now	1
therefore	1
perform	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
it;	1
that	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
will,	1
so	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
performance	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
first	1
a	1
willing	1
mind,	1
it	1
is	1
accepted	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
hath,	1
and	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
not.	1
	1
8:13	1
For	1
I	1
mean	1
not	1
that	1
other	1
men	1
be	1
eased,	1
and	1
ye	1
burdened:	1
8:14	1
But	1
by	1
an	1
equality,	1
that	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
your	1
abundance	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
supply	1
for	1
their	1
want,	1
that	1
their	1
abundance	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
supply	1
for	1
your	1
want:	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
equality:	1
8:15	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
that	1
had	1
gathered	1
much	1
had	1
nothing	1
over;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
gathered	1
little	1
had	1
no	1
lack.	1
	1
8:16	1
But	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
which	1
put	1
the	1
same	1
earnest	1
care	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Titus	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
indeed	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
exhortation;	1
but	1
being	1
more	1
forward,	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
sent	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
brother,	1
whose	1
praise	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
churches;	1
8:19	1
And	1
not	1
that	1
only,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
chosen	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
to	1
travel	1
with	1
us	1
with	1
this	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
Lord,	1
and	1
declaration	1
of	1
your	1
ready	1
mind:	1
8:20	1
Avoiding	1
this,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
blame	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
abundance	1
which	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
us:	1
8:21	1
Providing	1
for	1
honest	1
things,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
sent	1
with	1
them	1
our	1
brother,	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
oftentimes	1
proved	1
diligent	1
in	1
many	1
things,	1
but	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
diligent,	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
confidence	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:23	1
Whether	1
any	1
do	1
enquire	1
of	1
Titus,	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
partner	1
and	1
fellowhelper	1
concerning	1
you:	1
or	1
our	1
brethren	1
be	1
enquired	1
of,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
the	1
churches,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:24	1
Wherefore	1
shew	1
ye	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
churches,	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
your	1
love,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
boasting	1
on	1
your	1
behalf.	1
	1
9:1	1
For	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
it	1
is	1
superfluous	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you:	1
9:2	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
forwardness	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
boast	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
that	1
Achaia	1
was	1
ready	1
a	1
year	1
ago;	1
and	1
your	1
zeal	1
hath	1
provoked	1
very	1
many.	1
	1
9:3	1
Yet	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
the	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
our	1
boasting	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
vain	1
in	1
this	1
behalf;	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
ready:	1
9:4	1
Lest	1
haply	1
if	1
they	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
find	1
you	1
unprepared,	1
we	1
(that	1
we	1
say	1
not,	1
ye)	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
confident	1
boasting.	1
	1
9:5	1
Therefore	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
exhort	1
the	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
before	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
up	1
beforehand	1
your	1
bounty,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
had	1
notice	1
before,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
might	1
be	1
ready,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
bounty,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
of	1
covetousness.	1
	1
9:6	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
He	1
which	1
soweth	1
sparingly	1
shall	1
reap	1
also	1
sparingly;	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
soweth	1
bountifully	1
shall	1
reap	1
also	1
bountifully.	1
	1
9:7	1
Every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
purposeth	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
give;	1
not	1
grudgingly,	1
or	1
of	1
necessity:	1
for	1
God	1
loveth	1
a	1
cheerful	1
giver.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
grace	1
abound	1
toward	1
you;	1
that	1
ye,	1
always	1
having	1
all	1
sufficiency	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
may	1
abound	1
to	1
every	1
good	1
work:	1
9:9	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
hath	1
dispersed	1
abroad;	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor:	1
his	1
righteousness	1
remaineth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
9:10	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
ministereth	1
seed	1
to	1
the	1

bread	1
for	1
your	1
food,	1
and	1
multiply	1
your	1
seed	1
sown,	1
and	1
increase	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
your	1
righteousness;)	1
9:11	1
Being	1
enriched	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
all	1
bountifulness,	1
which	1
causeth	1
through	1
us	1
thanksgiving	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
9:12	1
For	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
this	1
service	1
not	1
only	1
supplieth	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
but	1
is	1
abundant	1
also	1
by	1
many	1
thanksgivings	1
unto	1
God;	1
9:13	1
Whiles	1
by	1
the	1
experiment	1
of	1
this	1
ministration	1
they	1
glorify	1
God	1
for	1
your	1
professed	1
subjection	1
unto	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
liberal	1
distribution	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
men;	1
9:14	1
And	1
by	1
their	1
prayer	1
for	1
you,	1
which	1
long	1
after	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
exceeding	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
9:15	1
Thanks	1
be	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
unspeakable	1
gift.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
I	1
Paul	1
myself	1
beseech	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
meekness	1
and	1
gentleness	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
in	1
presence	1
am	1
base	1
among	1
you,	1
but	1
being	1
absent	1
am	1
bold	1
toward	1
you:	1
10:2	1
But	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
bold	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
present	1
with	1
that	1
confidence,	1
wherewith	1
I	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
bold	1
against	1
some,	1
which	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
walked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
though	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
war	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
10:4	1
(For	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
our	1
warfare	1
are	1
not	1
carnal,	1
but	1
mighty	1
through	1
God	1
to	1
the	1
pulling	1
down	1
of	1
strong	1
holds;)	1
10:5	1
Casting	1
down	1
imaginations,	1
and	1
every	1
high	1
thing	1
that	1
exalteth	1
itself	1
against	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
bringing	1
into	1
captivity	1
every	1
thought	1
to	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
Christ;	1
10:6	1
And	1
having	1
in	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
revenge	1
all	1
disobedience,	1
when	1
your	1
obedience	1
is	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
10:7	1
Do	1
ye	1
look	1
on	1
things	1
after	1
the	1
outward	1
appearance?	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
trust	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Christ's,	1
let	1
him	1
of	1
himself	1
think	1
this	1
again,	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
Christ's,	1
even	1
so	1
are	1
we	1
Christ's.	1
	1
10:8	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
boast	1
somewhat	1
more	1
of	1
our	1
authority,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
for	1
edification,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
destruction,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
10:9	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
terrify	1
you	1
by	1
letters.	1
	1
10:10	1
For	1
his	1
letters,	1
say	1
they,	1
are	1
weighty	1
and	1
powerful;	1
but	1
his	1
bodily	1
presence	1
is	1
weak,	1
and	1
his	1
speech	1
contemptible.	1
	1
10:11	1
Let	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
think	1
this,	1
that,	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
word	1
by	1
letters	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
absent,	1
such	1
will	1
we	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
deed	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
present.	1
	1
10:12	1
For	1
we	1
dare	1
not	1
make	1
ourselves	1
of	1
the	1
number,	1
or	1
compare	1
ourselves	1
with	1
some	1
that	1
commend	1
themselves:	1
but	1
they	1
measuring	1
themselves	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
comparing	1
themselves	1
among	1
themselves,	1
are	1
not	1
wise.	1
	1
10:13	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
boast	1
of	1
things	1
without	1
our	1
measure,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
rule	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
distributed	1
to	1
us,	1
a	1
measure	1
to	1
reach	1
even	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:14	1
For	1
we	1
stretch	1
not	1
ourselves	1
beyond	1
our	1
measure,	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
reached	1
not	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
come	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
you	1
also	1
in	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
10:15	1
Not	1
boasting	1
of	1
things	1
without	1
our	1
measure,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
labours;	1
but	1
having	1
hope,	1
when	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
increased,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
enlarged	1
by	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
rule	1
abundantly,	1
10:16	1
To	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
in	1
the	1
regions	1
beyond	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
boast	1
in	1
another	1
man's	1
line	1
of	1
things	1
made	1
ready	1
to	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
10:17	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
glorieth,	1
let	1
him	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
10:18	1
For	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
commendeth	1
himself	1
is	1
approved,	1
but	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
commendeth.	1
	1
11:1	1
Would	1
to	1
God	1
ye	1
could	1
bear	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
my	1
folly:	1
and	1
indeed	1
bear	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
11:2	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
jealous	1
over	1
you	1
with	1
godly	1
jealousy:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
espoused	1
you	1
to	1
one	1
husband,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
present	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
chaste	1
virgin	1
to	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:3	1
But	1
I	1
fear,	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means,	1
as	1
the	1
serpent	1
beguiled	1
Eve	1
through	1
his	1
subtilty,	1
so	1
your	1
minds	1
should	1
be	1
corrupted	1
from	1
the	1
simplicity	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:4	1
For	1
if	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
preacheth	1
another	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
preached,	1
or	1
if	1
ye	1
receive	1
another	1
spirit,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received,	1
or	1
another	1
gospel,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
accepted,	1
ye	1
might	1
well	1
bear	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:5	1
For	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
behind	1
the	1
very	1
chiefest	1
apostles.	1
	1
11:6	1
But	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
rude	1
in	1
speech,	1
yet	1
not	1
in	1
knowledge;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
throughly	1
made	1
manifest	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
11:7	1
Have	1
I	1
committed	1
an	1
offence	1
in	1
abasing	1
myself	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
exalted,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
freely?	1
11:8	1
I	1
robbed	1
other	1
churches,	1
taking	1
wages	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
service.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
present	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
wanted,	1
I	1
was	1
chargeable	1
to	1
no	1
man:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lacking	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Macedonia	1
supplied:	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
myself	1
from	1
being	1
burdensome	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
keep	1
myself.	1
	1
11:10	1
As	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
stop	1
me	1
of	1
this	1
boasting	1
in	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Achaia.	1
	1
11:11	1
Wherefore?	1
because	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
not?	1
God	1
knoweth.	1
	1
11:12	1
But	1
what	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cut	1
off	1
occasion	1
from	1
them	1
which	1
desire	1
occasion;	1
that	1
wherein	1
they	1
glory,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
as	1
we.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
such	1
are	1
false	1
apostles,	1
deceitful	1
workers,	1
transforming	1
themselves	1
into	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
no	1
marvel;	1
for	1
Satan	1
himself	1
is	1
transformed	1
into	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
11:15	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
thing	1
if	1
his	1
ministers	1
also	1
be	1
transformed	1
as	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
righteousness;	1
whose	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
11:16	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
fool;	1
if	1
otherwise,	1
yet	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
receive	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
boast	1
myself	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
11:17	1
That	1
which	1
I	1
speak,	1
I	1
speak	1
it	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
foolishly,	1
in	1
this	1
confidence	1
of	1
boasting.	1
	1
11:18	1
Seeing	1
that	1
many	1
glory	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
I	1
will	1
glory	1
also.	1
	1
11:19	1
For	1
ye	1
suffer	1
fools	1
gladly,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
wise.	1
	1
11:20	1
For	1
ye	1
suffer,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
bondage,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
devour	1
you,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
of	1
you,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
exalt	1
himself,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
smite	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
11:21	1
I	1
speak	1
as	1
concerning	1
reproach,	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
weak.	1
Howbeit	1
whereinsoever	1
any	1
is	1
bold,	1
(I	1
speak	1
foolishly,)	1
I	1
am	1
bold	1
also.	1
	1
11:22	1
Are	1
they	1
Hebrews?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
Are	1
they	1
Israelites?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
Are	1
they	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
11:23	1
Are	1
they	1
ministers	1
of	1
Christ?	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
a	1
fool)	1
I	1
am	1
more;	1
in	1
labours	1
more	1
abundant,	1
in	1
stripes	1
above	1
measure,	1
in	1
prisons	1
more	1
frequent,	1
in	1
deaths	1
oft.	1
	1
11:24	1
Of	1
the	1
Jews	1
five	1
times	1
received	1
I	1
forty	1
stripes	1
save	1
one.	1
	1
11:25	1
Thrice	1
was	1
I	1
beaten	1
with	1
rods,	1
once	1
was	1
I	1
stoned,	1
thrice	1
I	1
suffered	1
shipwreck,	1
a	1
night	1
and	1
a	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
deep;	1
11:26	1
In	1
journeyings	1
often,	1
in	1
perils	1
of	1
waters,	1
in	1
perils	1
of	1
robbers,	1
in	1
perils	1
by	1
mine	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
in	1
perils	1
by	1
the	1
heathen,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
in	1
perils	1
among	1
false	1
brethren;	1
11:27	1
In	1
weariness	1
and	1
painfulness,	1
in	1
watchings	1
often,	1
in	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst,	1
in	1
fastings	1
often,	1
in	1
cold	1
and	1
nakedness.	1
	1
11:28	1
Beside	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
upon	1
me	1
daily,	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
11:29	1
Who	1
is	1
weak,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
weak?	1
who	1
is	1
offended,	1
and	1
I	1
burn	1
not?	1
11:30	1
If	1
I	1
must	1
needs	1
glory,	1
I	1
will	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
concern	1
mine	1
infirmities.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
is	1
blessed	1
for	1
evermore,	1
knoweth	1
that	1
I	1
lie	1
not.	1
	1
11:32	1
In	1
Damascus	1
the	1
governor	1
under	1
Aretas	1
the	1
king	1
kept	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Damascenes	1
with	1
a	1
garrison,	1
desirous	1
to	1
apprehend	1
me:	1
11:33	1
And	1
through	1
a	1
window	1
in	1
a	1
basket	1
was	1
I	1
let	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
escaped	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
12:1	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
expedient	1
for	1
me	1
doubtless	1
to	1
glory.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
visions	1
and	1
revelations	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:2	1
I	1
knew	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Christ	1
above	1
fourteen	1
years	1
ago,	1
(whether	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell;	1
or	1
whether	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell:	1
God	1
knoweth;)	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
caught	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
(whether	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell:	1
God	1
knoweth;)	1
12:4	1
How	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
into	1
paradise,	1
and	1
heard	1
unspeakable	1
words,	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
utter.	1
	1
12:5	1
Of	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
will	1
I	1
glory:	1
yet	1
of	1
myself	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
glory,	1
but	1
in	1
mine	1
infirmities.	1
	1
12:6	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
desire	1
to	1
glory,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
fool;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
the	1
truth:	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
forbear,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seeth	1
me	1
to	1
be,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
heareth	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
measure	1
through	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
revelations,	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
thorn	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
Satan	1
to	1
buffet	1
me,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
measure.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
this	1
thing	1
I	1
besought	1
the	1
Lord	1
thrice,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
depart	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
grace	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
thee:	1
for	1
my	1
strength	1
is	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
weakness.	1
Most	1
gladly	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
rather	1
glory	1
in	1
my	1
infirmities,	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Christ	1
may	1
rest	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
12:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
take	1
pleasure	1
in	1
infirmities,	1
in	1
reproaches,	1
in	1
necessities,	1
in	1
persecutions,	1
in	1
distresses	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake:	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
weak,	1
then	1
am	1
I	1
strong.	1
	1
12:11	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
glorying;	1
ye	1
have	1
compelled	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
commended	1
of	1
you:	1
for	1
in	1
nothing	1
am	1
I	1
behind	1
the	1
very	1
chiefest	1
apostles,	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
nothing.	1
	1
12:12	1
Truly	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
an	1
apostle	1
were	1
wrought	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
patience,	1
in	1
signs,	1
and	1
wonders,	1
and	1
mighty	1
deeds.	1
	1
12:13	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
wherein	1
ye	1
were	1
inferior	1
to	1
other	1
churches,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
myself	1
was	1
not	1
burdensome	1
to	1
you?	1
forgive	1
me	1
this	1
wrong.	1
	1
12:14	1
Behold,	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
burdensome	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
your's	1
but	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
parents,	1
but	1
the	1
parents	1
for	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
very	1
gladly	1
spend	1
and	1
be	1
spent	1
for	1
you;	1
though	1
the	1
more	1
abundantly	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
the	1
less	1
I	1
be	1
loved.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
be	1
it	1
so,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
burden	1
you:	1
nevertheless,	1
being	1
crafty,	1
I	1
caught	1
you	1
with	1
guile.	1
	1
12:17	1
Did	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
gain	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
whom	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you?	1
12:18	1
I	1
desired	1
Titus,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
sent	1
a	1
brother.	1
Did	1
Titus	1
make	1
a	1
gain	1
of	1
you?	1
walked	1
we	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
spirit?	1
walked	1
we	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
steps?	1
	1
12:19	1
Again,	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
we	1
excuse	1
ourselves	1
unto	1
you?	1
we	1
speak	1
before	1
God	1
in	1
Christ:	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
all	1
things,	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
for	1
your	1
edifying.	1
	1
12:20	1
For	1
I	1
fear,	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
come,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
unto	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
ye	1
would	1
not:	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
debates,	1
envyings,	1
wraths,	1
strifes,	1
backbitings,	1
whisperings,	1
swellings,	1
tumults:	1
12:21	1
And	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
my	1
God	1
will	1
humble	1
me	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
bewail	1
many	1
which	1
have	1
sinned	1
already,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
fornication	1
and	1
lasciviousness	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed.	1
	1
13:1	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
coming	1
to	1
you.	1
In	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses	1
shall	1
every	1
word	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
13:2	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
before,	1
and	1
foretell	1
you,	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
present,	1
the	1
second	1
time;	1
and	1
being	1
absent	1
now	1
I	1
write	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
heretofore	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
other,	1
that,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
spare:	1
13:3	1
Since	1
ye	1
seek	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
Christ	1
speaking	1
in	1
me,	1
which	1
to	1
you-ward	1
is	1
not	1
weak,	1
but	1
is	1
mighty	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
13:4	1
For	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
crucified	1
through	1
weakness,	1
yet	1
he	1
liveth	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
For	1
we	1
also	1
are	1
weak	1
in	1
him,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
toward	1
you.	1
	1
13:5	1
Examine	1
yourselves,	1
whether	1
ye	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
faith;	1
prove	1
your	1
own	1
selves.	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
your	1
own	1
selves,	1
how	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
except	1
ye	1
be	1
reprobates?	1
	1
13:6	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
reprobates.	1
	1
13:7	1
Now	1
I	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
no	1
evil;	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
appear	1
approved,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
honest,	1
though	1
we	1
be	1
as	1
reprobates.	1
	1
13:8	1
For	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
glad,	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
weak,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
strong:	1
and	1
this	1
also	1
we	1
wish,	1
even	1
your	1
perfection.	1
	1
13:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
write	1
these	1
things	1
being	1
absent,	1
lest	1
being	1
present	1
I	1
should	1
use	1
sharpness,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
edification,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
destruction.	1
	1
13:11	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
farewell.	1
Be	1
perfect,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
be	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
live	1
in	1
peace;	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
13:12	1
Greet	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
13:13	1
All	1
the	1
saints	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
13:14	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Galatians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle,	1
(not	1
of	1
men,	1
neither	1
by	1
man,	1
but	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead;)	1
1:2	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
unto	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Galatia:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
1:4	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
our	1
sins,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
this	1
present	1
evil	1
world,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father:	1
1:5	1
To	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:6	1
I	1
marvel	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
so	1
soon	1
removed	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
called	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
another	1
gospel:	1
1:7	1
Which	1
is	1
not	1
another;	1
but	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
that	1
trouble	1
you,	1
and	1
would	1
pervert	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
though	1
we,	1
or	1
an	1
angel	1
from	1
heaven,	1
preach	1
any	1
other	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
1:9	1
As	1
we	1
said	1
before,	1
so	1
say	1
I	1
now	1
again,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
preach	1
any	1
other	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
do	1
I	1
now	1
persuade	1
men,	1
or	1
God?	1
or	1
do	1
I	1
seek	1
to	1
please	1
men?	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
yet	1
pleased	1
men,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:11	1
But	1
I	1
certify	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
was	1
preached	1
of	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
after	1
man.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
I	1
neither	1
received	1
it	1
of	1
man,	1
neither	1
was	1
I	1
taught	1
it,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
conversation	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
religion,	1
how	1
that	1
beyond	1
measure	1
I	1
persecuted	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
wasted	1
it:	1
1:14	1
And	1
profited	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
religion	1
above	1
many	1
my	1
equals	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
nation,	1
being	1
more	1
exceedingly	1
zealous	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
my	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:15	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
pleased	1
God,	1
who	1
separated	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
and	1
called	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
grace,	1
1:16	1
To	1
reveal	1
his	1
Son	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
preach	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
heathen;	1
immediately	1
I	1
conferred	1
not	1
with	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood:	1
1:17	1
Neither	1
went	1
I	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
apostles	1
before	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
returned	1
again	1
unto	1
Damascus.	1
	1
1:18	1
Then	1
after	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
see	1
Peter,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
fifteen	1
days.	1
	1
1:19	1
But	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
saw	1
I	1
none,	1
save	1
James	1
the	1
Lord's	1
brother.	1
	1
1:20	1
Now	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
behold,	1
before	1
God,	1
I	1
lie	1
not.	1
	1
1:21	1
Afterwards	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia;	1
1:22	1
And	1
was	1
unknown	1
by	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Judaea	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Christ:	1
1:23	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
only,	1
That	1
he	1
which	1
persecuted	1
us	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
now	1
preacheth	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
once	1
he	1
destroyed.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
glorified	1
God	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
2:1	1
Then	1
fourteen	1
years	1
after	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
took	1
Titus	1
with	1
me	1
also.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
revelation,	1
and	1
communicated	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
but	1
privately	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
reputation,	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
should	1
run,	1
or	1
had	1
run,	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
2:3	1
But	1
neither	1
Titus,	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
me,	1
being	1
a	1
Greek,	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised:	1
2:4	1
And	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
false	1
brethren	1
unawares	1
brought	1
in,	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
privily	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
our	1
liberty	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
into	1
bondage:	1
2:5	1
To	1
whom	1
we	1
gave	1
place	1
by	1
subjection,	1
no,	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
hour;	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
might	1
continue	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
of	1
these	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat,	1
(whatsoever	1
they	1
were,	1
it	1
maketh	1
no	1
matter	1
to	1
me:	1
God	1
accepteth	1
no	1
man's	1
person:)	1
for	1
they	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat	1
in	1
conference	1
added	1
nothing	1
to	1
me:	1
2:7	1
But	1
contrariwise,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
was	1
committed	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
was	1
unto	1
Peter;	1
2:8	1
(For	1
he	1
that	1
wrought	1
effectually	1
in	1
Peter	1
to	1
the	1
apostleship	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision,	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
mighty	1
in	1
me	1
toward	1
the	1
Gentiles:)	1
2:9	1
And	1
when	1
James,	1
Cephas,	1
and	1
John,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
pillars,	1
perceived	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
they	1
gave	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
the	1
right	1
hands	1
of	1
fellowship;	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
they	1
unto	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
2:10	1
Only	1
they	1
would	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
remember	1
the	1
poor;	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
forward	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
2:11	1
But	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
I	1
withstood	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
face,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
blamed.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
before	1
that	1
certain	1
came	1
from	1
James,	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
with	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
and	1
separated	1
himself,	1
fearing	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
Jews	1
dissembled	1
likewise	1
with	1
him;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
Barnabas	1
also	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
with	1
their	1
dissimulation.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
walked	1
not	1
uprightly	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter	1
before	1
them	1
all,	1
If	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
Jew,	1
livest	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
do	1
the	1
Jews,	1
why	1
compellest	1
thou	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
live	1
as	1
do	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
2:15	1
We	1
who	1
are	1
Jews	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
not	1
sinners	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
2:16	1
Knowing	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
even	1
we	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
2:17	1
But	1
if,	1
while	1
we	1
seek	1
to	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
Christ,	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
are	1
found	1
sinners,	1
is	1
therefore	1
Christ	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
sin?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
destroyed,	1
I	1
make	1
myself	1
a	1
transgressor.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
I	1
through	1
the	1
law	1
am	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
live	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
2:20	1
I	1
am	1
crucified	1
with	1
Christ:	1
neverthless	1
I	1
live;	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
Christ	1
liveth	1
in	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
live	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
2:21	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
frustrate	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
if	1
righteousness	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
law,	1
then	1
Christ	1
is	1
dead	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:1	1
O	1
foolish	1
Galatians,	1
who	1
hath	1
bewitched	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth,	1
before	1
whose	1
eyes	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
been	1
evidently	1
set	1
forth,	1
crucified	1
among	1
you?	1
	1
3:2	1
This	1
only	1
would	1
I	1
learn	1
of	1
you,	1
Received	1
ye	1
the	1
Spirit	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
faith?	1
	1
3:3	1
Are	1
ye	1
so	1
foolish?	1
having	1
begun	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
are	1
ye	1
now	1
made	1
perfect	1
by	1
the	1
flesh?	1
	1
3:4	1
Have	1
ye	1
suffered	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
in	1
vain?	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
yet	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
therefore	1
that	1
ministereth	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
worketh	1
miracles	1
among	1
you,	1
doeth	1
he	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
faith?	1
	1
3:6	1
Even	1
as	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
accounted	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:7	1
Know	1
ye	1
therefore	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
faith,	1
the	1
same	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
the	1
scripture,	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
justify	1
the	1
heathen	1
through	1
faith,	1
preached	1
before	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
saying,	1
In	1
thee	1
shall	1
all	1
nations	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
3:9	1
So	1
then	1
they	1
which	1
be	1
of	1
faith	1
are	1
blessed	1
with	1
faithful	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
curse:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Cursed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
continueth	1
not	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
3:11	1
But	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
it	1
is	1
evident:	1
for,	1
The	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
faith:	1
but,	1
The	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
them	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:13	1
Christ	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
being	1
made	1
a	1
curse	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Cursed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hangeth	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
3:14	1
That	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
Abraham	1
might	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
through	1
faith.	1
	1
3:15	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
speak	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men;	1
Though	1
it	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
man's	1
covenant,	1
yet	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
confirmed,	1
no	1
man	1
disannulleth,	1
or	1
addeth	1
thereto.	1
	1
3:16	1
Now	1
to	1
Abraham	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
were	1
the	1
promises	1
made.	1
He	1
saith	1
not,	1
And	1
to	1
seeds,	1
as	1
of	1
many;	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
one,	1
And	1
to	1
thy	1
seed,	1
which	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
covenant,	1
that	1
was	1
confirmed	1
before	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ,	1
the	1
law,	1
which	1
was	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years	1
after,	1
cannot	1
disannul,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
make	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
3:18	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
inheritance	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
promise:	1
but	1
God	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Abraham	1
by	1
promise.	1
	1
3:19	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
serveth	1
the	1
law?	1
It	1
was	1
added	1
because	1
of	1
transgressions,	1
till	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
promise	1
was	1
made;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
ordained	1
by	1
angels	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
mediator.	1
	1
3:20	1
Now	1
a	1
mediator	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mediator	1
of	1
one,	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
one.	1
	1
3:21	1
Is	1
the	1
law	1
then	1
against	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
God?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
law	1
given	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
life,	1
verily	1
righteousness	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:22	1
But	1
the	1
scripture	1
hath	1
concluded	1
all	1
under	1
sin,	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
by	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
might	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
3:23	1
But	1
before	1
faith	1
came,	1
we	1
were	1
kept	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
shut	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
should	1
afterwards	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
3:24	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
our	1
schoolmaster	1
to	1
bring	1
us	1
unto	1
Christ,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
3:25	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
faith	1
is	1
come,	1
we	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
under	1
a	1
schoolmaster.	1
	1
3:26	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:27	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
have	1
been	1
baptized	1
into	1
Christ	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:28	1
There	1
is	1
neither	1
Jew	1
nor	1
Greek,	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
bond	1
nor	1
free,	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
male	1
nor	1
female:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:29	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
Christ's,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
Abraham's	1
seed,	1
and	1
heirs	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
I	1
say,	1
That	1
the	1
heir,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
child,	1
differeth	1
nothing	1
from	1
a	1
servant,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
lord	1
of	1
all;	1
4:2	1
But	1
is	1
under	1
tutors	1
and	1
governors	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
of	1
the	1
father.	1
	1
4:3	1
Even	1
so	1
we,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
children,	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
under	1
the	1
elements	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
4:4	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come,	1
God	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
Son,	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
made	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
4:5	1
To	1
redeem	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
sons.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
sons,	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
forth	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
into	1
your	1
hearts,	1
crying,	1
Abba,	1
Father.	1
	1
4:7	1
Wherefore	1
thou	1
art	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
servant,	1
but	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
son,	1
then	1
an	1
heir	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:8	1
Howbeit	1
then,	1
when	1
ye	1
knew	1
not	1
God,	1
ye	1
did	1
service	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
by	1
nature	1
are	1
no	1
gods.	1
	1
4:9	1
But	1
now,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
God,	1
or	1
rather	1
are	1
known	1
of	1
God,	1
how	1
turn	1
ye	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
weak	1
and	1
beggarly	1
elements,	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
desire	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
bondage?	1
	1
4:10	1
Ye	1
observe	1
days,	1
and	1
months,	1
and	1
times,	1
and	1
years.	1
	1
4:11	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
you,	1
lest	1
I	1
have	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
you	1
labour	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
4:12	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
be	1
as	1
I	1
am;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
ye	1
are:	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
injured	1
me	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
4:13	1
Ye	1
know	1
how	1
through	1
infirmity	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
my	1
temptation	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
ye	1
despised	1
not,	1
nor	1
rejected;	1
but	1
received	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:15	1
Where	1
is	1
then	1
the	1
blessedness	1
ye	1
spake	1
of?	1
for	1
I	1
bear	1
you	1
record,	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
possible,	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
plucked	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
4:16	1
Am	1
I	1
therefore	1
become	1
your	1
enemy,	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth?	1
4:17	1
They	1
zealously	1
affect	1
you,	1
but	1
not	1
well;	1
yea,	1
they	1
would	1
exclude	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
affect	1
them.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
zealously	1
affected	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
present	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:19	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
travail	1
in	1
birth	1
again	1
until	1
Christ	1
be	1
formed	1
in	1
you,	1
4:20	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
you	1
now,	1
and	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
voice;	1
for	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
doubt	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
4:21	1
Tell	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
that	1
Abraham	1
had	1
two	1
sons,	1
the	1
one	1
by	1
a	1
bondmaid,	1
the	1
other	1
by	1
a	1
freewoman.	1
	1
4:23	1
But	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flesh;	1
but	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
freewoman	1
was	1
by	1
promise.	1
	1
4:24	1
Which	1
things	1
are	1
an	1
allegory:	1
for	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
covenants;	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
which	1
gendereth	1
to	1
bondage,	1
which	1
is	1
Agar.	1
	1
4:25	1
For	1
this	1
Agar	1
is	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
in	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
answereth	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
now	1
is,	1
and	1
is	1
in	1
bondage	1
with	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
4:26	1
But	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
is	1
above	1
is	1
free,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
us	1
all.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Rejoice,	1
thou	1
barren	1
that	1
bearest	1
not;	1
break	1
forth	1
and	1
cry,	1
thou	1
that	1
travailest	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
desolate	1
hath	1
many	1
more	1
children	1
than	1
she	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband.	1
	1
4:28	1
Now	1
we,	1
brethren,	1
as	1
Isaac	1
was,	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
promise.	1
	1
4:29	1
But	1
as	1
then	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
persecuted	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
now.	1
	1
4:30	1
Nevertheless	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture?	1
Cast	1
out	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
and	1
her	1
son:	1
for	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
heir	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
freewoman.	1
	1
4:31	1
So	1
then,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
free.	1
	1
5:1	1
Stand	1
fast	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
liberty	1
wherewith	1
Christ	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
free,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
entangled	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
5:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
Paul	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
Christ	1
shall	1
profit	1
you	1
nothing.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
I	1
testify	1
again	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
debtor	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
whole	1
law.	1
	1
5:4	1
Christ	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
no	1
effect	1
unto	1
you,	1
whosoever	1
of	1
you	1
are	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
ye	1
are	1
fallen	1
from	1
grace.	1
	1
5:5	1
For	1
we	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
righteousness	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
neither	1
circumcision	1
availeth	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
uncircumcision;	1
but	1
faith	1
which	1
worketh	1
by	1
love.	1
	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
did	1
run	1
well;	1
who	1
did	1
hinder	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth?	1
	1
5:8	1
This	1
persuasion	1
cometh	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
calleth	1
you.	1
	1
5:9	1
A	1
little	1
leaven	1
leaveneth	1
the	1
whole	1
lump.	1
	1
5:10	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
otherwise	1
minded:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
troubleth	1
you	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
judgment,	1
whosoever	1
he	1
be.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
if	1
I	1
yet	1
preach	1
circumcision,	1
why	1
do	1
I	1
yet	1
suffer	1
persecution?	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
ceased.	1
	1
5:12	1
I	1
would	1
they	1
were	1
even	1
cut	1
off	1
which	1
trouble	1
you.	1
	1
5:13	1
For,	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
unto	1
liberty;	1
only	1
use	1
not	1
liberty	1
for	1
an	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
by	1
love	1
serve	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
one	1
word,	1
even	1
in	1
this;	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
bite	1
and	1
devour	1
one	1
another,	1
take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
consumed	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
5:16	1
This	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Walk	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fulfil	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
the	1
flesh	1
lusteth	1
against	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
against	1
the	1
flesh:	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
contrary	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other:	1
so	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
would.	1
	1
5:18	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
led	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
5:19	1
Now	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
are	1
manifest,	1
which	1
are	1
these;	1
Adultery,	1
fornication,	1
uncleanness,	1
lasciviousness,	1
5:20	1
Idolatry,	1
witchcraft,	1
hatred,	1
variance,	1
emulations,	1
wrath,	1
strife,	1
seditions,	1
heresies,	1
5:21	1
Envyings,	1
murders,	1
drunkenness,	1
revellings,	1
and	1
such	1
like:	1
of	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
before,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
told	1
you	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
do	1
such	1
things	1
shall	1
not	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
love,	1
joy,	1
peace,	1
longsuffering,	1
gentleness,	1
goodness,	1
faith,	1
5:23	1
Meekness,	1
temperance:	1
against	1
such	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
Christ's	1
have	1
crucified	1
the	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
affections	1
and	1
lusts.	1
	1
5:25	1
If	1
we	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
let	1
us	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:26	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
desirous	1
of	1
vain	1
glory,	1
provoking	1
one	1
another,	1
envying	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
6:1	1
Brethren,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
overtaken	1
in	1
a	1
fault,	1
ye	1
which	1
are	1
spiritual,	1
restore	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
meekness;	1
considering	1
thyself,	1
lest	1
thou	1
also	1
be	1
tempted.	1
	1
6:2	1
Bear	1
ye	1
one	1
another's	1
burdens,	1
and	1
so	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:3	1
For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
something,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
nothing,	1
he	1
deceiveth	1
himself.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
prove	1
his	1
own	1
work,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
have	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
himself	1
alone,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
another.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
own	1
burden.	1
	1
6:6	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
communicate	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
teacheth	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
things.	1
	1
6:7	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived;	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
mocked:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
a	1
man	1
soweth,	1
that	1
shall	1
he	1
also	1
reap.	1
	1
6:8	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
to	1
his	1
flesh	1
shall	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
reap	1
corruption;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
shall	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
reap	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
weary	1
in	1
well	1
doing:	1
for	1
in	1
due	1
season	1
we	1
shall	1
reap,	1
if	1
we	1
faint	1
not.	1
	1
6:10	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
therefore	1
opportunity,	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
good	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
especially	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
6:11	1
Ye	1
see	1
how	1
large	1
a	1
letter	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
6:12	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
shew	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
they	1
constrain	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised;	1
only	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
suffer	1
persecution	1
for	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
neither	1
they	1
themselves	1
who	1
are	1
circumcised	1
keep	1
the	1
law;	1
but	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
glory	1
in	1
your	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:14	1
But	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
glory,	1
save	1
in	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
crucified	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
unto	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:15	1
For	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
neither	1
circumcision	1
availeth	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
uncircumcision,	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
creature.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
walk	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
rule,	1
peace	1
be	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
mercy,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
Israel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:17	1
From	1
henceforth	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
trouble	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
bear	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:18	1
Brethren,	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
spirit.	1
	1
Amen.	1

1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1

of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
the	1

which	1
are	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
faithful	1
in	1

Grace	1

and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1

	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
hath	1
blessed	1
us	1
with	1
all	1
spiritual	1
blessings	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
in	1
Christ:	1
1:4	1
According	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
us	1
in	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
holy	1
and	1
without	1
blame	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
love:	1
1:5	1
Having	1
predestinated	1
us	1
unto	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
children	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
himself,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
1:6	1
To	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
beloved.	1
	1
1:7	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
redemption	1
through	1
his	1
blood,	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
grace;	1
1:8	1
Wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
abounded	1
toward	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
prudence;	1
1:9	1
Having	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
purposed	1
in	1
himself:	1
1:10	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
times	1
he	1
might	1
gather	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
Christ,	1
both	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
on	1
earth;	1
even	1
in	1
him:	1
1:11	1
In	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
have	1
obtained	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
being	1
predestinated	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
worketh	1
all	1
things	1
after	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
will:	1
1:12	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
who	1
first	1
trusted	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
In	1
whom	1
ye	1
also	1
trusted,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
your	1
salvation:	1
in	1
whom	1
also	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
believed,	1
ye	1
were	1
sealed	1
with	1
that	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
promise,	1
1:14	1
Which	1
is	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
until	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
purchased	1
possession,	1
unto	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
1:15	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
also,	1
after	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
love	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:16	1
Cease	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
for	1
you,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
prayers;	1
1:17	1
That	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
glory,	1
may	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
revelation	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him:	1
1:18	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
your	1
understanding	1
being	1
enlightened;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
calling,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:19	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
exceeding	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
us-ward	1
who	1
believe,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
power,	1
1:20	1
Which	1
he	1
wrought	1
in	1
Christ,	1
when	1
he	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
heavenly	1
places,	1
1:21	1
Far	1
above	1
all	1
principality,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
might,	1
and	1
dominion,	1
and	1
every	1
name	1
that	1
is	1
named,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come:	1
1:22	1
And	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
head	1
over	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
the	1
church,	1
1:23	1
Which	1
is	1
his	1
body,	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
filleth	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
you	1
hath	1
he	1
quickened,	1
who	1
were	1
dead	1
in	1
trespasses	1
and	1
sins;	1
2:2	1
Wherein	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
ye	1
walked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
now	1
worketh	1
in	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience:	1
2:3	1
Among	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
all	1
had	1
our	1
conversation	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
our	1
flesh,	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
mind;	1
and	1
were	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
wrath,	1
even	1
as	1
others.	1
	1
2:4	1
But	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
rich	1
in	1
mercy,	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
love	1
wherewith	1
he	1
loved	1
us,	1
2:5	1
Even	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
dead	1
in	1
sins,	1
hath	1
quickened	1
us	1
together	1
with	1
Christ,	1
(by	1
grace	1
ye	1
are	1
saved;)	1
2:6	1
And	1
hath	1
raised	1
us	1
up	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
us	1
sit	1
together	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
2:7	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
ages	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
might	1
shew	1
the	1
exceeding	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
grace	1
in	1
his	1
kindness	1
toward	1
us	1
through	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
by	1
grace	1
are	1
ye	1
saved	1
through	1
faith;	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
of	1
yourselves:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God:	1
2:9	1
Not	1
of	1
works,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
boast.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
workmanship,	1
created	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
good	1
works,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
before	1
ordained	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
2:11	1
Wherefore	1
remember,	1
that	1
ye	1
being	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
who	1
are	1
called	1
Uncircumcision	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Circumcision	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
made	1
by	1
hands;	1
2:12	1
That	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
ye	1
were	1
without	1
Christ,	1
being	1
aliens	1
from	1
the	1
commonwealth	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
strangers	1
from	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
promise,	1
having	1
no	1
hope,	1
and	1
without	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
world:	1
2:13	1
But	1
now	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
ye	1
who	1
sometimes	1
were	1
far	1
off	1
are	1
made	1
nigh	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
peace,	1
who	1
hath	1
made	1
both	1
one,	1
and	1
hath	1
broken	1
down	1
the	1
middle	1
wall	1
of	1
partition	1
between	1
us;	1
2:15	1
Having	1
abolished	1
in	1
his	1
flesh	1
the	1
enmity,	1
even	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
commandments	1
contained	1
in	1
ordinances;	1
for	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
himself	1
of	1
twain	1
one	1
new	1
man,	1
so	1
making	1
peace;	1
2:16	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
reconcile	1
both	1
unto	1
God	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
by	1
the	1
cross,	1
having	1
slain	1
the	1
enmity	1
thereby:	1
2:17	1
And	1
came	1
and	1
preached	1
peace	1
to	1
you	1
which	1
were	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
nigh.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
through	1
him	1
we	1
both	1
have	1
access	1
by	1
one	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:19	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
strangers	1
and	1
foreigners,	1
but	1
fellowcitizens	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
God;	1
2:20	1
And	1
are	1
built	1
upon	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself	1
being	1
the	1
chief	1
corner	1
stone;	1
2:21	1
In	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
building	1
fitly	1
framed	1
together	1
groweth	1
unto	1
an	1
holy	1
temple	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
2:22	1
In	1
whom	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
builded	1
together	1
for	1
an	1
habitation	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
3:1	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
Paul,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
you	1
Gentiles,	1
3:2	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
you-ward:	1
3:3	1
How	1
that	1
by	1
revelation	1
he	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
mystery;	1
(as	1
I	1
wrote	1
afore	1
in	1
few	1
words,	1
3:4	1
Whereby,	1
when	1
ye	1
read,	1
ye	1
may	1
understand	1
my	1
knowledge	1
in	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Christ)	1
3:5	1
Which	1
in	1
other	1
ages	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
revealed	1
unto	1
his	1
holy	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit;	1
3:6	1
That	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
should	1
be	1
fellowheirs,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
body,	1
and	1
partakers	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
in	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
gospel:	1
3:7	1
Whereof	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
minister,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
effectual	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
3:8	1
Unto	1
me,	1
who	1
am	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
saints,	1
is	1
this	1
grace	1
given,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
the	1
unsearchable	1
riches	1
of	1
Christ;	1
3:9	1
And	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
men	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
mystery,	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
been	1
hid	1
in	1
God,	1
who	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:10	1
To	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
now	1
unto	1
the	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
might	1
be	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
the	1
manifold	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God,	1
3:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
eternal	1
purpose	1
which	1
he	1
purposed	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord:	1
3:12	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
boldness	1
and	1
access	1
with	1
confidence	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:13	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
faint	1
not	1
at	1
my	1
tribulations	1
for	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
glory.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
bow	1
my	1
knees	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
3:15	1
Of	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
is	1
named,	1
3:16	1
That	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
you,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
to	1
be	1
strengthened	1
with	1
might	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
in	1
the	1
inner	1
man;	1
3:17	1
That	1
Christ	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
by	1
faith;	1
that	1
ye,	1
being	1
rooted	1
and	1
grounded	1
in	1
love,	1
3:18	1
May	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comprehend	1
with	1
all	1
saints	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
breadth,	1
and	1
length,	1
and	1
depth,	1
and	1
height;	1
3:19	1
And	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ,	1
which	1
passeth	1
knowledge,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:20	1
Now	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
exceeding	1
abundantly	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
ask	1
or	1
think,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
that	1
worketh	1
in	1
us,	1
3:21	1
Unto	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
throughout	1
all	1
ages,	1
world	1
without	1
end.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:1	1
I	1
therefore,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
beseech	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
vocation	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
are	1
called,	1
4:2	1
With	1
all	1
lowliness	1
and	1
meekness,	1
with	1
longsuffering,	1
forbearing	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
love;	1
4:3	1
Endeavouring	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
in	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
4:4	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
body,	1
and	1
one	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
hope	1
of	1
your	1
calling;	1
4:5	1
One	1
Lord,	1
one	1
faith,	1
one	1
baptism,	1
4:6	1
One	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
all,	1
who	1
is	1
above	1
all,	1
and	1
through	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
given	1
grace	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:8	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
When	1
he	1
ascended	1
up	1
on	1
high,	1
he	1
led	1
captivity	1
captive,	1
and	1
gave	1
gifts	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
4:9	1
(Now	1
that	1
he	1
ascended,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
also	1
descended	1
first	1
into	1
the	1
lower	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
4:10	1
He	1
that	1
descended	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
also	1
that	1
ascended	1
up	1
far	1
above	1
all	1
heavens,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
fill	1
all	1
things.)	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
some,	1
apostles;	1
and	1
some,	1
prophets;	1
and	1
some,	1
evangelists;	1
and	1
some,	1
pastors	1
and	1
teachers;	1
4:12	1
For	1
the	1
perfecting	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
ministry,	1
for	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ:	1
4:13	1
Till	1
we	1
all	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
unto	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
stature	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
Christ:	1
4:14	1
That	1
we	1
henceforth	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
children,	1
tossed	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
every	1
wind	1
of	1
doctrine,	1
by	1
the	1
sleight	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
cunning	1
craftiness,	1
whereby	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
to	1
deceive;	1
4:15	1
But	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
love,	1
may	1
grow	1
up	1
into	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
head,	1
even	1
Christ:	1
4:16	1
From	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
fitly	1
joined	1
together	1
and	1
compacted	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
every	1
joint	1
supplieth,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
effectual	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
every	1
part,	1
maketh	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
unto	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
itself	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
4:17	1
This	1
I	1
say	1
therefore,	1
and	1
testify	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
ye	1
henceforth	1
walk	1
not	1
as	1
other	1
Gentiles	1
walk,	1
in	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
their	1
mind,	1
4:18	1
Having	1
the	1
understanding	1
darkened,	1
being	1
alienated	1
from	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
ignorance	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
their	1
heart:	1
4:19	1
Who	1
being	1
past	1
feeling	1
have	1
given	1
themselves	1
over	1
unto	1
lasciviousness,	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
uncleanness	1
with	1
greediness.	1
	1
4:20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
learned	1
Christ;	1
4:21	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
by	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
in	1
Jesus:	1
4:22	1
That	1
ye	1
put	1
off	1
concerning	1
the	1
former	1
conversation	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
corrupt	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
deceitful	1
lusts;	1
4:23	1
And	1
be	1
renewed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
your	1
mind;	1
4:24	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
man,	1
which	1
after	1
God	1
is	1
created	1
in	1
righteousness	1
and	1
true	1
holiness.	1
	1
4:25	1
Wherefore	1
putting	1
away	1
lying,	1
speak	1
every	1
man	1
truth	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
members	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
4:26	1
Be	1
ye	1
angry,	1
and	1
sin	1
not:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
sun	1
go	1
down	1
upon	1
your	1
wrath:	1
4:27	1
Neither	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
4:28	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
stole	1
steal	1
no	1
more:	1
but	1
rather	1
let	1
him	1
labour,	1
working	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
needeth.	1
	1
4:29	1
Let	1
no	1
corrupt	1
communication	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
edifying,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
minister	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
hearers.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
grieve	1
not	1
the	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
whereby	1
ye	1
are	1
sealed	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
redemption.	1
	1
4:31	1
Let	1
all	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
wrath,	1
and	1
anger,	1
and	1
clamour,	1
and	1
evil	1
speaking,	1
be	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
with	1
all	1
malice:	1
4:32	1
And	1
be	1
ye	1
kind	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
tenderhearted,	1
forgiving	1
one	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
God	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake	1
hath	1
forgiven	1
you.	1
	1
5:1	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
followers	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
dear	1
children;	1
5:2	1
And	1
walk	1
in	1
love,	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
hath	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
himself	1
for	1
us	1
an	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
a	1
sweetsmelling	1
savour.	1
	1
5:3	1
But	1
fornication,	1
and	1
all	1
uncleanness,	1
or	1
covetousness,	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
once	1
named	1
among	1
you,	1
as	1
becometh	1
saints;	1
5:4	1
Neither	1
filthiness,	1
nor	1
foolish	1
talking,	1
nor	1
jesting,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
convenient:	1
but	1
rather	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks.	1
	1
5:5	1
For	1
this	1
ye	1
know,	1
that	1
no	1
whoremonger,	1
nor	1
unclean	1
person,	1
nor	1
covetous	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
idolater,	1
hath	1
any	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:6	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you	1
with	1
vain	1
words:	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
cometh	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience.	1
	1
5:7	1
Be	1
not	1
ye	1
therefore	1
partakers	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:8	1
For	1
ye	1
were	1
sometimes	1
darkness,	1
but	1
now	1
are	1
ye	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
walk	1
as	1
children	1
of	1
light:	1
5:9	1
(For	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
goodness	1
and	1
righteousness	1
and	1
truth;)	1
5:10	1
Proving	1
what	1
is	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
have	1
no	1
fellowship	1
with	1
the	1
unfruitful	1
works	1
of	1
darkness,	1
but	1
rather	1
reprove	1
them.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
even	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
done	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
secret.	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
reproved	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
light:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
doth	1
make	1
manifest	1
is	1
light.	1
	1
5:14	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
Awake	1
thou	1
that	1
sleepest,	1
and	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
Christ	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
light.	1
	1
5:15	1
See	1
then	1
that	1
ye	1
walk	1
circumspectly,	1
not	1
as	1
fools,	1
but	1
as	1
wise,	1
5:16	1
Redeeming	1
the	1
time,	1
because	1
the	1
days	1
are	1
evil.	1
	1
5:17	1
Wherefore	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
unwise,	1
but	1
understanding	1
what	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
drunk	1
with	1
wine,	1
wherein	1
is	1
excess;	1
but	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit;	1
5:19	1
Speaking	1
to	1
yourselves	1
in	1
psalms	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
spiritual	1
songs,	1
singing	1
and	1
making	1
melody	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;	1
5:20	1
Giving	1
thanks	1
always	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
5:21	1
Submitting	1
yourselves	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:22	1
Wives,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
your	1
own	1
husbands,	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:23	1
For	1
the	1
husband	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wife,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
church:	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
saviour	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
5:24	1
Therefore	1
as	1
the	1
church	1
is	1
subject	1
unto	1
Christ,	1
so	1
let	1
the	1
wives	1
be	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
husbands	1
in	1
every	1
thing.	1
	1
5:25	1
Husbands,	1
love	1
your	1
wives,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
loved	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
it;	1
5:26	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
sanctify	1
and	1
cleanse	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
water	1
by	1
the	1
word,	1
5:27	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
present	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
glorious	1
church,	1
not	1
having	1
spot,	1
or	1
wrinkle,	1
or	1
any	1
such	1
thing;	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
holy	1
and	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
5:28	1
So	1
ought	1
men	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
wives	1
as	1
their	1
own	1
bodies.	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
wife	1
loveth	1
himself.	1
	1
5:29	1
For	1
no	1
man	1
ever	1
yet	1
hated	1
his	1
own	1
flesh;	1
but	1
nourisheth	1
and	1
cherisheth	1
it,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
church:	1
5:30	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
members	1
of	1
his	1
body,	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
5:31	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:32	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
mystery:	1
but	1
I	1
speak	1
concerning	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
5:33	1
Nevertheless	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
particular	1
so	1
love	1
his	1
wife	1
even	1
as	1
himself;	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
reverence	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
6:1	1
Children,	1
obey	1
your	1
parents	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
right.	1
	1
6:2	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother;	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment	1
with	1
promise;	1
6:3	1
That	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
live	1
long	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:4	1
And,	1
ye	1
fathers,	1
provoke	1
not	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
wrath:	1
but	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
nurture	1
and	1
admonition	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:5	1
Servants,	1
be	1
obedient	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
your	1
masters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling,	1
in	1
singleness	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
as	1
unto	1
Christ;	1
6:6	1
Not	1
with	1
eyeservice,	1
as	1
menpleasers;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Christ,	1
doing	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
heart;	1
6:7	1
With	1
good	1
will	1
doing	1
service,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
men:	1
6:8	1
Knowing	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
good	1
thing	1
any	1
man	1
doeth,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
he	1
receive	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
bond	1
or	1
free.	1
	1
6:9	1
And,	1
ye	1
masters,	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
forbearing	1
threatening:	1
knowing	1
that	1
your	1
Master	1
also	1
is	1
in	1
heaven;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
6:10	1
Finally,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
be	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
might.	1
	1
6:11	1
Put	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
armour	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
6:12	1
For	1
we	1
wrestle	1
not	1
against	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
but	1
against	1
principalities,	1
against	1
powers,	1
against	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
against	1
spiritual	1
wickedness	1
in	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
6:13	1
Wherefore	1
take	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
armour	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
in	1
the	1
evil	1
day,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
all,	1
to	1
stand.	1
	1
6:14	1
Stand	1
therefore,	1
having	1
your	1
loins	1
girt	1
about	1
with	1
truth,	1
and	1
having	1
on	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
righteousness;	1
6:15	1
And	1
your	1
feet	1
shod	1
with	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
peace;	1
6:16	1
Above	1
all,	1
taking	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
faith,	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
quench	1
all	1
the	1
fiery	1
darts	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
take	1
the	1
helmet	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
6:18	1
Praying	1
always	1
with	1
all	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
watching	1
thereunto	1
with	1
all	1
perseverance	1
and	1
supplication	1
for	1
all	1
saints;	1
6:19	1
And	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
utterance	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
boldly,	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
6:20	1
For	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
ambassador	1
in	1
bonds:	1
that	1
therein	1
I	1
may	1
speak	1
boldly,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
6:21	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
know	1
my	1
affairs,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
do,	1
Tychicus,	1
a	1
beloved	1
brother	1
and	1
faithful	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
things:	1
6:22	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
our	1
affairs,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
comfort	1
your	1
hearts.	1
	1
6:23	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
love	1
with	1
faith,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:24	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
sincerity.	1
	1
Amen.	1

The	1

Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Philippians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Philippi,	1
with	1
the	1

Grace	1
be	1

and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1

	1
1:3	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
upon	1
every	1
remembrance	1
of	1
you,	1
1:4	1
Always	1
in	1
every	1
prayer	1
of	1
mine	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
making	1
request	1
with	1
joy,	1
1:5	1
For	1
your	1
fellowship	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
until	1
now;	1
1:6	1
Being	1
confident	1
of	1
this	1
very	1
thing,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
begun	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
in	1
you	1
will	1
perform	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:7	1
Even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
meet	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
this	1
of	1
you	1
all,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
heart;	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
both	1
in	1
my	1
bonds,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
and	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
my	1
grace.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
record,	1
how	1
greatly	1
I	1
long	1
after	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
pray,	1
that	1
your	1
love	1
may	1
abound	1
yet	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
in	1
knowledge	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
judgment;	1
1:10	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
approve	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
excellent;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
sincere	1
and	1
without	1
offence	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:11	1
Being	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
are	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
unto	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
ye	1
should	1
understand,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
happened	1
unto	1
me	1
have	1
fallen	1
out	1
rather	1
unto	1
the	1
furtherance	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:13	1
So	1
that	1
my	1
bonds	1
in	1
Christ	1
are	1
manifest	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
other	1
places;	1
1:14	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
waxing	1
confident	1
by	1
my	1
bonds,	1
are	1
much	1
more	1
bold	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
word	1
without	1
fear.	1
	1
1:15	1
Some	1
indeed	1
preach	1
Christ	1
even	1
of	1
envy	1
and	1
strife;	1
and	1
some	1
also	1
of	1
good	1
will:	1
1:16	1
The	1
one	1
preach	1
Christ	1
of	1
contention,	1
not	1
sincerely,	1
supposing	1
to	1
add	1
affliction	1
to	1
my	1
bonds:	1
1:17	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
love,	1
knowing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
1:18	1
What	1
then?	1
notwithstanding,	1
every	1
way,	1
whether	1
in	1
pretence,	1
or	1
in	1
truth,	1
Christ	1
is	1
preached;	1
and	1
I	1
therein	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
yea,	1
and	1
will	1
rejoice.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
my	1
salvation	1
through	1
your	1
prayer,	1
and	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
1:20	1
According	1
to	1
my	1
earnest	1
expectation	1
and	1
my	1
hope,	1
that	1
in	1
nothing	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
but	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
boldness,	1
as	1
always,	1
so	1
now	1
also	1
Christ	1
shall	1
be	1
magnified	1
in	1
my	1
body,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
life,	1
or	1
by	1
death.	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
live	1
is	1
Christ,	1
and	1
to	1
die	1
is	1
gain.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
labour:	1
yet	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
choose	1
I	1
wot	1
not.	1
	1
1:23	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
strait	1
betwixt	1
two,	1
having	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
depart,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Christ;	1
which	1
is	1
far	1
better:	1
1:24	1
Nevertheless	1
to	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
more	1
needful	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
having	1
this	1
confidence,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
abide	1
and	1
continue	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
furtherance	1
and	1
joy	1
of	1
faith;	1
1:26	1
That	1
your	1
rejoicing	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
abundant	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
1:27	1
Only	1
let	1
your	1
conversation	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
becometh	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
that	1
whether	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you,	1
or	1
else	1
be	1
absent,	1
I	1
may	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
affairs,	1
that	1
ye	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
one	1
spirit,	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
striving	1
together	1
for	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:28	1
And	1
in	1
nothing	1
terrified	1
by	1
your	1
adversaries:	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
evident	1
token	1
of	1
perdition,	1
but	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:29	1
For	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
behalf	1
of	1
Christ,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
believe	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
his	1
sake;	1
1:30	1
Having	1
the	1
same	1
conflict	1
which	1
ye	1
saw	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
now	1
hear	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
2:1	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
therefore	1
any	1
consolation	1
in	1
Christ,	1
if	1
any	1
comfort	1
of	1
love,	1
if	1
any	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
if	1
any	1
bowels	1
and	1
mercies,	1
2:2	1
Fulfil	1
ye	1
my	1
joy,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
likeminded,	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
love,	1
being	1
of	1
one	1
accord,	1
of	1
one	1
mind.	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
nothing	1
be	1
done	1
through	1
strife	1
or	1
vainglory;	1
but	1
in	1
lowliness	1
of	1
mind	1
let	1
each	1
esteem	1
other	1
better	1
than	1
themselves.	1
	1
2:4	1
Look	1
not	1
every	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
things,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
others.	1
	1
2:5	1
Let	1
this	1
mind	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
2:6	1
Who,	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
God,	1
thought	1
it	1
not	1
robbery	1
to	1
be	1
equal	1
with	1
God:	1
2:7	1
But	1
made	1
himself	1
of	1
no	1
reputation,	1
and	1
took	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
servant,	1
and	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
men:	1
2:8	1
And	1
being	1
found	1
in	1
fashion	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
humbled	1
himself,	1
and	1
became	1
obedient	1
unto	1
death,	1
even	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
2:9	1
Wherefore	1
God	1
also	1
hath	1
highly	1
exalted	1
him,	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
name	1
which	1
is	1
above	1
every	1
name:	1
2:10	1
That	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
every	1
knee	1
should	1
bow,	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
things	1
in	1
earth,	1
and	1
things	1
under	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:11	1
And	1
that	1
every	1
tongue	1
should	1
confess	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
Lord,	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:12	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
beloved,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
always	1
obeyed,	1
not	1
as	1
in	1
my	1
presence	1
only,	1
but	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
absence,	1
work	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
salvation	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
God	1
which	1
worketh	1
in	1
you	1
both	1
to	1
will	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure.	1
	1
2:14	1
Do	1
all	1
things	1
without	1
murmurings	1
and	1
disputings:	1
2:15	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blameless	1
and	1
harmless,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
without	1
rebuke,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
crooked	1
and	1
perverse	1
nation,	1
among	1
whom	1
ye	1
shine	1
as	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
2:16	1
Holding	1
forth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
life;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
run	1
in	1
vain,	1
neither	1
laboured	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
2:17	1
Yea,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
service	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
I	1
joy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
cause	1
also	1
do	1
ye	1
joy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
to	1
send	1
Timotheus	1
shortly	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
when	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
state.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
man	1
likeminded,	1
who	1
will	1
naturally	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
state.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
all	1
seek	1
their	1
own,	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
Jesus	1
Christ's.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
him,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
son	1
with	1
the	1
father,	1
he	1
hath	1
served	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
2:23	1
Him	1
therefore	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
send	1
presently,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
myself	1
shall	1
come	1
shortly.	1
	1
2:25	1
Yet	1
I	1
supposed	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
you	1
Epaphroditus,	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
companion	1
in	1
labour,	1
and	1
fellowsoldier,	1
but	1
your	1
messenger,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
ministered	1
to	1
my	1
wants.	1
	1
2:26	1
For	1
he	1
longed	1
after	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
heaviness,	1
because	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sick.	1
	1
2:27	1
For	1
indeed	1
he	1
was	1
sick	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death:	1
but	1
God	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
him	1
only,	1
but	1
on	1
me	1
also,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sorrow	1
upon	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:28	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
therefore	1
the	1
more	1
carefully,	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
him	1
again,	1
ye	1
may	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
less	1
sorrowful.	1
	1
2:29	1
Receive	1
him	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
gladness;	1
and	1
hold	1
such	1
in	1
reputation:	1
2:30	1
Because	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Christ	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death,	1
not	1
regarding	1
his	1
life,	1
to	1
supply	1
your	1
lack	1
of	1
service	1
toward	1
me.	1
	1
3:1	1
Finally,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
To	1
write	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
me	1
indeed	1
is	1
not	1
grievous,	1
but	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
safe.	1
	1
3:2	1
Beware	1
of	1
dogs,	1
beware	1
of	1
evil	1
workers,	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
concision.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
circumcision,	1
which	1
worship	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
3:4	1
Though	1
I	1
might	1
also	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
If	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
thinketh	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
whereof	1
he	1
might	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
I	1
more:	1
3:5	1
Circumcised	1
the	1
eighth	1
day,	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
Israel,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews;	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
law,	1
a	1
Pharisee;	1
3:6	1
Concerning	1
zeal,	1
persecuting	1
the	1
church;	1
touching	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
what	1
things	1
were	1
gain	1
to	1
me,	1
those	1
I	1
counted	1
loss	1
for	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:8	1
Yea	1
doubtless,	1
and	1
I	1
count	1
all	1
things	1
but	1
loss	1
for	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
my	1
Lord:	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
do	1
count	1
them	1
but	1
dung,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
win	1
Christ,	1
3:9	1
And	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
him,	1
not	1
having	1
mine	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
through	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ,	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
faith:	1
3:10	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
his	1
sufferings,	1
being	1
made	1
conformable	1
unto	1
his	1
death;	1
3:11	1
If	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
might	1
attain	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
3:12	1
Not	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
attained,	1
either	1
were	1
already	1
perfect:	1
but	1
I	1
follow	1
after,	1
if	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
apprehend	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
apprehended	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:13	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
count	1
not	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
apprehended:	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
do,	1
forgetting	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
behind,	1
and	1
reaching	1
forth	1
unto	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
before,	1
3:14	1
I	1
press	1
toward	1
the	1
mark	1
for	1
the	1
prize	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
calling	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:15	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
be	1
perfect,	1
be	1
thus	1
minded:	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
any	1
thing	1
ye	1
be	1
otherwise	1
minded,	1
God	1
shall	1
reveal	1
even	1
this	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:16	1
Nevertheless,	1
whereto	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
attained,	1
let	1
us	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
rule,	1
let	1
us	1
mind	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
	1
3:17	1
Brethren,	1
be	1
followers	1
together	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
mark	1
them	1
which	1
walk	1
so	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
us	1
for	1
an	1
ensample.	1
	1
3:18	1
(For	1
many	1
walk,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
often,	1
and	1
now	1
tell	1
you	1
even	1
weeping,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ:	1
3:19	1
Whose	1
end	1
is	1
destruction,	1
whose	1
God	1
is	1
their	1
belly,	1
and	1
whose	1
glory	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
shame,	1
who	1
mind	1
earthly	1
things.)	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
our	1
conversation	1
is	1
in	1
heaven;	1
from	1
whence	1
also	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
Saviour,	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:21	1
Who	1
shall	1
change	1
our	1
vile	1
body,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fashioned	1
like	1
unto	1
his	1
glorious	1
body,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
working	1
whereby	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
even	1
to	1
subdue	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
himself.	1
	1
4:1	1
Therefore,	1
my	1
brethren	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
and	1
longed	1
for,	1
my	1
joy	1
and	1
crown,	1
so	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved.	1
	1
4:2	1
I	1
beseech	1
Euodias,	1
and	1
beseech	1
Syntyche,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
I	1
intreat	1
thee	1
also,	1
true	1
yokefellow,	1
help	1
those	1
women	1
which	1
laboured	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
gospel,	1
with	1
Clement	1
also,	1
and	1
with	1
other	1
my	1
fellowlabourers,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
4:4	1
Rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
alway:	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
say,	1
Rejoice.	1
	1
4:5	1
Let	1
your	1
moderation	1
be	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:6	1
Be	1
careful	1
for	1
nothing;	1
but	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
let	1
your	1
requests	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
passeth	1
all	1
understanding,	1
shall	1
keep	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
minds	1
through	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:8	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
true,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
honest,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
just,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
pure,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
lovely,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
of	1
good	1
report;	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
virtue,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
praise,	1
think	1
on	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
4:9	1
Those	1
things,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
both	1
learned,	1
and	1
received,	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
seen	1
in	1
me,	1
do:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:10	1
But	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
greatly,	1
that	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
your	1
care	1
of	1
me	1
hath	1
flourished	1
again;	1
wherein	1
ye	1
were	1
also	1
careful,	1
but	1
ye	1
lacked	1
opportunity.	1
	1
4:11	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
want:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
learned,	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
state	1
I	1
am,	1
therewith	1
to	1
be	1
content.	1
	1
4:12	1
I	1
know	1
both	1
how	1
to	1
be	1
abased,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
abound:	1
every	1
where	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
am	1
instructed	1
both	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
hungry,	1
both	1
to	1
abound	1
and	1
to	1
suffer	1
need.	1
	1
4:13	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
through	1
Christ	1
which	1
strengtheneth	1
me.	1
	1
4:14	1
Notwithstanding	1
ye	1
have	1
well	1
done,	1
that	1
ye	1
did	1
communicate	1
with	1
my	1
affliction.	1
	1
4:15	1
Now	1
ye	1
Philippians	1
know	1
also,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
when	1
I	1
departed	1
from	1
Macedonia,	1
no	1
church	1
communicated	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
concerning	1
giving	1
and	1
receiving,	1
but	1
ye	1
only.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
even	1
in	1
Thessalonica	1
ye	1
sent	1
once	1
and	1
again	1
unto	1
my	1
necessity.	1
	1
4:17	1
Not	1
because	1
I	1
desire	1
a	1
gift:	1
but	1
I	1
desire	1
fruit	1
that	1
may	1
abound	1
to	1
your	1
account.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
all,	1
and	1
abound:	1
I	1
am	1
full,	1
having	1
received	1
of	1
Epaphroditus	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
you,	1
an	1
odour	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
smell,	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
acceptable,	1
wellpleasing	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
supply	1
all	1
your	1
need	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
riches	1
in	1
glory	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:20	1
Now	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:21	1
Salute	1
every	1
saint	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
The	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
greet	1
you.	1
	1
4:22	1
All	1
the	1
saints	1
salute	1
you,	1
chiefly	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
Caesar's	1
household.	1
	1
4:23	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1

The	1

of	1
Paul	1

1:1	1
	1
Paul,	1
an	1

of	1
Jesus	1

by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
our	1

1:2	1
	1
To	1
the	1
saints	1
and	1
faithful	1
brethren	1
in	1
Christ	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Colosse:	1
Grace	1

unto	1
you,	1

peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1

	1
1:3	1
	1
We	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
praying	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
1:4	1
	1
Since	1
we	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:5	1
	1
For	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
heaven,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
heard	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:6	1
	1
Which	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
as	1
it	1
doth	1
also	1
in	1
you,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
ye	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
knew	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth:	1
1:7	1
	1
As	1
ye	1
also	1
learned	1
of	1
Epaphras	1
our	1
dear	1
fellowservant,	1
who	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
a	1
faithful	1
minister	1
of	1
Christ;	1
1:8	1
	1
Who	1
also	1
declared	1
unto	1
us	1
your	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
1:9	1
	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
we	1
also,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
heard	1
it,	1
do	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
spiritual	1
understanding;	1
1:10	1
	1
That	1
ye	1
might	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
all	1
pleasing,	1
being	1
fruitful	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
work,	1
and	1
increasing	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God;	1
1:11	1
	1
Strengthened	1
with	1
all	1
might,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
glorious	1
power,	1
unto	1
all	1
patience	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
with	1
joyfulness;	1
1:12	1
	1
Giving	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
which	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
in	1
light:	1
1:13	1
	1
Who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
hath	1
translated	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
his	1
dear	1
Son:	1
1:14	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
redemption	1
through	1
his	1
blood,	1
even	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins:	1
1:15	1
	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
invisible	1
God,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
every	1
creature:	1
1:16	1
	1
For	1
by	1
him	1
were	1
all	1
things	1
created,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
earth,	1
visible	1
and	1
invisible,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
thrones,	1
or	1
dominions,	1
or	1
principalities,	1
or	1
powers:	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
created	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
for	1
him:	1
1:17	1
	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
before	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
consist.	1
	1
1:18	1
	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
the	1
church:	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
beginning,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence.	1
	1
1:19	1
	1
For	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
all	1
fulness	1
dwell;	1
1:20	1
	1
And,	1
having	1
made	1
peace	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
cross,	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
reconcile	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
himself;	1
by	1
him,	1
I	1
say,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
things	1
in	1
earth,	1
or	1
things	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:21	1
	1
And	1
you,	1
that	1
were	1
sometime	1
alienated	1
and	1
enemies	1
in	1
your	1
mind	1
by	1
wicked	1
works,	1
yet	1
now	1
hath	1
he	1
reconciled	1
1:22	1
	1
In	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
through	1
death,	1
to	1
present	1
you	1
holy	1
and	1
unblameable	1
and	1
unreproveable	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
1:23	1
	1
If	1
ye	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
grounded	1
and	1
settled,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
preached	1
to	1
every	1
creature	1
which	1
is	1
under	1
heaven;	1
whereof	1
I	1
Paul	1
am	1
made	1
a	1
minister;	1
1:24	1
	1
Who	1
now	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
sufferings	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
fill	1
up	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
behind	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
Christ	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
for	1
his	1
body's	1
sake,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
church:	1
1:25	1
	1
Whereof	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
a	1
minister,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God;	1
1:26	1
	1
Even	1
the	1
mystery	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
hid	1
from	1
ages	1
and	1
from	1
generations,	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
made	1
manifest	1
to	1
his	1
saints:	1
1:27	1
	1
To	1
whom	1
God	1
would	1
make	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
mystery	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
which	1
is	1
Christ	1
in	1
you,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
glory:	1
1:28	1
	1
Whom	1
we	1
preach,	1
warning	1
every	1
man,	1
and	1
teaching	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
present	1
every	1
man	1
perfect	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
1:29	1
	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
also	1
labour,	1
striving	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
working,	1
which	1
worketh	1
in	1
me	1
mightily.	1
	1
2:1	1
	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
knew	1
what	1
great	1
conflict	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
my	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
flesh;	1
2:2	1
	1
That	1
their	1
hearts	1
might	1
be	1
comforted,	1
being	1
knit	1
together	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
understanding,	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledgement	1
of	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
of	1
Christ;	1
2:3	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
are	1
hid	1
all	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge.	1
	1
2:4	1
	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
beguile	1
you	1
with	1
enticing	1
words.	1
	1
2:5	1
	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
absent	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
joying	1
and	1
beholding	1
your	1
order,	1
and	1
the	1
stedfastness	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:6	1
	1
As	1
ye	1
have	1
therefore	1
received	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Lord,	1
so	1
walk	1
ye	1
in	1
him:	1
2:7	1
	1
Rooted	1
and	1
built	1
up	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
stablished	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
taught,	1
abounding	1
therein	1
with	1
thanksgiving.	1
	1
2:8	1
	1
Beware	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
spoil	1
you	1
through	1
philosophy	1
and	1
vain	1
deceit,	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
men,	1
after	1
the	1
rudiments	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:9	1
	1
For	1
in	1
him	1
dwelleth	1
all	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Godhead	1
bodily.	1
	1
2:10	1
	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
complete	1
in	1
him,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
all	1
principality	1
and	1
power:	1
2:11	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
circumcised	1
with	1
the	1
circumcision	1
made	1
without	1
hands,	1
in	1
putting	1
off	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
by	1
the	1
circumcision	1
of	1
Christ:	1
2:12	1
	1
Buried	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
baptism,	1
wherein	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
risen	1
with	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
2:13	1
	1
And	1
you,	1
being	1
dead	1
in	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
of	1
your	1
flesh,	1
hath	1
he	1
quickened	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
having	1
forgiven	1
you	1
all	1
trespasses;	1
2:14	1
	1
Blotting	1
out	1
the	1
handwriting	1
of	1
ordinances	1
that	1
was	1
against	1
us,	1
which	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
nailing	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
cross;	1
2:15	1
	1
And	1
having	1
spoiled	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
shew	1
of	1
them	1
openly,	1
triumphing	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
2:16	1
	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
therefore	1
judge	1
you	1
in	1
meat,	1
or	1
in	1
drink,	1
or	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
an	1
holyday,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
moon,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days:	1
2:17	1
	1
Which	1
are	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
but	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:18	1
	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
beguile	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
a	1
voluntary	1
humility	1
and	1
worshipping	1
of	1
angels,	1
intruding	1
into	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen,	1
vainly	1
puffed	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
fleshly	1
mind,	1
2:19	1
	1
And	1
not	1
holding	1
the	1
Head,	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
body	1
by	1
joints	1
and	1
bands	1
having	1
nourishment	1
ministered,	1
and	1
knit	1
together,	1
increaseth	1
with	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:20	1
	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
rudiments	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
why,	1
as	1
though	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
are	1
ye	1
subject	1
to	1
ordinances,	1
2:21	1
	1
(Touch	1
not;	1
taste	1
not;	1
handle	1
not;	1
2:22	1
	1
Which	1
all	1
are	1
to	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
using;)	1
after	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
doctrines	1
of	1
men?	1
2:23	1
	1
Which	1
things	1
have	1
indeed	1
a	1
shew	1
of	1
wisdom	1
in	1
will	1
worship,	1
and	1
humility,	1
and	1
neglecting	1
of	1
the	1
body:	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
honour	1
to	1
the	1
satisfying	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
3:1	1
	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
be	1
risen	1
with	1
Christ,	1
seek	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
above,	1
where	1
Christ	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:2	1
	1
Set	1
your	1
affection	1
on	1
things	1
above,	1
not	1
on	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:3	1
	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
dead,	1
and	1
your	1
life	1
is	1
hid	1
with	1
Christ	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
3:4	1
	1
When	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
our	1
life,	1
shall	1
appear,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
also	1
appear	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
3:5	1
	1
Mortify	1
therefore	1
your	1
members	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
fornication,	1
uncleanness,	1
inordinate	1
affection,	1
evil	1
concupiscence,	1
and	1
covetousness,	1
which	1
is	1
idolatry:	1
3:6	1
	1
For	1
which	1
things'	1
sake	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
cometh	1
on	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience:	1
3:7	1
	1
In	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
also	1
walked	1
some	1
time,	1
when	1
ye	1
lived	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:8	1
	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
also	1
put	1
off	1
all	1
these;	1
anger,	1
wrath,	1
malice,	1
blasphemy,	1
filthy	1
communication	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
3:9	1
	1
Lie	1
not	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
deeds;	1
3:10	1
	1
And	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
renewed	1
in	1
knowledge	1
after	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
created	1
him:	1
3:11	1
	1
Where	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
Greek	1
nor	1
Jew,	1
circumcision	1
nor	1
uncircumcision,	1
Barbarian,	1
Scythian,	1
bond	1
nor	1
free:	1
but	1
Christ	1
is	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
3:12	1
	1
Put	1
on	1
therefore,	1
as	1
the	1
elect	1
of	1
God,	1
holy	1
and	1
beloved,	1
bowels	1
of	1
mercies,	1
kindness,	1
humbleness	1
of	1
mind,	1
meekness,	1
longsuffering;	1
3:13	1
	1
Forbearing	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
forgiving	1
one	1
another,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
a	1
quarrel	1
against	1
any:	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
forgave	1
you,	1
so	1
also	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
3:14	1
	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
put	1
on	1
charity,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
perfectness.	1
	1
3:15	1
	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God	1
rule	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
to	1
the	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
body;	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
thankful.	1
	1
3:16	1
	1
Let	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Christ	1
dwell	1
in	1
you	1
richly	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom;	1
teaching	1
and	1
admonishing	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
psalms	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
spiritual	1
songs,	1
singing	1
with	1
grace	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
to	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:17	1
	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
word	1
or	1
deed,	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
giving	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
3:18	1
	1
Wives,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
your	1
own	1
husbands,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
fit	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:19	1
	1
Husbands,	1
love	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
bitter	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
3:20	1
	1
Children,	1
obey	1
your	1
parents	1
in	1
all	1
things:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
well	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:21	1
	1
Fathers,	1
provoke	1
not	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
anger,	1
lest	1
they	1
be	1
discouraged.	1
	1
3:22	1
	1
Servants,	1
obey	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
your	1
masters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh;	1
not	1
with	1
eyeservice,	1
as	1
menpleasers;	1
but	1
in	1
singleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
fearing	1
God;	1
3:23	1
	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do,	1
do	1
it	1
heartily,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
men;	1
3:24	1
	1
Knowing	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance:	1
for	1
ye	1
serve	1
the	1
Lord	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:25	1
	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
wrong	1
shall	1
receive	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
respect	1
of	1
persons.	1
	1
4:1	1
	1
Masters,	1
give	1
unto	1
your	1
servants	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
equal;	1
knowing	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
a	1
Master	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
4:2	1
	1
Continue	1
in	1
prayer,	1
and	1
watch	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
thanksgiving;	1
4:3	1
	1
Withal	1
praying	1
also	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
open	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
door	1
of	1
utterance,	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Christ,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
in	1
bonds:	1
4:4	1
	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
it	1
manifest,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
4:5	1
	1
Walk	1
in	1
wisdom	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
redeeming	1
the	1
time.	1
	1
4:6	1
	1
Let	1
your	1
speech	1
be	1
alway	1
with	1
grace,	1
seasoned	1
with	1
salt,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
answer	1
every	1
man.	1
	1
4:7	1
	1
All	1
my	1
state	1
shall	1
Tychicus	1
declare	1
unto	1
you,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
beloved	1
brother,	1
and	1
a	1
faithful	1
minister	1
and	1
fellowservant	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
4:8	1
	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
your	1
estate,	1
and	1
comfort	1
your	1
hearts;	1
4:9	1
	1
With	1
Onesimus,	1
a	1
faithful	1
and	1
beloved	1
brother,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
you.	1
They	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
done	1
here.	1
	1
4:10	1
	1
Aristarchus	1
my	1
fellowprisoner	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
and	1
Marcus,	1
sister's	1
son	1
to	1
Barnabas,	1
(touching	1
whom	1
ye	1
received	1
commandments:	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
receive	1
him;)	1
4:11	1
	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Justus,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
These	1
only	1
are	1
my	1
fellowworkers	1
unto	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
comfort	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
4:12	1
	1
Epaphras,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Christ,	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
always	1
labouring	1
fervently	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
prayers,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
stand	1
perfect	1
and	1
complete	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
	1
For	1
I	1
bear	1
him	1
record,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
great	1
zeal	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
them	1
in	1
Hierapolis.	1
	1
4:14	1
	1
Luke,	1
the	1
beloved	1
physician,	1
and	1
Demas,	1
greet	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
	1
Salute	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
Nymphas,	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
4:16	1
	1
And	1
when	1
this	1
epistle	1
is	1
read	1
among	1
you,	1
cause	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
read	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Laodiceans;	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
likewise	1
read	1
the	1
epistle	1
from	1
Laodicea.	1
	1
4:17	1
	1
And	1
say	1
to	1
Archippus,	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
thou	1
fulfil	1
it.	1
	1
4:18	1
	1
The	1
salutation	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
me	1
Paul.	1
Remember	1
my	1
bonds.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
and	1
Silvanus,	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:2	1
We	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
always	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
our	1
prayers;	1
1:3	1
Remembering	1
without	1
ceasing	1
your	1
work	1
of	1
faith,	1
and	1
labour	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
patience	1
of	1
hope	1
in	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father;	1
1:4	1
Knowing,	1
brethren	1
beloved,	1
your	1
election	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
our	1
gospel	1
came	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
word	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
assurance;	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
we	1
were	1
among	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
sake.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
ye	1
became	1
followers	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
much	1
affliction,	1
with	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:7	1
So	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
ensamples	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
from	1
you	1
sounded	1
out	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
your	1
faith	1
to	1
God-ward	1
is	1
spread	1
abroad;	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
any	1
thing.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
they	1
themselves	1
shew	1
of	1
us	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
entering	1
in	1
we	1
had	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
how	1
ye	1
turned	1
to	1
God	1
from	1
idols	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
living	1
and	1
true	1
God;	1
1:10	1
And	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
Son	1
from	1
heaven,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
2:1	1
For	1
yourselves,	1
brethren,	1
know	1
our	1
entrance	1
in	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
vain:	1
2:2	1
But	1
even	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
suffered	1
before,	1
and	1
were	1
shamefully	1
entreated,	1
as	1
ye	1
know,	1
at	1
Philippi,	1
we	1
were	1
bold	1
in	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
much	1
contention.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
our	1
exhortation	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
deceit,	1
nor	1
of	1
uncleanness,	1
nor	1
in	1
guile:	1
2:4	1
But	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
allowed	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
trust	1
with	1
the	1
gospel,	1
even	1
so	1
we	1
speak;	1
not	1
as	1
pleasing	1
men,	1
but	1
God,	1
which	1
trieth	1
our	1
hearts.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
neither	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
used	1
we	1
flattering	1
words,	1
as	1
ye	1
know,	1
nor	1
a	1
cloke	1
of	1
covetousness;	1
God	1
is	1
witness:	1
2:6	1
Nor	1
of	1
men	1
sought	1
we	1
glory,	1
neither	1
of	1
you,	1
nor	1
yet	1
of	1
others,	1
when	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
burdensome,	1
as	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:7	1
But	1
we	1
were	1
gentle	1
among	1
you,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
nurse	1
cherisheth	1
her	1
children:	1
2:8	1
So	1
being	1
affectionately	1
desirous	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
imparted	1
unto	1
you,	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
our	1
own	1
souls,	1
because	1
ye	1
were	1
dear	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
2:9	1
For	1
ye	1
remember,	1
brethren,	1
our	1
labour	1
and	1
travail:	1
for	1
labouring	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
because	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
chargeable	1
unto	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
preached	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:10	1
Ye	1
are	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
God	1
also,	1
how	1
holily	1
and	1
justly	1
and	1
unblameably	1
we	1
behaved	1
ourselves	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
believe:	1
2:11	1
As	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
we	1
exhorted	1
and	1
comforted	1
and	1
charged	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
father	1
doth	1
his	1
children,	1
2:12	1
That	1
ye	1
would	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
unto	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
also	1
thank	1
we	1
God	1
without	1
ceasing,	1
because,	1
when	1
ye	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
ye	1
heard	1
of	1
us,	1
ye	1
received	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
truth,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
effectually	1
worketh	1
also	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
became	1
followers	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
in	1
Judaea	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
for	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
suffered	1
like	1
things	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
2:15	1
Who	1
both	1
killed	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
prophets,	1
and	1
have	1
persecuted	1
us;	1
and	1
they	1
please	1
not	1
God,	1
and	1
are	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
men:	1
2:16	1
Forbidding	1
us	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved,	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
their	1
sins	1
alway:	1
for	1
the	1
wrath	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost.	1
	1
2:17	1
But	1
we,	1
brethren,	1
being	1
taken	1
from	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
in	1
presence,	1
not	1
in	1
heart,	1
endeavoured	1
the	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
face	1
with	1
great	1
desire.	1
	1
2:18	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
even	1
I	1
Paul,	1
once	1
and	1
again;	1
but	1
Satan	1
hindered	1
us.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
our	1
hope,	1
or	1
joy,	1
or	1
crown	1
of	1
rejoicing?	1
Are	1
not	1
even	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
at	1
his	1
coming?	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
our	1
glory	1
and	1
joy.	1
	1
3:1	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
we	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
forbear,	1
we	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
at	1
Athens	1
alone;	1
3:2	1
And	1
sent	1
Timotheus,	1
our	1
brother,	1
and	1
minister	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
our	1
fellowlabourer	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
to	1
establish	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
comfort	1
you	1
concerning	1
your	1
faith:	1
3:3	1
That	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
moved	1
by	1
these	1
afflictions:	1
for	1
yourselves	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
appointed	1
thereunto.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
verily,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
you,	1
we	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
suffer	1
tribulation;	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
ye	1
know.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
this	1
cause,	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
forbear,	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
know	1
your	1
faith,	1
lest	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
the	1
tempter	1
have	1
tempted	1
you,	1
and	1
our	1
labour	1
be	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:6	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
Timotheus	1
came	1
from	1
you	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
brought	1
us	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
charity,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
good	1
remembrance	1
of	1
us	1
always,	1
desiring	1
greatly	1
to	1
see	1
us,	1
as	1
we	1
also	1
to	1
see	1
you:	1
3:7	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
were	1
comforted	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
affliction	1
and	1
distress	1
by	1
your	1
faith:	1
3:8	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
live,	1
if	1
ye	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
what	1
thanks	1
can	1
we	1
render	1
to	1
God	1
again	1
for	1
you,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
joy	1
wherewith	1
we	1
joy	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
before	1
our	1
God;	1
3:10	1
Night	1
and	1
day	1
praying	1
exceedingly	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
see	1
your	1
face,	1
and	1
might	1
perfect	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lacking	1
in	1
your	1
faith?	1
	1
3:11	1
Now	1
God	1
himself	1
and	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
direct	1
our	1
way	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
make	1
you	1
to	1
increase	1
and	1
abound	1
in	1
love	1
one	1
toward	1
another,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
men,	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
toward	1
you:	1
3:13	1
To	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
may	1
stablish	1
your	1
hearts	1
unblameable	1
in	1
holiness	1
before	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
Father,	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
saints.	1
	1
4:1	1
Furthermore	1
then	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
exhort	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
us	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
walk	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
God,	1
so	1
ye	1
would	1
abound	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
commandments	1
we	1
gave	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
your	1
sanctification,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
abstain	1
from	1
fornication:	1
4:4	1
That	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
possess	1
his	1
vessel	1
in	1
sanctification	1
and	1
honour;	1
4:5	1
Not	1
in	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
concupiscence,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
know	1
not	1
God:	1
4:6	1
That	1
no	1
man	1
go	1
beyond	1
and	1
defraud	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
any	1
matter:	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
all	1
such,	1
as	1
we	1
also	1
have	1
forewarned	1
you	1
and	1
testified.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
called	1
us	1
unto	1
uncleanness,	1
but	1
unto	1
holiness.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
therefore	1
that	1
despiseth,	1
despiseth	1
not	1
man,	1
but	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
also	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
his	1
holy	1
Spirit.	1
	1
4:9	1
But	1
as	1
touching	1
brotherly	1
love	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
taught	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
indeed	1
ye	1
do	1
it	1
toward	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
Macedonia:	1
but	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
increase	1
more	1
and	1
more;	1
4:11	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
study	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
your	1
own	1
business,	1
and	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
hands,	1
as	1
we	1
commanded	1
you;	1
4:12	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
walk	1
honestly	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
lack	1
of	1
nothing.	1
	1
4:13	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
brethren,	1
concerning	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
asleep,	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrow	1
not,	1
even	1
as	1
others	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
hope.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
died	1
and	1
rose	1
again,	1
even	1
so	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
sleep	1
in	1
Jesus	1
will	1
God	1
bring	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
this	1
we	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
we	1
which	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
remain	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
not	1
prevent	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
asleep.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
himself	1
shall	1
descend	1
from	1
heaven	1
with	1
a	1
shout,	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
archangel,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
trump	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
rise	1
first:	1
4:17	1
Then	1
we	1
which	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
remain	1
shall	1
be	1
caught	1
up	1
together	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
clouds,	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
air:	1
and	1
so	1
shall	1
we	1
ever	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:18	1
Wherefore	1
comfort	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
5:1	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
seasons,	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
yourselves	1
know	1
perfectly	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
so	1
cometh	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Peace	1
and	1
safety;	1
then	1
sudden	1
destruction	1
cometh	1
upon	1
them,	1
as	1
travail	1
upon	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
darkness,	1
that	1
that	1
day	1
should	1
overtake	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
	1
5:5	1
Ye	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
nor	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
5:6	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
sleep,	1
as	1
do	1
others;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
watch	1
and	1
be	1
sober.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
sleep	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
drunken	1
are	1
drunken	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
let	1
us,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
be	1
sober,	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
love;	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
helmet,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
5:9	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
appointed	1
us	1
to	1
wrath,	1
but	1
to	1
obtain	1
salvation	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
5:10	1
Who	1
died	1
for	1
us,	1
that,	1
whether	1
we	1
wake	1
or	1
sleep,	1
we	1
should	1
live	1
together	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:11	1
Wherefore	1
comfort	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
and	1
edify	1
one	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
also	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
to	1
know	1
them	1
which	1
labour	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
are	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
admonish	1
you;	1
5:13	1
And	1
to	1
esteem	1
them	1
very	1
highly	1
in	1
love	1
for	1
their	1
work's	1
sake.	1
And	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
among	1
yourselves.	1
	1
5:14	1
Now	1
we	1
exhort	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
warn	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
unruly,	1
comfort	1
the	1
feebleminded,	1
support	1
the	1
weak,	1
be	1
patient	1
toward	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
5:15	1
See	1
that	1
none	1
render	1
evil	1
for	1
evil	1
unto	1
any	1
man;	1
but	1
ever	1
follow	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
both	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
5:16	1
Rejoice	1
evermore.	1
	1
5:17	1
Pray	1
without	1
ceasing.	1
	1
5:18	1
In	1
every	1
thing	1
give	1
thanks:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
concerning	1
you.	1
	1
5:19	1
Quench	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:20	1
Despise	1
not	1
prophesyings.	1
	1
5:21	1
Prove	1
all	1
things;	1
hold	1
fast	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
5:22	1
Abstain	1
from	1
all	1
appearance	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
the	1
very	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
sanctify	1
you	1
wholly;	1
and	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
your	1
whole	1
spirit	1
and	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
be	1
preserved	1
blameless	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
5:24	1
Faithful	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
calleth	1
you,	1
who	1
also	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
5:25	1
Brethren,	1
pray	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
5:26	1
Greet	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
5:27	1
I	1
charge	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
this	1
epistle	1
be	1
read	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
brethren.	1
	1
5:28	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
and	1
Silvanus,	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
in	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
We	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
thank	1
God	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
meet,	1
because	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
groweth	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
the	1
charity	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
all	1
toward	1
each	1
other	1
aboundeth;	1
1:4	1
So	1
that	1
we	1
ourselves	1
glory	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
your	1
patience	1
and	1
faith	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
persecutions	1
and	1
tribulations	1
that	1
ye	1
endure:	1
1:5	1
Which	1
is	1
a	1
manifest	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
for	1
which	1
ye	1
also	1
suffer:	1
1:6	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
righteous	1
thing	1
with	1
God	1
to	1
recompense	1
tribulation	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
trouble	1
you;	1
1:7	1
And	1
to	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
troubled	1
rest	1
with	1
us,	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
from	1
heaven	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
angels,	1
1:8	1
In	1
flaming	1
fire	1
taking	1
vengeance	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
not	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:9	1
Who	1
shall	1
be	1
punished	1
with	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
power;	1
1:10	1
When	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
his	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
admired	1
in	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
(because	1
our	1
testimony	1
among	1
you	1
was	1
believed)	1
in	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
1:11	1
Wherefore	1
also	1
we	1
pray	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
that	1
our	1
God	1
would	1
count	1
you	1
worthy	1
of	1
this	1
calling,	1
and	1
fulfil	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
faith	1
with	1
power:	1
1:12	1
That	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
in	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:1	1
Now	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
gathering	1
together	1
unto	1
him,	1
2:2	1
That	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
soon	1
shaken	1
in	1
mind,	1
or	1
be	1
troubled,	1
neither	1
by	1
spirit,	1
nor	1
by	1
word,	1
nor	1
by	1
letter	1
as	1
from	1
us,	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you	1
by	1
any	1
means:	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
not	1
come,	1
except	1
there	1
come	1
a	1
falling	1
away	1
first,	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
of	1
sin	1
be	1
revealed,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition;	1
2:4	1
Who	1
opposeth	1
and	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
God,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
worshipped;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
as	1
God	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
shewing	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
2:5	1
Remember	1
ye	1
not,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
withholdeth	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
his	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
For	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
iniquity	1
doth	1
already	1
work:	1
only	1
he	1
who	1
now	1
letteth	1
will	1
let,	1
until	1
he	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
that	1
Wicked	1
be	1
revealed,	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
consume	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
with	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
his	1
coming:	1
2:9	1
Even	1
him,	1
whose	1
coming	1
is	1
after	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
Satan	1
with	1
all	1
power	1
and	1
signs	1
and	1
lying	1
wonders,	1
2:10	1
And	1
with	1
all	1
deceivableness	1
of	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
perish;	1
because	1
they	1
received	1
not	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
God	1
shall	1
send	1
them	1
strong	1
delusion,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
a	1
lie:	1
2:12	1
That	1
they	1
all	1
might	1
be	1
damned	1
who	1
believed	1
not	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
had	1
pleasure	1
in	1
unrighteousness.	1
	1
2:13	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
alway	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
you,	1
brethren	1
beloved	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
because	1
God	1
hath	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
chosen	1
you	1
to	1
salvation	1
through	1
sanctification	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
truth:	1
2:14	1
Whereunto	1
he	1
called	1
you	1
by	1
our	1
gospel,	1
to	1
the	1
obtaining	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:15	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
stand	1
fast,	1
and	1
hold	1
the	1
traditions	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
taught,	1
whether	1
by	1
word,	1
or	1
our	1
epistle.	1
	1
2:16	1
Now	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself,	1
and	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
Father,	1
which	1
hath	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
everlasting	1
consolation	1
and	1
good	1
hope	1
through	1
grace,	1
2:17	1
Comfort	1
your	1
hearts,	1
and	1
stablish	1
you	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
word	1
and	1
work.	1
	1
3:1	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
pray	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
may	1
have	1
free	1
course,	1
and	1
be	1
glorified,	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
you:	1
3:2	1
And	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
unreasonable	1
and	1
wicked	1
men:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
have	1
not	1
faith.	1
	1
3:3	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
faithful,	1
who	1
shall	1
stablish	1
you,	1
and	1
keep	1
you	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
touching	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
both	1
do	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
direct	1
your	1
hearts	1
into	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
patient	1
waiting	1
for	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:6	1
Now	1
we	1
command	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
ye	1
withdraw	1
yourselves	1
from	1
every	1
brother	1
that	1
walketh	1
disorderly,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
yourselves	1
know	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
follow	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
behaved	1
not	1
ourselves	1
disorderly	1
among	1
you;	1
3:8	1
Neither	1
did	1
we	1
eat	1
any	1
man's	1
bread	1
for	1
nought;	1
but	1
wrought	1
with	1
labour	1
and	1
travail	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
chargeable	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
you:	1
3:9	1
Not	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
power,	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
ourselves	1
an	1
ensample	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
follow	1
us.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
even	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
you,	1
this	1
we	1
commanded	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
would	1
not	1
work,	1
neither	1
should	1
he	1
eat.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
we	1
hear	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
which	1
walk	1
among	1
you	1
disorderly,	1
working	1
not	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
are	1
busybodies.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
such	1
we	1
command	1
and	1
exhort	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
with	1
quietness	1
they	1
work,	1
and	1
eat	1
their	1
own	1
bread.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
weary	1
in	1
well	1
doing.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
obey	1
not	1
our	1
word	1
by	1
this	1
epistle,	1
note	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
company	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
3:15	1
Yet	1
count	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
enemy,	1
but	1
admonish	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
3:16	1
Now	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
peace	1
himself	1
give	1
you	1
peace	1
always	1
by	1
all	1
means.	1
The	1
Lord	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
3:17	1
The	1
salutation	1
of	1
Paul	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
token	1
in	1
every	1
epistle:	1
so	1
I	1
write.	1
	1
3:18	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Timothy	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour,	1
and	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
is	1
our	1
hope;	1
1:2	1
Unto	1
Timothy,	1
my	1
own	1
son	1
in	1
the	1
faith:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:3	1
As	1
I	1
besought	1
thee	1
to	1
abide	1
still	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
charge	1
some	1
that	1
they	1
teach	1
no	1
other	1
doctrine,	1
1:4	1
Neither	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
fables	1
and	1
endless	1
genealogies,	1
which	1
minister	1
questions,	1
rather	1
than	1
godly	1
edifying	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
faith:	1
so	1
do.	1
	1
1:5	1
Now	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
is	1
charity	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
heart,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conscience,	1
and	1
of	1
faith	1
unfeigned:	1
1:6	1
From	1
which	1
some	1
having	1
swerved	1
have	1
turned	1
aside	1
unto	1
vain	1
jangling;	1
1:7	1
Desiring	1
to	1
be	1
teachers	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
understanding	1
neither	1
what	1
they	1
say,	1
nor	1
whereof	1
they	1
affirm.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
good,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
use	1
it	1
lawfully;	1
1:9	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
man,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
lawless	1
and	1
disobedient,	1
for	1
the	1
ungodly	1
and	1
for	1
sinners,	1
for	1
unholy	1
and	1
profane,	1
for	1
murderers	1
of	1
fathers	1
and	1
murderers	1
of	1
mothers,	1
for	1
manslayers,	1
1:10	1
For	1
whoremongers,	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
defile	1
themselves	1
with	1
mankind,	1
for	1
menstealers,	1
for	1
liars,	1
for	1
perjured	1
persons,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
sound	1
doctrine;	1
1:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
glorious	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
blessed	1
God,	1
which	1
was	1
committed	1
to	1
my	1
trust.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
I	1
thank	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
enabled	1
me,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
counted	1
me	1
faithful,	1
putting	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
ministry;	1
1:13	1
Who	1
was	1
before	1
a	1
blasphemer,	1
and	1
a	1
persecutor,	1
and	1
injurious:	1
but	1
I	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
because	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
ignorantly	1
in	1
unbelief.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
was	1
exceeding	1
abundant	1
with	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:15	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying,	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
acceptation,	1
that	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
save	1
sinners;	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
chief.	1
	1
1:16	1
Howbeit	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
first	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
might	1
shew	1
forth	1
all	1
longsuffering,	1
for	1
a	1
pattern	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
should	1
hereafter	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
1:17	1
Now	1
unto	1
the	1
King	1
eternal,	1
immortal,	1
invisible,	1
the	1
only	1
wise	1
God,	1
be	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:18	1
This	1
charge	1
I	1
commit	1
unto	1
thee,	1
son	1
Timothy,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
on	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
by	1
them	1
mightest	1
war	1
a	1
good	1
warfare;	1
1:19	1
Holding	1
faith,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
conscience;	1
which	1
some	1
having	1
put	1
away	1
concerning	1
faith	1
have	1
made	1
shipwreck:	1
1:20	1
Of	1
whom	1
is	1
Hymenaeus	1
and	1
Alexander;	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn	1
not	1
to	1
blaspheme.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
exhort	1
therefore,	1
that,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
supplications,	1
prayers,	1
intercessions,	1
and	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks,	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
all	1
men;	1
2:2	1
For	1
kings,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
authority;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
lead	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
peaceable	1
life	1
in	1
all	1
godliness	1
and	1
honesty.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
acceptable	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
2:4	1
Who	1
will	1
have	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God,	1
and	1
one	1
mediator	1
between	1
God	1
and	1
men,	1
the	1
man	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
all,	1
to	1
be	1
testified	1
in	1
due	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
am	1
ordained	1
a	1
preacher,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle,	1
(I	1
speak	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
lie	1
not;)	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
verity.	1
	1
2:8	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
that	1
men	1
pray	1
every	1
where,	1
lifting	1
up	1
holy	1
hands,	1
without	1
wrath	1
and	1
doubting.	1
	1
2:9	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
also,	1
that	1
women	1
adorn	1
themselves	1
in	1
modest	1
apparel,	1
with	1
shamefacedness	1
and	1
sobriety;	1
not	1
with	1
broided	1
hair,	1
or	1
gold,	1
or	1
pearls,	1
or	1
costly	1
array;	1
2:10	1
But	1
(which	1
becometh	1
women	1
professing	1
godliness)	1
with	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
2:11	1
Let	1
the	1
woman	1
learn	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
all	1
subjection.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
I	1
suffer	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
teach,	1
nor	1
to	1
usurp	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
man,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
Adam	1
was	1
first	1
formed,	1
then	1
Eve.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
Adam	1
was	1
not	1
deceived,	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
being	1
deceived	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
transgression.	1
	1
2:15	1
Notwithstanding	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
childbearing,	1
if	1
they	1
continue	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
charity	1
and	1
holiness	1
with	1
sobriety.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
saying,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
desire	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
bishop,	1
he	1
desireth	1
a	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
3:2	1
A	1
bishop	1
then	1
must	1
be	1
blameless,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
vigilant,	1
sober,	1
of	1
good	1
behaviour,	1
given	1
to	1
hospitality,	1
apt	1
to	1
teach;	1
3:3	1
Not	1
given	1
to	1
wine,	1
no	1
striker,	1
not	1
greedy	1
of	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
but	1
patient,	1
not	1
a	1
brawler,	1
not	1
covetous;	1
3:4	1
One	1
that	1
ruleth	1
well	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
having	1
his	1
children	1
in	1
subjection	1
with	1
all	1
gravity;	1
3:5	1
(For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
rule	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God?)	1
	1
3:6	1
Not	1
a	1
novice,	1
lest	1
being	1
lifted	1
up	1
with	1
pride	1
he	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
condemnation	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:7	1
Moreover	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
without;	1
lest	1
he	1
fall	1
into	1
reproach	1
and	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:8	1
Likewise	1
must	1
the	1
deacons	1
be	1
grave,	1
not	1
doubletongued,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
much	1
wine,	1
not	1
greedy	1
of	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
3:9	1
Holding	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
a	1
pure	1
conscience.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
let	1
these	1
also	1
first	1
be	1
proved;	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
use	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
deacon,	1
being	1
found	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:11	1
Even	1
so	1
must	1
their	1
wives	1
be	1
grave,	1
not	1
slanderers,	1
sober,	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
3:12	1
Let	1
the	1
deacons	1
be	1
the	1
husbands	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
ruling	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
houses	1
well.	1
	1
3:13	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
deacon	1
well	1
purchase	1
to	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
degree,	1
and	1
great	1
boldness	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:14	1
These	1
things	1
write	1
I	1
unto	1
thee,	1
hoping	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
shortly:	1
3:15	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
tarry	1
long,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
how	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
behave	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
the	1
pillar	1
and	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
without	1
controversy	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
godliness:	1
God	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
justified	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
seen	1
of	1
angels,	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
believed	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
received	1
up	1
into	1
glory.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Spirit	1
speaketh	1
expressly,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
times	1
some	1
shall	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
faith,	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
seducing	1
spirits,	1
and	1
doctrines	1
of	1
devils;	1
4:2	1
Speaking	1
lies	1
in	1
hypocrisy;	1
having	1
their	1
conscience	1
seared	1
with	1
a	1
hot	1
iron;	1
4:3	1
Forbidding	1
to	1
marry,	1
and	1
commanding	1
to	1
abstain	1
from	1
meats,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
created	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
believe	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
every	1
creature	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
refused,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
thanksgiving:	1
4:5	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:6	1
If	1
thou	1
put	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
minister	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
nourished	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
doctrine,	1
whereunto	1
thou	1
hast	1
attained.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
refuse	1
profane	1
and	1
old	1
wives'	1
fables,	1
and	1
exercise	1
thyself	1
rather	1
unto	1
godliness.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
profiteth	1
little:	1
but	1
godliness	1
is	1
profitable	1
unto	1
all	1
things,	1
having	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
now	1
is,	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
4:9	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
acceptation.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
therefore	1
we	1
both	1
labour	1
and	1
suffer	1
reproach,	1
because	1
we	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
specially	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
4:11	1
These	1
things	1
command	1
and	1
teach.	1
	1
4:12	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
despise	1
thy	1
youth;	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
believers,	1
in	1
word,	1
in	1
conversation,	1
in	1
charity,	1
in	1
spirit,	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
purity.	1
	1
4:13	1
Till	1
I	1
come,	1
give	1
attendance	1
to	1
reading,	1
to	1
exhortation,	1
to	1
doctrine.	1
	1
4:14	1
Neglect	1
not	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
thee	1
by	1
prophecy,	1
with	1
the	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
presbytery.	1
	1
4:15	1
Meditate	1
upon	1
these	1
things;	1
give	1
thyself	1
wholly	1
to	1
them;	1
that	1
thy	1
profiting	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
all.	1
	1
4:16	1
Take	1
heed	1
unto	1
thyself,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
doctrine;	1
continue	1
in	1
them:	1
for	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
thou	1
shalt	1
both	1
save	1
thyself,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
hear	1
thee.	1
	1
5:1	1
Rebuke	1
not	1
an	1
elder,	1
but	1
intreat	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
father;	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
as	1
brethren;	1
5:2	1
The	1
elder	1
women	1
as	1
mothers;	1
the	1
younger	1
as	1
sisters,	1
with	1
all	1
purity.	1
	1
5:3	1
Honour	1
widows	1
that	1
are	1
widows	1
indeed.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
widow	1
have	1
children	1
or	1
nephews,	1
let	1
them	1
learn	1
first	1
to	1
shew	1
piety	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
to	1
requite	1
their	1
parents:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
acceptable	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
widow	1
indeed,	1
and	1
desolate,	1
trusteth	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
continueth	1
in	1
supplications	1
and	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
she	1
that	1
liveth	1
in	1
pleasure	1
is	1
dead	1
while	1
she	1
liveth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
give	1
in	1
charge,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
blameless.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
provide	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
specially	1
for	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
he	1
hath	1
denied	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
an	1
infidel.	1
	1
5:9	1
Let	1
not	1
a	1
widow	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
number	1
under	1
threescore	1
years	1
old,	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
5:10	1
Well	1
reported	1
of	1
for	1
good	1
works;	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
brought	1
up	1
children,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
lodged	1
strangers,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
washed	1
the	1
saints'	1
feet,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
relieved	1
the	1
afflicted,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
diligently	1
followed	1
every	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
the	1
younger	1
widows	1
refuse:	1
for	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
wax	1
wanton	1
against	1
Christ,	1
they	1
will	1
marry;	1
5:12	1
Having	1
damnation,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
first	1
faith.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
withal	1
they	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
idle,	1
wandering	1
about	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
idle,	1
but	1
tattlers	1
also	1
and	1
busybodies,	1
speaking	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
ought	1
not.	1
	1
5:14	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
younger	1
women	1
marry,	1
bear	1
children,	1
guide	1
the	1
house,	1
give	1
none	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
adversary	1
to	1
speak	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
5:15	1
For	1
some	1
are	1
already	1
turned	1
aside	1
after	1
Satan.	1
	1
5:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
that	1
believeth	1
have	1
widows,	1
let	1
them	1
relieve	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
church	1
be	1
charged;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
relieve	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
widows	1
indeed.	1
	1
5:17	1
Let	1
the	1
elders	1
that	1
rule	1
well	1
be	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
double	1
honour,	1
especially	1
they	1
who	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
doctrine.	1
	1
5:18	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
ox	1
that	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
And,	1
The	1
labourer	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
5:19	1
Against	1
an	1
elder	1
receive	1
not	1
an	1
accusation,	1
but	1
before	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses.	1
	1
5:20	1
Them	1
that	1
sin	1
rebuke	1
before	1
all,	1
that	1
others	1
also	1
may	1
fear.	1
	1
5:21	1
I	1
charge	1
thee	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
elect	1
angels,	1
that	1
thou	1
observe	1
these	1
things	1
without	1
preferring	1
one	1
before	1
another,	1
doing	1
nothing	1
by	1
partiality.	1
	1
5:22	1
Lay	1
hands	1
suddenly	1
on	1
no	1
man,	1
neither	1
be	1
partaker	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
sins:	1
keep	1
thyself	1
pure.	1
	1
5:23	1
Drink	1
no	1
longer	1
water,	1
but	1
use	1
a	1
little	1
wine	1
for	1
thy	1
stomach's	1
sake	1
and	1
thine	1
often	1
infirmities.	1
	1
5:24	1
Some	1
men's	1
sins	1
are	1
open	1
beforehand,	1
going	1
before	1
to	1
judgment;	1
and	1
some	1
men	1
they	1
follow	1
after.	1
	1
5:25	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
good	1
works	1
of	1
some	1
are	1
manifest	1
beforehand;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
otherwise	1
cannot	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
6:1	1
Let	1
as	1
many	1
servants	1
as	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
count	1
their	1
own	1
masters	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
honour,	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
doctrine	1
be	1
not	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
believing	1
masters,	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
despise	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
brethren;	1
but	1
rather	1
do	1
them	1
service,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
beloved,	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
benefit.	1
These	1
things	1
teach	1
and	1
exhort.	1
	1
6:3	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
teach	1
otherwise,	1
and	1
consent	1
not	1
to	1
wholesome	1
words,	1
even	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
which	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
godliness;	1
6:4	1
He	1
is	1
proud,	1
knowing	1
nothing,	1
but	1
doting	1
about	1
questions	1
and	1
strifes	1
of	1
words,	1
whereof	1
cometh	1
envy,	1
strife,	1
railings,	1
evil	1
surmisings,	1
6:5	1
Perverse	1
disputings	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
corrupt	1
minds,	1
and	1
destitute	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
supposing	1
that	1
gain	1
is	1
godliness:	1
from	1
such	1
withdraw	1
thyself.	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
godliness	1
with	1
contentment	1
is	1
great	1
gain.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
we	1
brought	1
nothing	1
into	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
we	1
can	1
carry	1
nothing	1
out.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
having	1
food	1
and	1
raiment	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
therewith	1
content.	1
	1
6:9	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
rich	1
fall	1
into	1
temptation	1
and	1
a	1
snare,	1
and	1
into	1
many	1
foolish	1
and	1
hurtful	1
lusts,	1
which	1
drown	1
men	1
in	1
destruction	1
and	1
perdition.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
money	1
is	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
evil:	1
which	1
while	1
some	1
coveted	1
after,	1
they	1
have	1
erred	1
from	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
pierced	1
themselves	1
through	1
with	1
many	1
sorrows.	1
	1
6:11	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
flee	1
these	1
things;	1
and	1
follow	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
godliness,	1
faith,	1
love,	1
patience,	1
meekness.	1
	1
6:12	1
Fight	1
the	1
good	1
fight	1
of	1
faith,	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
eternal	1
life,	1
whereunto	1
thou	1
art	1
also	1
called,	1
and	1
hast	1
professed	1
a	1
good	1
profession	1
before	1
many	1
witnesses.	1
	1
6:13	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
charge	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
quickeneth	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
before	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
before	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
witnessed	1
a	1
good	1
confession;	1
6:14	1
That	1
thou	1
keep	1
this	1
commandment	1
without	1
spot,	1
unrebukable,	1
until	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
6:15	1
Which	1
in	1
his	1
times	1
he	1
shall	1
shew,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
blessed	1
and	1
only	1
Potentate,	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords;	1
6:16	1
Who	1
only	1
hath	1
immortality,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
approach	1
unto;	1
whom	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
seen,	1
nor	1
can	1
see:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
honour	1
and	1
power	1
everlasting.	1
Amen.	1
	1
6:17	1
Charge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
rich	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
highminded,	1
nor	1
trust	1
in	1
uncertain	1
riches,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
who	1
giveth	1
us	1
richly	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
enjoy;	1
6:18	1
That	1
they	1
do	1
good,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
rich	1
in	1
good	1
works,	1
ready	1
to	1
distribute,	1
willing	1
to	1
communicate;	1
6:19	1
Laying	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
foundation	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
6:20	1
O	1
Timothy,	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
committed	1
to	1
thy	1
trust,	1
avoiding	1
profane	1
and	1
vain	1
babblings,	1
and	1
oppositions	1
of	1
science	1
falsely	1
so	1
called:	1
6:21	1
Which	1
some	1
professing	1
have	1
erred	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Timothy	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
1:2	1
To	1
Timothy,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
son:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:3	1
I	1
thank	1
God,	1
whom	1
I	1
serve	1
from	1
my	1
forefathers	1
with	1
pure	1
conscience,	1
that	1
without	1
ceasing	1
I	1
have	1
remembrance	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
my	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day;	1
1:4	1
Greatly	1
desiring	1
to	1
see	1
thee,	1
being	1
mindful	1
of	1
thy	1
tears,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
joy;	1
1:5	1
When	1
I	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
unfeigned	1
faith	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
first	1
in	1
thy	1
grandmother	1
Lois,	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
Eunice;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
in	1
thee	1
also.	1
	1
1:6	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
put	1
thee	1
in	1
remembrance	1
that	1
thou	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
putting	1
on	1
of	1
my	1
hands.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
given	1
us	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
fear;	1
but	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sound	1
mind.	1
	1
1:8	1
Be	1
not	1
thou	1
therefore	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
our	1
Lord,	1
nor	1
of	1
me	1
his	1
prisoner:	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God;	1
1:9	1
Who	1
hath	1
saved	1
us,	1
and	1
called	1
us	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
calling,	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
works,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
purpose	1
and	1
grace,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
us	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
began,	1
1:10	1
But	1
is	1
now	1
made	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
hath	1
abolished	1
death,	1
and	1
hath	1
brought	1
life	1
and	1
immortality	1
to	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
gospel:	1
1:11	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
am	1
appointed	1
a	1
preacher,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle,	1
and	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
the	1
which	1
cause	1
I	1
also	1
suffer	1
these	1
things:	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
believed,	1
and	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
unto	1
him	1
against	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
1:13	1
Hold	1
fast	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
sound	1
words,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
me,	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:14	1
That	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
was	1
committed	1
unto	1
thee	1
keep	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
1:15	1
This	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
Phygellus	1
and	1
Hermogenes.	1
	1
1:16	1
The	1
Lord	1
give	1
mercy	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Onesiphorus;	1
for	1
he	1
oft	1
refreshed	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
my	1
chain:	1
1:17	1
But,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Rome,	1
he	1
sought	1
me	1
out	1
very	1
diligently,	1
and	1
found	1
me.	1
	1
1:18	1
The	1
Lord	1
grant	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
find	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
in	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
he	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
very	1
well.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thou	1
therefore,	1
my	1
son,	1
be	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
me	1
among	1
many	1
witnesses,	1
the	1
same	1
commit	1
thou	1
to	1
faithful	1
men,	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
teach	1
others	1
also.	1
	1
2:3	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
endure	1
hardness,	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
soldier	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:4	1
No	1
man	1
that	1
warreth	1
entangleth	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
this	1
life;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
chosen	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
soldier.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
also	1
strive	1
for	1
masteries,	1
yet	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
crowned,	1
except	1
he	1
strive	1
lawfully.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
husbandman	1
that	1
laboureth	1
must	1
be	1
first	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
fruits.	1
	1
2:7	1
Consider	1
what	1
I	1
say;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
give	1
thee	1
understanding	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:8	1
Remember	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
was	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel:	1
2:9	1
Wherein	1
I	1
suffer	1
trouble,	1
as	1
an	1
evil	1
doer,	1
even	1
unto	1
bonds;	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
bound.	1
	1
2:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
endure	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sakes,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
also	1
obtain	1
the	1
salvation	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
with	1
eternal	1
glory.	1
	1
2:11	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying:	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
him,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
live	1
with	1
him:	1
2:12	1
If	1
we	1
suffer,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
reign	1
with	1
him:	1
if	1
we	1
deny	1
him,	1
he	1
also	1
will	1
deny	1
us:	1
2:13	1
If	1
we	1
believe	1
not,	1
yet	1
he	1
abideth	1
faithful:	1
he	1
cannot	1
deny	1
himself.	1
	1
2:14	1
Of	1
these	1
things	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
charging	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
strive	1
not	1
about	1
words	1
to	1
no	1
profit,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
subverting	1
of	1
the	1
hearers.	1
	1
2:15	1
Study	1
to	1
shew	1
thyself	1
approved	1
unto	1
God,	1
a	1
workman	1
that	1
needeth	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
rightly	1
dividing	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth.	1
	1
2:16	1
But	1
shun	1
profane	1
and	1
vain	1
babblings:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
increase	1
unto	1
more	1
ungodliness.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
their	1
word	1
will	1
eat	1
as	1
doth	1
a	1
canker:	1
of	1
whom	1
is	1
Hymenaeus	1
and	1
Philetus;	1
2:18	1
Who	1
concerning	1
the	1
truth	1
have	1
erred,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
resurrection	1
is	1
past	1
already;	1
and	1
overthrow	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
some.	1
	1
2:19	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
God	1
standeth	1
sure,	1
having	1
this	1
seal,	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
his.	1
And,	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
nameth	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
depart	1
from	1
iniquity.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
house	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
of	1
earth;	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
honour,	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
dishonour.	1
	1
2:21	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
therefore	1
purge	1
himself	1
from	1
these,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
vessel	1
unto	1
honour,	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
master's	1
use,	1
and	1
prepared	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
2:22	1
Flee	1
also	1
youthful	1
lusts:	1
but	1
follow	1
righteousness,	1
faith,	1
charity,	1
peace,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
heart.	1
	1
2:23	1
But	1
foolish	1
and	1
unlearned	1
questions	1
avoid,	1
knowing	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
gender	1
strifes.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
must	1
not	1
strive;	1
but	1
be	1
gentle	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
apt	1
to	1
teach,	1
patient,	1
2:25	1
In	1
meekness	1
instructing	1
those	1
that	1
oppose	1
themselves;	1
if	1
God	1
peradventure	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
repentance	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
the	1
truth;	1
2:26	1
And	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
recover	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
who	1
are	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
know	1
also,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
perilous	1
times	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
3:2	1
For	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
lovers	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
selves,	1
covetous,	1
boasters,	1
proud,	1
blasphemers,	1
disobedient	1
to	1
parents,	1
unthankful,	1
unholy,	1
3:3	1
Without	1
natural	1
affection,	1
trucebreakers,	1
false	1
accusers,	1
incontinent,	1
fierce,	1
despisers	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
good,	1
3:4	1
Traitors,	1
heady,	1
highminded,	1
lovers	1
of	1
pleasures	1
more	1
than	1
lovers	1
of	1
God;	1
3:5	1
Having	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
godliness,	1
but	1
denying	1
the	1
power	1
thereof:	1
from	1
such	1
turn	1
away.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
creep	1
into	1
houses,	1
and	1
lead	1
captive	1
silly	1
women	1
laden	1
with	1
sins,	1
led	1
away	1
with	1
divers	1
lusts,	1
3:7	1
Ever	1
learning,	1
and	1
never	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
as	1
Jannes	1
and	1
Jambres	1
withstood	1
Moses,	1
so	1
do	1
these	1
also	1
resist	1
the	1
truth:	1
men	1
of	1
corrupt	1
minds,	1
reprobate	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
3:9	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
proceed	1
no	1
further:	1
for	1
their	1
folly	1
shall	1
be	1
manifest	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
as	1
their's	1
also	1
was.	1
	1
3:10	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
fully	1
known	1
my	1
doctrine,	1
manner	1
of	1
life,	1
purpose,	1
faith,	1
longsuffering,	1
charity,	1
patience,	1
3:11	1
Persecutions,	1
afflictions,	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Antioch,	1
at	1
Iconium,	1
at	1
Lystra;	1
what	1
persecutions	1
I	1
endured:	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
Lord	1
delivered	1
me.	1
	1
3:12	1
Yea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
live	1
godly	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
suffer	1
persecution.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
evil	1
men	1
and	1
seducers	1
shall	1
wax	1
worse	1
and	1
worse,	1
deceiving,	1
and	1
being	1
deceived.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
continue	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
learned	1
and	1
hast	1
been	1
assured	1
of,	1
knowing	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
learned	1
them;	1
3:15	1
And	1
that	1
from	1
a	1
child	1
thou	1
hast	1
known	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures,	1
which	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
wise	1
unto	1
salvation	1
through	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:16	1
All	1
scripture	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
inspiration	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
doctrine,	1
for	1
reproof,	1
for	1
correction,	1
for	1
instruction	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
3:17	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
perfect,	1
throughly	1
furnished	1
unto	1
all	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
4:1	1
I	1
charge	1
thee	1
therefore	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
at	1
his	1
appearing	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom;	1
4:2	1
Preach	1
the	1
word;	1
be	1
instant	1
in	1
season,	1
out	1
of	1
season;	1
reprove,	1
rebuke,	1
exhort	1
with	1
all	1
longsuffering	1
and	1
doctrine.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
endure	1
sound	1
doctrine;	1
but	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts	1
shall	1
they	1
heap	1
to	1
themselves	1
teachers,	1
having	1
itching	1
ears;	1
4:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
turn	1
away	1
their	1
ears	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
fables.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
watch	1
thou	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
endure	1
afflictions,	1
do	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
evangelist,	1
make	1
full	1
proof	1
of	1
thy	1
ministry.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
offered,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:7	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
a	1
good	1
fight,	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
my	1
course,	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
faith:	1
4:8	1
Henceforth	1
there	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
righteous	1
judge,	1
shall	1
give	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
me	1
only,	1
but	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
love	1
his	1
appearing.	1
	1
4:9	1
Do	1
thy	1
diligence	1
to	1
come	1
shortly	1
unto	1
me:	1
4:10	1
For	1
Demas	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
having	1
loved	1
this	1
present	1
world,	1
and	1
is	1
departed	1
unto	1
Thessalonica;	1
Crescens	1
to	1
Galatia,	1
Titus	1
unto	1
Dalmatia.	1
	1
4:11	1
Only	1
Luke	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
Take	1
Mark,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
profitable	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
ministry.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
Tychicus	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
4:13	1
The	1
cloke	1
that	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
Troas	1
with	1
Carpus,	1
when	1
thou	1
comest,	1
bring	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
books,	1
but	1
especially	1
the	1
parchments.	1
	1
4:14	1
Alexander	1
the	1
coppersmith	1
did	1
me	1
much	1
evil:	1
the	1
Lord	1
reward	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works:	1
4:15	1
Of	1
whom	1
be	1
thou	1
ware	1
also;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
greatly	1
withstood	1
our	1
words.	1
	1
4:16	1
At	1
my	1
first	1
answer	1
no	1
man	1
stood	1
with	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
men	1
forsook	1
me:	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
laid	1
to	1
their	1
charge.	1
	1
4:17	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
Lord	1
stood	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
me;	1
that	1
by	1
me	1
the	1
preaching	1
might	1
be	1
fully	1
known,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
hear:	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
lion.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
every	1
evil	1
work,	1
and	1
will	1
preserve	1
me	1
unto	1
his	1
heavenly	1
kingdom:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:19	1
Salute	1
Prisca	1
and	1
Aquila,	1
and	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
Onesiphorus.	1
	1
4:20	1
Erastus	1
abode	1
at	1
Corinth:	1
but	1
Trophimus	1
have	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
Miletum	1
sick.	1
	1
4:21	1
Do	1
thy	1
diligence	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
winter.	1
Eubulus	1
greeteth	1
thee,	1
and	1
Pudens,	1
and	1
Linus,	1
and	1
Claudia,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
4:22	1
The	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
spirit.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Titus	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
God's	1
elect,	1
and	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
which	1
is	1
after	1
godliness;	1
1:2	1
In	1
hope	1
of	1
eternal	1
life,	1
which	1
God,	1
that	1
cannot	1
lie,	1
promised	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
began;	1
1:3	1
But	1
hath	1
in	1
due	1
times	1
manifested	1
his	1
word	1
through	1
preaching,	1
which	1
is	1
committed	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
1:4	1
To	1
Titus,	1
mine	1
own	1
son	1
after	1
the	1
common	1
faith:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Saviour.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
left	1
I	1
thee	1
in	1
Crete,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
wanting,	1
and	1
ordain	1
elders	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
appointed	1
thee:	1
1:6	1
If	1
any	1
be	1
blameless,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
having	1
faithful	1
children	1
not	1
accused	1
of	1
riot	1
or	1
unruly.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
a	1
bishop	1
must	1
be	1
blameless,	1
as	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
God;	1
not	1
selfwilled,	1
not	1
soon	1
angry,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
wine,	1
no	1
striker,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
1:8	1
But	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
hospitality,	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
good	1
men,	1
sober,	1
just,	1
holy,	1
temperate;	1
1:9	1
Holding	1
fast	1
the	1
faithful	1
word	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
taught,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
by	1
sound	1
doctrine	1
both	1
to	1
exhort	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
the	1
gainsayers.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
unruly	1
and	1
vain	1
talkers	1
and	1
deceivers,	1
specially	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision:	1
1:11	1
Whose	1
mouths	1
must	1
be	1
stopped,	1
who	1
subvert	1
whole	1
houses,	1
teaching	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
ought	1
not,	1
for	1
filthy	1
lucre's	1
sake.	1
	1
1:12	1
One	1
of	1
themselves,	1
even	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
said,	1
The	1
Cretians	1
are	1
alway	1
liars,	1
evil	1
beasts,	1
slow	1
bellies.	1
	1
1:13	1
This	1
witness	1
is	1
true.	1
Wherefore	1
rebuke	1
them	1
sharply,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
faith;	1
1:14	1
Not	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
Jewish	1
fables,	1
and	1
commandments	1
of	1
men,	1
that	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:15	1
Unto	1
the	1
pure	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
pure:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
defiled	1
and	1
unbelieving	1
is	1
nothing	1
pure;	1
but	1
even	1
their	1
mind	1
and	1
conscience	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
1:16	1
They	1
profess	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
God;	1
but	1
in	1
works	1
they	1
deny	1
him,	1
being	1
abominable,	1
and	1
disobedient,	1
and	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
work	1
reprobate.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
speak	1
thou	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
become	1
sound	1
doctrine:	1
2:2	1
That	1
the	1
aged	1
men	1
be	1
sober,	1
grave,	1
temperate,	1
sound	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
charity,	1
in	1
patience.	1
	1
2:3	1
The	1
aged	1
women	1
likewise,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
in	1
behaviour	1
as	1
becometh	1
holiness,	1
not	1
false	1
accusers,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
much	1
wine,	1
teachers	1
of	1
good	1
things;	1
2:4	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
teach	1
the	1
young	1
women	1
to	1
be	1
sober,	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
husbands,	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
children,	1
2:5	1
To	1
be	1
discreet,	1
chaste,	1
keepers	1
at	1
home,	1
good,	1
obedient	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
husbands,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
not	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
2:6	1
Young	1
men	1
likewise	1
exhort	1
to	1
be	1
sober	1
minded.	1
	1
2:7	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
shewing	1
thyself	1
a	1
pattern	1
of	1
good	1
works:	1
in	1
doctrine	1
shewing	1
uncorruptness,	1
gravity,	1
sincerity,	1
2:8	1
Sound	1
speech,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
condemned;	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
contrary	1
part	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
having	1
no	1
evil	1
thing	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
2:9	1
Exhort	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
masters,	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
them	1
well	1
in	1
all	1
things;	1
not	1
answering	1
again;	1
2:10	1
Not	1
purloining,	1
but	1
shewing	1
all	1
good	1
fidelity;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
adorn	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
bringeth	1
salvation	1
hath	1
appeared	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
2:12	1
Teaching	1
us	1
that,	1
denying	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
worldly	1
lusts,	1
we	1
should	1
live	1
soberly,	1
righteously,	1
and	1
godly,	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
world;	1
2:13	1
Looking	1
for	1
that	1
blessed	1
hope,	1
and	1
the	1
glorious	1
appearing	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
2:14	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
redeem	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
purify	1
unto	1
himself	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people,	1
zealous	1
of	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
2:15	1
These	1
things	1
speak,	1
and	1
exhort,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
with	1
all	1
authority.	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
despise	1
thee.	1
	1
3:1	1
Put	1
them	1
in	1
mind	1
to	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers,	1
to	1
obey	1
magistrates,	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
every	1
good	1
work,	1
3:2	1
To	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
no	1
man,	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
brawlers,	1
but	1
gentle,	1
shewing	1
all	1
meekness	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
were	1
sometimes	1
foolish,	1
disobedient,	1
deceived,	1
serving	1
divers	1
lusts	1
and	1
pleasures,	1
living	1
in	1
malice	1
and	1
envy,	1
hateful,	1
and	1
hating	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
3:4	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
kindness	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour	1
toward	1
man	1
appeared,	1
3:5	1
Not	1
by	1
works	1
of	1
righteousness	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
done,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
mercy	1
he	1
saved	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
regeneration,	1
and	1
renewing	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost;	1
3:6	1
Which	1
he	1
shed	1
on	1
us	1
abundantly	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
3:7	1
That	1
being	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
grace,	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
heirs	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
3:8	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying,	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
thou	1
affirm	1
constantly,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
careful	1
to	1
maintain	1
good	1
works.	1
These	1
things	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
profitable	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
3:9	1
But	1
avoid	1
foolish	1
questions,	1
and	1
genealogies,	1
and	1
contentions,	1
and	1
strivings	1
about	1
the	1
law;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
unprofitable	1
and	1
vain.	1
	1
3:10	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
heretick	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
admonition	1
reject;	1
3:11	1
Knowing	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
such	1
is	1
subverted,	1
and	1
sinneth,	1
being	1
condemned	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
3:12	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
Artemas	1
unto	1
thee,	1
or	1
Tychicus,	1
be	1
diligent	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
Nicopolis:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
determined	1
there	1
to	1
winter.	1
	1
3:13	1
Bring	1
Zenas	1
the	1
lawyer	1
and	1
Apollos	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
diligently,	1
that	1
nothing	1
be	1
wanting	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
let	1
our's	1
also	1
learn	1
to	1
maintain	1
good	1
works	1
for	1
necessary	1
uses,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
3:15	1
All	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
salute	1
thee.	1
Greet	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
faith.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1

	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
Timothy	1
our	1
brother,	1
unto	1
Philemon	1
our	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
and	1
fellowlabourer,	1
1:2	1
And	1
to	1
our	1
beloved	1
Apphia,	1
and	1
Archippus	1
our	1
fellowsoldier,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
thy	1
house:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
thee	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers,	1
1:5	1
Hearing	1
of	1
thy	1
love	1
and	1
faith,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
toward	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
saints;	1
1:6	1
That	1
the	1
communication	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
may	1
become	1
effectual	1
by	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
and	1
consolation	1
in	1
thy	1
love,	1
because	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
are	1
refreshed	1
by	1
thee,	1
brother.	1
	1
1:8	1
Wherefore,	1
though	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
much	1
bold	1
in	1
Christ	1
to	1
enjoin	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
convenient,	1
1:9	1
Yet	1
for	1
love's	1
sake	1
I	1
rather	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
being	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
Paul	1
the	1
aged,	1
and	1
now	1
also	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:10	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee	1
for	1
my	1
son	1
Onesimus,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
begotten	1
in	1
my	1
bonds:	1
1:11	1
Which	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
was	1
to	1
thee	1
unprofitable,	1
but	1
now	1
profitable	1
to	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
me:	1
1:12	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
again:	1
thou	1
therefore	1
receive	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
mine	1
own	1
bowels:	1
1:13	1
Whom	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
retained	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
in	1
thy	1
stead	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
the	1
gospel:	1
1:14	1
But	1
without	1
thy	1
mind	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
nothing;	1
that	1
thy	1
benefit	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
necessity,	1
but	1
willingly.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
perhaps	1
he	1
therefore	1
departed	1
for	1
a	1
season,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
receive	1
him	1
for	1
ever;	1
1:16	1
Not	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
servant,	1
but	1
above	1
a	1
servant,	1
a	1
brother	1
beloved,	1
specially	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
unto	1
thee,	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
1:17	1
If	1
thou	1
count	1
me	1
therefore	1
a	1
partner,	1
receive	1
him	1
as	1
myself.	1
	1
1:18	1
If	1
he	1
hath	1
wronged	1
thee,	1
or	1
oweth	1
thee	1
ought,	1
put	1
that	1
on	1
mine	1
account;	1
1:19	1
I	1
Paul	1
have	1
written	1
it	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand,	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
it:	1
albeit	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
thee	1
how	1
thou	1
owest	1
unto	1
me	1
even	1
thine	1
own	1
self	1
besides.	1
	1
1:20	1
Yea,	1
brother,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
joy	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
refresh	1
my	1
bowels	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:21	1
Having	1
confidence	1
in	1
thy	1
obedience	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
thee,	1
knowing	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
also	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
say.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
withal	1
prepare	1
me	1
also	1
a	1
lodging:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
prayers	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:23	1
There	1
salute	1
thee	1
Epaphras,	1
my	1
fellowprisoner	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
1:24	1
Marcus,	1
Aristarchus,	1
Demas,	1
Lucas,	1
my	1
fellowlabourers.	1
	1
1:25	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
spirit.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
God,	1
who	1
at	1
sundry	1
times	1
and	1
in	1
divers	1
manners	1
spake	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
1:2	1
Hath	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
spoken	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Son,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
appointed	1
heir	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
by	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
worlds;	1
1:3	1
Who	1
being	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
express	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
person,	1
and	1
upholding	1
all	1
things	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
power,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
by	1
himself	1
purged	1
our	1
sins,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Majesty	1
on	1
high:	1
1:4	1
Being	1
made	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
angels,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
by	1
inheritance	1
obtained	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
name	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
unto	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee?	1
And	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
Son?	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
again,	1
when	1
he	1
bringeth	1
in	1
the	1
firstbegotten	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
saith,	1
And	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
he	1
saith,	1
Who	1
maketh	1
his	1
angels	1
spirits,	1
and	1
his	1
ministers	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
he	1
saith,	1
Thy	1
throne,	1
O	1
God,	1
is	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
a	1
sceptre	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
1:9	1
Thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
hated	1
iniquity;	1
therefore	1
God,	1
even	1
thy	1
God,	1
hath	1
anointed	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
gladness	1
above	1
thy	1
fellows.	1
	1
1:10	1
And,	1
Thou,	1
Lord,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
hast	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thine	1
hands:	1
1:11	1
They	1
shall	1
perish;	1
but	1
thou	1
remainest;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
as	1
doth	1
a	1
garment;	1
1:12	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
vesture	1
shalt	1
thou	1
fold	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
changed:	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
thy	1
years	1
shall	1
not	1
fail.	1
	1
1:13	1
But	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
Sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
until	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool?	1
	1
1:14	1
Are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
ministering	1
spirits,	1
sent	1
forth	1
to	1
minister	1
for	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
heirs	1
of	1
salvation?	1
	1
2:1	1
Therefore	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
more	1
earnest	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
we	1
should	1
let	1
them	1
slip.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
word	1
spoken	1
by	1
angels	1
was	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
every	1
transgression	1
and	1
disobedience	1
received	1
a	1
just	1
recompence	1
of	1
reward;	1
2:3	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
escape,	1
if	1
we	1
neglect	1
so	1
great	1
salvation;	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
was	1
confirmed	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
him;	1
2:4	1
God	1
also	1
bearing	1
them	1
witness,	1
both	1
with	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
and	1
with	1
divers	1
miracles,	1
and	1
gifts	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
will?	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
unto	1
the	1
angels	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
put	1
in	1
subjection	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come,	1
whereof	1
we	1
speak.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place	1
testified,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
mindful	1
of	1
him?	1
or	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
thou	1
visitest	1
him?	1
2:7	1
Thou	1
madest	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels;	1
thou	1
crownedst	1
him	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
didst	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thy	1
hands:	1
2:8	1
Thou	1
hast	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
subjection	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
all	1
in	1
subjection	1
under	1
him,	1
he	1
left	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
put	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
not	1
yet	1
all	1
things	1
put	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
we	1
see	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels	1
for	1
the	1
suffering	1
of	1
death,	1
crowned	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour;	1
that	1
he	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
taste	1
death	1
for	1
every	1
man.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
it	1
became	1
him,	1
for	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
in	1
bringing	1
many	1
sons	1
unto	1
glory,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
salvation	1
perfect	1
through	1
sufferings.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
sanctified	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
one:	1
for	1
which	1
cause	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
brethren,	1
2:12	1
Saying,	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
praise	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
And	1
again,	1
Behold	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me.	1
	1
2:14	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
he	1
also	1
himself	1
likewise	1
took	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
same;	1
that	1
through	1
death	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
death,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
devil;	1
2:15	1
And	1
deliver	1
them	1
who	1
through	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
were	1
all	1
their	1
lifetime	1
subject	1
to	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
verily	1
he	1
took	1
not	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
angels;	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
2:17	1
Wherefore	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
it	1
behoved	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
merciful	1
and	1
faithful	1
high	1
priest	1
in	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
God,	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
hath	1
suffered	1
being	1
tempted,	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
succour	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
tempted.	1
	1
3:1	1
Wherefore,	1
holy	1
brethren,	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
calling,	1
consider	1
the	1
Apostle	1
and	1
High	1
Priest	1
of	1
our	1
profession,	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
3:2	1
Who	1
was	1
faithful	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
appointed	1
him,	1
as	1
also	1
Moses	1
was	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
more	1
glory	1
than	1
Moses,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
who	1
hath	1
builded	1
the	1
house	1
hath	1
more	1
honour	1
than	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
every	1
house	1
is	1
builded	1
by	1
some	1
man;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
built	1
all	1
things	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
verily	1
was	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
as	1
a	1
servant,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
after;	1
3:6	1
But	1
Christ	1
as	1
a	1
son	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
whose	1
house	1
are	1
we,	1
if	1
we	1
hold	1
fast	1
the	1
confidence	1
and	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
firm	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
3:7	1
Wherefore	1
(as	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
saith,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
3:8	1
Harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
temptation	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
3:9	1
When	1
your	1
fathers	1
tempted	1
me,	1
proved	1
me,	1
and	1
saw	1
my	1
works	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
3:10	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
was	1
grieved	1
with	1
that	1
generation,	1
and	1
said,	1
They	1
do	1
alway	1
err	1
in	1
their	1
heart;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
my	1
ways.	1
	1
3:11	1
So	1
I	1
sware	1
in	1
my	1
wrath,	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.)	1
	1
3:12	1
Take	1
heed,	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
an	1
evil	1
heart	1
of	1
unbelief,	1
in	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
exhort	1
one	1
another	1
daily,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
To	1
day;	1
lest	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
hardened	1
through	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
Christ,	1
if	1
we	1
hold	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
our	1
confidence	1
stedfast	1
unto	1
the	1
end;	1
3:15	1
While	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
some,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard,	1
did	1
provoke:	1
howbeit	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
Moses.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
with	1
whom	1
was	1
he	1
grieved	1
forty	1
years?	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
sinned,	1
whose	1
carcases	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
to	1
whom	1
sware	1
he	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not?	1
	1
3:19	1
So	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief.	1
	1
4:1	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
fear,	1
lest,	1
a	1
promise	1
being	1
left	1
us	1
of	1
entering	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
seem	1
to	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
unto	1
us	1
was	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
preached	1
did	1
not	1
profit	1
them,	1
not	1
being	1
mixed	1
with	1
faith	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
we	1
which	1
have	1
believed	1
do	1
enter	1
into	1
rest,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
in	1
my	1
wrath,	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest:	1
although	1
the	1
works	1
were	1
finished	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
And	1
God	1
did	1
rest	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
again,	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.	1
	1
4:6	1
Seeing	1
therefore	1
it	1
remaineth	1
that	1
some	1
must	1
enter	1
therein,	1
and	1
they	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
first	1
preached	1
entered	1
not	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief:	1
4:7	1
Again,	1
he	1
limiteth	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
saying	1
in	1
David,	1
To	1
day,	1
after	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
time;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
if	1
Jesus	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
rest,	1
then	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
afterward	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
another	1
day.	1
	1
4:9	1
There	1
remaineth	1
therefore	1
a	1
rest	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
he	1
also	1
hath	1
ceased	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
works,	1
as	1
God	1
did	1
from	1
his.	1
	1
4:11	1
Let	1
us	1
labour	1
therefore	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
that	1
rest,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
fall	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
example	1
of	1
unbelief.	1
	1
4:12	1
For	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
quick,	1
and	1
powerful,	1
and	1
sharper	1
than	1
any	1
twoedged	1
sword,	1
piercing	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dividing	1
asunder	1
of	1
soul	1
and	1
spirit,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
joints	1
and	1
marrow,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
discerner	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
intents	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
4:13	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
creature	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
manifest	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
naked	1
and	1
opened	1
unto	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
4:14	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
high	1
priest,	1
that	1
is	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
heavens,	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
let	1
us	1
hold	1
fast	1
our	1
profession.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
our	1
infirmities;	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
points	1
tempted	1
like	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
yet	1
without	1
sin.	1
	1
4:16	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
come	1
boldly	1
unto	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
grace,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
obtain	1
mercy,	1
and	1
find	1
grace	1
to	1
help	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
need.	1
	1
5:1	1
For	1
every	1
high	1
priest	1
taken	1
from	1
among	1
men	1
is	1
ordained	1
for	1
men	1
in	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
offer	1
both	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
sins:	1
5:2	1
Who	1
can	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
ignorant,	1
and	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
also	1
is	1
compassed	1
with	1
infirmity.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
by	1
reason	1
hereof	1
he	1
ought,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
so	1
also	1
for	1
himself,	1
to	1
offer	1
for	1
sins.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
this	1
honour	1
unto	1
himself,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
was	1
Aaron.	1
	1
5:5	1
So	1
also	1
Christ	1
glorified	1
not	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
an	1
high	1
priest;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
to	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
5:6	1
As	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
5:7	1
Who	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
up	1
prayers	1
and	1
supplications	1
with	1
strong	1
crying	1
and	1
tears	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
feared;	1
5:8	1
Though	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
Son,	1
yet	1
learned	1
he	1
obedience	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
suffered;	1
5:9	1
And	1
being	1
made	1
perfect,	1
he	1
became	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
eternal	1
salvation	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
him;	1
5:10	1
Called	1
of	1
God	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
5:11	1
Of	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
uttered,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
when	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
teachers,	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
that	1
one	1
teach	1
you	1
again	1
which	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
strong	1
meat.	1
	1
5:13	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
useth	1
milk	1
is	1
unskilful	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
babe.	1
	1
5:14	1
But	1
strong	1
meat	1
belongeth	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
full	1
age,	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
use	1
have	1
their	1
senses	1
exercised	1
to	1
discern	1
both	1
good	1
and	1
evil.	1
	1
6:1	1
Therefore	1
leaving	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
on	1
unto	1
perfection;	1
not	1
laying	1
again	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
repentance	1
from	1
dead	1
works,	1
and	1
of	1
faith	1
toward	1
God,	1
6:2	1
Of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
baptisms,	1
and	1
of	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
hands,	1
and	1
of	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
of	1
eternal	1
judgment.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
this	1
will	1
we	1
do,	1
if	1
God	1
permit.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
once	1
enlightened,	1
and	1
have	1
tasted	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
gift,	1
and	1
were	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
6:5	1
And	1
have	1
tasted	1
the	1
good	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come,	1
6:6	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
away,	1
to	1
renew	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
repentance;	1
seeing	1
they	1
crucify	1
to	1
themselves	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
afresh,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
shame.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
drinketh	1
in	1
the	1
rain	1
that	1
cometh	1
oft	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
herbs	1
meet	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
dressed,	1
receiveth	1
blessing	1
from	1
God:	1
6:8	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
beareth	1
thorns	1
and	1
briers	1
is	1
rejected,	1
and	1
is	1
nigh	1
unto	1
cursing;	1
whose	1
end	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
burned.	1
	1
6:9	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
we	1
are	1
persuaded	1
better	1
things	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
things	1
that	1
accompany	1
salvation,	1
though	1
we	1
thus	1
speak.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
unrighteous	1
to	1
forget	1
your	1
work	1
and	1
labour	1
of	1
love,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
shewed	1
toward	1
his	1
name,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
ministered	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
do	1
minister.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
we	1
desire	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
do	1
shew	1
the	1
same	1
diligence	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
hope	1
unto	1
the	1
end:	1
6:12	1
That	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
slothful,	1
but	1
followers	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
through	1
faith	1
and	1
patience	1
inherit	1
the	1
promises.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
when	1
God	1
made	1
promise	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
swear	1
by	1
no	1
greater,	1
he	1
sware	1
by	1
himself,	1
6:14	1
Saying,	1
Surely	1
blessing	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
multiplying	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
thee.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
so,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
patiently	1
endured,	1
he	1
obtained	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
6:16	1
For	1
men	1
verily	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
greater:	1
and	1
an	1
oath	1
for	1
confirmation	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
strife.	1
	1
6:17	1
Wherein	1
God,	1
willing	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
heirs	1
of	1
promise	1
the	1
immutability	1
of	1
his	1
counsel,	1
confirmed	1
it	1
by	1
an	1
oath:	1
6:18	1
That	1
by	1
two	1
immutable	1
things,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
God	1
to	1
lie,	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
consolation,	1
who	1
have	1
fled	1
for	1
refuge	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
hope	1
set	1
before	1
us:	1
6:19	1
Which	1
hope	1
we	1
have	1
as	1
an	1
anchor	1
of	1
the	1
soul,	1
both	1
sure	1
and	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
which	1
entereth	1
into	1
that	1
within	1
the	1
veil;	1
6:20	1
Whither	1
the	1
forerunner	1
is	1
for	1
us	1
entered,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
made	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
7:1	1
For	1
this	1
Melchisedec,	1
king	1
of	1
Salem,	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
who	1
met	1
Abraham	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
kings,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him;	1
7:2	1
To	1
whom	1
also	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
all;	1
first	1
being	1
by	1
interpretation	1
King	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
also	1
King	1
of	1
Salem,	1
which	1
is,	1
King	1
of	1
peace;	1
7:3	1
Without	1
father,	1
without	1
mother,	1
without	1
descent,	1
having	1
neither	1
beginning	1
of	1
days,	1
nor	1
end	1
of	1
life;	1
but	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
abideth	1
a	1
priest	1
continually.	1
	1
7:4	1
Now	1
consider	1
how	1
great	1
this	1
man	1
was,	1
unto	1
whom	1
even	1
the	1
patriarch	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
the	1
spoils.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
verily	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
who	1
receive	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
priesthood,	1
have	1
a	1
commandment	1
to	1
take	1
tithes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
their	1
brethren,	1
though	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Abraham:	1
7:6	1
But	1
he	1
whose	1
descent	1
is	1
not	1
counted	1
from	1
them	1
received	1
tithes	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
promises.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
without	1
all	1
contradiction	1
the	1
less	1
is	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
better.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
here	1
men	1
that	1
die	1
receive	1
tithes;	1
but	1
there	1
he	1
receiveth	1
them,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
witnessed	1
that	1
he	1
liveth.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
say,	1
Levi	1
also,	1
who	1
receiveth	1
tithes,	1
payed	1
tithes	1
in	1
Abraham.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
when	1
Melchisedec	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
7:11	1
If	1
therefore	1
perfection	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
Levitical	1
priesthood,	1
(for	1
under	1
it	1
the	1
people	1
received	1
the	1
law,)	1
what	1
further	1
need	1
was	1
there	1
that	1
another	1
priest	1
should	1
rise	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Aaron?	1
	1
7:12	1
For	1
the	1
priesthood	1
being	1
changed,	1
there	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
necessity	1
a	1
change	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
7:13	1
For	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
spoken	1
pertaineth	1
to	1
another	1
tribe,	1
of	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
gave	1
attendance	1
at	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
our	1
Lord	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
Juda;	1
of	1
which	1
tribe	1
Moses	1
spake	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
priesthood.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
far	1
more	1
evident:	1
for	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
Melchisedec	1
there	1
ariseth	1
another	1
priest,	1
7:16	1
Who	1
is	1
made,	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
a	1
carnal	1
commandment,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
an	1
endless	1
life.	1
	1
7:17	1
For	1
he	1
testifieth,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
7:18	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
verily	1
a	1
disannulling	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
going	1
before	1
for	1
the	1
weakness	1
and	1
unprofitableness	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
made	1
nothing	1
perfect,	1
but	1
the	1
bringing	1
in	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
hope	1
did;	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
we	1
draw	1
nigh	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
oath	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
priest:	1
7:21	1
(For	1
those	1
priests	1
were	1
made	1
without	1
an	1
oath;	1
but	1
this	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Lord	1
sware	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
repent,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec:)	1
7:22	1
By	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
Jesus	1
made	1
a	1
surety	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
testament.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
they	1
truly	1
were	1
many	1
priests,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
suffered	1
to	1
continue	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
death:	1
7:24	1
But	1
this	1
man,	1
because	1
he	1
continueth	1
ever,	1
hath	1
an	1
unchangeable	1
priesthood.	1
	1
7:25	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
that	1
come	1
unto	1
God	1
by	1
him,	1
seeing	1
he	1
ever	1
liveth	1
to	1
make	1
intercession	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
7:26	1
For	1
such	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
became	1
us,	1
who	1
is	1
holy,	1
harmless,	1
undefiled,	1
separate	1
from	1
sinners,	1
and	1
made	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
heavens;	1
7:27	1
Who	1
needeth	1
not	1
daily,	1
as	1
those	1
high	1
priests,	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
sacrifice,	1
first	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sins,	1
and	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
people's:	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
once,	1
when	1
he	1
offered	1
up	1
himself.	1
	1
7:28	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
maketh	1
men	1
high	1
priests	1
which	1
have	1
infirmity;	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
oath,	1
which	1
was	1
since	1
the	1
law,	1
maketh	1
the	1
Son,	1
who	1
is	1
consecrated	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
8:1	1
Now	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
spoken	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sum:	1
We	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
high	1
priest,	1
who	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
Majesty	1
in	1
the	1
heavens;	1
8:2	1
A	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
tabernacle,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
pitched,	1
and	1
not	1
man.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
every	1
high	1
priest	1
is	1
ordained	1
to	1
offer	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices:	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
necessity	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
have	1
somewhat	1
also	1
to	1
offer.	1
	1
8:4	1
For	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
on	1
earth,	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
priest,	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
priests	1
that	1
offer	1
gifts	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law:	1
8:5	1
Who	1
serve	1
unto	1
the	1
example	1
and	1
shadow	1
of	1
heavenly	1
things,	1
as	1
Moses	1
was	1
admonished	1
of	1
God	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
for,	1
See,	1
saith	1
he,	1
that	1
thou	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
pattern	1
shewed	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
8:6	1
But	1
now	1
hath	1
he	1
obtained	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
ministry,	1
by	1
how	1
much	1
also	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
covenant,	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
upon	1
better	1
promises.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
if	1
that	1
first	1
covenant	1
had	1
been	1
faultless,	1
then	1
should	1
no	1
place	1
have	1
been	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
8:8	1
For	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
when	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
8:9	1
Not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
because	1
they	1
continued	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
covenant,	1
and	1
I	1
regarded	1
them	1
not,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
after	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
laws	1
into	1
their	1
mind,	1
and	1
write	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hearts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
people:	1
8:11	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
teach	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
Know	1
the	1
Lord:	1
for	1
all	1
shall	1
know	1
me,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
their	1
unrighteousness,	1
and	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
their	1
iniquities	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
8:13	1
In	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
A	1
new	1
covenant,	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
first	1
old.	1
Now	1
that	1
which	1
decayeth	1
and	1
waxeth	1
old	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
vanish	1
away.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
verily	1
the	1
first	1
covenant	1
had	1
also	1
ordinances	1
of	1
divine	1
service,	1
and	1
a	1
worldly	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
9:2	1
For	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
made;	1
the	1
first,	1
wherein	1
was	1
the	1
candlestick,	1
and	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
shewbread;	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
second	1
veil,	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Holiest	1
of	1
all;	1
9:4	1
Which	1
had	1
the	1
golden	1
censer,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
overlaid	1
round	1
about	1
with	1
gold,	1
wherein	1
was	1
the	1
golden	1
pot	1
that	1
had	1
manna,	1
and	1
Aaron's	1
rod	1
that	1
budded,	1
and	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
covenant;	1
9:5	1
And	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
cherubims	1
of	1
glory	1
shadowing	1
the	1
mercyseat;	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
now	1
speak	1
particularly.	1
	1
9:6	1
Now	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
thus	1
ordained,	1
the	1
priests	1
went	1
always	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
tabernacle,	1
accomplishing	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:7	1
But	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
went	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
alone	1
once	1
every	1
year,	1
not	1
without	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
offered	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
errors	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
9:8	1
The	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
this	1
signifying,	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
holiest	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
made	1
manifest,	1
while	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
tabernacle	1
was	1
yet	1
standing:	1
9:9	1
Which	1
was	1
a	1
figure	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
then	1
present,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
offered	1
both	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices,	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
service	1
perfect,	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
conscience;	1
9:10	1
Which	1
stood	1
only	1
in	1
meats	1
and	1
drinks,	1
and	1
divers	1
washings,	1
and	1
carnal	1
ordinances,	1
imposed	1
on	1
them	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
reformation.	1
	1
9:11	1
But	1
Christ	1
being	1
come	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
by	1
a	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
perfect	1
tabernacle,	1
not	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
building;	1
9:12	1
Neither	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
goats	1
and	1
calves,	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
blood	1
he	1
entered	1
in	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
having	1
obtained	1
eternal	1
redemption	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:13	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
and	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
an	1
heifer	1
sprinkling	1
the	1
unclean,	1
sanctifieth	1
to	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
flesh:	1
9:14	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
through	1
the	1
eternal	1
Spirit	1
offered	1
himself	1
without	1
spot	1
to	1
God,	1
purge	1
your	1
conscience	1
from	1
dead	1
works	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
living	1
God?	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
that	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
death,	1
for	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
transgressions	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
testament,	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
eternal	1
inheritance.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
where	1
a	1
testament	1
is,	1
there	1
must	1
also	1
of	1
necessity	1
be	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
testator.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
a	1
testament	1
is	1
of	1
force	1
after	1
men	1
are	1
dead:	1
otherwise	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
strength	1
at	1
all	1
while	1
the	1
testator	1
liveth.	1
	1
9:18	1
Whereupon	1
neither	1
the	1
first	1
testament	1
was	1
dedicated	1
without	1
blood.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
when	1
Moses	1
had	1
spoken	1
every	1
precept	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
calves	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
scarlet	1
wool,	1
and	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
both	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
9:20	1
Saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
testament	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
enjoined	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:21	1
Moreover	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
blood	1
both	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
ministry.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
almost	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
purged	1
with	1
blood;	1
and	1
without	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
is	1
no	1
remission.	1
	1
9:23	1
It	1
was	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
patterns	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
should	1
be	1
purified	1
with	1
these;	1
but	1
the	1
heavenly	1
things	1
themselves	1
with	1
better	1
sacrifices	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
9:24	1
For	1
Christ	1
is	1
not	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
places	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
the	1
true;	1
but	1
into	1
heaven	1
itself,	1
now	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
us:	1
9:25	1
Nor	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offer	1
himself	1
often,	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
entereth	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
every	1
year	1
with	1
blood	1
of	1
others;	1
9:26	1
For	1
then	1
must	1
he	1
often	1
have	1
suffered	1
since	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
but	1
now	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
sin	1
by	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
appointed	1
unto	1
men	1
once	1
to	1
die,	1
but	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
judgment:	1
9:28	1
So	1
Christ	1
was	1
once	1
offered	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
many;	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
shall	1
he	1
appear	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
without	1
sin	1
unto	1
salvation.	1
	1
10:1	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
having	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
things,	1
can	1
never	1
with	1
those	1
sacrifices	1
which	1
they	1
offered	1
year	1
by	1
year	1
continually	1
make	1
the	1
comers	1
thereunto	1
perfect.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
then	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
offered?	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
worshippers	1
once	1
purged	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
conscience	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
10:3	1
But	1
in	1
those	1
sacrifices	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
remembrance	1
again	1
made	1
of	1
sins	1
every	1
year.	1
	1
10:4	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
of	1
goats	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
sins.	1
	1
10:5	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not,	1
but	1
a	1
body	1
hast	1
thou	1
prepared	1
me:	1
10:6	1
In	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
sin	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure.	1
	1
10:7	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
(in	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
me,)	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
God.	1
	1
10:8	1
Above	1
when	1
he	1
said,	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
offering	1
for	1
sin	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not,	1
neither	1
hadst	1
pleasure	1
therein;	1
which	1
are	1
offered	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
10:9	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
God.	1
He	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
establish	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
10:10	1
By	1
the	1
which	1
will	1
we	1
are	1
sanctified	1
through	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
once	1
for	1
all.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
every	1
priest	1
standeth	1
daily	1
ministering	1
and	1
offering	1
oftentimes	1
the	1
same	1
sacrifices,	1
which	1
can	1
never	1
take	1
away	1
sins:	1
10:12	1
But	1
this	1
man,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
one	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sins	1
for	1
ever,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God;	1
10:13	1
From	1
henceforth	1
expecting	1
till	1
his	1
enemies	1
be	1
made	1
his	1
footstool.	1
	1
10:14	1
For	1
by	1
one	1
offering	1
he	1
hath	1
perfected	1
for	1
ever	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified.	1
	1
10:15	1
Whereof	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
also	1
is	1
a	1
witness	1
to	1
us:	1
for	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
10:16	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
them	1
after	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
laws	1
into	1
their	1
hearts,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
will	1
I	1
write	1
them;	1
10:17	1
And	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
10:18	1
Now	1
where	1
remission	1
of	1
these	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
offering	1
for	1
sin.	1
	1
10:19	1
Having	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
boldness	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
holiest	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
10:20	1
By	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
living	1
way,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
consecrated	1
for	1
us,	1
through	1
the	1
veil,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
his	1
flesh;	1
10:21	1
And	1
having	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God;	1
10:22	1
Let	1
us	1
draw	1
near	1
with	1
a	1
true	1
heart	1
in	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
faith,	1
having	1
our	1
hearts	1
sprinkled	1
from	1
an	1
evil	1
conscience,	1
and	1
our	1
bodies	1
washed	1
with	1
pure	1
water.	1
	1
10:23	1
Let	1
us	1
hold	1
fast	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
our	1
faith	1
without	1
wavering;	1
(for	1
he	1
is	1
faithful	1
that	1
promised;)	1
10:24	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
provoke	1
unto	1
love	1
and	1
to	1
good	1
works:	1
10:25	1
Not	1
forsaking	1
the	1
assembling	1
of	1
ourselves	1
together,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
some	1
is;	1
but	1
exhorting	1
one	1
another:	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more,	1
as	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
day	1
approaching.	1
	1
10:26	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
sin	1
wilfully	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
there	1
remaineth	1
no	1
more	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sins,	1
10:27	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
fearful	1
looking	1
for	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
fiery	1
indignation,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
adversaries.	1
	1
10:28	1
He	1
that	1
despised	1
Moses'	1
law	1
died	1
without	1
mercy	1
under	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses:	1
10:29	1
Of	1
how	1
much	1
sorer	1
punishment,	1
suppose	1
ye,	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
thought	1
worthy,	1
who	1
hath	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
hath	1
counted	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
sanctified,	1
an	1
unholy	1
thing,	1
and	1
hath	1
done	1
despite	1
unto	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
grace?	1
10:30	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
said,	1
Vengeance	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
recompense,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
And	1
again,	1
The	1
Lord	1
shall	1
judge	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
10:31	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
fearful	1
thing	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
But	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
former	1
days,	1
in	1
which,	1
after	1
ye	1
were	1
illuminated,	1
ye	1
endured	1
a	1
great	1
fight	1
of	1
afflictions;	1
10:33	1
Partly,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
a	1
gazingstock	1
both	1
by	1
reproaches	1
and	1
afflictions;	1
and	1
partly,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
became	1
companions	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
used.	1
	1
10:34	1
For	1
ye	1
had	1
compassion	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
bonds,	1
and	1
took	1
joyfully	1
the	1
spoiling	1
of	1
your	1
goods,	1
knowing	1
in	1
yourselves	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
in	1
heaven	1
a	1
better	1
and	1
an	1
enduring	1
substance.	1
	1
10:35	1
Cast	1
not	1
away	1
therefore	1
your	1
confidence,	1
which	1
hath	1
great	1
recompence	1
of	1
reward.	1
	1
10:36	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
patience,	1
that,	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
10:37	1
For	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
will	1
come,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
tarry.	1
	1
10:38	1
Now	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith:	1
but	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
draw	1
back,	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
draw	1
back	1
unto	1
perdition;	1
but	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
to	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
the	1
soul.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
faith	1
is	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
things	1
hoped	1
for,	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
seen.	1
	1
11:2	1
For	1
by	1
it	1
the	1
elders	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
report.	1
	1
11:3	1
Through	1
faith	1
we	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
worlds	1
were	1
framed	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
so	1
that	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen	1
were	1
not	1
made	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
do	1
appear.	1
	1
11:4	1
By	1
faith	1
Abel	1
offered	1
unto	1
God	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
sacrifice	1
than	1
Cain,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
obtained	1
witness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
righteous,	1
God	1
testifying	1
of	1
his	1
gifts:	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
being	1
dead	1
yet	1
speaketh.	1
	1
11:5	1
By	1
faith	1
Enoch	1
was	1
translated	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
death;	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
found,	1
because	1
God	1
had	1
translated	1
him:	1
for	1
before	1
his	1
translation	1
he	1
had	1
this	1
testimony,	1
that	1
he	1
pleased	1
God.	1
	1
11:6	1
But	1
without	1
faith	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
please	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
God	1
must	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
rewarder	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
diligently	1
seek	1
him.	1
	1
11:7	1
By	1
faith	1
Noah,	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
seen	1
as	1
yet,	1
moved	1
with	1
fear,	1
prepared	1
an	1
ark	1
to	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
his	1
house;	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
condemned	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
became	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
11:8	1
By	1
faith	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
after	1
receive	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
obeyed;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whither	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
11:9	1
By	1
faith	1
he	1
sojourned	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
country,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
tabernacles	1
with	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
the	1
heirs	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
promise:	1
11:10	1
For	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
city	1
which	1
hath	1
foundations,	1
whose	1
builder	1
and	1
maker	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
11:11	1
Through	1
faith	1
also	1
Sara	1
herself	1
received	1
strength	1
to	1
conceive	1
seed,	1
and	1
was	1
delivered	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
past	1
age,	1
because	1
she	1
judged	1
him	1
faithful	1
who	1
had	1
promised.	1
	1
11:12	1
Therefore	1
sprang	1
there	1
even	1
of	1
one,	1
and	1
him	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
dead,	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
in	1
multitude,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
shore	1
innumerable.	1
	1
11:13	1
These	1
all	1
died	1
in	1
faith,	1
not	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
promises,	1
but	1
having	1
seen	1
them	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
were	1
persuaded	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them,	1
and	1
confessed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
strangers	1
and	1
pilgrims	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:14	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
say	1
such	1
things	1
declare	1
plainly	1
that	1
they	1
seek	1
a	1
country.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
truly,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
came	1
out,	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
opportunity	1
to	1
have	1
returned.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
desire	1
a	1
better	1
country,	1
that	1
is,	1
an	1
heavenly:	1
wherefore	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
city.	1
	1
11:17	1
By	1
faith	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tried,	1
offered	1
up	1
Isaac:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
promises	1
offered	1
up	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
son,	1
11:18	1
Of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
That	1
in	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called:	1
11:19	1
Accounting	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
up,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
from	1
whence	1
also	1
he	1
received	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
figure.	1
	1
11:20	1
By	1
faith	1
Isaac	1
blessed	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Esau	1
concerning	1
things	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
11:21	1
By	1
faith	1
Jacob,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
dying,	1
blessed	1
both	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joseph;	1
and	1
worshipped,	1
leaning	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
staff.	1
	1
11:22	1
By	1
faith	1
Joseph,	1
when	1
he	1
died,	1
made	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
departing	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
gave	1
commandment	1
concerning	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
11:23	1
By	1
faith	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
born,	1
was	1
hid	1
three	1
months	1
of	1
his	1
parents,	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
proper	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment.	1
	1
11:24	1
By	1
faith	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
years,	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter;	1
11:25	1
Choosing	1
rather	1
to	1
suffer	1
affliction	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God,	1
than	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
sin	1
for	1
a	1
season;	1
11:26	1
Esteeming	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
Christ	1
greater	1
riches	1
than	1
the	1
treasures	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
the	1
recompence	1
of	1
the	1
reward.	1
	1
11:27	1
By	1
faith	1
he	1
forsook	1
Egypt,	1
not	1
fearing	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
he	1
endured,	1
as	1
seeing	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
invisible.	1
	1
11:28	1
Through	1
faith	1
he	1
kept	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
the	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
blood,	1
lest	1
he	1
that	1
destroyed	1
the	1
firstborn	1
should	1
touch	1
them.	1
	1
11:29	1
By	1
faith	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
as	1
by	1
dry	1
land:	1
which	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
assaying	1
to	1
do	1
were	1
drowned.	1
	1
11:30	1
By	1
faith	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jericho	1
fell	1
down,	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
compassed	1
about	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
11:31	1
By	1
faith	1
the	1
harlot	1
Rahab	1
perished	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
spies	1
with	1
peace.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
more	1
say?	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
would	1
fail	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
Gedeon,	1
and	1
of	1
Barak,	1
and	1
of	1
Samson,	1
and	1
of	1
Jephthae;	1
of	1
David	1
also,	1
and	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
prophets:	1
11:33	1
Who	1
through	1
faith	1
subdued	1
kingdoms,	1
wrought	1
righteousness,	1
obtained	1
promises,	1
stopped	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
11:34	1
Quenched	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
fire,	1
escaped	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
out	1
of	1
weakness	1
were	1
made	1
strong,	1
waxed	1
valiant	1
in	1
fight,	1
turned	1
to	1
flight	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
aliens.	1
	1
11:35	1
Women	1
received	1
their	1
dead	1
raised	1
to	1
life	1
again:	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
tortured,	1
not	1
accepting	1
deliverance;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
obtain	1
a	1
better	1
resurrection:	1
11:36	1
And	1
others	1
had	1
trial	1
of	1
cruel	1
mockings	1
and	1
scourgings,	1
yea,	1
moreover	1
of	1
bonds	1
and	1
imprisonment:	1
11:37	1
They	1
were	1
stoned,	1
they	1
were	1
sawn	1
asunder,	1
were	1
tempted,	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
they	1
wandered	1
about	1
in	1
sheepskins	1
and	1
goatskins;	1
being	1
destitute,	1
afflicted,	1
tormented;	1
11:38	1
(Of	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
not	1
worthy:)	1
they	1
wandered	1
in	1
deserts,	1
and	1
in	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
dens	1
and	1
caves	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
these	1
all,	1
having	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
through	1
faith,	1
received	1
not	1
the	1
promise:	1
11:40	1
God	1
having	1
provided	1
some	1
better	1
thing	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
they	1
without	1
us	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
perfect.	1
	1
12:1	1
Wherefore	1
seeing	1
we	1
also	1
are	1
compassed	1
about	1
with	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
witnesses,	1
let	1
us	1
lay	1
aside	1
every	1
weight,	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
which	1
doth	1
so	1
easily	1
beset	1
us,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
run	1
with	1
patience	1
the	1
race	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
us,	1
12:2	1
Looking	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
the	1
author	1
and	1
finisher	1
of	1
our	1
faith;	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
before	1
him	1
endured	1
the	1
cross,	1
despising	1
the	1
shame,	1
and	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:3	1
For	1
consider	1
him	1
that	1
endured	1
such	1
contradiction	1
of	1
sinners	1
against	1
himself,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
wearied	1
and	1
faint	1
in	1
your	1
minds.	1
	1
12:4	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
resisted	1
unto	1
blood,	1
striving	1
against	1
sin.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
exhortation	1
which	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
unto	1
children,	1
My	1
son,	1
despise	1
not	1
thou	1
the	1
chastening	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
nor	1
faint	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
rebuked	1
of	1
him:	1
12:6	1
For	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
loveth	1
he	1
chasteneth,	1
and	1
scourgeth	1
every	1
son	1
whom	1
he	1
receiveth.	1
	1
12:7	1
If	1
ye	1
endure	1
chastening,	1
God	1
dealeth	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
with	1
sons;	1
for	1
what	1
son	1
is	1
he	1
whom	1
the	1
father	1
chasteneth	1
not?	1
	1
12:8	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
without	1
chastisement,	1
whereof	1
all	1
are	1
partakers,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
bastards,	1
and	1
not	1
sons.	1
	1
12:9	1
Furthermore	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
fathers	1
of	1
our	1
flesh	1
which	1
corrected	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
gave	1
them	1
reverence:	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
much	1
rather	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
spirits,	1
and	1
live?	1
	1
12:10	1
For	1
they	1
verily	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
chastened	1
us	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
pleasure;	1
but	1
he	1
for	1
our	1
profit,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
12:11	1
Now	1
no	1
chastening	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
joyous,	1
but	1
grievous:	1
nevertheless	1
afterward	1
it	1
yieldeth	1
the	1
peaceable	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
exercised	1
thereby.	1
	1
12:12	1
Wherefore	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
hands	1
which	1
hang	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
feeble	1
knees;	1
12:13	1
And	1
make	1
straight	1
paths	1
for	1
your	1
feet,	1
lest	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lame	1
be	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
but	1
let	1
it	1
rather	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
12:14	1
Follow	1
peace	1
with	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
holiness,	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Lord:	1
12:15	1
Looking	1
diligently	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
fail	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God;	1
lest	1
any	1
root	1
of	1
bitterness	1
springing	1
up	1
trouble	1
you,	1
and	1
thereby	1
many	1
be	1
defiled;	1
12:16	1
Lest	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
fornicator,	1
or	1
profane	1
person,	1
as	1
Esau,	1
who	1
for	1
one	1
morsel	1
of	1
meat	1
sold	1
his	1
birthright.	1
	1
12:17	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
afterward,	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
inherited	1
the	1
blessing,	1
he	1
was	1
rejected:	1
for	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
place	1
of	1
repentance,	1
though	1
he	1
sought	1
it	1
carefully	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
12:18	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
touched,	1
and	1
that	1
burned	1
with	1
fire,	1
nor	1
unto	1
blackness,	1
and	1
darkness,	1
and	1
tempest,	1
12:19	1
And	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
words;	1
which	1
voice	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
intreated	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
spoken	1
to	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
12:20	1
(For	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
commanded,	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
beast	1
touch	1
the	1
mountain,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
stoned,	1
or	1
thrust	1
through	1
with	1
a	1
dart:	1
12:21	1
And	1
so	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
sight,	1
that	1
Moses	1
said,	1
I	1
exceedingly	1
fear	1
and	1
quake:)	1
12:22	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
the	1
heavenly	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
innumerable	1
company	1
of	1
angels,	1
12:23	1
To	1
the	1
general	1
assembly	1
and	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
just	1
men	1
made	1
perfect,	1
12:24	1
And	1
to	1
Jesus	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
covenant,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
sprinkling,	1
that	1
speaketh	1
better	1
things	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
Abel.	1
	1
12:25	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
refuse	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh.	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
escaped	1
not	1
who	1
refused	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
on	1
earth,	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
not	1
we	1
escape,	1
if	1
we	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
from	1
heaven:	1
12:26	1
Whose	1
voice	1
then	1
shook	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
hath	1
promised,	1
saying,	1
Yet	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
shake	1
not	1
the	1
earth	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
this	1
word,	1
Yet	1
once	1
more,	1
signifieth	1
the	1
removing	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
shaken,	1
as	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
made,	1
that	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
shaken	1
may	1
remain.	1
	1
12:28	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
receiving	1
a	1
kingdom	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
moved,	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
grace,	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
serve	1
God	1
acceptably	1
with	1
reverence	1
and	1
godly	1
fear:	1
12:29	1
For	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
consuming	1
fire.	1
	1
13:1	1
Let	1
brotherly	1
love	1
continue.	1
	1
13:2	1
Be	1
not	1
forgetful	1
to	1
entertain	1
strangers:	1
for	1
thereby	1
some	1
have	1
entertained	1
angels	1
unawares.	1
	1
13:3	1
Remember	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
bonds,	1
as	1
bound	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
suffer	1
adversity,	1
as	1
being	1
yourselves	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
13:4	1
Marriage	1
is	1
honourable	1
in	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
bed	1
undefiled:	1
but	1
whoremongers	1
and	1
adulterers	1
God	1
will	1
judge.	1
	1
13:5	1
Let	1
your	1
conversation	1
be	1
without	1
covetousness;	1
and	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
ye	1
have:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
leave	1
thee,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
thee.	1
	1
13:6	1
So	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
boldly	1
say,	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
my	1
helper,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
fear	1
what	1
man	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
13:7	1
Remember	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
whose	1
faith	1
follow,	1
considering	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
conversation.	1
	1
13:8	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
13:9	1
Be	1
not	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
divers	1
and	1
strange	1
doctrines.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
heart	1
be	1
established	1
with	1
grace;	1
not	1
with	1
meats,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
profited	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
occupied	1
therein.	1
	1
13:10	1
We	1
have	1
an	1
altar,	1
whereof	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
eat	1
which	1
serve	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
those	1
beasts,	1
whose	1
blood	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
for	1
sin,	1
are	1
burned	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
13:12	1
Wherefore	1
Jesus	1
also,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
sanctify	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
blood,	1
suffered	1
without	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
13:13	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
forth	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
bearing	1
his	1
reproach.	1
	1
13:14	1
For	1
here	1
have	1
we	1
no	1
continuing	1
city,	1
but	1
we	1
seek	1
one	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
13:15	1
By	1
him	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
offer	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
praise	1
to	1
God	1
continually,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
our	1
lips	1
giving	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
13:16	1
But	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
communicate	1
forget	1
not:	1
for	1
with	1
such	1
sacrifices	1
God	1
is	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
13:17	1
Obey	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
submit	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
they	1
watch	1
for	1
your	1
souls,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
must	1
give	1
account,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
grief:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
unprofitable	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
13:18	1
Pray	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
trust	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
conscience,	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
willing	1
to	1
live	1
honestly.	1
	1
13:19	1
But	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
the	1
rather	1
to	1
do	1
this,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
sooner.	1
	1
13:20	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace,	1
that	1
brought	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
great	1
shepherd	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
13:21	1
Make	1
you	1
perfect	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
will,	1
working	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
wellpleasing	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
suffer	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
exhortation:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
13:23	1
Know	1
ye	1
that	1
our	1
brother	1
Timothy	1
is	1
set	1
at	1
liberty;	1
with	1
whom,	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
shortly,	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
you.	1
	1
13:24	1
Salute	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
They	1
of	1
Italy	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
13:25	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
James	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
James,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
which	1
are	1
scattered	1
abroad,	1
greeting.	1
	1
1:2	1
My	1
brethren,	1
count	1
it	1
all	1
joy	1
when	1
ye	1
fall	1
into	1
divers	1
temptations;	1
1:3	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
trying	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
worketh	1
patience.	1
	1
1:4	1
But	1
let	1
patience	1
have	1
her	1
perfect	1
work,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
perfect	1
and	1
entire,	1
wanting	1
nothing.	1
	1
1:5	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
lack	1
wisdom,	1
let	1
him	1
ask	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
giveth	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
liberally,	1
and	1
upbraideth	1
not;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
1:6	1
But	1
let	1
him	1
ask	1
in	1
faith,	1
nothing	1
wavering.	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
wavereth	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
driven	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
tossed.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
let	1
not	1
that	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:8	1
A	1
double	1
minded	1
man	1
is	1
unstable	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
1:9	1
Let	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
low	1
degree	1
rejoice	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
exalted:	1
1:10	1
But	1
the	1
rich,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
made	1
low:	1
because	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
no	1
sooner	1
risen	1
with	1
a	1
burning	1
heat,	1
but	1
it	1
withereth	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
thereof	1
falleth,	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
it	1
perisheth:	1
so	1
also	1
shall	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
fade	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
1:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
endureth	1
temptation:	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
tried,	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
promised	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him.	1
	1
1:13	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
tempted,	1
I	1
am	1
tempted	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
God	1
cannot	1
be	1
tempted	1
with	1
evil,	1
neither	1
tempteth	1
he	1
any	1
man:	1
1:14	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
tempted,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
drawn	1
away	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
lust,	1
and	1
enticed.	1
	1
1:15	1
Then	1
when	1
lust	1
hath	1
conceived,	1
it	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
sin:	1
and	1
sin,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
finished,	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
death.	1
	1
1:16	1
Do	1
not	1
err,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren.	1
	1
1:17	1
Every	1
good	1
gift	1
and	1
every	1
perfect	1
gift	1
is	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
lights,	1
with	1
whom	1
is	1
no	1
variableness,	1
neither	1
shadow	1
of	1
turning.	1
	1
1:18	1
Of	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
begat	1
he	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
his	1
creatures.	1
	1
1:19	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
swift	1
to	1
hear,	1
slow	1
to	1
speak,	1
slow	1
to	1
wrath:	1
1:20	1
For	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
man	1
worketh	1
not	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:21	1
Wherefore	1
lay	1
apart	1
all	1
filthiness	1
and	1
superfluity	1
of	1
naughtiness,	1
and	1
receive	1
with	1
meekness	1
the	1
engrafted	1
word,	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
be	1
ye	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
not	1
hearers	1
only,	1
deceiving	1
your	1
own	1
selves.	1
	1
1:23	1
For	1
if	1
any	1
be	1
a	1
hearer	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
doer,	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
beholding	1
his	1
natural	1
face	1
in	1
a	1
glass:	1
1:24	1
For	1
he	1
beholdeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
goeth	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
straightway	1
forgetteth	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
1:25	1
But	1
whoso	1
looketh	1
into	1
the	1
perfect	1
law	1
of	1
liberty,	1
and	1
continueth	1
therein,	1
he	1
being	1
not	1
a	1
forgetful	1
hearer,	1
but	1
a	1
doer	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
this	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
in	1
his	1
deed.	1
	1
1:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
religious,	1
and	1
bridleth	1
not	1
his	1
tongue,	1
but	1
deceiveth	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
this	1
man's	1
religion	1
is	1
vain.	1
	1
1:27	1
Pure	1
religion	1
and	1
undefiled	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
this,	1
To	1
visit	1
the	1
fatherless	1
and	1
widows	1
in	1
their	1
affliction,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
unspotted	1
from	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
brethren,	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
glory,	1
with	1
respect	1
of	1
persons.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
come	1
unto	1
your	1
assembly	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
gold	1
ring,	1
in	1
goodly	1
apparel,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
also	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
in	1
vile	1
raiment;	1
2:3	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
weareth	1
the	1
gay	1
clothing,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
place;	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
Stand	1
thou	1
there,	1
or	1
sit	1
here	1
under	1
my	1
footstool:	1
2:4	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
then	1
partial	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
judges	1
of	1
evil	1
thoughts?	1
	1
2:5	1
Hearken,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
Hath	1
not	1
God	1
chosen	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
rich	1
in	1
faith,	1
and	1
heirs	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him?	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
poor.	1
Do	1
not	1
rich	1
men	1
oppress	1
you,	1
and	1
draw	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seats?	1
	1
2:7	1
Do	1
not	1
they	1
blaspheme	1
that	1
worthy	1
name	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
called?	1
	1
2:8	1
If	1
ye	1
fulfil	1
the	1
royal	1
law	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scripture,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself,	1
ye	1
do	1
well:	1
2:9	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
persons,	1
ye	1
commit	1
sin,	1
and	1
are	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
transgressors.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
whole	1
law,	1
and	1
yet	1
offend	1
in	1
one	1
point,	1
he	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
said,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
said	1
also,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill.	1
Now	1
if	1
thou	1
commit	1
no	1
adultery,	1
yet	1
if	1
thou	1
kill,	1
thou	1
art	1
become	1
a	1
transgressor	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:12	1
So	1
speak	1
ye,	1
and	1
so	1
do,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
liberty.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
judgment	1
without	1
mercy,	1
that	1
hath	1
shewed	1
no	1
mercy;	1
and	1
mercy	1
rejoiceth	1
against	1
judgment.	1
	1
2:14	1
What	1
doth	1
it	1
profit,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
say	1
he	1
hath	1
faith,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
works?	1
can	1
faith	1
save	1
him?	1
	1
2:15	1
If	1
a	1
brother	1
or	1
sister	1
be	1
naked,	1
and	1
destitute	1
of	1
daily	1
food,	1
2:16	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Depart	1
in	1
peace,	1
be	1
ye	1
warmed	1
and	1
filled;	1
notwithstanding	1
ye	1
give	1
them	1
not	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
needful	1
to	1
the	1
body;	1
what	1
doth	1
it	1
profit?	1
	1
2:17	1
Even	1
so	1
faith,	1
if	1
it	1
hath	1
not	1
works,	1
is	1
dead,	1
being	1
alone.	1
	1
2:18	1
Yea,	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
say,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
faith,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
works:	1
shew	1
me	1
thy	1
faith	1
without	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
my	1
faith	1
by	1
my	1
works.	1
	1
2:19	1
Thou	1
believest	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God;	1
thou	1
doest	1
well:	1
the	1
devils	1
also	1
believe,	1
and	1
tremble.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
wilt	1
thou	1
know,	1
O	1
vain	1
man,	1
that	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead?	1
2:21	1
Was	1
not	1
Abraham	1
our	1
father	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son	1
upon	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
2:22	1
Seest	1
thou	1
how	1
faith	1
wrought	1
with	1
his	1
works,	1
and	1
by	1
works	1
was	1
faith	1
made	1
perfect?	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
the	1
scripture	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
saith,	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Friend	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:24	1
Ye	1
see	1
then	1
how	1
that	1
by	1
works	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
justified,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
faith	1
only.	1
	1
2:25	1
Likewise	1
also	1
was	1
not	1
Rahab	1
the	1
harlot	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
messengers,	1
and	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
out	1
another	1
way?	1
2:26	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
without	1
the	1
spirit	1
is	1
dead,	1
so	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
3:1	1
My	1
brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
many	1
masters,	1
knowing	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
greater	1
condemnation.	1
	1
3:2	1
For	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
we	1
offend	1
all.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
offend	1
not	1
in	1
word,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
and	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
bridle	1
the	1
whole	1
body.	1
	1
3:3	1
Behold,	1
we	1
put	1
bits	1
in	1
the	1
horses'	1
mouths,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
obey	1
us;	1
and	1
we	1
turn	1
about	1
their	1
whole	1
body.	1
	1
3:4	1
Behold	1
also	1
the	1
ships,	1
which	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
so	1
great,	1
and	1
are	1
driven	1
of	1
fierce	1
winds,	1
yet	1
are	1
they	1
turned	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
helm,	1
whithersoever	1
the	1
governor	1
listeth.	1
	1
3:5	1
Even	1
so	1
the	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
member,	1
and	1
boasteth	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
Behold,	1
how	1
great	1
a	1
matter	1
a	1
little	1
fire	1
kindleth!	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
fire,	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
iniquity:	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
tongue	1
among	1
our	1
members,	1
that	1
it	1
defileth	1
the	1
whole	1
body,	1
and	1
setteth	1
on	1
fire	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
nature;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
of	1
hell.	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
birds,	1
and	1
of	1
serpents,	1
and	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
is	1
tamed,	1
and	1
hath	1
been	1
tamed	1
of	1
mankind:	1
3:8	1
But	1
the	1
tongue	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
tame;	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unruly	1
evil,	1
full	1
of	1
deadly	1
poison.	1
	1
3:9	1
Therewith	1
bless	1
we	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
therewith	1
curse	1
we	1
men,	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mouth	1
proceedeth	1
blessing	1
and	1
cursing.	1
My	1
brethren,	1
these	1
things	1
ought	1
not	1
so	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
3:11	1
Doth	1
a	1
fountain	1
send	1
forth	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
sweet	1
water	1
and	1
bitter?	1
	1
3:12	1
Can	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
bear	1
olive	1
berries?	1
either	1
a	1
vine,	1
figs?	1
so	1
can	1
no	1
fountain	1
both	1
yield	1
salt	1
water	1
and	1
fresh.	1
	1
3:13	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
and	1
endued	1
with	1
knowledge	1
among	1
you?	1
let	1
him	1
shew	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conversation	1
his	1
works	1
with	1
meekness	1
of	1
wisdom.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
bitter	1
envying	1
and	1
strife	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
glory	1
not,	1
and	1
lie	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:15	1
This	1
wisdom	1
descendeth	1
not	1
from	1
above,	1
but	1
is	1
earthly,	1
sensual,	1
devilish.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
where	1
envying	1
and	1
strife	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
confusion	1
and	1
every	1
evil	1
work.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
the	1
wisdom	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
above	1
is	1
first	1
pure,	1
then	1
peaceable,	1
gentle,	1
and	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
intreated,	1
full	1
of	1
mercy	1
and	1
good	1
fruits,	1
without	1
partiality,	1
and	1
without	1
hypocrisy.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
peace	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
make	1
peace.	1
	1
4:1	1
From	1
whence	1
come	1
wars	1
and	1
fightings	1
among	1
you?	1
come	1
they	1
not	1
hence,	1
even	1
of	1
your	1
lusts	1
that	1
war	1
in	1
your	1
members?	1
	1
4:2	1
Ye	1
lust,	1
and	1
have	1
not:	1
ye	1
kill,	1
and	1
desire	1
to	1
have,	1
and	1
cannot	1
obtain:	1
ye	1
fight	1
and	1
war,	1
yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
not.	1
	1
4:3	1
Ye	1
ask,	1
and	1
receive	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
amiss,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
consume	1
it	1
upon	1
your	1
lusts.	1
	1
4:4	1
Ye	1
adulterers	1
and	1
adulteresses,	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
enmity	1
with	1
God?	1
whosoever	1
therefore	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
Do	1
ye	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
in	1
vain,	1
The	1
spirit	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us	1
lusteth	1
to	1
envy?	1
	1
4:6	1
But	1
he	1
giveth	1
more	1
grace.	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
God	1
resisteth	1
the	1
proud,	1
but	1
giveth	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
4:7	1
Submit	1
yourselves	1
therefore	1
to	1
God.	1
Resist	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
flee	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
4:8	1
Draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
you.	1
Cleanse	1
your	1
hands,	1
ye	1
sinners;	1
and	1
purify	1
your	1
hearts,	1
ye	1
double	1
minded.	1
	1
4:9	1
Be	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
mourn,	1
and	1
weep:	1
let	1
your	1
laughter	1
be	1
turned	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
your	1
joy	1
to	1
heaviness.	1
	1
4:10	1
Humble	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
lift	1
you	1
up.	1
	1
4:11	1
Speak	1
not	1
evil	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
brethren.	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
evil	1
of	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
judgeth	1
his	1
brother,	1
speaketh	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
judgeth	1
the	1
law:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
judge	1
the	1
law,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
a	1
doer	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
a	1
judge.	1
	1
4:12	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
lawgiver,	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
and	1
to	1
destroy:	1
who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
another?	1
	1
4:13	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
ye	1
that	1
say,	1
To	1
day	1
or	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
continue	1
there	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
buy	1
and	1
sell,	1
and	1
get	1
gain:	1
4:14	1
Whereas	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
morrow.	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
life?	1
It	1
is	1
even	1
a	1
vapour,	1
that	1
appeareth	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
vanisheth	1
away.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
that	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
say,	1
If	1
the	1
Lord	1
will,	1
we	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
do	1
this,	1
or	1
that.	1
	1
4:16	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
rejoice	1
in	1
your	1
boastings:	1
all	1
such	1
rejoicing	1
is	1
evil.	1
	1
4:17	1
Therefore	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knoweth	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
doeth	1
it	1
not,	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
5:1	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
ye	1
rich	1
men,	1
weep	1
and	1
howl	1
for	1
your	1
miseries	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
5:2	1
Your	1
riches	1
are	1
corrupted,	1
and	1
your	1
garments	1
are	1
motheaten.	1
	1
5:3	1
Your	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
is	1
cankered;	1
and	1
the	1
rust	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
your	1
flesh	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
fire.	1
Ye	1
have	1
heaped	1
treasure	1
together	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
days.	1
	1
5:4	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
the	1
labourers	1
who	1
have	1
reaped	1
down	1
your	1
fields,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
you	1
kept	1
back	1
by	1
fraud,	1
crieth:	1
and	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
reaped	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
sabaoth.	1
	1
5:5	1
Ye	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
pleasure	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
been	1
wanton;	1
ye	1
have	1
nourished	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
slaughter.	1
	1
5:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
condemned	1
and	1
killed	1
the	1
just;	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
resist	1
you.	1
	1
5:7	1
Be	1
patient	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
Behold,	1
the	1
husbandman	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hath	1
long	1
patience	1
for	1
it,	1
until	1
he	1
receive	1
the	1
early	1
and	1
latter	1
rain.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
ye	1
also	1
patient;	1
stablish	1
your	1
hearts:	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
draweth	1
nigh.	1
	1
5:9	1
Grudge	1
not	1
one	1
against	1
another,	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
condemned:	1
behold,	1
the	1
judge	1
standeth	1
before	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
5:10	1
Take,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
the	1
prophets,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
suffering	1
affliction,	1
and	1
of	1
patience.	1
	1
5:11	1
Behold,	1
we	1
count	1
them	1
happy	1
which	1
endure.	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
Job,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
very	1
pitiful,	1
and	1
of	1
tender	1
mercy.	1
	1
5:12	1
But	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
swear	1
not,	1
neither	1
by	1
heaven,	1
neither	1
by	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
oath:	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
yea	1
be	1
yea;	1
and	1
your	1
nay,	1
nay;	1
lest	1
ye	1
fall	1
into	1
condemnation.	1
	1
5:13	1
Is	1
any	1
among	1
you	1
afflicted?	1
let	1
him	1
pray.	1
Is	1
any	1
merry?	1
let	1
him	1
sing	1
psalms.	1
	1
5:14	1
Is	1
any	1
sick	1
among	1
you?	1
let	1
him	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
pray	1
over	1
him,	1
anointing	1
him	1
with	1
oil	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
faith	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
raise	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
committed	1
sins,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
5:16	1
Confess	1
your	1
faults	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
pray	1
one	1
for	1
another,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
healed.	1
The	1
effectual	1
fervent	1
prayer	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
availeth	1
much.	1
	1
5:17	1
Elias	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
subject	1
to	1
like	1
passions	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
and	1
he	1
prayed	1
earnestly	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
rain:	1
and	1
it	1
rained	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
he	1
prayed	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
gave	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
fruit.	1
	1
5:19	1
Brethren,	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
do	1
err	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
one	1
convert	1
him;	1
5:20	1
Let	1
him	1
know,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
converteth	1
the	1
sinner	1
from	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
shall	1
save	1
a	1
soul	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
hide	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
sins.	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
Peter	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Peter,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
the	1
strangers	1
scattered	1
throughout	1
Pontus,	1
Galatia,	1
Cappadocia,	1
Asia,	1
and	1
Bithynia,	1
1:2	1
Elect	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
through	1
sanctification	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
unto	1
obedience	1
and	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
Grace	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
be	1
multiplied.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
abundant	1
mercy	1
hath	1
begotten	1
us	1
again	1
unto	1
a	1
lively	1
hope	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
1:4	1
To	1
an	1
inheritance	1
incorruptible,	1
and	1
undefiled,	1
and	1
that	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away,	1
reserved	1
in	1
heaven	1
for	1
you,	1
1:5	1
Who	1
are	1
kept	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
faith	1
unto	1
salvation	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
1:6	1
Wherein	1
ye	1
greatly	1
rejoice,	1
though	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
season,	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
heaviness	1
through	1
manifold	1
temptations:	1
1:7	1
That	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
being	1
much	1
more	1
precious	1
than	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
perisheth,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
tried	1
with	1
fire,	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
unto	1
praise	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
at	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:8	1
Whom	1
having	1
not	1
seen,	1
ye	1
love;	1
in	1
whom,	1
though	1
now	1
ye	1
see	1
him	1
not,	1
yet	1
believing,	1
ye	1
rejoice	1
with	1
joy	1
unspeakable	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
glory:	1
1:9	1
Receiving	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
even	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
1:10	1
Of	1
which	1
salvation	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
enquired	1
and	1
searched	1
diligently,	1
who	1
prophesied	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
you:	1
1:11	1
Searching	1
what,	1
or	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
them	1
did	1
signify,	1
when	1
it	1
testified	1
beforehand	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
should	1
follow.	1
	1
1:12	1
Unto	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
revealed,	1
that	1
not	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
they	1
did	1
minister	1
the	1
things,	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
reported	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
sent	1
down	1
from	1
heaven;	1
which	1
things	1
the	1
angels	1
desire	1
to	1
look	1
into.	1
	1
1:13	1
Wherefore	1
gird	1
up	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
be	1
sober,	1
and	1
hope	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:14	1
As	1
obedient	1
children,	1
not	1
fashioning	1
yourselves	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
lusts	1
in	1
your	1
ignorance:	1
1:15	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
is	1
holy,	1
so	1
be	1
ye	1
holy	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
conversation;	1
1:16	1
Because	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Be	1
ye	1
holy;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
without	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
judgeth	1
according	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
work,	1
pass	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
your	1
sojourning	1
here	1
in	1
fear:	1
1:18	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
redeemed	1
with	1
corruptible	1
things,	1
as	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
from	1
your	1
vain	1
conversation	1
received	1
by	1
tradition	1
from	1
your	1
fathers;	1
1:19	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
lamb	1
without	1
blemish	1
and	1
without	1
spot:	1
1:20	1
Who	1
verily	1
was	1
foreordained	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
times	1
for	1
you,	1
1:21	1
Who	1
by	1
him	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
that	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
glory;	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
hope	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
1:22	1
Seeing	1
ye	1
have	1
purified	1
your	1
souls	1
in	1
obeying	1
the	1
truth	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
unfeigned	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
pure	1
heart	1
fervently:	1
1:23	1
Being	1
born	1
again,	1
not	1
of	1
corruptible	1
seed,	1
but	1
of	1
incorruptible,	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
liveth	1
and	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:24	1
For	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
as	1
grass,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
grass.	1
The	1
grass	1
withereth,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
thereof	1
falleth	1
away:	1
1:25	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
preached	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:1	1
Wherefore	1
laying	1
aside	1
all	1
malice,	1
and	1
all	1
guile,	1
and	1
hypocrisies,	1
and	1
envies,	1
all	1
evil	1
speakings,	1
2:2	1
As	1
newborn	1
babes,	1
desire	1
the	1
sincere	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
grow	1
thereby:	1
2:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
ye	1
have	1
tasted	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
gracious.	1
	1
2:4	1
To	1
whom	1
coming,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
living	1
stone,	1
disallowed	1
indeed	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
chosen	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
precious,	1
2:5	1
Ye	1
also,	1
as	1
lively	1
stones,	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
a	1
spiritual	1
house,	1
an	1
holy	1
priesthood,	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
spiritual	1
sacrifices,	1
acceptable	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:6	1
Wherefore	1
also	1
it	1
is	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
scripture,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Sion	1
a	1
chief	1
corner	1
stone,	1
elect,	1
precious:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
2:7	1
Unto	1
you	1
therefore	1
which	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
precious:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
be	1
disobedient,	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
disallowed,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
made	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner,	1
2:8	1
And	1
a	1
stone	1
of	1
stumbling,	1
and	1
a	1
rock	1
of	1
offence,	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
stumble	1
at	1
the	1
word,	1
being	1
disobedient:	1
whereunto	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
appointed.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
a	1
chosen	1
generation,	1
a	1
royal	1
priesthood,	1
an	1
holy	1
nation,	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people;	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
shew	1
forth	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
into	1
his	1
marvellous	1
light;	1
2:10	1
Which	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
people,	1
but	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God:	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
obtained	1
mercy.	1
	1
2:11	1
Dearly	1
beloved,	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
as	1
strangers	1
and	1
pilgrims,	1
abstain	1
from	1
fleshly	1
lusts,	1
which	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
soul;	1
2:12	1
Having	1
your	1
conversation	1
honest	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
that,	1
whereas	1
they	1
speak	1
against	1
you	1
as	1
evildoers,	1
they	1
may	1
by	1
your	1
good	1
works,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
behold,	1
glorify	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
visitation.	1
	1
2:13	1
Submit	1
yourselves	1
to	1
every	1
ordinance	1
of	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
Lord's	1
sake:	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
as	1
supreme;	1
2:14	1
Or	1
unto	1
governors,	1
as	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sent	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
well.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
with	1
well	1
doing	1
ye	1
may	1
put	1
to	1
silence	1
the	1
ignorance	1
of	1
foolish	1
men:	1
2:16	1
As	1
free,	1
and	1
not	1
using	1
your	1
liberty	1
for	1
a	1
cloke	1
of	1
maliciousness,	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:17	1
Honour	1
all	1
men.	1
Love	1
the	1
brotherhood.	1
Fear	1
God.	1
Honour	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:18	1
Servants,	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
your	1
masters	1
with	1
all	1
fear;	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
gentle,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
froward.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
thankworthy,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
conscience	1
toward	1
God	1
endure	1
grief,	1
suffering	1
wrongfully.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
what	1
glory	1
is	1
it,	1
if,	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
buffeted	1
for	1
your	1
faults,	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
patiently?	1
but	1
if,	1
when	1
ye	1
do	1
well,	1
and	1
suffer	1
for	1
it,	1
ye	1
take	1
it	1
patiently,	1
this	1
is	1
acceptable	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
even	1
hereunto	1
were	1
ye	1
called:	1
because	1
Christ	1
also	1
suffered	1
for	1
us,	1
leaving	1
us	1
an	1
example,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
follow	1
his	1
steps:	1
2:22	1
Who	1
did	1
no	1
sin,	1
neither	1
was	1
guile	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
mouth:	1
2:23	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reviled,	1
reviled	1
not	1
again;	1
when	1
he	1
suffered,	1
he	1
threatened	1
not;	1
but	1
committed	1
himself	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
judgeth	1
righteously:	1
2:24	1
Who	1
his	1
own	1
self	1
bare	1
our	1
sins	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
on	1
the	1
tree,	1
that	1
we,	1
being	1
dead	1
to	1
sins,	1
should	1
live	1
unto	1
righteousness:	1
by	1
whose	1
stripes	1
ye	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
ye	1
were	1
as	1
sheep	1
going	1
astray;	1
but	1
are	1
now	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
Shepherd	1
and	1
Bishop	1
of	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
3:1	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
wives,	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
husbands;	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
word,	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
without	1
the	1
word	1
be	1
won	1
by	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
wives;	1
3:2	1
While	1
they	1
behold	1
your	1
chaste	1
conversation	1
coupled	1
with	1
fear.	1
	1
3:3	1
Whose	1
adorning	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
outward	1
adorning	1
of	1
plaiting	1
the	1
hair,	1
and	1
of	1
wearing	1
of	1
gold,	1
or	1
of	1
putting	1
on	1
of	1
apparel;	1
3:4	1
But	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
hidden	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
corruptible,	1
even	1
the	1
ornament	1
of	1
a	1
meek	1
and	1
quiet	1
spirit,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
great	1
price.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
time	1
the	1
holy	1
women	1
also,	1
who	1
trusted	1
in	1
God,	1
adorned	1
themselves,	1
being	1
in	1
subjection	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
husbands:	1
3:6	1
Even	1
as	1
Sara	1
obeyed	1
Abraham,	1
calling	1
him	1
lord:	1
whose	1
daughters	1
ye	1
are,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
ye	1
do	1
well,	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
with	1
any	1
amazement.	1
	1
3:7	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
husbands,	1
dwell	1
with	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
knowledge,	1
giving	1
honour	1
unto	1
the	1
wife,	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
weaker	1
vessel,	1
and	1
as	1
being	1
heirs	1
together	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
life;	1
that	1
your	1
prayers	1
be	1
not	1
hindered.	1
	1
3:8	1
Finally,	1
be	1
ye	1
all	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
having	1
compassion	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
love	1
as	1
brethren,	1
be	1
pitiful,	1
be	1
courteous:	1
3:9	1
Not	1
rendering	1
evil	1
for	1
evil,	1
or	1
railing	1
for	1
railing:	1
but	1
contrariwise	1
blessing;	1
knowing	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
thereunto	1
called,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
inherit	1
a	1
blessing.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
love	1
life,	1
and	1
see	1
good	1
days,	1
let	1
him	1
refrain	1
his	1
tongue	1
from	1
evil,	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
no	1
guile:	1
3:11	1
Let	1
him	1
eschew	1
evil,	1
and	1
do	1
good;	1
let	1
him	1
seek	1
peace,	1
and	1
ensue	1
it.	1
	1
3:12	1
For	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
are	1
over	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
his	1
ears	1
are	1
open	1
unto	1
their	1
prayers:	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
harm	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
followers	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good?	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
suffer	1
for	1
righteousness'	1
sake,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye:	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
terror,	1
neither	1
be	1
troubled;	1
3:15	1
But	1
sanctify	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
in	1
your	1
hearts:	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
always	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
asketh	1
you	1
a	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
with	1
meekness	1
and	1
fear:	1
3:16	1
Having	1
a	1
good	1
conscience;	1
that,	1
whereas	1
they	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed	1
that	1
falsely	1
accuse	1
your	1
good	1
conversation	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:17	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
better,	1
if	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
so,	1
that	1
ye	1
suffer	1
for	1
well	1
doing,	1
than	1
for	1
evil	1
doing.	1
	1
3:18	1
For	1
Christ	1
also	1
hath	1
once	1
suffered	1
for	1
sins,	1
the	1
just	1
for	1
the	1
unjust,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
to	1
God,	1
being	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
quickened	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit:	1
3:19	1
By	1
which	1
also	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
spirits	1
in	1
prison;	1
3:20	1
Which	1
sometime	1
were	1
disobedient,	1
when	1
once	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
God	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noah,	1
while	1
the	1
ark	1
was	1
a	1
preparing,	1
wherein	1
few,	1
that	1
is,	1
eight	1
souls	1
were	1
saved	1
by	1
water.	1
	1
3:21	1
The	1
like	1
figure	1
whereunto	1
even	1
baptism	1
doth	1
also	1
now	1
save	1
us	1
(not	1
the	1
putting	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conscience	1
toward	1
God,)	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:22	1
Who	1
is	1
gone	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God;	1
angels	1
and	1
authorities	1
and	1
powers	1
being	1
made	1
subject	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:1	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
Christ	1
hath	1
suffered	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
arm	1
yourselves	1
likewise	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
mind:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
hath	1
ceased	1
from	1
sin;	1
4:2	1
That	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
should	1
live	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
to	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
past	1
of	1
our	1
life	1
may	1
suffice	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
wrought	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
when	1
we	1
walked	1
in	1
lasciviousness,	1
lusts,	1
excess	1
of	1
wine,	1
revellings,	1
banquetings,	1
and	1
abominable	1
idolatries:	1
4:4	1
Wherein	1
they	1
think	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
ye	1
run	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
excess	1
of	1
riot,	1
speaking	1
evil	1
of	1
you:	1
4:5	1
Who	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
was	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
live	1
according	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
spirit.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
sober,	1
and	1
watch	1
unto	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
have	1
fervent	1
charity	1
among	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
charity	1
shall	1
cover	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
4:9	1
Use	1
hospitality	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
without	1
grudging.	1
	1
4:10	1
As	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
received	1
the	1
gift,	1
even	1
so	1
minister	1
the	1
same	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
as	1
good	1
stewards	1
of	1
the	1
manifold	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:11	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
speak,	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
as	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God;	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
minister,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
ability	1
which	1
God	1
giveth:	1
that	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
praise	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:12	1
Beloved,	1
think	1
it	1
not	1
strange	1
concerning	1
the	1
fiery	1
trial	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
try	1
you,	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
strange	1
thing	1
happened	1
unto	1
you:	1
4:13	1
But	1
rejoice,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
Christ's	1
sufferings;	1
that,	1
when	1
his	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed,	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
glad	1
also	1
with	1
exceeding	1
joy.	1
	1
4:14	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
reproached	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye;	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
of	1
God	1
resteth	1
upon	1
you:	1
on	1
their	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of,	1
but	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
glorified.	1
	1
4:15	1
But	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
suffer	1
as	1
a	1
murderer,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
or	1
as	1
an	1
evildoer,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
busybody	1
in	1
other	1
men's	1
matters.	1
	1
4:16	1
Yet	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
suffer	1
as	1
a	1
Christian,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
glorify	1
God	1
on	1
this	1
behalf.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
that	1
judgment	1
must	1
begin	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
first	1
begin	1
at	1
us,	1
what	1
shall	1
the	1
end	1
be	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
righteous	1
scarcely	1
be	1
saved,	1
where	1
shall	1
the	1
ungodly	1
and	1
the	1
sinner	1
appear?	1
	1
4:19	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
suffer	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
commit	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
well	1
doing,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
faithful	1
Creator.	1
	1
5:1	1
The	1
elders	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
you	1
I	1
exhort,	1
who	1
am	1
also	1
an	1
elder,	1
and	1
a	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed:	1
5:2	1
Feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
taking	1
the	1
oversight	1
thereof,	1
not	1
by	1
constraint,	1
but	1
willingly;	1
not	1
for	1
filthy	1
lucre,	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
ready	1
mind;	1
5:3	1
Neither	1
as	1
being	1
lords	1
over	1
God's	1
heritage,	1
but	1
being	1
ensamples	1
to	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
Shepherd	1
shall	1
appear,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory	1
that	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away.	1
	1
5:5	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
younger,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
elder.	1
Yea,	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
subject	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
humility:	1
for	1
God	1
resisteth	1
the	1
proud,	1
and	1
giveth	1
grace	1
to	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
5:6	1
Humble	1
yourselves	1
therefore	1
under	1
the	1
mighty	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
exalt	1
you	1
in	1
due	1
time:	1
5:7	1
Casting	1
all	1
your	1
care	1
upon	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
careth	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
sober,	1
be	1
vigilant;	1
because	1
your	1
adversary	1
the	1
devil,	1
as	1
a	1
roaring	1
lion,	1
walketh	1
about,	1
seeking	1
whom	1
he	1
may	1
devour:	1
5:9	1
Whom	1
resist	1
stedfast	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
afflictions	1
are	1
accomplished	1
in	1
your	1
brethren	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
5:10	1
But	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
grace,	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
unto	1
his	1
eternal	1
glory	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
suffered	1
a	1
while,	1
make	1
you	1
perfect,	1
stablish,	1
strengthen,	1
settle	1
you.	1
	1
5:11	1
To	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
5:12	1
By	1
Silvanus,	1
a	1
faithful	1
brother	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
suppose,	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
briefly,	1
exhorting,	1
and	1
testifying	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
wherein	1
ye	1
stand.	1
	1
5:13	1
The	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
Babylon,	1
elected	1
together	1
with	1
you,	1
saluteth	1
you;	1
and	1
so	1
doth	1
Marcus	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
5:14	1
Greet	1
ye	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
kiss	1
of	1
charity.	1
Peace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Peter	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
a	1
servant	1
and	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
obtained	1
like	1
precious	1
faith	1
with	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord,	1
1:3	1
According	1
as	1
his	1
divine	1
power	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
pertain	1
unto	1
life	1
and	1
godliness,	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
glory	1
and	1
virtue:	1
1:4	1
Whereby	1
are	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
exceeding	1
great	1
and	1
precious	1
promises:	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
nature,	1
having	1
escaped	1
the	1
corruption	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
lust.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
beside	1
this,	1
giving	1
all	1
diligence,	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
faith	1
virtue;	1
and	1
to	1

	1
1:8	1
For	1
if	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
abound,	1
they	1
make	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
neither	1
be	1
barren	1
nor	1
unfruitful	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1

Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
lacketh	1
these	1
things	1
is	1
blind,	1
and	1
cannot	1
see	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
purged	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
sins.	1
	1
1:10	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
rather,	1
brethren,	1
give	1
diligence	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
calling	1
and	1
election	1
sure:	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
these	1
things,	1
ye	1
shall	1
never	1
fall:	1
1:11	1
For	1
so	1
an	1
entrance	1
shall	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto	1
you	1
abundantly	1
into	1
the	1
everlasting	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1

Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:12	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
negligent	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
though	1
ye	1
know	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
truth.	1
	1
1:13	1
Yea,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
meet,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle,	1
to	1
stir	1
you	1
up	1
by	1
putting	1
you	1
in	1
remembrance;	1
1:14	1
Knowing	1
that	1
shortly	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
off	1
this	1
my	1
tabernacle,	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me.	1
	1
1:15	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
after	1
my	1
decease	1
to	1
have	1
these	1
things	1
always	1
in	1
remembrance.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
followed	1
cunningly	1
devised	1
fables,	1
when	1
we	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
but	1
were	1
eyewitnesses	1
of	1
his	1
majesty.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
he	1
received	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
honour	1
and	1
glory,	1
when	1
there	1
came	1
such	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
excellent	1
glory,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
this	1
voice	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
heaven	1
we	1
heard,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
mount.	1
	1
1:19	1
We	1
have	1
also	1
a	1
more	1
sure	1
word	1
of	1
prophecy;	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
do	1
well	1
that	1
ye	1
take	1
heed,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
light	1
that	1
shineth	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
place,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
dawn,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
star	1
arise	1
in	1
your	1
hearts:	1
1:20	1
Knowing	1
this	1
first,	1
that	1
no	1
prophecy	1
of	1
the	1
scripture	1
is	1
of	1
any	1
private	1
interpretation.	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
the	1
prophecy	1
came	1
not	1
in	1
old	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
man:	1
but	1
holy	1
men	1
of	1
God	1
spake	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
false	1
prophets	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
as	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
false	1
teachers	1
among	1
you,	1
who	1
privily	1
shall	1
bring	1
in	1
damnable	1
heresies,	1
even	1
denying	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
bought	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
upon	1
themselves	1
swift	1
destruction.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
many	1
shall	1
follow	1
their	1
pernicious	1
ways;	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
truth	1
shall	1
be	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
through	1
covetousness	1
shall	1
they	1
with	1
feigned	1
words	1
make	1
merchandise	1
of	1
you:	1
whose	1
judgment	1
now	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
lingereth	1
not,	1
and	1
their	1
damnation	1
slumbereth	1
not.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
if	1
God	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
that	1
sinned,	1
but	1
cast	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
hell,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
chains	1
of	1
darkness,	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
unto	1
judgment;	1
2:5	1
And	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
old	1
world,	1
but	1
saved	1
Noah	1
the	1
eighth	1
person,	1
a	1
preacher	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
bringing	1
in	1
the	1
flood	1
upon	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
ungodly;	1
2:6	1
And	1
turning	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
into	1
ashes	1
condemned	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
overthrow,	1
making	1
them	1
an	1
ensample	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
after	1
should	1
live	1
ungodly;	1
2:7	1
And	1
delivered	1
just	1
Lot,	1
vexed	1
with	1
the	1
filthy	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
2:8	1
(For	1
that	1
righteous	1
man	1
dwelling	1
among	1
them,	1
in	1
seeing	1
and	1
hearing,	1
vexed	1
his	1
righteous	1
soul	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
with	1
their	1
unlawful	1
deeds;)	1
2:9	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
how	1
to	1
deliver	1
the	1
godly	1
out	1
of	1
temptations,	1
and	1
to	1
reserve	1
the	1
unjust	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
to	1
be	1
punished:	1
2:10	1
But	1
chiefly	1
them	1
that	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
uncleanness,	1
and	1
despise	1
government.	1
Presumptuous	1
are	1
they,	1
selfwilled,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
dignities.	1
	1
2:11	1
Whereas	1
angels,	1
which	1
are	1
greater	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
might,	1
bring	1
not	1
railing	1
accusation	1
against	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
these,	1
as	1
natural	1
brute	1
beasts,	1
made	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
and	1
destroyed,	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
understand	1
not;	1
and	1
shall	1
utterly	1
perish	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
corruption;	1
2:13	1
And	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
unrighteousness,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
count	1
it	1
pleasure	1
to	1
riot	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time.	1
Spots	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
blemishes,	1
sporting	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
deceivings	1
while	1
they	1
feast	1
with	1
you;	1
2:14	1
Having	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
adultery,	1
and	1
that	1
cannot	1
cease	1
from	1
sin;	1
beguiling	1
unstable	1
souls:	1
an	1
heart	1
they	1
have	1
exercised	1
with	1
covetous	1
practices;	1
cursed	1
children:	1
2:15	1
Which	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
right	1
way,	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
astray,	1
following	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bosor,	1
who	1
loved	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
unrighteousness;	1
2:16	1
But	1
was	1
rebuked	1
for	1
his	1
iniquity:	1
the	1
dumb	1
ass	1
speaking	1
with	1
man's	1
voice	1
forbad	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
2:17	1
These	1
are	1
wells	1
without	1
water,	1
clouds	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
with	1
a	1
tempest;	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
darkness	1
is	1
reserved	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
speak	1
great	1
swelling	1
words	1
of	1
vanity,	1
they	1
allure	1
through	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
through	1
much	1
wantonness,	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
clean	1
escaped	1
from	1
them	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
error.	1
	1
2:19	1
While	1
they	1
promise	1
them	1
liberty,	1
they	1
themselves	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
corruption:	1
for	1
of	1
whom	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
overcome,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
if	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
escaped	1
the	1
pollutions	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
they	1
are	1
again	1
entangled	1
therein,	1
and	1
overcome,	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
is	1
worse	1
with	1
them	1
than	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
than,	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
it,	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
holy	1
commandment	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
proverb,	1
The	1
dog	1
is	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
vomit	1
again;	1
and	1
the	1
sow	1
that	1
was	1
washed	1
to	1
her	1
wallowing	1
in	1
the	1
mire.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
second	1
epistle,	1
beloved,	1
I	1
now	1
write	1
unto	1
you;	1
in	1
both	1
which	1
I	1
stir	1
up	1
your	1
pure	1
minds	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
remembrance:	1
3:2	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
mindful	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
before	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
us	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour:	1
3:3	1
Knowing	1
this	1
first,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
scoffers,	1
walking	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts,	1
3:4	1
And	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
his	1
coming?	1
for	1
since	1
the	1
fathers	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
all	1
things	1
continue	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
this	1
they	1
willingly	1
are	1
ignorant	1
of,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
standing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
water:	1
3:6	1
Whereby	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
then	1
was,	1
being	1
overflowed	1
with	1
water,	1
perished:	1
3:7	1
But	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
are	1
now,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
word	1
are	1
kept	1
in	1
store,	1
reserved	1
unto	1
fire	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
perdition	1
of	1
ungodly	1
men.	1
	1
3:8	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
be	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
thing,	1
that	1
one	1
day	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
as	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
3:9	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
not	1
slack	1
concerning	1
his	1
promise,	1
as	1
some	1
men	1
count	1
slackness;	1
but	1
is	1
longsuffering	1
to	1
us-ward,	1
not	1
willing	1
that	1
any	1
should	1
perish,	1
but	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
3:10	1
But	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
noise,	1
and	1
the	1
elements	1
shall	1
melt	1
with	1
fervent	1
heat,	1
the	1
earth	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
are	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
up.	1
	1
3:11	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
persons	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
holy	1
conversation	1
and	1
godliness,	1
3:12	1
Looking	1
for	1
and	1
hasting	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
God,	1
wherein	1
the	1
heavens	1
being	1
on	1
fire	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
and	1
the	1
elements	1
shall	1
melt	1
with	1
fervent	1
heat?	1
	1
3:13	1
Nevertheless	1
we,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
promise,	1
look	1
for	1
new	1
heavens	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth,	1
wherein	1
dwelleth	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:14	1
Wherefore,	1
beloved,	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
look	1
for	1
such	1
things,	1
be	1
diligent	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
peace,	1
without	1
spot,	1
and	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
account	1
that	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
is	1
salvation;	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Paul	1
also	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
hath	1
written	1
unto	1
you;	1
3:16	1
As	1
also	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
epistles,	1
speaking	1
in	1
them	1
of	1
these	1
things;	1
in	1
which	1
are	1
some	1
things	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
which	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
unlearned	1
and	1
unstable	1
wrest,	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
also	1
the	1
other	1
scriptures,	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
destruction.	1
	1
3:17	1
Ye	1
therefore,	1
beloved,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
before,	1
beware	1
lest	1
ye	1
also,	1
being	1
led	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
fall	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
stedfastness.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
grow	1
in	1
grace,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
To	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
both	1
now	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
That	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
our	1
eyes,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
looked	1
upon,	1
and	1
our	1
hands	1
have	1
handled,	1
of	1
the	1
Word	1
of	1
life;	1
1:2	1
(For	1
the	1
life	1
was	1
manifested,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
it,	1
and	1
bear	1
witness,	1
and	1
shew	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
eternal	1
life,	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
was	1
manifested	1
unto	1
us;)	1
1:3	1
That	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
declare	1
we	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
us:	1
and	1
truly	1
our	1
fellowship	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
write	1
we	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
1:5	1
This	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
message	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
declare	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
light,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
darkness	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
1:6	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness,	1
we	1
lie,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
truth:	1
1:7	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
we	1
have	1
fellowship	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
his	1
Son	1
cleanseth	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
sin.	1
	1
1:8	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
sin,	1
we	1
deceive	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
1:9	1
If	1
we	1
confess	1
our	1
sins,	1
he	1
is	1
faithful	1
and	1
just	1
to	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
sins,	1
and	1
to	1
cleanse	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
unrighteousness.	1
	1
1:10	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
sinned,	1
we	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
his	1
word	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
these	1
things	1
write	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
sin	1
not.	1
	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
sin,	1
we	1
have	1
an	1
advocate	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
righteous:	1
2:2	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
propitiation	1
for	1
our	1
sins:	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
our's	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
him,	1
if	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
2:4	1
He	1
that	1
saith,	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
not	1
his	1
commandments,	1
is	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
whoso	1
keepeth	1
his	1
word,	1
in	1
him	1
verily	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
perfected:	1
hereby	1
know	1
we	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:6	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
abideth	1
in	1
him	1
ought	1
himself	1
also	1
so	1
to	1
walk,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
walked.	1
	1
2:7	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
write	1
no	1
new	1
commandment	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
an	1
old	1
commandment	1
which	1
ye	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
The	1
old	1
commandment	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
2:8	1
Again,	1
a	1
new	1
commandment	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
which	1
thing	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
you:	1
because	1
the	1
darkness	1
is	1
past,	1
and	1
the	1
true	1
light	1
now	1
shineth.	1
	1
2:9	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother,	1
is	1
in	1
darkness	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
2:10	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
brother	1
abideth	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
occasion	1
of	1
stumbling	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:11	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
not	1
whither	1
he	1
goeth,	1
because	1
that	1
darkness	1
hath	1
blinded	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
2:12	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
little	1
children,	1
because	1
your	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
you	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
2:13	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
fathers,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
young	1
men,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
wicked	1
one.	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
little	1
children,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:14	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you,	1
fathers,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you,	1
young	1
men,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
wicked	1
one.	1
	1
2:15	1
Love	1
not	1
the	1
world,	1
neither	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
life,	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
but	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
world	1
passeth	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
lust	1
thereof:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:18	1
Little	1
children,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time:	1
and	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
antichrist	1
shall	1
come,	1
even	1
now	1
are	1
there	1
many	1
antichrists;	1
whereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
2:19	1
They	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
us,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
us;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
us,	1
they	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
continued	1
with	1
us:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
an	1
unction	1
from	1
the	1
Holy	1
One,	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:21	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
lie	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
2:22	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
liar	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
denieth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ?	1
He	1
is	1
antichrist,	1
that	1
denieth	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
2:23	1
Whosoever	1
denieth	1
the	1
Son,	1
the	1
same	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
Father:	1
he	1
that	1
acknowledgeth	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
the	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
2:24	1
Let	1
that	1
therefore	1
abide	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
If	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
you,	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
us,	1
even	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
2:26	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
them	1
that	1
seduce	1
you.	1
	1
2:27	1
But	1
the	1
anointing	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
him	1
abideth	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
teach	1
you:	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
same	1
anointing	1
teacheth	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
is	1
truth,	1
and	1
is	1
no	1
lie,	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
taught	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
now,	1
little	1
children,	1
abide	1
in	1
him;	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
appear,	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
confidence,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
before	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
coming.	1
	1
2:29	1
If	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
righteous,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:1	1
Behold,	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God:	1
therefore	1
the	1
world	1
knoweth	1
us	1
not,	1
because	1
it	1
knew	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
3:2	1
Beloved,	1
now	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
doth	1
not	1
yet	1
appear	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
be:	1
but	1
we	1
know	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
appear,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
him;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
this	1
hope	1
in	1
him	1
purifieth	1
himself,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
pure.	1
	1
3:4	1
Whosoever	1
committeth	1
sin	1
transgresseth	1
also	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
manifested	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
our	1
sins;	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
sin.	1
	1
3:6	1
Whosoever	1
abideth	1
in	1
him	1
sinneth	1
not:	1
whosoever	1
sinneth	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
him,	1
neither	1
known	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
Little	1
children,	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you:	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
is	1
righteous,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:8	1
He	1
that	1
committeth	1
sin	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
sinneth	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
manifested,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:9	1
Whosoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
doth	1
not	1
commit	1
sin;	1
for	1
his	1
seed	1
remaineth	1
in	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
cannot	1
sin,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
In	1
this	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
manifest,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
devil:	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
not	1
righteousness	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
message	1
that	1
ye	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
3:12	1
Not	1
as	1
Cain,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
wicked	1
one,	1
and	1
slew	1
his	1
brother.	1
And	1
wherefore	1
slew	1
he	1
him?	1
Because	1
his	1
own	1
works	1
were	1
evil,	1
and	1
his	1
brother's	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:13	1
Marvel	1
not,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
hate	1
you.	1
	1
3:14	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
passed	1
from	1
death	1
unto	1
life,	1
because	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
brethren.	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
abideth	1
in	1
death.	1
	1
3:15	1
Whosoever	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
a	1
murderer:	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
murderer	1
hath	1
eternal	1
life	1
abiding	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
3:16	1
Hereby	1
perceive	1
we	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
he	1
laid	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
us:	1
and	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
our	1
lives	1
for	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
whoso	1
hath	1
this	1
world's	1
good,	1
and	1
seeth	1
his	1
brother	1
have	1
need,	1
and	1
shutteth	1
up	1
his	1
bowels	1
of	1
compassion	1
from	1
him,	1
how	1
dwelleth	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him?	1
	1
3:18	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
love	1
in	1
word,	1
neither	1
in	1
tongue;	1
but	1
in	1
deed	1
and	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
shall	1
assure	1
our	1
hearts	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
if	1
our	1
heart	1
condemn	1
us,	1
God	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
heart,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
3:21	1
Beloved,	1
if	1
our	1
heart	1
condemn	1
us	1
not,	1
then	1
have	1
we	1
confidence	1
toward	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
ask,	1
we	1
receive	1
of	1
him,	1
because	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
pleasing	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
commandment,	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
us	1
commandment.	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
his	1
commandments	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
abideth	1
in	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us.	1
	1
4:1	1
Beloved,	1
believe	1
not	1
every	1
spirit,	1
but	1
try	1
the	1
spirits	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
God:	1
because	1
many	1
false	1
prophets	1
are	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:2	1
Hereby	1
know	1
ye	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God:	1
Every	1
spirit	1
that	1
confesseth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
of	1
God:	1
4:3	1
And	1
every	1
spirit	1
that	1
confesseth	1
not	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
spirit	1
of	1
antichrist,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
come;	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
already	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:4	1
Ye	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
have	1
overcome	1
them:	1
because	1
greater	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:5	1
They	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
therefore	1
speak	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
heareth	1
them.	1
	1
4:6	1
We	1
are	1
of	1
God:	1
he	1
that	1
knoweth	1
God	1
heareth	1
us;	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God	1
heareth	1
not	1
us.	1
Hereby	1
know	1
we	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
error.	1
	1
4:7	1
Beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
love	1
one	1
another:	1
for	1
love	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
loveth	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
God.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
knoweth	1
not	1
God;	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
love.	1
	1
4:9	1
In	1
this	1
was	1
manifested	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
toward	1
us,	1
because	1
that	1
God	1
sent	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
live	1
through	1
him.	1
	1
4:10	1
Herein	1
is	1
love,	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
loved	1
God,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
Son	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
propitiation	1
for	1
our	1
sins.	1
	1
4:11	1
Beloved,	1
if	1
God	1
so	1
loved	1
us,	1
we	1
ought	1
also	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
4:12	1
No	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
God	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
If	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us,	1
and	1
his	1
love	1
is	1
perfected	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
4:13	1
Hereby	1
know	1
we	1
that	1
we	1
dwell	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
us,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
Spirit.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
do	1
testify	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
sent	1
the	1
Son	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:15	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
confess	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
and	1
believed	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
to	1
us.	1
God	1
is	1
love;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
love	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
God	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
4:17	1
Herein	1
is	1
our	1
love	1
made	1
perfect,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
boldness	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment:	1
because	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
so	1
are	1
we	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
4:18	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
in	1
love;	1
but	1
perfect	1
love	1
casteth	1
out	1
fear:	1
because	1
fear	1
hath	1
torment.	1
He	1
that	1
feareth	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
4:19	1
We	1
love	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
first	1
loved	1
us.	1
	1
4:20	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
say,	1
I	1
love	1
God,	1
and	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
seen,	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
love	1
God	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen?	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
this	1
commandment	1
have	1
we	1
from	1
him,	1
That	1
he	1
who	1
loveth	1
God	1
love	1
his	1
brother	1
also.	1
	1
5:1	1
Whosoever	1
believeth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
loveth	1
him	1
that	1
begat	1
loveth	1
him	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
begotten	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:2	1
By	1
this	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God,	1
when	1
we	1
love	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments:	1
and	1
his	1
commandments	1
are	1
not	1
grievous.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
our	1
faith.	1
	1
5:5	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
5:6	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
by	1
water	1
and	1
blood,	1
even	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
not	1
by	1
water	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
water	1
and	1
blood.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
beareth	1
witness,	1
because	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
that	1
bear	1
record	1
in	1
heaven,	1
the	1
Father,	1
the	1
Word,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
and	1
these	1
three	1
are	1
one.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
that	1
bear	1
witness	1
in	1
earth,	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
blood:	1
and	1
these	1
three	1
agree	1
in	1
one.	1
	1
5:9	1
If	1
we	1
receive	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
men,	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
greater:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
testified	1
of	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:10	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
the	1
witness	1
in	1
himself:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
liar;	1
because	1
he	1
believeth	1
not	1
the	1
record	1
that	1
God	1
gave	1
of	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
record,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
eternal	1
life,	1
and	1
this	1
life	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:12	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
life;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
life.	1
	1
5:13	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
eternal	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
confidence	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
him,	1
that,	1
if	1
we	1
ask	1
any	1
thing	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
he	1
heareth	1
us:	1
5:15	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
hear	1
us,	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
ask,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
petitions	1
that	1
we	1
desired	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
see	1
his	1
brother	1
sin	1
a	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
unto	1
death,	1
he	1
shall	1
ask,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
life	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
sin	1
not	1
unto	1
death.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
unto	1
death:	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
5:17	1
All	1
unrighteousness	1
is	1
sin:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
not	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
5:18	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
whosoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
sinneth	1
not;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
begotten	1
of	1
God	1
keepeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
wicked	1
one	1
toucheth	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
lieth	1
in	1
wickedness.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
an	1
understanding,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
5:21	1
Little	1
children,	1
keep	1
yourselves	1
from	1
idols.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
elder	1
unto	1
the	1
elect	1
lady	1
and	1
her	1
children,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
not	1
I	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
truth;	1
1:2	1
For	1
the	1
truth's	1
sake,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
love.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
greatly	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
of	1
thy	1
children	1
walking	1
in	1
truth,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
commandment	1
from	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
lady,	1
not	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
wrote	1
a	1
new	1
commandment	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
love,	1
that	1
we	1
walk	1
after	1
his	1
commandments.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
commandment,	1
That,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
ye	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
many	1
deceivers	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
who	1
confess	1
not	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
deceiver	1
and	1
an	1
antichrist.	1
	1
1:8	1
Look	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
we	1
lose	1
not	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
wrought,	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
receive	1
a	1
full	1
reward.	1
	1
1:9	1
Whosoever	1
transgresseth,	1
and	1
abideth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
hath	1
not	1
God.	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
hath	1
both	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
1:10	1
If	1
there	1
come	1
any	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
bring	1
not	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
receive	1
him	1
not	1
into	1
your	1
house,	1
neither	1
bid	1
him	1
God	1
speed:	1
1:11	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
biddeth	1
him	1
God	1
speed	1
is	1
partaker	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
deeds.	1
	1
1:12	1
Having	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
write	1
with	1
paper	1
and	1
ink:	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
speak	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
that	1
our	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
1:13	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
elect	1
sister	1
greet	1
thee.	1
Amen.	1

Gaius,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:2	1
Beloved,	1
I	1
wish	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prosper	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
health,	1
even	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
prospereth.	1
	1
1:3	1
For	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
greatly,	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
came	1
and	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
walkest	1
in	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
greater	1
joy	1
than	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
walk	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
1:5	1
Beloved,	1
thou	1
doest	1
faithfully	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
doest	1
to	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
to	1
strangers;	1
1:6	1
Which	1
have	1
borne	1
witness	1
of	1
thy	1
charity	1
before	1
the	1
church:	1
whom	1
if	1
thou	1
bring	1
forward	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
sort,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
well:	1
1:7	1
Because	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
taking	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:8	1
We	1
therefore	1
ought	1
to	1
receive	1
such,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
fellowhelpers	1
to	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:9	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
the	1
church:	1
but	1
Diotrephes,	1
who	1
loveth	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence	1
among	1
them,	1
receiveth	1
us	1
not.	1
	1
1:10	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
I	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
his	1
deeds	1
which	1
he	1
doeth,	1
prating	1
against	1
us	1
with	1
malicious	1
words:	1
and	1
not	1
content	1
therewith,	1
neither	1
doth	1
he	1
himself	1
receive	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
forbiddeth	1
them	1
that	1
would,	1
and	1
casteth	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
1:11	1
Beloved,	1
follow	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
He	1
that	1
doeth	1
good	1
is	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
God.	1
	1
1:12	1
Demetrius	1
hath	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
itself:	1
yea,	1
and	1
we	1
also	1
bear	1
record;	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
our	1
record	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
1:13	1
I	1
had	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
write,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
with	1
ink	1
and	1
pen	1
write	1
unto	1
thee:	1
1:14	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
I	1
shall	1
shortly	1
see	1
thee,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
speak	1
face	1
to	1
face.	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
thee.	1
Our	1
friends	1
salute	1
thee.	1
Greet	1
the	1
friends	1
by	1
name.	1

The	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Jude	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Jude,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified	1
by	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
preserved	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
called:	1
1:2	1
Mercy	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
love,	1
be	1
multiplied.	1
	1
1:3	1
Beloved,	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
all	1
diligence	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
salvation,	1
it	1
was	1
needful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
exhort	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
earnestly	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
was	1
once	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
1:4	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
men	1
crept	1
in	1
unawares,	1
who	1
were	1
before	1
of	1
old	1
ordained	1
to	1
this	1
condemnation,	1
ungodly	1
men,	1
turning	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
into	1
lasciviousness,	1
and	1
denying	1
the	1
only	1
Lord	1
God,	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:5	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
put	1
you	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
though	1
ye	1
once	1
knew	1
this,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
Lord,	1
having	1
saved	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
afterward	1
destroyed	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
kept	1
not	1
their	1
first	1
estate,	1
but	1
left	1
their	1
own	1
habitation,	1
he	1
hath	1
reserved	1
in	1
everlasting	1
chains	1
under	1
darkness	1
unto	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
day.	1
	1
1:7	1
Even	1
as	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
about	1
them	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
giving	1
themselves	1
over	1
to	1
fornication,	1
and	1
going	1
after	1
strange	1
flesh,	1
are	1
set	1
forth	1
for	1
an	1
example,	1
suffering	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
eternal	1
fire.	1
	1
1:8	1
Likewise	1
also	1
these	1
filthy	1
dreamers	1
defile	1
the	1
flesh,	1
despise	1
dominion,	1
and	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
dignities.	1
	1
1:9	1
Yet	1
Michael	1
the	1
archangel,	1
when	1
contending	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
he	1
disputed	1
about	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Moses,	1
durst	1
not	1
bring	1
against	1
him	1
a	1
railing	1
accusation,	1
but	1
said,	1
The	1
Lord	1
rebuke	1
thee.	1
	1
1:10	1
But	1
these	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
know	1
not:	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
know	1
naturally,	1
as	1
brute	1
beasts,	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
they	1
corrupt	1
themselves.	1
	1
1:11	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Cain,	1
and	1
ran	1
greedily	1
after	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
Balaam	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
gainsaying	1
of	1
Core.	1
	1
1:12	1
These	1
are	1
spots	1
in	1
your	1
feasts	1
of	1
charity,	1
when	1
they	1
feast	1
with	1
you,	1
feeding	1
themselves	1
without	1
fear:	1
clouds	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
water,	1
carried	1
about	1
of	1
winds;	1
trees	1
whose	1
fruit	1
withereth,	1
without	1
fruit,	1
twice	1
dead,	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots;	1
1:13	1
Raging	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
foaming	1
out	1
their	1
own	1
shame;	1
wandering	1
stars,	1
to	1
whom	1
is	1
reserved	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
darkness	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
Enoch	1
also,	1
the	1
seventh	1
from	1
Adam,	1
prophesied	1
of	1
these,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
cometh	1
with	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
his	1
saints,	1
1:15	1
To	1
execute	1
judgment	1
upon	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
ungodly	1
among	1
them	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
ungodly	1
deeds	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
ungodly	1
committed,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
hard	1
speeches	1
which	1
ungodly	1
sinners	1
have	1
spoken	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
1:16	1
These	1
are	1
murmurers,	1
complainers,	1
walking	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts;	1
and	1
their	1
mouth	1
speaketh	1
great	1
swelling	1
words,	1
having	1
men's	1
persons	1
in	1
admiration	1
because	1
of	1
advantage.	1
	1
1:17	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
remember	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
before	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:18	1
How	1
that	1
they	1
told	1
you	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
mockers	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
who	1
should	1
walk	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
ungodly	1
lusts.	1
	1
1:19	1
These	1
be	1
they	1
who	1
separate	1
themselves,	1
sensual,	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
1:20	1
But	1
ye,	1
beloved,	1
building	1
up	1
yourselves	1
on	1
your	1
most	1
holy	1
faith,	1
praying	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
1:21	1
Keep	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
unto	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
of	1
some	1
have	1
compassion,	1
making	1
a	1
difference:	1
1:23	1
And	1
others	1
save	1
with	1
fear,	1
pulling	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fire;	1
hating	1
even	1
the	1
garment	1
spotted	1
by	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
1:24	1
Now	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
from	1
falling,	1
and	1
to	1
present	1
you	1
faultless	1
before	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
with	1
exceeding	1
joy,	1
1:25	1
To	1
the	1
only	1
wise	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour,	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
majesty,	1
dominion	1
and	1
power,	1
both	1
now	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Revelation	1
of	1
Saint	1
John	1
the	1

	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
Revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
him,	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
and	1
signified	1
it	1
by	1
his	1
angel	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
John:	1
1:2	1
Who	1
bare	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
saw.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
readeth,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
keep	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
1:4	1
John	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia:	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
is,	1
and	1
which	1
was,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
which	1
are	1
before	1
his	1
throne;	1
1:5	1
And	1
from	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
faithful	1
witness,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
begotten	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Unto	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
washed	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
sins	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
blood,	1
1:6	1
And	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
kings	1
and	1
priests	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
Father;	1
to	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1

dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:7	1
Behold,	1
he	1
cometh	1
with	1
clouds;	1
and	1
every	1
eye	1
shall	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
which	1
pierced	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wail	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
Even	1
so,	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:8	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1

1:9	1
I	1
John,	1
who	1
also	1
am	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
companion	1
in	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
patience	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
isle	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Patmos,	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:10	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
on	1
the	1
Lord's	1
day,	1
and	1
heard	1
behind	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
voice,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
1:11	1
Saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last:	1
and,	1
What	1
thou	1
seest,	1
write	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
seven	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia;	1
unto	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
unto	1
Smyrna,	1
and	1
unto	1
Pergamos,	1
and	1
unto	1
Thyatira,	1
and	1
unto	1
Sardis,	1
and	1
unto	1
Philadelphia,	1
and	1
unto	1
Laodicea.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
I	1
turned	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
voice	1
that	1
spake	1
with	1
me.	1
And	1
being	1
turned,	1
I	1
saw	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks;	1
1:13	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
candlesticks	1
one	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
garment	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
foot,	1
and	1
girt	1
about	1
the	1
paps	1
with	1
a	1
golden	1
girdle.	1
	1
1:14	1
His	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
hairs	1
were	1
white	1
like	1
wool,	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow;	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire;	1
1:15	1
And	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
unto	1
fine	1
brass,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
burned	1
in	1
a	1
furnace;	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
many	1
waters.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
seven	1
stars:	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
went	1
a	1
sharp	1
twoedged	1
sword:	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
shineth	1
in	1
his	1
strength.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him,	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
dead.	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
me,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last:	1
1:18	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
liveth,	1
and	1
was	1
dead;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
alive	1
for	1
evermore,	1
Amen;	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
hell	1
and	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
1:19	1
Write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
hereafter;	1
1:20	1
The	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks.	1
The	1
seven	1
stars	1
are	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
churches:	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
candlesticks	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
churches.	1
	1
2:1	1
Unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Ephesus	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
who	1
walketh	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks;	1
2:2	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
thy	1
labour,	1
and	1
thy	1
patience,	1
and	1
how	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
bear	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
evil:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
tried	1
them	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
apostles,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
and	1
hast	1
found	1
them	1
liars:	1
2:3	1
And	1
hast	1
borne,	1
and	1
hast	1
patience,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake	1
hast	1
laboured,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
fainted.	1
	1
2:4	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
left	1
thy	1
first	1
love.	1
	1
2:5	1
Remember	1
therefore	1
from	1
whence	1
thou	1
art	1
fallen,	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
do	1
the	1
first	1
works;	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
quickly,	1
and	1
will	1
remove	1
thy	1
candlestick	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
except	1
thou	1
repent.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
this	1
thou	1
hast,	1
that	1
thou	1
hatest	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
Nicolaitanes,	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
hate.	1
	1
2:7	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
paradise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Smyrna	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last,	1
which	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive;	1
2:9	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
poverty,	1
(but	1
thou	1
art	1
rich)	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
Jews,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
but	1
are	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
Satan.	1
	1
2:10	1
Fear	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
suffer:	1
behold,	1
the	1
devil	1
shall	1
cast	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
into	1
prison,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
tried;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
tribulation	1
ten	1
days:	1
be	1
thou	1
faithful	1
unto	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
2:11	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Pergamos	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
the	1
sharp	1
sword	1
with	1
two	1
edges;	1
2:13	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
where	1
thou	1
dwellest,	1
even	1
where	1
Satan's	1
seat	1
is:	1
and	1
thou	1
holdest	1
fast	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
denied	1
my	1
faith,	1
even	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
wherein	1
Antipas	1
was	1
my	1
faithful	1
martyr,	1
who	1
was	1
slain	1
among	1
you,	1
where	1
Satan	1
dwelleth.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
there	1
them	1
that	1
hold	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Balaam,	1
who	1
taught	1
Balac	1
to	1
cast	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
eat	1
things	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols,	1
and	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication.	1
	1
2:15	1
So	1
hast	1
thou	1
also	1
them	1
that	1
hold	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Nicolaitanes,	1
which	1
thing	1
I	1
hate.	1
	1
2:16	1
Repent;	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
quickly,	1
and	1
will	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
2:17	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
hidden	1
manna,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
white	1
stone,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stone	1
a	1
new	1
name	1
written,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
saving	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
it.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Thyatira	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
his	1
eyes	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
are	1
like	1
fine	1
brass;	1
2:19	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
charity,	1
and	1
service,	1
and	1
faith,	1
and	1
thy	1
patience,	1
and	1
thy	1
works;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
2:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
sufferest	1
that	1
woman	1
Jezebel,	1
which	1
calleth	1
herself	1
a	1
prophetess,	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
to	1
seduce	1
my	1
servants	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
things	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
space	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
her	1
fornication;	1
and	1
she	1
repented	1
not.	1
	1
2:22	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
bed,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
commit	1
adultery	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
kill	1
her	1
children	1
with	1
death;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
which	1
searcheth	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
hearts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
works.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
rest	1
in	1
Thyatira,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
Satan,	1
as	1
they	1
speak;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
upon	1
you	1
none	1
other	1
burden.	1
	1
2:25	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
already	1
hold	1
fast	1
till	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
overcometh,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
my	1
works	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
nations:	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron;	1
as	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
a	1
potter	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
broken	1
to	1
shivers:	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
received	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
morning	1
star.	1
	1
2:29	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Sardis	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
stars;	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
name	1
that	1
thou	1
livest,	1
and	1
art	1
dead.	1
	1
3:2	1
Be	1
watchful,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
remain,	1
that	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
die:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
thy	1
works	1
perfect	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
Remember	1
therefore	1
how	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
hold	1
fast,	1
and	1
repent.	1
If	1
therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
watch,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
on	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
hour	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
3:4	1
Thou	1
hast	1
a	1
few	1
names	1
even	1
in	1
Sardis	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
defiled	1
their	1
garments;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
white:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
raiment;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
blot	1
out	1
his	1
name	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
his	1
name	1
before	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
angels.	1
	1
3:6	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Philadelphia	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holy,	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
David,	1
he	1
that	1
openeth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shutteth;	1
and	1
shutteth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
openeth;	1
3:8	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
thee	1
an	1
open	1
door,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
shut	1
it:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
little	1
strength,	1
and	1
hast	1
kept	1
my	1
word,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
denied	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
3:9	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
Satan,	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
Jews,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
but	1
do	1
lie;	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee.	1
	1
3:10	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
my	1
patience,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
keep	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
temptation,	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
try	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:11	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly:	1
hold	1
that	1
fast	1
which	1
thou	1
hast,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
take	1
thy	1
crown.	1
	1
3:12	1
Him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
pillar	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
out:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
new	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
my	1
God:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
upon	1
him	1
my	1
new	1
name.	1
	1
3:13	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Laodiceans	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
Amen,	1
the	1
faithful	1
and	1
true	1
witness,	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
God;	1
3:15	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
neither	1
cold	1
nor	1
hot:	1
I	1
would	1
thou	1
wert	1
cold	1
or	1
hot.	1
	1
3:16	1
So	1
then	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
lukewarm,	1
and	1
neither	1
cold	1
nor	1
hot,	1
I	1
will	1
spue	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
3:17	1
Because	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
I	1
am	1
rich,	1
and	1
increased	1
with	1
goods,	1
and	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
nothing;	1
and	1
knowest	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
wretched,	1
and	1
miserable,	1
and	1
poor,	1
and	1
blind,	1
and	1
naked:	1
3:18	1
I	1
counsel	1
thee	1
to	1
buy	1
of	1
me	1
gold	1
tried	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
rich;	1
and	1
white	1
raiment,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
clothed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
thy	1
nakedness	1
do	1
not	1
appear;	1
and	1
anoint	1
thine	1
eyes	1
with	1
eyesalve,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
see.	1
	1
3:19	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
I	1
love,	1
I	1
rebuke	1
and	1
chasten:	1
be	1
zealous	1
therefore,	1
and	1
repent.	1
	1
3:20	1
Behold,	1
I	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
knock:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
sup	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
3:21	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
grant	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
throne,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
overcame,	1
and	1
am	1
set	1
down	1
with	1
my	1
Father	1
in	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
3:22	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
4:1	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet	1
talking	1
with	1
me;	1
which	1
said,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
hereafter.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
immediately	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
spirit:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
throne	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
one	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
was	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
like	1
a	1
jasper	1
and	1
a	1
sardine	1
stone:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rainbow	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
in	1
sight	1
like	1
unto	1
an	1
emerald.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne	1
were	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
seats:	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
seats	1
I	1
saw	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
sitting,	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
raiment;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
crowns	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
proceeded	1
lightnings	1
and	1
thunderings	1
and	1
voices:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
lamps	1
of	1
fire	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
glass	1
like	1
unto	1
crystal:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
were	1
four	1
beasts	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
before	1
and	1
behind.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
beast	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
beast	1
like	1
a	1
calf,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
beast	1
had	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
flying	1
eagle.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
had	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
six	1
wings	1
about	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
within:	1
and	1
they	1
rest	1
not	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
saying,	1
Holy,	1
holy,	1
holy,	1
LORD	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
which	1
was,	1
and	1
is,	1
and	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
when	1
those	1
beasts	1
give	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
thanks	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
who	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
4:10	1
The	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fall	1
down	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
and	1
cast	1
their	1
crowns	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
4:11	1
Thou	1
art	1
worthy,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
to	1
receive	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
power:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
created	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
pleasure	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
were	1
created.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
a	1
book	1
written	1
within	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
backside,	1
sealed	1
with	1
seven	1
seals.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
strong	1
angel	1
proclaiming	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Who	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
seals	1
thereof?	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
heaven,	1
nor	1
in	1
earth,	1
neither	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
neither	1
to	1
look	1
thereon.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
I	1
wept	1
much,	1
because	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
found	1
worthy	1
to	1
open	1
and	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
book,	1
neither	1
to	1
look	1
thereon.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Weep	1
not:	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lion	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Juda,	1
the	1
Root	1
of	1
David,	1
hath	1
prevailed	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
seven	1
seals	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
stood	1
a	1
Lamb	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
slain,	1
having	1
seven	1
horns	1
and	1
seven	1
eyes,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God	1
sent	1
forth	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
book,	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
and	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
having	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
harps,	1
and	1
golden	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
odours,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
they	1
sung	1
a	1
new	1
song,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
worthy	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
seals	1
thereof:	1
for	1
thou	1
wast	1
slain,	1
and	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
us	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
thy	1
blood	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
kindred,	1
and	1
tongue,	1
and	1
people,	1
and	1
nation;	1
5:10	1
And	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
unto	1
our	1
God	1
kings	1
and	1
priests:	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
reign	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
angels	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
and	1
the	1
elders:	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
and	1
thousands	1
of	1
thousands;	1
5:12	1
Saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Worthy	1
is	1
the	1
Lamb	1
that	1
was	1
slain	1
to	1
receive	1
power,	1
and	1
riches,	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
blessing.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
every	1
creature	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
them,	1
heard	1
I	1
saying,	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
power,	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
said,	1
Amen.	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
when	1
the	1
Lamb	1
opened	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seals,	1
and	1
I	1
heard,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thunder,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
saying,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
horse:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
a	1
bow;	1
and	1
a	1
crown	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
conquering,	1
and	1
to	1
conquer.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
second	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
second	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
another	1
horse	1
that	1
was	1
red:	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
thereon	1
to	1
take	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
kill	1
one	1
another:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
sword.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
third	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
third	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
lo	1
a	1
black	1
horse;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
balances	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
say,	1
A	1
measure	1
of	1
wheat	1
for	1
a	1
penny,	1
and	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
for	1
a	1
penny;	1
and	1
see	1
thou	1
hurt	1
not	1
the	1
oil	1
and	1
the	1
wine.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
fourth	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
pale	1
horse:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
was	1
Death,	1
and	1
Hell	1
followed	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
kill	1
with	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
hunger,	1
and	1
with	1
death,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
fifth	1
seal,	1
I	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
altar	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
which	1
they	1
held:	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
How	1
long,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
holy	1
and	1
true,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
judge	1
and	1
avenge	1
our	1
blood	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
white	1
robes	1
were	1
given	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
rest	1
yet	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
season,	1
until	1
their	1
fellowservants	1
also	1
and	1
their	1
brethren,	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
killed	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
sixth	1
seal,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
black	1
as	1
sackcloth	1
of	1
hair,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
became	1
as	1
blood;	1
6:13	1
And	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
casteth	1
her	1
untimely	1
figs,	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
shaken	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
wind.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
heaven	1
departed	1
as	1
a	1
scroll	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
rolled	1
together;	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
island	1
were	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
places.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
every	1
bondman,	1
and	1
every	1
free	1
man,	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
dens	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
6:16	1
And	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
rocks,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
hide	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb:	1
6:17	1
For	1
the	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
is	1
come;	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand?	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
four	1
angels	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
holding	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
the	1
wind	1
should	1
not	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
nor	1
on	1
any	1
tree.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
ascending	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
having	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God:	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
four	1
angels,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
hurt	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
7:3	1
Saying,	1
Hurt	1
not	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
the	1
sea,	1
nor	1
the	1
trees,	1
till	1
we	1
have	1
sealed	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
sealed:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
sealed	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1

the	1

Juda	1

thousand.	1

Benjamin	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:9	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
number,	1
of	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
kindreds,	1
and	1
people,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
clothed	1
with	1
white	1
robes,	1
and	1
palms	1
in	1
their	1
hands;	1
7:10	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Salvation	1
to	1
our	1
God	1
which	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
fell	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
on	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
7:12	1
Saying,	1
Amen:	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
might,	1
be	1
unto	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
answered,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
which	1
are	1
arrayed	1
in	1
white	1
robes?	1
and	1
whence	1
came	1
they?	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
thou	1
knowest.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
have	1
washed	1
their	1
robes,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
7:15	1
Therefore	1
are	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
in	1
his	1
temple:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
shall	1
dwell	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
7:16	1
They	1
shall	1
hunger	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
thirst	1
any	1
more;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sun	1
light	1
on	1
them,	1
nor	1
any	1
heat.	1
	1
7:17	1
For	1
the	1
Lamb	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
shall	1
feed	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
lead	1
them	1
unto	1
living	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters:	1
and	1
God	1
shall	1
wipe	1
away	1
all	1
tears	1
from	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
seventh	1
seal,	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
in	1
heaven	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
half	1
an	1
hour.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
stood	1
before	1
God;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
given	1
seven	1
trumpets.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
altar,	1
having	1
a	1
golden	1
censer;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
much	1
incense,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offer	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
all	1
saints	1
upon	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
incense,	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
ascended	1
up	1
before	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
angel's	1
hand.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
took	1
the	1
censer,	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
with	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
an	1
earthquake.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
trumpets	1
prepared	1
themselves	1
to	1
sound.	1
	1
8:7	1
The	1
first	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
there	1
followed	1
hail	1
and	1
fire	1
mingled	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
cast	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
trees	1
was	1
burnt	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
green	1
grass	1
was	1
burnt	1
up.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
mountain	1
burning	1
with	1
fire	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
became	1
blood;	1
8:9	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
creatures	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
had	1
life,	1
died;	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ships	1
were	1
destroyed.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
great	1
star	1
from	1
heaven,	1
burning	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
lamp,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters;	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
star	1
is	1
called	1
Wormwood:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
became	1
wormwood;	1
and	1
many	1
men	1
died	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
bitter.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
smitten,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stars;	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
shone	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
likewise.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
heard	1
an	1
angel	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Woe,	1
woe,	1
woe,	1
to	1
the	1
inhabiters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
angels,	1
which	1
are	1
yet	1
to	1
sound!	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
the	1
fifth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
star	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven	1
unto	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
given	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit;	1
and	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
furnace;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
were	1
darkened	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
locusts	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
was	1
given	1
power,	1
as	1
the	1
scorpions	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
power.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hurt	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
any	1
green	1
thing,	1
neither	1
any	1
tree;	1
but	1
only	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
kill	1
them,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
tormented	1
five	1
months:	1
and	1
their	1
torment	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
torment	1
of	1
a	1
scorpion,	1
when	1
he	1
striketh	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
men	1
seek	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it;	1
and	1
shall	1
desire	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
death	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
locusts	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
horses	1
prepared	1
unto	1
battle;	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
were	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
crowns	1
like	1
gold,	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
hair	1
as	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
women,	1
and	1
their	1
teeth	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
breastplates,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
breastplates	1
of	1
iron;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
wings	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
chariots	1
of	1
many	1
horses	1
running	1
to	1
battle.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
tails	1
like	1
unto	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
stings	1
in	1
their	1
tails:	1
and	1
their	1
power	1
was	1
to	1
hurt	1
men	1
five	1
months.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
them,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
whose	1
name	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
is	1
Abaddon,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Greek	1
tongue	1
hath	1
his	1
name	1
Apollyon.	1
	1
9:12	1
One	1
woe	1
is	1
past;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
come	1
two	1
woes	1
more	1
hereafter.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
God,	1
9:14	1
Saying	1
to	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
Loose	1
the	1
four	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
angels	1
were	1
loosed,	1
which	1
were	1
prepared	1
for	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
a	1
year,	1
for	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
thousand:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
them,	1
having	1
breastplates	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
of	1
jacinth,	1
and	1
brimstone:	1
and	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
lions;	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouths	1
issued	1
fire	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
brimstone.	1
	1
9:18	1
By	1
these	1
three	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
men	1
killed,	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
brimstone,	1
which	1
issued	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouths.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
their	1
power	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
tails:	1
for	1
their	1
tails	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
serpents,	1
and	1
had	1
heads,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
they	1
do	1
hurt.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
killed	1
by	1
these	1
plagues	1
yet	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
worship	1
devils,	1
and	1
idols	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
brass,	1
and	1
stone,	1
and	1
of	1
wood:	1
which	1
neither	1
can	1
see,	1
nor	1
hear,	1
nor	1
walk:	1
9:21	1
Neither	1
repented	1
they	1
of	1
their	1
murders,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
sorceries,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
fornication,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
thefts.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
mighty	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
cloud:	1
and	1
a	1
rainbow	1
was	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
pillars	1
of	1
fire:	1
10:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
little	1
book	1
open:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
right	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
10:3	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
lion	1
roareth:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cried,	1
seven	1
thunders	1
uttered	1
their	1
voices.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
thunders	1
had	1
uttered	1
their	1
voices,	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
write:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Seal	1
up	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
seven	1
thunders	1
uttered,	1
and	1
write	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
heaven,	1
10:6	1
And	1
sware	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
who	1
created	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
therein,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
time	1
no	1
longer:	1
10:7	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
sound,	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
finished,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
declared	1
to	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
from	1
heaven	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
which	1
is	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
standeth	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
little	1
book.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
it,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
up;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
make	1
thy	1
belly	1
bitter,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth	1
sweet	1
as	1
honey.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
angel's	1
hand,	1
and	1
ate	1
it	1
up;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
mouth	1
sweet	1
as	1
honey:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
eaten	1
it,	1
my	1
belly	1
was	1
bitter.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
must	1
prophesy	1
again	1
before	1
many	1
peoples,	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
and	1
kings.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
reed	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
rod:	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
stood,	1
saying,	1
Rise,	1
and	1
measure	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
therein.	1
	1
11:2	1
But	1
the	1
court	1
which	1
is	1
without	1
the	1
temple	1
leave	1
out,	1
and	1
measure	1
it	1
not;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
city	1
shall	1
they	1
tread	1
under	1
foot	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
power	1
unto	1
my	1
two	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
days,	1
clothed	1
in	1
sackcloth.	1
	1
11:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
olive	1
trees,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
candlesticks	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
fire	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
devoureth	1
their	1
enemies:	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
he	1
must	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
11:6	1
These	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
shut	1
heaven,	1
that	1
it	1
rain	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
prophecy:	1
and	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
waters	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
to	1
blood,	1
and	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
all	1
plagues,	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
they	1
will.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
finished	1
their	1
testimony,	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
ascendeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
shall	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
overcome	1
them,	1
and	1
kill	1
them.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
shall	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
city,	1
which	1
spiritually	1
is	1
called	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Egypt,	1
where	1
also	1
our	1
Lord	1
was	1
crucified.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
kindreds	1
and	1
tongues	1
and	1
nations	1
shall	1
see	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
an	1
half,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
suffer	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
graves.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
merry,	1
and	1
shall	1
send	1
gifts	1
one	1
to	1
another;	1
because	1
these	1
two	1
prophets	1
tormented	1
them	1
that	1
dwelt	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
an	1
half	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
God	1
entered	1
into	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
upon	1
their	1
feet;	1
and	1
great	1
fear	1
fell	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
saw	1
them.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither.	1
And	1
they	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
in	1
a	1
cloud;	1
and	1
their	1
enemies	1
beheld	1
them.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
fell,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earthquake	1
were	1
slain	1
of	1
men	1
seven	1
thousand:	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
were	1
affrighted,	1
and	1
gave	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:14	1
The	1
second	1
woe	1
is	1
past;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
third	1
woe	1
cometh	1
quickly.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel	1
sounded;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
voices	1
in	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
are	1
become	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
our	1
Lord,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
Christ;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders,	1
which	1
sat	1
before	1
God	1
on	1
their	1
seats,	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
11:17	1
Saying,	1
We	1
give	1
thee	1
thanks,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
which	1
art,	1
and	1
wast,	1
and	1
art	1
to	1
come;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
to	1
thee	1
thy	1
great	1
power,	1
and	1
hast	1
reigned.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
nations	1
were	1
angry,	1
and	1
thy	1
wrath	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
judged,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
give	1
reward	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
thy	1
name,	1
small	1
and	1
great;	1
and	1
shouldest	1
destroy	1
them	1
which	1
destroy	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
opened	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
seen	1
in	1
his	1
temple	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
his	1
testament:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
great	1
hail.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
a	1
great	1
wonder	1
in	1
heaven;	1
a	1
woman	1
clothed	1
with	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
under	1
her	1
feet,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
twelve	1
stars:	1
12:2	1
And	1
she	1
being	1
with	1
child	1
cried,	1
travailing	1
in	1
birth,	1
and	1
pained	1
to	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
another	1
wonder	1
in	1
heaven;	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
great	1
red	1
dragon,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns,	1
and	1
seven	1
crowns	1
upon	1
his	1
heads.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
his	1
tail	1
drew	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
delivered,	1
for	1
to	1
devour	1
her	1
child	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
born.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
a	1
man	1
child,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
rule	1
all	1
nations	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
her	1
child	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
unto	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
where	1
she	1
hath	1
a	1
place	1
prepared	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
feed	1
her	1
there	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
days.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
in	1
heaven:	1
Michael	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
dragon;	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
fought	1
and	1
his	1
angels,	1
12:8	1
And	1
prevailed	1
not;	1
neither	1
was	1
their	1
place	1
found	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
dragon	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
that	1
old	1
serpent,	1
called	1
the	1
Devil,	1
and	1
Satan,	1
which	1
deceiveth	1
the	1
whole	1
world:	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
were	1
cast	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Now	1
is	1
come	1
salvation,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
Christ:	1
for	1
the	1
accuser	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
is	1
cast	1
down,	1
which	1
accused	1
them	1
before	1
our	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
they	1
overcame	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
their	1
testimony;	1
and	1
they	1
loved	1
not	1
their	1
lives	1
unto	1
the	1
death.	1
	1
12:12	1
Therefore	1
rejoice,	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
them.	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
inhabiters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sea!	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
you,	1
having	1
great	1
wrath,	1
because	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
dragon	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
unto	1
the	1
earth,	1
he	1
persecuted	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
man	1
child.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
were	1
given	1
two	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
eagle,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
fly	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
into	1
her	1
place,	1
where	1
she	1
is	1
nourished	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
times,	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
time,	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
serpent.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
the	1
serpent	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
water	1
as	1
a	1
flood	1
after	1
the	1
woman,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
helped	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
up	1
the	1
flood	1
which	1
the	1
dragon	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
the	1
dragon	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
her	1
seed,	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
beast	1
rise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
horns	1
ten	1
crowns,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
heads	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
blasphemy.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
leopard,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
as	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
lion:	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
great	1
authority.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
heads	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
wounded	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
his	1
deadly	1
wound	1
was	1
healed:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
wondered	1
after	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
dragon	1
which	1
gave	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
beast:	1
and	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
beast,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
beast?	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
mouth	1
speaking	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
blasphemies;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
continue	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
blasphemy	1
against	1
God,	1
to	1
blaspheme	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
overcome	1
them:	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
over	1
all	1
kindreds,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
and	1
nations.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
worship	1
him,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
slain	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
13:9	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:10	1
He	1
that	1
leadeth	1
into	1
captivity	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
must	1
be	1
killed	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
patience	1
and	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
another	1
beast	1
coming	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
horns	1
like	1
a	1
lamb,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
as	1
a	1
dragon.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
he	1
exerciseth	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
beast	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
causeth	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
dwell	1
therein	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
first	1
beast,	1
whose	1
deadly	1
wound	1
was	1
healed.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
he	1
doeth	1
great	1
wonders,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
maketh	1
fire	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men,	1
13:14	1
And	1
deceiveth	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
those	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
beast;	1
saying	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
an	1
image	1
to	1
the	1
beast,	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
wound	1
by	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
did	1
live.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
life	1
unto	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
that	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
should	1
both	1
speak,	1
and	1
cause	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
not	1
worship	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
should	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
he	1
causeth	1
all,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
rich	1
and	1
poor,	1
free	1
and	1
bond,	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
mark	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads:	1
13:17	1
And	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
might	1
buy	1
or	1
sell,	1
save	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
mark,	1
or	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
13:18	1
Here	1
is	1
wisdom.	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding	1
count	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
beast:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
a	1
man;	1
and	1
his	1
number	1
is	1
Six	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
six.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
Lamb	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
hundred	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand,	1
having	1
his	1
Father's	1
name	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
thunder:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
harpers	1
harping	1
with	1
their	1
harps:	1
14:3	1
And	1
they	1
sung	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
new	1
song	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
the	1
elders:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
learn	1
that	1
song	1
but	1
the	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand,	1
which	1
were	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:4	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
defiled	1
with	1
women;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
virgins.	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
follow	1
the	1
Lamb	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
goeth.	1
These	1
were	1
redeemed	1
from	1
among	1
men,	1
being	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
mouth	1
was	1
found	1
no	1
guile:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
fault	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
having	1
the	1
everlasting	1
gospel	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
nation,	1
and	1
kindred,	1
and	1
tongue,	1
and	1
people,	1
14:7	1
Saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Fear	1
God,	1
and	1
give	1
glory	1
to	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
his	1
judgment	1
is	1
come:	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
another	1
angel,	1
saying,	1
Babylon	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
because	1
she	1
made	1
all	1
nations	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
fornication.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
followed	1
them,	1
saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
worship	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
receive	1
his	1
mark	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
or	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
14:10	1
The	1
same	1
shall	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
without	1
mixture	1
into	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
his	1
indignation;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
tormented	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
angels,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb:	1
14:11	1
And	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
their	1
torment	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
rest	1
day	1
nor	1
night,	1
who	1
worship	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
receiveth	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
14:12	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
the	1
saints:	1
here	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
henceforth:	1
Yea,	1
saith	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
rest	1
from	1
their	1
labours;	1
and	1
their	1
works	1
do	1
follow	1
them.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
cloud,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
cloud	1
one	1
sat	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
having	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
golden	1
crown,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
sharp	1
sickle.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
crying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
cloud,	1
Thrust	1
in	1
thy	1
sickle,	1
and	1
reap:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
reap;	1
for	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
ripe.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
cloud	1
thrust	1
in	1
his	1
sickle	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
reaped.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
he	1
also	1
having	1
a	1
sharp	1
sickle.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
altar,	1
which	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
fire;	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
cry	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
sharp	1
sickle,	1
saying,	1
Thrust	1
in	1
thy	1
sharp	1
sickle,	1
and	1
gather	1
the	1
clusters	1
of	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
her	1
grapes	1
are	1
fully	1
ripe.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
thrust	1
in	1
his	1
sickle	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
winepress	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
the	1
winepress	1
was	1
trodden	1
without	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
blood	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
winepress,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
horse	1
bridles,	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred	1
furlongs.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
sign	1
in	1
heaven,	1
great	1
and	1
marvellous,	1
seven	1
angels	1
having	1
the	1
seven	1
last	1
plagues;	1
for	1
in	1
them	1
is	1
filled	1
up	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
glass	1
mingled	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
gotten	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
mark,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
name,	1
stand	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
glass,	1
having	1
the	1
harps	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
they	1
sing	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
saying,	1
Great	1
and	1
marvellous	1
are	1
thy	1
works,	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty;	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
are	1
thy	1
ways,	1
thou	1
King	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
15:4	1
Who	1
shall	1
not	1
fear	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
and	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name?	1
for	1
thou	1
only	1
art	1
holy:	1
for	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thee;	1
for	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
made	1
manifest.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
in	1
heaven	1
was	1
opened:	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
having	1
the	1
seven	1
plagues,	1
clothed	1
in	1
pure	1
and	1
white	1
linen,	1
and	1
having	1
their	1
breasts	1
girded	1
with	1
golden	1
girdles.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
seven	1
golden	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
smoke	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
power;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
till	1
the	1
seven	1
plagues	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
were	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
saying	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
angels,	1
Go	1
your	1
ways,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
vials	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
went,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
noisome	1
and	1
grievous	1
sore	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
worshipped	1
his	1
image.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
as	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
man:	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
soul	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
rivers	1
and	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters;	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
blood.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
say,	1
Thou	1
art	1
righteous,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
which	1
art,	1
and	1
wast,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
judged	1
thus.	1
	1
16:6	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
saints	1
and	1
prophets,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
them	1
blood	1
to	1
drink;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
another	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
say,	1
Even	1
so,	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
are	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
scorch	1
men	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
men	1
were	1
scorched	1
with	1
great	1
heat,	1
and	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
these	1
plagues:	1
and	1
they	1
repented	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
glory.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
the	1
fifth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
beast;	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
darkness;	1
and	1
they	1
gnawed	1
their	1
tongues	1
for	1
pain,	1
16:11	1
And	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
pains	1
and	1
their	1
sores,	1
and	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Euphrates;	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
thereof	1
was	1
dried	1
up,	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
might	1
be	1
prepared.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
three	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
like	1
frogs	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
dragon,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
false	1
prophet.	1
	1
16:14	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
devils,	1
working	1
miracles,	1
which	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
to	1
gather	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
God	1
Almighty.	1
	1
16:15	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
watcheth,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
his	1
garments,	1
lest	1
he	1
walk	1
naked,	1
and	1
they	1
see	1
his	1
shame.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
Armageddon.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
heaven,	1
from	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
done.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunders,	1
and	1
lightnings;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
since	1
men	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
so	1
mighty	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
so	1
great.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
three	1
parts,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
fell:	1
and	1
great	1
Babylon	1
came	1
in	1
remembrance	1
before	1
God,	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
her	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
every	1
island	1
fled	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
not	1
found.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
there	1
fell	1
upon	1
men	1
a	1
great	1
hail	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
every	1
stone	1
about	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
a	1
talent:	1
and	1
men	1
blasphemed	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
the	1
hail;	1
for	1
the	1
plague	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceeding	1
great.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
vials,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Come	1
hither;	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
whore	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
many	1
waters:	1
17:2	1
With	1
whom	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
drunk	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
her	1
fornication.	1
	1
17:3	1
So	1
he	1
carried	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
woman	1
sit	1
upon	1
a	1
scarlet	1
coloured	1
beast,	1
full	1
of	1
names	1
of	1
blasphemy,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
arrayed	1
in	1
purple	1
and	1
scarlet	1
colour,	1
and	1
decked	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
precious	1
stones	1
and	1
pearls,	1
having	1
a	1
golden	1
cup	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
full	1
of	1
abominations	1
and	1
filthiness	1
of	1
her	1
fornication:	1
17:5	1
And	1
upon	1
her	1
forehead	1
was	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
MYSTERY,	1
BABYLON	1
THE	1
GREAT,	1
THE	1
MOTHER	1
OF	1
HARLOTS	1
AND	1
ABOMINATIONS	1
OF	1
THE	1
EARTH.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
woman	1
drunken	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
martyrs	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
her,	1
I	1
wondered	1
with	1
great	1
admiration.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
marvel?	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
carrieth	1
her,	1
which	1
hath	1
the	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
17:8	1
The	1
beast	1
that	1
thou	1
sawest	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not;	1
and	1
shall	1
ascend	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
perdition:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wonder,	1
whose	1
names	1
were	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
when	1
they	1
behold	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
yet	1
is.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
hath	1
wisdom.	1
The	1
seven	1
heads	1
are	1
seven	1
mountains,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
woman	1
sitteth.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
seven	1
kings:	1
five	1
are	1
fallen,	1
and	1
one	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
he	1
must	1
continue	1
a	1
short	1
space.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not,	1
even	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
eighth,	1
and	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
seven,	1
and	1
goeth	1
into	1
perdition.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
are	1
ten	1
kings,	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
no	1
kingdom	1
as	1
yet;	1
but	1
receive	1
power	1
as	1
kings	1
one	1
hour	1
with	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
17:13	1
These	1
have	1
one	1
mind,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
their	1
power	1
and	1
strength	1
unto	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
17:14	1
These	1
shall	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
overcome	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords,	1
and	1
King	1
of	1
kings:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him	1
are	1
called,	1
and	1
chosen,	1
and	1
faithful.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
waters	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
where	1
the	1
whore	1
sitteth,	1
are	1
peoples,	1
and	1
multitudes,	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
tongues.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
upon	1
the	1
beast,	1
these	1
shall	1
hate	1
the	1
whore,	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
her	1
desolate	1
and	1
naked,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
her	1
flesh,	1
and	1
burn	1
her	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
17:17	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
fulfil	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
to	1
agree,	1
and	1
give	1
their	1
kingdom	1
unto	1
the	1
beast,	1
until	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
is	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
which	1
reigneth	1
over	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
having	1
great	1
power;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
lightened	1
with	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
mightily	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Babylon	1
the	1
great	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen,	1
and	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
devils,	1
and	1
the	1
hold	1
of	1
every	1
foul	1
spirit,	1
and	1
a	1
cage	1
of	1
every	1
unclean	1
and	1
hateful	1
bird.	1
	1
18:3	1
For	1
all	1
nations	1
have	1
drunk	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
fornication,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
waxed	1
rich	1
through	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
her	1
delicacies.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
another	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
out	1
of	1
her,	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
partakers	1
of	1
her	1
sins,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
of	1
her	1
plagues.	1
	1
18:5	1
For	1
her	1
sins	1
have	1
reached	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
remembered	1
her	1
iniquities.	1
	1
18:6	1
Reward	1
her	1
even	1
as	1
she	1
rewarded	1
you,	1
and	1
double	1
unto	1
her	1
double	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
works:	1
in	1
the	1
cup	1
which	1
she	1
hath	1
filled	1
fill	1
to	1
her	1
double.	1
	1
18:7	1
How	1
much	1
she	1
hath	1
glorified	1
herself,	1
and	1
lived	1
deliciously,	1
so	1
much	1
torment	1
and	1
sorrow	1
give	1
her:	1
for	1
she	1
saith	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
I	1
sit	1
a	1
queen,	1
and	1
am	1
no	1
widow,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
no	1
sorrow.	1
	1
18:8	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
her	1
plagues	1
come	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
death,	1
and	1
mourning,	1
and	1
famine;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
burned	1
with	1
fire:	1
for	1
strong	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
who	1
judgeth	1
her.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
who	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication	1
and	1
lived	1
deliciously	1
with	1
her,	1
shall	1
bewail	1
her,	1
and	1
lament	1
for	1
her,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
her	1
burning,	1
18:10	1
Standing	1
afar	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
torment,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
mighty	1
city!	1
for	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
is	1
thy	1
judgment	1
come.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
weep	1
and	1
mourn	1
over	1
her;	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
buyeth	1
their	1
merchandise	1
any	1
more:	1
18:12	1
The	1
merchandise	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
of	1
pearls,	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
silk,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
all	1
thyine	1
wood,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
vessels	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
vessels	1
of	1
most	1
precious	1
wood,	1
and	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
iron,	1
and	1
marble,	1
18:13	1
And	1
cinnamon,	1
and	1
odours,	1
and	1
ointments,	1
and	1
frankincense,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
fine	1

and	1

and	1
horses,	1
and	1
chariots,	1
and	1
slaves,	1
and	1
souls	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
the	1
fruits	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
lusted	1
after	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
dainty	1
and	1
goodly	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
them	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:15	1
The	1
merchants	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
rich	1
by	1
her,	1
shall	1
stand	1
afar	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
torment,	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
18:16	1
And	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
that	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
decked	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
pearls!	1
	1
18:17	1
For	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
so	1
great	1
riches	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
nought.	1
And	1
every	1
shipmaster,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
ships,	1
and	1
sailors,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
trade	1
by	1
sea,	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
18:18	1
And	1
cried	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
her	1
burning,	1
saying,	1
What	1
city	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city!	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
dust	1
on	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
cried,	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
wherein	1
were	1
made	1
rich	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
ships	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
her	1
costliness!	1
for	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
is	1
she	1
made	1
desolate.	1
	1
18:20	1
Rejoice	1
over	1
her,	1
thou	1
heaven,	1
and	1
ye	1
holy	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
avenged	1
you	1
on	1
her.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
a	1
mighty	1
angel	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
stone	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
millstone,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
with	1
violence	1
shall	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Babylon	1
be	1
thrown	1
down,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
harpers,	1
and	1
musicians,	1
and	1
of	1
pipers,	1
and	1
trumpeters,	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
no	1
craftsman,	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
craft	1
he	1
be,	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
millstone	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
18:23	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
shall	1
shine	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee:	1
for	1
thy	1
merchants	1
were	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
by	1
thy	1
sorceries	1
were	1
all	1
nations	1
deceived.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
was	1
found	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
saints,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
of	1
much	1
people	1
in	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Alleluia;	1
Salvation,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
power,	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God:	1
19:2	1
For	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
are	1
his	1
judgments:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
judged	1
the	1
great	1
whore,	1
which	1
did	1
corrupt	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
her	1
fornication,	1
and	1
hath	1
avenged	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
at	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
again	1
they	1
said,	1
Alleluia	1
And	1
her	1
smoke	1
rose	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
Amen;	1
Alleluia.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
Praise	1
our	1
God,	1
all	1
ye	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
him,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mighty	1
thunderings,	1
saying,	1
Alleluia:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
omnipotent	1
reigneth.	1
	1
19:7	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
give	1
honour	1
to	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hath	1
made	1
herself	1
ready.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
granted	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
arrayed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
clean	1
and	1
white:	1
for	1
the	1
fine	1
linen	1
is	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
marriage	1
supper	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
true	1
sayings	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
See	1
thou	1
do	1
it	1
not:	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
worship	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
heaven	1
opened,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
horse;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
him	1
was	1
called	1
Faithful	1
and	1
True,	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness	1
he	1
doth	1
judge	1
and	1
make	1
war.	1
	1
19:12	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
were	1
many	1
crowns;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
knew,	1
but	1
he	1
himself.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
vesture	1
dipped	1
in	1
blood:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
called	1
The	1
Word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
the	1
armies	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
heaven	1
followed	1
him	1
upon	1
white	1
horses,	1
clothed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
white	1
and	1
clean.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
goeth	1
a	1
sharp	1
sword,	1
that	1
with	1
it	1
he	1
should	1
smite	1
the	1
nations:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
he	1
treadeth	1
the	1
winepress	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
and	1
wrath	1
of	1
Almighty	1
God.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
on	1
his	1
vesture	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
thigh	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
KING	1
OF	1
KINGS,	1
AND	1
LORD	1
OF	1
LORDS.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
angel	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
that	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
Come	1
and	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
supper	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God;	1
19:18	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
horses,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
both	1
free	1
and	1
bond,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
armies,	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
horse,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
false	1
prophet	1
that	1
wrought	1
miracles	1
before	1
him,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
deceived	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worshipped	1
his	1
image.	1
These	1
both	1
were	1
cast	1
alive	1
into	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
burning	1
with	1
brimstone.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
horse,	1
which	1
sword	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
their	1
flesh.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
having	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
chain	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
dragon,	1
that	1
old	1
serpent,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Devil,	1
and	1
Satan,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
20:3	1
And	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
and	1
shut	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
seal	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
deceive	1
the	1
nations	1
no	1
more,	1
till	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
loosed	1
a	1
little	1
season.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
thrones,	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
judgment	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
beheaded	1
for	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
worshipped	1
the	1
beast,	1
neither	1
his	1
image,	1
neither	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
mark	1
upon	1
their	1
foreheads,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
they	1
lived	1
and	1
reigned	1
with	1
Christ	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
	1
20:5	1
But	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
lived	1
not	1
again	1
until	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
were	1
finished.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection.	1
	1
20:6	1
Blessed	1
and	1
holy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection:	1
on	1
such	1
the	1
second	1
death	1
hath	1
no	1
power,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
priests	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
shall	1
reign	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
are	1
expired,	1
Satan	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
prison,	1
20:8	1
And	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
deceive	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Gog,	1
and	1
Magog,	1
to	1
gather	1
them	1
together	1
to	1
battle:	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
whom	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
compassed	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
beloved	1
city:	1
and	1
fire	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
devoured	1
them.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
that	1
deceived	1
them	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone,	1
where	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
the	1
false	1
prophet	1
are,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
tormented	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
white	1
throne,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
it,	1
from	1
whose	1
face	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
fled	1
away;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
found	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
dead,	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
stand	1
before	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
opened:	1
and	1
another	1
book	1
was	1
opened,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life:	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
were	1
judged	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
books,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
death	1
and	1
hell	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
judged	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
death	1
and	1
hell	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
whosoever	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
heaven	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
earth	1
were	1
passed	1
away;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1

	1
21:2	1
And	1
I	1
John	1
saw	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
new	1
Jerusalem,	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
prepared	1
as	1
a	1
bride	1
adorned	1
for	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
dwell	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
God	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
God	1
shall	1
wipe	1
away	1
all	1
tears	1
from	1
their	1
eyes;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
death,	1
neither	1
sorrow,	1
nor	1
crying,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
pain:	1
for	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
are	1
passed	1
away.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
new.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write:	1
for	1
these	1
words	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
faithful.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
It	1
is	1
done.	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end.	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
athirst	1
of	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
life	1
freely.	1
	1
21:7	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh	1
shall	1
inherit	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
21:8	1
But	1
the	1
fearful,	1
and	1
unbelieving,	1
and	1
the	1
abominable,	1
and	1
murderers,	1
and	1
whoremongers,	1
and	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
idolaters,	1
and	1
all	1
liars,	1
shall	1
have	1
their	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
lake	1
which	1
burneth	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone:	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
last	1
plagues,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
hither,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
bride,	1
the	1
Lamb's	1
wife.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
the	1
holy	1
Jerusalem,	1
descending	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
God,	1
21:11	1
Having	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
her	1
light	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
stone	1
most	1
precious,	1
even	1
like	1
a	1
jasper	1
stone,	1
clear	1
as	1
crystal;	1
21:12	1
And	1
had	1
a	1
wall	1
great	1
and	1
high,	1
and	1
had	1
twelve	1
gates,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
twelve	1
angels,	1
and	1
names	1
written	1
thereon,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
21:13	1
On	1
the	1
east	1
three	1
gates;	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
three	1
gates;	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
three	1
gates;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
three	1
gates.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
twelve	1
foundations,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
had	1
a	1
golden	1
reed	1
to	1
measure	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
lieth	1
foursquare,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
is	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
breadth:	1
and	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
reed,	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
furlongs.	1
	1
The	1
length	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
equal.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
cubits,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
the	1
angel.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
jasper:	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
pure	1
gold,	1
like	1
unto	1
clear	1
glass.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
were	1
garnished	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
stones.	1
The	1
first	1
foundation	1
was	1
jasper;	1
the	1
second,	1
sapphire;	1
the	1
third,	1
a	1
chalcedony;	1
the	1
fourth,	1
an	1
emerald;	1
21:20	1
The	1
fifth,	1
sardonyx;	1
the	1
sixth,	1
sardius;	1
the	1
seventh,	1
chrysolyte;	1
the	1
eighth,	1
beryl;	1
the	1
ninth,	1
a	1
topaz;	1
the	1
tenth,	1
a	1
chrysoprasus;	1
the	1
eleventh,	1
a	1
jacinth;	1
the	1
twelfth,	1
an	1
amethyst.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
the	1
twelve	1
gates	1
were	1
twelve	1
pearls:	1
every	1
several	1
gate	1
was	1
of	1
one	1
pearl:	1
and	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
pure	1
gold,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
transparent	1
glass.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
temple	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
to	1
shine	1
in	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
lighten	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
saved	1
shall	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
bring	1
their	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
day:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
night	1
there.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
enter	1
into	1
it	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
defileth,	1
neither	1
whatsoever	1
worketh	1
abomination,	1
or	1
maketh	1
a	1
lie:	1
but	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
Lamb's	1
book	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
me	1
a	1
pure	1
river	1
of	1
water	1
of	1
life,	1
clear	1
as	1
crystal,	1
proceeding	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
22:2	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
bare	1
twelve	1
manner	1
of	1
fruits,	1
and	1
yielded	1
her	1
fruit	1
every	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
healing	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
curse:	1
but	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
shall	1
serve	1
him:	1
22:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
face;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
night	1
there;	1
and	1
they	1
need	1
no	1
candle,	1
neither	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun;	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
giveth	1
them	1
light:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
sayings	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
true:	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
sent	1
his	1
angel	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
22:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly:	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
I	1
John	1
saw	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
heard	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen,	1
I	1
fell	1
down	1
to	1
worship	1
before	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
shewed	1
me	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
See	1
thou	1
do	1
it	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
this	1
book:	1
worship	1
God.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Seal	1
not	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
22:11	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unjust,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
unjust	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
filthy,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
filthy	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
righteous,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
righteous	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holy,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
holy	1
still.	1
	1
22:12	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly;	1
and	1
my	1
reward	1
is	1
with	1
me,	1
to	1
give	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
his	1
work	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
22:13	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last.	1
	1
22:14	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
do	1
his	1
commandments,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
may	1
enter	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
gates	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
22:15	1
For	1
without	1
are	1
dogs,	1
and	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
whoremongers,	1
and	1
murderers,	1
and	1
idolaters,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
loveth	1
and	1
maketh	1
a	1
lie.	1
	1
22:16	1
I	1
Jesus	1
have	1
sent	1
mine	1
angel	1
to	1
testify	1
unto	1
you	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
churches.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1

offspring	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
the	1

star.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
the	1
bride	1
say,	1
Come.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
heareth	1
say,	1
Come.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
athirst	1
come.	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
life	1
freely.	1
	1
22:18	1
For	1
I	1
testify	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1

If	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
add	1
unto	1
these	1
things,	1
God	1
shall	1
add	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
plagues	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1

22:19	1

man	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
this	1

God	1

	1
22:20	1
He	1
which	1
testifieth	1
these	1
things	1
saith,	1
Surely	1
I	1
come	1
quickly.	1
Amen.	1
	1
Even	1
so,	1

SCANDAL	1
IN	1

	1
I.	1
	1
To	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
she	1
is	1
always	1
THE	1
woman.	1
I	1
have	1
seldom	1
heard	1
him	1
mention	1
her	1
under	1
any	1
other	1
name.	1
In	1
his	1
eyes	1
she	1
eclipses	1
and	1
predominates	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
sex.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
any	1
emotion	1
akin	1
to	1
love	1
for	1
Irene	1
Adler.	1
All	1
emotions,	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
particularly,	1
were	1
abhorrent	1
to	1
his	1
cold,	1
precise	1
but	1
admirably	1
balanced	1
mind.	1
He	1
was,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
reasoning	1
and	1
observing	1
machine	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
has	1
seen,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
lover	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
placed	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
false	1
position.	1
He	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
softer	1
passions,	1
save	1
with	1
a	1
gibe	1
and	1
a	1
sneer.	1
They	1
were	1
admirable	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
observer--excellent	1
for	1
drawing	1
the	1
veil	1
from	1
men's	1
motives	1
and	1
actions.	1
But	1
for	1
the	1
trained	1
reasoner	1
to	1
admit	1
such	1
intrusions	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
delicate	1
and	1
finely	1
adjusted	1
temperament	1
was	1
to	1
introduce	1
a	1
distracting	1
factor	1
which	1
might	1
throw	1
a	1
doubt	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
mental	1
results.	1
Grit	1
in	1
a	1
sensitive	1
instrument,	1
or	1
a	1
crack	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
high-power	1
lenses,	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
disturbing	1
than	1
a	1
strong	1
emotion	1
in	1
a	1
nature	1
such	1
as	1
his.	1
And	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
woman	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
woman	1
was	1
the	1
late	1
Irene	1
Adler,	1
of	1
dubious	1
and	1
questionable	1
memory.	1
	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
little	1
of	1
Holmes	1
lately.	1
My	1
marriage	1
had	1
drifted	1
us	1
away	1
from	1
each	1
other.	1
My	1
own	1
complete	1
happiness,	1
and	1
the	1
home-centred	1
interests	1
which	1
rise	1
up	1
around	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
first	1
finds	1
himself	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
establishment,	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
absorb	1
all	1
my	1
attention,	1
while	1
Holmes,	1
who	1
loathed	1
every	1
form	1
of	1
society	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
Bohemian	1
soul,	1
remained	1
in	1
our	1
lodgings	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
buried	1
among	1
his	1
old	1
books,	1
and	1
alternating	1
from	1
week	1
to	1
week	1
between	1
cocaine	1
and	1
ambition,	1
the	1
drowsiness	1
of	1
the	1
drug,	1
and	1
the	1
fierce	1
energy	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
keen	1
nature.	1
He	1
was	1
still,	1
as	1
ever,	1
deeply	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
crime,	1
and	1
occupied	1
his	1
immense	1
faculties	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
powers	1
of	1
observation	1
in	1
following	1
out	1
those	1
clues,	1
and	1
clearing	1
up	1
those	1
mysteries	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
as	1
hopeless	1
by	1
the	1
official	1
police.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
I	1
heard	1
some	1
vague	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
doings:	1
of	1
his	1
summons	1
to	1
Odessa	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Trepoff	1
murder,	1
of	1
his	1
clearing	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
singular	1
tragedy	1
of	1
the	1
Atkinson	1
brothers	1
at	1
Trincomalee,	1
and	1
finally	1
of	1
the	1
mission	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
accomplished	1
so	1
delicately	1
and	1
successfully	1
for	1
the	1
reigning	1
family	1
of	1
Holland.	1
Beyond	1
these	1
signs	1
of	1
his	1
activity,	1
however,	1
which	1
I	1
merely	1
shared	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
readers	1
of	1
the	1
daily	1
press,	1
I	1
knew	1
little	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
friend	1
and	1
companion.	1
	1
One	1
night--it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
twentieth	1
of	1
March,	1
1888--I	1
was	1
returning	1
from	1
a	1
journey	1
to	1
a	1
patient	1
(for	1
I	1
had	1
now	1
returned	1
to	1
civil	1
practice),	1
when	1
my	1
way	1
led	1
me	1
through	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
As	1
I	1
passed	1
the	1
well-remembered	1
door,	1
which	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
associated	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
with	1
my	1
wooing,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
dark	1
incidents	1
of	1
the	1
Study	1
in	1
Scarlet,	1
I	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
a	1
keen	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
Holmes	1
again,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
employing	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
powers.	1
His	1
rooms	1
were	1
brilliantly	1
lit,	1
and,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
looked	1
up,	1
I	1
saw	1
his	1
tall,	1
spare	1
figure	1
pass	1
twice	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
silhouette	1
against	1
the	1
blind.	1
He	1
was	1
pacing	1
the	1
room	1
swiftly,	1
eagerly,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
upon	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
clasped	1
behind	1
him.	1
To	1
me,	1
who	1
knew	1
his	1
every	1
mood	1
and	1
habit,	1
his	1
attitude	1
and	1
manner	1
told	1
their	1
own	1
story.	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
again.	1
He	1
had	1
risen	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
drug-created	1
dreams	1
and	1
was	1
hot	1
upon	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
some	1
new	1
problem.	1
I	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
was	1
shown	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chamber	1
which	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
in	1
part	1
my	1
own.	1
	1
His	1
manner	1
was	1
not	1
effusive.	1
It	1
seldom	1
was;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
glad,	1
I	1
think,	1
to	1
see	1
me.	1
With	1
hardly	1
a	1
word	1
spoken,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
kindly	1
eye,	1
he	1
waved	1
me	1
to	1
an	1
armchair,	1
threw	1
across	1
his	1
case	1
of	1
cigars,	1
and	1
indicated	1
a	1
spirit	1
case	1
and	1
a	1
gasogene	1
in	1
the	1
corner.	1
Then	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
looked	1
me	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
singular	1
introspective	1
fashion.	1
	1
"Wedlock	1
suits	1
you,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
seven	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
pounds	1
since	1
I	1
saw	1
you."	1
	1
"Seven!"	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
a	1
little	1
more.	1
Just	1
a	1
trifle	1
more,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
Watson.	1
And	1
in	1
practice	1
again,	1
I	1
observe.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
intended	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
harness."	1
	1
"Then,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know?"	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
it,	1
I	1
deduce	1
it.	1
How	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
getting	1
yourself	1
very	1
wet	1
lately,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
most	1
clumsy	1
and	1
careless	1
servant	1
girl?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"this	1
is	1
too	1
much.	1
You	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
been	1
burned,	1
had	1
you	1
lived	1
a	1
few	1
centuries	1
ago.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
country	1
walk	1
on	1
Thursday	1
and	1
came	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
mess,	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
changed	1
my	1
clothes	1
I	1
can't	1
imagine	1
how	1
you	1
deduce	1
it.	1
As	1
to	1
Mary	1
Jane,	1
she	1
is	1
incorrigible,	1
and	1
my	1
wife	1
has	1
given	1
her	1
notice,	1
but	1
there,	1
again,	1
I	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
you	1
work	1
it	1
out."	1
	1
He	1
chuckled	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
long,	1
nervous	1
hands	1
together.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
simplicity	1
itself,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"my	1
eyes	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
your	1
left	1
shoe,	1
just	1
where	1
the	1
firelight	1
strikes	1
it,	1
the	1
leather	1
is	1
scored	1
by	1
six	1
almost	1
parallel	1
cuts.	1
Obviously	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
caused	1
by	1
someone	1
who	1
has	1
very	1
carelessly	1
scraped	1
round	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
sole	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
remove	1
crusted	1
mud	1
from	1
it.	1
Hence,	1
you	1
see,	1
my	1
double	1
deduction	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
in	1
vile	1
weather,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
particularly	1
malignant	1
boot-slitting	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
London	1
slavey.	1
As	1
to	1
your	1
practice,	1
if	1
a	1
gentleman	1
walks	1
into	1
my	1
rooms	1
smelling	1
of	1
iodoform,	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
mark	1
of	1
nitrate	1
of	1
silver	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
forefinger,	1
and	1
a	1
bulge	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
top-hat	1
to	1
show	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
secreted	1
his	1
stethoscope,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
dull,	1
indeed,	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pronounce	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
active	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
medical	1
profession."	1
	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
explained	1
his	1
process	1
of	1
deduction.	1
"When	1
I	1
hear	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
reasons,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
"the	1
thing	1
always	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
ridiculously	1
simple	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
easily	1
do	1
it	1
myself,	1
though	1
at	1
each	1
successive	1
instance	1
of	1
your	1
reasoning	1
I	1
am	1
baffled	1
until	1
you	1
explain	1
your	1
process.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
my	1
eyes	1
are	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
yours."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigarette,	1
and	1
throwing	1
himself	1
down	1
into	1
an	1
armchair.	1
"You	1
see,	1
but	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
observe.	1
The	1
distinction	1
is	1
clear.	1
For	1
example,	1
you	1
have	1
frequently	1
seen	1
the	1
steps	1
which	1
lead	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
this	1
room."	1
	1
"Frequently."	1
	1
"How	1
often?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
some	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times."	1
	1
"Then	1
how	1
many	1
are	1
there?"	1
	1
"How	1
many?	1
I	1
don't	1
know."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so!	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
observed.	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
have	1
seen.	1
That	1
is	1
just	1
my	1
point.	1
Now,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
seventeen	1
steps,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
both	1
seen	1
and	1
observed.	1
By-the-way,	1
since	1
you	1
are	1
interested	1
in	1
these	1
little	1
problems,	1
and	1
since	1
you	1
are	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
chronicle	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
my	1
trifling	1
experiences,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
this."	1
He	1
threw	1
over	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
thick,	1
pink-tinted	1
note-paper	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
lying	1
open	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
"It	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
post,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Read	1
it	1
aloud."	1
	1
The	1
note	1
was	1
undated,	1
and	1
without	1
either	1
signature	1
or	1
address.	1
	1
"There	1
will	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
to-night,	1
at	1
a	1
quarter	1
to	1
eight	1
o'clock,"	1
it	1
said,	1
"a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
desires	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
upon	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
deepest	1
moment.	1
Your	1
recent	1
services	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
royal	1
houses	1
of	1
Europe	1
have	1
shown	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
one	1
who	1
may	1
safely	1
be	1
trusted	1
with	1
matters	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
an	1
importance	1
which	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
exaggerated.	1
This	1
account	1
of	1
you	1
we	1
have	1
from	1
all	1
quarters	1
received.	1
Be	1
in	1
your	1
chamber	1
then	1
at	1
that	1
hour,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
amiss	1
if	1
your	1
visitor	1
wear	1
a	1
mask."	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
mystery,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
it	1
means?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
data	1
yet.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
mistake	1
to	1
theorize	1
before	1
one	1
has	1
data.	1
Insensibly	1
one	1
begins	1
to	1
twist	1
facts	1
to	1
suit	1
theories,	1
instead	1
of	1
theories	1
to	1
suit	1
facts.	1
But	1
the	1
note	1
itself.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
deduce	1
from	1
it?"	1
	1
I	1
carefully	1
examined	1
the	1
writing,	1
and	1
the	1
paper	1
upon	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
written.	1
	1
"The	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
it	1
was	1
presumably	1
well	1
to	1
do,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
imitate	1
my	1
companion's	1
processes.	1
"Such	1
paper	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
bought	1
under	1
half	1
a	1
crown	1
a	1
packet.	1
It	1
is	1
peculiarly	1
strong	1
and	1
stiff."	1
	1
"Peculiar--that	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
word,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
English	1
paper	1
at	1
all.	1
Hold	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
light."	1
	1
I	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
large	1
"E"	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
"g,"	1
a	1
"P,"	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
"G"	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
"t"	1
woven	1
into	1
the	1
texture	1
of	1
the	1
paper.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"The	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
maker,	1
no	1
doubt;	1
or	1
his	1
monogram,	1
rather."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
'G'	1
with	1
the	1
small	1
't'	1
stands	1
for	1
'Gesellschaft,'	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
German	1
for	1
'Company.'	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
customary	1
contraction	1
like	1
our	1
'Co.'	1
'P,'	1
of	1
course,	1
stands	1
for	1
'Papier.'	1
Now	1
for	1
the	1
'Eg.'	1
Let	1
us	1
glance	1
at	1
our	1
Continental	1
Gazetteer."	1
He	1
took	1
down	1
a	1
heavy	1
brown	1
volume	1
from	1
his	1
shelves.	1
"Eglow,	1
Eglonitz--here	1
we	1
are,	1
Egria.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
German-speaking	1
country--in	1
Bohemia,	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Carlsbad.	1
'Remarkable	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Wallenstein,	1
and	1
for	1
its	1
numerous	1
glass-factories	1
and	1
paper-mills.'	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
my	1
boy,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
that?"	1
His	1
eyes	1
sparkled,	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
blue	1
triumphant	1
cloud	1
from	1
his	1
cigarette.	1
	1
"The	1
paper	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
Bohemia,"	1
I	1
said.	1
	1
"Precisely.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
the	1
note	1
is	1
a	1
German.	1
Do	1
you	1
note	1
the	1
peculiar	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
sentence--'This	1
account	1
of	1
you	1
we	1
have	1
from	1
all	1
quarters	1
received.'	1
A	1
Frenchman	1
or	1
Russian	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
written	1
that.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
German	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
uncourteous	1
to	1
his	1
verbs.	1
It	1
only	1
remains,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
is	1
wanted	1
by	1
this	1
German	1
who	1
writes	1
upon	1
Bohemian	1
paper	1
and	1
prefers	1
wearing	1
a	1
mask	1
to	1
showing	1
his	1
face.	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
comes,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mistaken,	1
to	1
resolve	1
all	1
our	1
doubts."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sharp	1
sound	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
and	1
grating	1
wheels	1
against	1
the	1
curb,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
sharp	1
pull	1
at	1
the	1
bell.	1
Holmes	1
whistled.	1
	1
"A	1
pair,	1
by	1
the	1
sound,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
glancing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
"A	1
nice	1
little	1
brougham	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
beauties.	1
A	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
guineas	1
apiece.	1
There's	1
money	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
Watson,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
else."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
go,	1
Holmes."	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
bit,	1
Doctor.	1
Stay	1
where	1
you	1
are.	1
I	1
am	1
lost	1
without	1
my	1
Boswell.	1
And	1
this	1
promises	1
to	1
be	1
interesting.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
miss	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
your	1
client--"	1
	1
"Never	1
mind	1
him.	1
I	1
may	1
want	1
your	1
help,	1
and	1
so	1
may	1
he.	1
Here	1
he	1
comes.	1
Sit	1
down	1
in	1
that	1
armchair,	1
Doctor,	1
and	1
give	1
us	1
your	1
best	1
attention."	1
	1
A	1
slow	1
and	1
heavy	1
step,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
heard	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
paused	1
immediately	1
outside	1
the	1
door.	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
authoritative	1
tap.	1
	1
"Come	1
in!"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
A	1
man	1
entered	1
who	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
less	1
than	1
six	1
feet	1
six	1
inches	1
in	1
height,	1
with	1
the	1
chest	1
and	1
limbs	1
of	1
a	1
Hercules.	1
His	1
dress	1
was	1
rich	1
with	1
a	1
richness	1
which	1
would,	1
in	1
England,	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
akin	1
to	1
bad	1
taste.	1
Heavy	1
bands	1
of	1
astrakhan	1
were	1
slashed	1
across	1
the	1
sleeves	1
and	1
fronts	1
of	1
his	1
double-breasted	1
coat,	1
while	1
the	1
deep	1
blue	1
cloak	1
which	1
was	1
thrown	1
over	1
his	1
shoulders	1
was	1
lined	1
with	1
flame-coloured	1
silk	1
and	1
secured	1
at	1
the	1
neck	1
with	1
a	1
brooch	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
flaming	1
beryl.	1
Boots	1
which	1
extended	1
halfway	1
up	1
his	1
calves,	1
and	1
which	1
were	1
trimmed	1
at	1
the	1
tops	1
with	1
rich	1
brown	1
fur,	1
completed	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
barbaric	1
opulence	1
which	1
was	1
suggested	1
by	1
his	1
whole	1
appearance.	1
He	1
carried	1
a	1
broad-brimmed	1
hat	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
while	1
he	1
wore	1
across	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
extending	1
down	1
past	1
the	1
cheekbones,	1
a	1
black	1
vizard	1
mask,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
apparently	1
adjusted	1
that	1
very	1
moment,	1
for	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
still	1
raised	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
From	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
strong	1
character,	1
with	1
a	1
thick,	1
hanging	1
lip,	1
and	1
a	1
long,	1
straight	1
chin	1
suggestive	1
of	1
resolution	1
pushed	1
to	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
obstinacy.	1
	1
"You	1
had	1
my	1
note?"	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
harsh	1
voice	1
and	1
a	1
strongly	1
marked	1
German	1
accent.	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
call."	1
He	1
looked	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us,	1
as	1
if	1
uncertain	1
which	1
to	1
address.	1
	1
"Pray	1
take	1
a	1
seat,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
colleague,	1
Dr.	1
Watson,	1
who	1
is	1
occasionally	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
cases.	1
Whom	1
have	1
I	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
address?"	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
address	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
Count	1
Von	1
Kramm,	1
a	1
Bohemian	1
nobleman.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
this	1
gentleman,	1
your	1
friend,	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
discretion,	1
whom	1
I	1
may	1
trust	1
with	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
extreme	1
importance.	1
If	1
not,	1
I	1
should	1
much	1
prefer	1
to	1
communicate	1
with	1
you	1
alone."	1
	1
I	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
Holmes	1
caught	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
wrist	1
and	1
pushed	1
me	1
back	1
into	1
my	1
chair.	1
"It	1
is	1
both,	1
or	1
none,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
may	1
say	1
before	1
this	1
gentleman	1
anything	1
which	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
Count	1
shrugged	1
his	1
broad	1
shoulders.	1
"Then	1
I	1
must	1
begin,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"by	1
binding	1
you	1
both	1
to	1
absolute	1
secrecy	1
for	1
two	1
years;	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
matter	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
importance.	1
At	1
present	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
weight	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
an	1
influence	1
upon	1
European	1
history."	1
	1
"I	1
promise,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"And	1
I."	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
this	1
mask,"	1
continued	1
our	1
strange	1
visitor.	1
"The	1
august	1
person	1
who	1
employs	1
me	1
wishes	1
his	1
agent	1
to	1
be	1
unknown	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
confess	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
the	1
title	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
called	1
myself	1
is	1
not	1
exactly	1
my	1
own."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
dryly.	1
	1
"The	1
circumstances	1
are	1
of	1
great	1
delicacy,	1
and	1
every	1
precaution	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
quench	1
what	1
might	1
grow	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
immense	1
scandal	1
and	1
seriously	1
compromise	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
reigning	1
families	1
of	1
Europe.	1
To	1
speak	1
plainly,	1
the	1
matter	1
implicates	1
the	1
great	1
House	1
of	1
Ormstein,	1
hereditary	1
kings	1
of	1
Bohemia."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
also	1
aware	1
of	1
that,"	1
murmured	1
Holmes,	1
settling	1
himself	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
glanced	1
with	1
some	1
apparent	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
languid,	1
lounging	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
doubt	1
depicted	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
incisive	1
reasoner	1
and	1
most	1
energetic	1
agent	1
in	1
Europe.	1
Holmes	1
slowly	1
reopened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
impatiently	1
at	1
his	1
gigantic	1
client.	1
	1
"If	1
your	1
Majesty	1
would	1
condescend	1
to	1
state	1
your	1
case,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
advise	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
man	1
sprang	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
uncontrollable	1
agitation.	1
Then,	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
desperation,	1
he	1
tore	1
the	1
mask	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
hurled	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
"You	1
are	1
right,"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
King.	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
attempt	1
to	1
conceal	1
it?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
indeed?"	1
murmured	1
Holmes.	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
addressing	1
Wilhelm	1
Gottsreich	1
Sigismond	1
von	1
Ormstein,	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
of	1
Cassel-Felstein,	1
and	1
hereditary	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
can	1
understand,"	1
said	1
our	1
strange	1
visitor,	1
sitting	1
down	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
passing	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
high	1
white	1
forehead,	1
"you	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
accustomed	1
to	1
doing	1
such	1
business	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
person.	1
Yet	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
so	1
delicate	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
confide	1
it	1
to	1
an	1
agent	1
without	1
putting	1
myself	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
incognito	1
from	1
Prague	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
consulting	1
you."	1
	1
"Then,	1
pray	1
consult,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
shutting	1
his	1
eyes	1
once	1
more.	1
	1
"The	1
facts	1
are	1
briefly	1
these:	1
Some	1
five	1
years	1
ago,	1
during	1
a	1
lengthy	1
visit	1
to	1
Warsaw,	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
well-known	1
adventuress,	1
Irene	1
Adler.	1
The	1
name	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
familiar	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Kindly	1
look	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
index,	1
Doctor,"	1
murmured	1
Holmes	1
without	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes.	1
For	1
many	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
adopted	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
docketing	1
all	1
paragraphs	1
concerning	1
men	1
and	1
things,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
name	1
a	1
subject	1
or	1
a	1
person	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
furnish	1
information.	1
In	1
this	1
case	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
biography	1
sandwiched	1
in	1
between	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
Hebrew	1
rabbi	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
staff-commander	1
who	1
had	1
written	1
a	1
monograph	1
upon	1
the	1
deep-sea	1
fishes.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
see!"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Hum!	1
Born	1
in	1
New	1
Jersey	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1858.	1
Contralto--hum!	1
La	1
Scala,	1
hum!	1
Prima	1
donna	1
Imperial	1
Opera	1
of	1
Warsaw--yes!	1
Retired	1
from	1
operatic	1
stage--ha!	1
Living	1
in	1
London--quite	1
so!	1
Your	1
Majesty,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
became	1
entangled	1
with	1
this	1
young	1
person,	1
wrote	1
her	1
some	1
compromising	1
letters,	1
and	1
is	1
now	1
desirous	1
of	1
getting	1
those	1
letters	1
back."	1
	1
"Precisely	1
so.	1
But	1
how--"	1
	1
"Was	1
there	1
a	1
secret	1
marriage?"	1
	1
"None."	1
	1
"No	1
legal	1
papers	1
or	1
certificates?"	1
	1
"None."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
fail	1
to	1
follow	1
your	1
Majesty.	1
If	1
this	1
young	1
person	1
should	1
produce	1
her	1
letters	1
for	1
blackmailing	1
or	1
other	1
purposes,	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
to	1
prove	1
their	1
authenticity?"	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
the	1
writing."	1
	1
"Pooh,	1
pooh!	1
Forgery."	1
	1
"My	1
private	1
note-paper."	1
	1
"Stolen."	1
	1
"My	1
own	1
seal."	1
	1
"Imitated."	1
	1
"My	1
photograph."	1
	1
"Bought."	1
	1
"We	1
were	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
photograph."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
dear!	1
That	1
is	1
very	1
bad!	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
has	1
indeed	1
committed	1
an	1
indiscretion."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
mad--insane."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
compromised	1
yourself	1
seriously."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
only	1
Crown	1
Prince	1
then.	1
I	1
was	1
young.	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
thirty	1
now."	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
recovered."	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
tried	1
and	1
failed."	1
	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
must	1
pay.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
bought."	1
	1
"She	1
will	1
not	1
sell."	1
	1
"Stolen,	1
then."	1
	1
"Five	1
attempts	1
have	1
been	1
made.	1
Twice	1
burglars	1
in	1
my	1
pay	1
ransacked	1
her	1
house.	1
Once	1
we	1
diverted	1
her	1
luggage	1
when	1
she	1
travelled.	1
Twice	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
waylaid.	1
There	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
result."	1
	1
"No	1
sign	1
of	1
it?"	1
	1
"Absolutely	1
none."	1
	1
Holmes	1
laughed.	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
problem,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
one	1
to	1
me,"	1
returned	1
the	1
King	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"Very,	1
indeed.	1
And	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
propose	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
photograph?"	1
	1
"To	1
ruin	1
me."	1
	1
"But	1
how?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
married."	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
have	1
heard."	1
	1
"To	1
Clotilde	1
Lothman	1
von	1
Saxe-Meningen,	1
second	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Scandinavia.	1
You	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
strict	1
principles	1
of	1
her	1
family.	1
She	1
is	1
herself	1
the	1
very	1
soul	1
of	1
delicacy.	1
A	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
conduct	1
would	1
bring	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
an	1
end."	1
	1
"And	1
Irene	1
Adler?"	1
	1
"Threatens	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
the	1
photograph.	1
And	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
soul	1
of	1
steel.	1
She	1
has	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
of	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
resolute	1
of	1
men.	1
Rather	1
than	1
I	1
should	1
marry	1
another	1
woman,	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
lengths	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
go--none."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
sent	1
it	1
yet?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure."	1
	1
"And	1
why?"	1
	1
"Because	1
she	1
has	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
send	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
betrothal	1
was	1
publicly	1
proclaimed.	1
That	1
will	1
be	1
next	1
Monday."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
three	1
days	1
yet,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
with	1
a	1
yawn.	1
"That	1
is	1
very	1
fortunate,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
matters	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
just	1
at	1
present.	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
will,	1
of	1
course,	1
stay	1
in	1
London	1
for	1
the	1
present?"	1
	1
"Certainly.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
Langham	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Count	1
Von	1
Kramm."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
drop	1
you	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
we	1
progress."	1
	1
"Pray	1
do	1
so.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
anxiety."	1
	1
"Then,	1
as	1
to	1
money?"	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
carte	1
blanche."	1
	1
"Absolutely?"	1
	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
to	1
have	1
that	1
photograph."	1
	1
"And	1
for	1
present	1
expenses?"	1
	1
The	1
King	1
took	1
a	1
heavy	1
chamois	1
leather	1
bag	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
three	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
in	1
gold	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred	1
in	1
notes,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Holmes	1
scribbled	1
a	1
receipt	1
upon	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
his	1
note-book	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
Mademoiselle's	1
address?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Is	1
Briony	1
Lodge,	1
Serpentine	1
Avenue,	1
St.	1
John's	1
Wood."	1
	1
Holmes	1
took	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
it.	1
"One	1
other	1
question,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Was	1
the	1
photograph	1
a	1
cabinet?"	1
	1
"It	1
was."	1
	1
"Then,	1
good-night,	1
your	1
Majesty,	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
have	1
some	1
good	1
news	1
for	1
you.	1
And	1
good-night,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
added,	1
as	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
royal	1
brougham	1
rolled	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
"If	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
call	1
to-morrow	1
afternoon	1
at	1
three	1
o'clock	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
chat	1
this	1
little	1
matter	1
over	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
	1
II.	1
	1
At	1
three	1
o'clock	1
precisely	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
but	1
Holmes	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
returned.	1
The	1
landlady	1
informed	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
shortly	1
after	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
fire,	1
however,	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
awaiting	1
him,	1
however	1
long	1
he	1
might	1
be.	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
deeply	1
interested	1
in	1
his	1
inquiry,	1
for,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
grim	1
and	1
strange	1
features	1
which	1
were	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
crimes	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
recorded,	1
still,	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
and	1
the	1
exalted	1
station	1
of	1
his	1
client	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
character	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
Indeed,	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
investigation	1
which	1
my	1
friend	1
had	1
on	1
hand,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
masterly	1
grasp	1
of	1
a	1
situation,	1
and	1
his	1
keen,	1
incisive	1
reasoning,	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
study	1
his	1
system	1
of	1
work,	1
and	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
quick,	1
subtle	1
methods	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
disentangled	1
the	1
most	1
inextricable	1
mysteries.	1
So	1
accustomed	1
was	1
I	1
to	1
his	1
invariable	1
success	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
failing	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
close	1
upon	1
four	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
drunken-looking	1
groom,	1
ill-kempt	1
and	1
side-whiskered,	1
with	1
an	1
inflamed	1
face	1
and	1
disreputable	1
clothes,	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
Accustomed	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
my	1
friend's	1
amazing	1
powers	1
in	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
disguises,	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
look	1
three	1
times	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
he.	1
With	1
a	1
nod	1
he	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom,	1
whence	1
he	1
emerged	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
tweed-suited	1
and	1
respectable,	1
as	1
of	1
old.	1
Putting	1
his	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
pockets,	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
for	1
some	1
minutes.	1
	1
"Well,	1
really!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
choked	1
and	1
laughed	1
again	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
lie	1
back,	1
limp	1
and	1
helpless,	1
in	1
the	1
chair.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"It's	1
quite	1
too	1
funny.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
could	1
never	1
guess	1
how	1
I	1
employed	1
my	1
morning,	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
ended	1
by	1
doing."	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
imagine.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
watching	1
the	1
habits,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
house,	1
of	1
Miss	1
Irene	1
Adler."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so;	1
but	1
the	1
sequel	1
was	1
rather	1
unusual.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,	1
however.	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
a	1
little	1
after	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
this	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
a	1
groom	1
out	1
of	1
work.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
sympathy	1
and	1
freemasonry	1
among	1
horsey	1
men.	1
Be	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
know.	1
I	1
soon	1
found	1
Briony	1
Lodge.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
bijou	1
villa,	1
with	1
a	1
garden	1
at	1
the	1
back,	1
but	1
built	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
two	1
stories.	1
Chubb	1
lock	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
Large	1
sitting-room	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side,	1
well	1
furnished,	1
with	1
long	1
windows	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
those	1
preposterous	1
English	1
window	1
fasteners	1
which	1
a	1
child	1
could	1
open.	1
Behind	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable,	1
save	1
that	1
the	1
passage	1
window	1
could	1
be	1
reached	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
coach-house.	1
I	1
walked	1
round	1
it	1
and	1
examined	1
it	1
closely	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
but	1
without	1
noting	1
anything	1
else	1
of	1
interest.	1
	1
"I	1
then	1
lounged	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
found,	1
as	1
I	1
expected,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mews	1
in	1
a	1
lane	1
which	1
runs	1
down	1
by	1
one	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
I	1
lent	1
the	1
ostlers	1
a	1
hand	1
in	1
rubbing	1
down	1
their	1
horses,	1
and	1
received	1
in	1
exchange	1
twopence,	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
half	1
and	1
half,	1
two	1
fills	1
of	1
shag	1
tobacco,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
information	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
desire	1
about	1
Miss	1
Adler,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
other	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
interested,	1
but	1
whose	1
biographies	1
I	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
listen	1
to."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
of	1
Irene	1
Adler?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
she	1
has	1
turned	1
all	1
the	1
men's	1
heads	1
down	1
in	1
that	1
part.	1
She	1
is	1
the	1
daintiest	1
thing	1
under	1
a	1
bonnet	1
on	1
this	1
planet.	1
So	1
say	1
the	1
Serpentine-mews,	1
to	1
a	1
man.	1
She	1
lives	1
quietly,	1
sings	1
at	1
concerts,	1
drives	1
out	1
at	1
five	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
returns	1
at	1
seven	1
sharp	1
for	1
dinner.	1
Seldom	1
goes	1
out	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
except	1
when	1
she	1
sings.	1
Has	1
only	1
one	1
male	1
visitor,	1
but	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
dark,	1
handsome,	1
and	1
dashing,	1
never	1
calls	1
less	1
than	1
once	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
often	1
twice.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
Mr.	1
Godfrey	1
Norton,	1
of	1
the	1
Inner	1
Temple.	1
See	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
a	1
cabman	1
as	1
a	1
confidant.	1
They	1
had	1
driven	1
him	1
home	1
a	1
dozen	1
times	1
from	1
Serpentine-mews,	1
and	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
him.	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
tell,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
near	1
Briony	1
Lodge	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
my	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign.	1
	1
"This	1
Godfrey	1
Norton	1
was	1
evidently	1
an	1
important	1
factor	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
lawyer.	1
That	1
sounded	1
ominous.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
relation	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
repeated	1
visits?	1
Was	1
she	1
his	1
client,	1
his	1
friend,	1
or	1
his	1
mistress?	1
If	1
the	1
former,	1
she	1
had	1
probably	1
transferred	1
the	1
photograph	1
to	1
his	1
keeping.	1
If	1
the	1
latter,	1
it	1
was	1
less	1
likely.	1
On	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
this	1
question	1
depended	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
continue	1
my	1
work	1
at	1
Briony	1
Lodge,	1
or	1
turn	1
my	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
chambers	1
in	1
the	1
Temple.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
delicate	1
point,	1
and	1
it	1
widened	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
my	1
inquiry.	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
I	1
bore	1
you	1
with	1
these	1
details,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
little	1
difficulties,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
situation."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
following	1
you	1
closely,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
still	1
balancing	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
when	1
a	1
hansom	1
cab	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
Briony	1
Lodge,	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman	1
sprang	1
out.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
remarkably	1
handsome	1
man,	1
dark,	1
aquiline,	1
and	1
moustached--evidently	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
heard.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry,	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
cabman	1
to	1
wait,	1
and	1
brushed	1
past	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
at	1
home.	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
catch	1
glimpses	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
sitting-room,	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
talking	1
excitedly,	1
and	1
waving	1
his	1
arms.	1
Of	1
her	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
nothing.	1
Presently	1
he	1
emerged,	1
looking	1
even	1
more	1
flurried	1
than	1
before.	1
As	1
he	1
stepped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cab,	1
he	1
pulled	1
a	1
gold	1
watch	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
earnestly,	1
'Drive	1
like	1
the	1
devil,'	1
he	1
shouted,	1
'first	1
to	1
Gross	1
&	1
Hankey's	1
in	1
Regent	1
Street,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
St.	1
Monica	1
in	1
the	1
Edgeware	1
Road.	1
Half	1
a	1
guinea	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes!'	1
	1
"Away	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
wondering	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
when	1
up	1
the	1
lane	1
came	1
a	1
neat	1
little	1
landau,	1
the	1
coachman	1
with	1
his	1
coat	1
only	1
half-buttoned,	1
and	1
his	1
tie	1
under	1
his	1
ear,	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
tags	1
of	1
his	1
harness	1
were	1
sticking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
buckles.	1
It	1
hadn't	1
pulled	1
up	1
before	1
she	1
shot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
door	1
and	1
into	1
it.	1
I	1
only	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
moment,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
woman,	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
die	1
for.	1
	1
"'The	1
Church	1
of	1
St.	1
Monica,	1
John,'	1
she	1
cried,	1
'and	1
half	1
a	1
sovereign	1
if	1
you	1
reach	1
it	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes.'	1
	1
"This	1
was	1
quite	1
too	1
good	1
to	1
lose,	1
Watson.	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
balancing	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
run	1
for	1
it,	1
or	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
perch	1
behind	1
her	1
landau	1
when	1
a	1
cab	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
street.	1
The	1
driver	1
looked	1
twice	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
shabby	1
fare,	1
but	1
I	1
jumped	1
in	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
object.	1
'The	1
Church	1
of	1
St.	1
Monica,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'and	1
half	1
a	1
sovereign	1
if	1
you	1
reach	1
it	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes.'	1
It	1
was	1
twenty-five	1
minutes	1
to	1
twelve,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
enough	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
"My	1
cabby	1
drove	1
fast.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
ever	1
drove	1
faster,	1
but	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
there	1
before	1
us.	1
The	1
cab	1
and	1
the	1
landau	1
with	1
their	1
steaming	1
horses	1
were	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
when	1
I	1
arrived.	1
I	1
paid	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
hurried	1
into	1
the	1
church.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
there	1
save	1
the	1
two	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
followed	1
and	1
a	1
surpliced	1
clergyman,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
expostulating	1
with	1
them.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
three	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
knot	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
I	1
lounged	1
up	1
the	1
side	1
aisle	1
like	1
any	1
other	1
idler	1
who	1
has	1
dropped	1
into	1
a	1
church.	1
Suddenly,	1
to	1
my	1
surprise,	1
the	1
three	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
faced	1
round	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
Godfrey	1
Norton	1
came	1
running	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
towards	1
me.	1
	1
"'Thank	1
God,'	1
he	1
cried.	1
'You'll	1
do.	1
Come!	1
Come!'	1
	1
"'What	1
then?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Come,	1
man,	1
come,	1
only	1
three	1
minutes,	1
or	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
legal.'	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
half-dragged	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
before	1
I	1
knew	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
mumbling	1
responses	1
which	1
were	1
whispered	1
in	1
my	1
ear,	1
and	1
vouching	1
for	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
knew	1
nothing,	1
and	1
generally	1
assisting	1
in	1
the	1
secure	1
tying	1
up	1
of	1
Irene	1
Adler,	1
spinster,	1
to	1
Godfrey	1
Norton,	1
bachelor.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
gentleman	1
thanking	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
while	1
the	1
clergyman	1
beamed	1
on	1
me	1
in	1
front.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
preposterous	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
ever	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
started	1
me	1
laughing	1
just	1
now.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
informality	1
about	1
their	1
license,	1
that	1
the	1
clergyman	1
absolutely	1
refused	1
to	1
marry	1
them	1
without	1
a	1
witness	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
lucky	1
appearance	1
saved	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
from	1
having	1
to	1
sally	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
a	1
best	1
man.	1
The	1
bride	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
sovereign,	1
and	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
wear	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
watch-chain	1
in	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
occasion."	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
unexpected	1
turn	1
of	1
affairs,"	1
said	1
I;	1
"and	1
what	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
plans	1
very	1
seriously	1
menaced.	1
It	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
pair	1
might	1
take	1
an	1
immediate	1
departure,	1
and	1
so	1
necessitate	1
very	1
prompt	1
and	1
energetic	1
measures	1
on	1
my	1
part.	1
At	1
the	1
church	1
door,	1
however,	1
they	1
separated,	1
he	1
driving	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Temple,	1
and	1
she	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
house.	1
'I	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
park	1
at	1
five	1
as	1
usual,'	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
she	1
left	1
him.	1
I	1
heard	1
no	1
more.	1
They	1
drove	1
away	1
in	1
different	1
directions,	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
own	1
arrangements."	1
	1
"Which	1
are?"	1
	1
"Some	1
cold	1
beef	1
and	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
beer,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
ringing	1
the	1
bell.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
busy	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
food,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
busier	1
still	1
this	1
evening.	1
By	1
the	1
way,	1
Doctor,	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
your	1
co-operation."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted."	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
mind	1
breaking	1
the	1
law?"	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least."	1
	1
"Nor	1
running	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
arrest?"	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
cause."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
cause	1
is	1
excellent!"	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
man."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rely	1
on	1
you."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
wish?"	1
	1
"When	1
Mrs.	1
Turner	1
has	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
tray	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
you.	1
Now,"	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
hungrily	1
on	1
the	1
simple	1
fare	1
that	1
our	1
landlady	1
had	1
provided,	1
"I	1
must	1
discuss	1
it	1
while	1
I	1
eat,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
much	1
time.	1
It	1
is	1
nearly	1
five	1
now.	1
In	1
two	1
hours	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action.	1
Miss	1
Irene,	1
or	1
Madame,	1
rather,	1
returns	1
from	1
her	1
drive	1
at	1
seven.	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
Briony	1
Lodge	1
to	1
meet	1
her."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
then?"	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
leave	1
that	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
arranged	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
occur.	1
There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
must	1
insist.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
interfere,	1
come	1
what	1
may.	1
You	1
understand?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
neutral?"	1
	1
"To	1
do	1
nothing	1
whatever.	1
There	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
some	1
small	1
unpleasantness.	1
Do	1
not	1
join	1
in	1
it.	1
It	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
my	1
being	1
conveyed	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
Four	1
or	1
five	1
minutes	1
afterwards	1
the	1
sitting-room	1
window	1
will	1
open.	1
You	1
are	1
to	1
station	1
yourself	1
close	1
to	1
that	1
open	1
window."	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
to	1
watch	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
visible	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"And	1
when	1
I	1
raise	1
my	1
hand--so--you	1
will	1
throw	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
what	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
throw,	1
and	1
will,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
raise	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
fire.	1
You	1
quite	1
follow	1
me?"	1
	1
"Entirely."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
nothing	1
very	1
formidable,"	1
he	1
said,	1
taking	1
a	1
long	1
cigar-shaped	1
roll	1
from	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"It	1
is	1
an	1
ordinary	1
plumber's	1
smoke-rocket,	1
fitted	1
with	1
a	1
cap	1
at	1
either	1
end	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
self-lighting.	1
Your	1
task	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
that.	1
When	1
you	1
raise	1
your	1
cry	1
of	1
fire,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
quite	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
people.	1
You	1
may	1
then	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rejoin	1
you	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
myself	1
clear?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
to	1
remain	1
neutral,	1
to	1
get	1
near	1
the	1
window,	1
to	1
watch	1
you,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
signal	1
to	1
throw	1
in	1
this	1
object,	1
then	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
to	1
wait	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
street."	1
	1
"Precisely."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
may	1
entirely	1
rely	1
on	1
me."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
excellent.	1
I	1
think,	1
perhaps,	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
new	1
role	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
play."	1
	1
He	1
disappeared	1
into	1
his	1
bedroom	1
and	1
returned	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
an	1
amiable	1
and	1
simple-minded	1
Nonconformist	1
clergyman.	1
His	1
broad	1
black	1
hat,	1
his	1
baggy	1
trousers,	1
his	1
white	1
tie,	1
his	1
sympathetic	1
smile,	1
and	1
general	1
look	1
of	1
peering	1
and	1
benevolent	1
curiosity	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Hare	1
alone	1
could	1
have	1
equalled.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
that	1
Holmes	1
changed	1
his	1
costume.	1
His	1
expression,	1
his	1
manner,	1
his	1
very	1
soul	1
seemed	1
to	1
vary	1
with	1
every	1
fresh	1
part	1
that	1
he	1
assumed.	1
The	1
stage	1
lost	1
a	1
fine	1
actor,	1
even	1
as	1
science	1
lost	1
an	1
acute	1
reasoner,	1
when	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
specialist	1
in	1
crime.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
quarter	1
past	1
six	1
when	1
we	1
left	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
and	1
it	1
still	1
wanted	1
ten	1
minutes	1
to	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
Serpentine	1
Avenue.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
dusk,	1
and	1
the	1
lamps	1
were	1
just	1
being	1
lighted	1
as	1
we	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Briony	1
Lodge,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
its	1
occupant.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
pictured	1
it	1
from	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
succinct	1
description,	1
but	1
the	1
locality	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
private	1
than	1
I	1
expected.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
for	1
a	1
small	1
street	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
neighbourhood,	1
it	1
was	1
remarkably	1
animated.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
shabbily	1
dressed	1
men	1
smoking	1
and	1
laughing	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
a	1
scissors-grinder	1
with	1
his	1
wheel,	1
two	1
guardsmen	1
who	1
were	1
flirting	1
with	1
a	1
nurse-girl,	1
and	1
several	1
well-dressed	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
lounging	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
cigars	1
in	1
their	1
mouths.	1
	1
"You	1
see,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes,	1
as	1
we	1
paced	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
"this	1
marriage	1
rather	1
simplifies	1
matters.	1
The	1
photograph	1
becomes	1
a	1
double-edged	1
weapon	1
now.	1
The	1
chances	1
are	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
averse	1
to	1
its	1
being	1
seen	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Godfrey	1
Norton,	1
as	1
our	1
client	1
is	1
to	1
its	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
princess.	1
Now	1
the	1
question	1
is,	1
Where	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
photograph?"	1
	1
"Where,	1
indeed?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
most	1
unlikely	1
that	1
she	1
carries	1
it	1
about	1
with	1
her.	1
It	1
is	1
cabinet	1
size.	1
Too	1
large	1
for	1
easy	1
concealment	1
about	1
a	1
woman's	1
dress.	1
She	1
knows	1
that	1
the	1
King	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
having	1
her	1
waylaid	1
and	1
searched.	1
Two	1
attempts	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
made.	1
We	1
may	1
take	1
it,	1
then,	1
that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
carry	1
it	1
about	1
with	1
her."	1
	1
"Where,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Her	1
banker	1
or	1
her	1
lawyer.	1
There	1
is	1
that	1
double	1
possibility.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
neither.	1
Women	1
are	1
naturally	1
secretive,	1
and	1
they	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
own	1
secreting.	1
Why	1
should	1
she	1
hand	1
it	1
over	1
to	1
anyone	1
else?	1
She	1
could	1
trust	1
her	1
own	1
guardianship,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
what	1
indirect	1
or	1
political	1
influence	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
a	1
business	1
man.	1
Besides,	1
remember	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
where	1
she	1
can	1
lay	1
her	1
hands	1
upon	1
it.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
has	1
twice	1
been	1
burgled."	1
	1
"Pshaw!	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
look."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
will	1
you	1
look?"	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
look."	1
	1
"What	1
then?"	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
get	1
her	1
to	1
show	1
me."	1
	1
"But	1
she	1
will	1
refuse."	1
	1
"She	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to.	1
But	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
wheels.	1
It	1
is	1
her	1
carriage.	1
Now	1
carry	1
out	1
my	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
letter."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
the	1
side-lights	1
of	1
a	1
carriage	1
came	1
round	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
avenue.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
smart	1
little	1
landau	1
which	1
rattled	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
Briony	1
Lodge.	1
As	1
it	1
pulled	1
up,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
loafing	1
men	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
dashed	1
forward	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
earning	1
a	1
copper,	1
but	1
was	1
elbowed	1
away	1
by	1
another	1
loafer,	1
who	1
had	1
rushed	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
intention.	1
A	1
fierce	1
quarrel	1
broke	1
out,	1
which	1
was	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
guardsmen,	1
who	1
took	1
sides	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
loungers,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
scissors-grinder,	1
who	1
was	1
equally	1
hot	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
A	1
blow	1
was	1
struck,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
lady,	1
who	1
had	1
stepped	1
from	1
her	1
carriage,	1
was	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
knot	1
of	1
flushed	1
and	1
struggling	1
men,	1
who	1
struck	1
savagely	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
their	1
fists	1
and	1
sticks.	1
Holmes	1
dashed	1
into	1
the	1
crowd	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
lady;	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
reached	1
her	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
cry	1
and	1
dropped	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
running	1
freely	1
down	1
his	1
face.	1
At	1
his	1
fall	1
the	1
guardsmen	1
took	1
to	1
their	1
heels	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
and	1
the	1
loungers	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
while	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
better-dressed	1
people,	1
who	1
had	1
watched	1
the	1
scuffle	1
without	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
it,	1
crowded	1
in	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
lady	1
and	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
injured	1
man.	1
Irene	1
Adler,	1
as	1
I	1
will	1
still	1
call	1
her,	1
had	1
hurried	1
up	1
the	1
steps;	1
but	1
she	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
with	1
her	1
superb	1
figure	1
outlined	1
against	1
the	1
lights	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
looking	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
much	1
hurt?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
dead,"	1
cried	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
there's	1
life	1
in	1
him!"	1
shouted	1
another.	1
"But	1
he'll	1
be	1
gone	1
before	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
hospital."	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
brave	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
a	1
woman.	1
"They	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
lady's	1
purse	1
and	1
watch	1
if	1
it	1
hadn't	1
been	1
for	1
him.	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
gang,	1
and	1
a	1
rough	1
one,	1
too.	1
Ah,	1
he's	1
breathing	1
now."	1
	1
"He	1
can't	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
May	1
we	1
bring	1
him	1
in,	1
marm?"	1
	1
"Surely.	1
Bring	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
sitting-room.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
comfortable	1
sofa.	1
This	1
way,	1
please!"	1
	1
Slowly	1
and	1
solemnly	1
he	1
was	1
borne	1
into	1
Briony	1
Lodge	1
and	1
laid	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
principal	1
room,	1
while	1
I	1
still	1
observed	1
the	1
proceedings	1
from	1
my	1
post	1
by	1
the	1
window.	1
The	1
lamps	1
had	1
been	1
lit,	1
but	1
the	1
blinds	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
drawn,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
Holmes	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
couch.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
compunction	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
for	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
was	1
playing,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
felt	1
more	1
heartily	1
ashamed	1
of	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
than	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
beautiful	1
creature	1
against	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
conspiring,	1
or	1
the	1
grace	1
and	1
kindliness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
waited	1
upon	1
the	1
injured	1
man.	1
And	1
yet	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
blackest	1
treachery	1
to	1
Holmes	1
to	1
draw	1
back	1
now	1
from	1
the	1
part	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
intrusted	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
hardened	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
smoke-rocket	1
from	1
under	1
my	1
ulster.	1
After	1
all,	1
I	1
thought,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
injuring	1
her.	1
We	1
are	1
but	1
preventing	1
her	1
from	1
injuring	1
another.	1
	1
Holmes	1
had	1
sat	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
couch,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
motion	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
air.	1
A	1
maid	1
rushed	1
across	1
and	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
window.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
raise	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
signal	1
I	1
tossed	1
my	1
rocket	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
"Fire!"	1
The	1
word	1
was	1
no	1
sooner	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
than	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd	1
of	1
spectators,	1
well	1
dressed	1
and	1
ill--gentlemen,	1
ostlers,	1
and	1
servant-maids--joined	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
shriek	1
of	1
"Fire!"	1
Thick	1
clouds	1
of	1
smoke	1
curled	1
through	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
window.	1
I	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
rushing	1
figures,	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Holmes	1
from	1
within	1
assuring	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
false	1
alarm.	1
Slipping	1
through	1
the	1
shouting	1
crowd	1
I	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes	1
was	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
find	1
my	1
friend's	1
arm	1
in	1
mine,	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
uproar.	1
He	1
walked	1
swiftly	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
few	1
minutes	1
until	1
we	1
had	1
turned	1
down	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
streets	1
which	1
lead	1
towards	1
the	1
Edgeware	1
Road.	1
	1
"You	1
did	1
it	1
very	1
nicely,	1
Doctor,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"Nothing	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
better.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
right."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
the	1
photograph?"	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
where	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
out?"	1
	1
"She	1
showed	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
she	1
would."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
dark."	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
mystery,"	1
said	1
he,	1
laughing.	1
"The	1
matter	1
was	1
perfectly	1
simple.	1
You,	1
of	1
course,	1
saw	1
that	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
was	1
an	1
accomplice.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
engaged	1
for	1
the	1
evening."	1
	1
"I	1
guessed	1
as	1
much."	1
	1
"Then,	1
when	1
the	1
row	1
broke	1
out,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
moist	1
red	1
paint	1
in	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
I	1
rushed	1
forward,	1
fell	1
down,	1
clapped	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
became	1
a	1
piteous	1
spectacle.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
trick."	1
	1
"That	1
also	1
I	1
could	1
fathom."	1
	1
"Then	1
they	1
carried	1
me	1
in.	1
She	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
have	1
me	1
in.	1
What	1
else	1
could	1
she	1
do?	1
And	1
into	1
her	1
sitting-room,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
room	1
which	1
I	1
suspected.	1
It	1
lay	1
between	1
that	1
and	1
her	1
bedroom,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
see	1
which.	1
They	1
laid	1
me	1
on	1
a	1
couch,	1
I	1
motioned	1
for	1
air,	1
they	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
you	1
had	1
your	1
chance."	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
that	1
help	1
you?"	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
all-important.	1
When	1
a	1
woman	1
thinks	1
that	1
her	1
house	1
is	1
on	1
fire,	1
her	1
instinct	1
is	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
rush	1
to	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
she	1
values	1
most.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
perfectly	1
overpowering	1
impulse,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
taken	1
advantage	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Darlington	1
substitution	1
scandal	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
Arnsworth	1
Castle	1
business.	1
A	1
married	1
woman	1
grabs	1
at	1
her	1
baby;	1
an	1
unmarried	1
one	1
reaches	1
for	1
her	1
jewel-box.	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
our	1
lady	1
of	1
to-day	1
had	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
more	1
precious	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
quest	1
of.	1
She	1
would	1
rush	1
to	1
secure	1
it.	1
The	1
alarm	1
of	1
fire	1
was	1
admirably	1
done.	1
The	1
smoke	1
and	1
shouting	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
shake	1
nerves	1
of	1
steel.	1
She	1
responded	1
beautifully.	1
The	1
photograph	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
recess	1
behind	1
a	1
sliding	1
panel	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
right	1
bell-pull.	1
She	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
I	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
she	1
half-drew	1
it	1
out.	1
When	1
I	1
cried	1
out	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
false	1
alarm,	1
she	1
replaced	1
it,	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
rocket,	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
since.	1
I	1
rose,	1
and,	1
making	1
my	1
excuses,	1
escaped	1
from	1
the	1
house.	1
I	1
hesitated	1
whether	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
photograph	1
at	1
once;	1
but	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
watching	1
me	1
narrowly	1
it	1
seemed	1
safer	1
to	1
wait.	1
A	1
little	1
over-precipitance	1
may	1
ruin	1
all."	1
	1
"And	1
now?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Our	1
quest	1
is	1
practically	1
finished.	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
with	1
the	1
King	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
with	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
us.	1
We	1
will	1
be	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
sitting-room	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
lady,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
comes	1
she	1
may	1
find	1
neither	1
us	1
nor	1
the	1
photograph.	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
his	1
Majesty	1
to	1
regain	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands."	1
	1
"And	1
when	1
will	1
you	1
call?"	1
	1
"At	1
eight	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
She	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
up,	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
clear	1
field.	1
Besides,	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
prompt,	1
for	1
this	1
marriage	1
may	1
mean	1
a	1
complete	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
and	1
habits.	1
I	1
must	1
wire	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
without	1
delay."	1
	1
We	1
had	1
reached	1
Baker	1
Street	1
and	1
had	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
was	1
searching	1
his	1
pockets	1
for	1
the	1
key	1
when	1
someone	1
passing	1
said:	1
	1
"Good-night,	1
Mister	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes."	1
	1
There	1
were	1
several	1
people	1
on	1
the	1
pavement	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
but	1
the	1
greeting	1
appeared	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
slim	1
youth	1
in	1
an	1
ulster	1
who	1
had	1
hurried	1
by.	1
	1
"I've	1
heard	1
that	1
voice	1
before,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
staring	1
down	1
the	1
dimly	1
lit	1
street.	1
"Now,	1
I	1
wonder	1
who	1
the	1
deuce	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
been."	1
	1
	1
III.	1
	1
I	1
slept	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
engaged	1
upon	1
our	1
toast	1
and	1
coffee	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
when	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
really	1
got	1
it!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
grasping	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
by	1
either	1
shoulder	1
and	1
looking	1
eagerly	1
into	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Not	1
yet."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
hopes?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
hopes."	1
	1
"Then,	1
come.	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
impatience	1
to	1
be	1
gone."	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
cab."	1
	1
"No,	1
my	1
brougham	1
is	1
waiting."	1
	1
"Then	1
that	1
will	1
simplify	1
matters."	1
We	1
descended	1
and	1
started	1
off	1
once	1
more	1
for	1
Briony	1
Lodge.	1
	1
"Irene	1
Adler	1
is	1
married,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Married!	1
When?"	1
	1
"Yesterday."	1
	1
"But	1
to	1
whom?"	1
	1
"To	1
an	1
English	1
lawyer	1
named	1
Norton."	1
	1
"But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
him."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
she	1
does."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
in	1
hopes?"	1
	1
"Because	1
it	1
would	1
spare	1
your	1
Majesty	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
future	1
annoyance.	1
If	1
the	1
lady	1
loves	1
her	1
husband,	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
your	1
Majesty.	1
If	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
your	1
Majesty,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
she	1
should	1
interfere	1
with	1
your	1
Majesty's	1
plan."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
true.	1
And	1
yet--Well!	1
I	1
wish	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
station!	1
What	1
a	1
queen	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
made!"	1
He	1
relapsed	1
into	1
a	1
moody	1
silence,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
broken	1
until	1
we	1
drew	1
up	1
in	1
Serpentine	1
Avenue.	1
	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
Briony	1
Lodge	1
was	1
open,	1
and	1
an	1
elderly	1
woman	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
steps.	1
She	1
watched	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
sardonic	1
eye	1
as	1
we	1
stepped	1
from	1
the	1
brougham.	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
believe?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
answered	1
my	1
companion,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
questioning	1
and	1
rather	1
startled	1
gaze.	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
My	1
mistress	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
likely	1
to	1
call.	1
She	1
left	1
this	1
morning	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
by	1
the	1
5:15	1
train	1
from	1
Charing	1
Cross	1
for	1
the	1
Continent."	1
	1
"What!"	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
staggered	1
back,	1
white	1
with	1
chagrin	1
and	1
surprise.	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
left	1
England?"	1
	1
"Never	1
to	1
return."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
papers?"	1
asked	1
the	1
King	1
hoarsely.	1
"All	1
is	1
lost."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
see."	1
He	1
pushed	1
past	1
the	1
servant	1
and	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
King	1
and	1
myself.	1
The	1
furniture	1
was	1
scattered	1
about	1
in	1
every	1
direction,	1
with	1
dismantled	1
shelves	1
and	1
open	1
drawers,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
lady	1
had	1
hurriedly	1
ransacked	1
them	1
before	1
her	1
flight.	1
Holmes	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
bell-pull,	1
tore	1
back	1
a	1
small	1
sliding	1
shutter,	1
and,	1
plunging	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
photograph	1
and	1
a	1
letter.	1
The	1
photograph	1
was	1
of	1
Irene	1
Adler	1
herself	1
in	1
evening	1
dress,	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
superscribed	1
to	1
"Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
Esq.	1
To	1
be	1
left	1
till	1
called	1
for."	1
My	1
friend	1
tore	1
it	1
open	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
three	1
read	1
it	1
together.	1
It	1
was	1
dated	1
at	1
midnight	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
night	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
MR.	1
SHERLOCK	1
HOLMES,--You	1
really	1
did	1
it	1
very	1
well.	1
You	1
took	1
me	1
in	1
completely.	1
Until	1
after	1
the	1
alarm	1
of	1
fire,	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
suspicion.	1
But	1
then,	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
how	1
I	1
had	1
betrayed	1
myself,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
think.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
warned	1
against	1
you	1
months	1
ago.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
King	1
employed	1
an	1
agent	1
it	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
you.	1
And	1
your	1
address	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
me.	1
Yet,	1
with	1
all	1
this,	1
you	1
made	1
me	1
reveal	1
what	1
you	1
wanted	1
to	1
know.	1
Even	1
after	1
I	1
became	1
suspicious,	1
I	1
found	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
evil	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
dear,	1
kind	1
old	1
clergyman.	1
But,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
trained	1
as	1
an	1
actress	1
myself.	1
Male	1
costume	1
is	1
nothing	1
new	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
often	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
freedom	1
which	1
it	1
gives.	1
I	1
sent	1
John,	1
the	1
coachman,	1
to	1
watch	1
you,	1
ran	1
up	1
stairs,	1
got	1
into	1
my	1
walking-clothes,	1
as	1
I	1
call	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
departed.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
followed	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
door,	1
and	1
so	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
really	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
Then	1
I,	1
rather	1
imprudently,	1
wished	1
you	1
good-night,	1
and	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
Temple	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
husband.	1
	1
"We	1
both	1
thought	1
the	1
best	1
resource	1
was	1
flight,	1
when	1
pursued	1
by	1
so	1
formidable	1
an	1
antagonist;	1
so	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
nest	1
empty	1
when	1
you	1
call	1
to-morrow.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
photograph,	1
your	1
client	1
may	1
rest	1
in	1
peace.	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
am	1
loved	1
by	1
a	1
better	1
man	1
than	1
he.	1
The	1
King	1
may	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
without	1
hindrance	1
from	1
one	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
cruelly	1
wronged.	1
I	1
keep	1
it	1
only	1
to	1
safeguard	1
myself,	1
and	1
to	1
preserve	1
a	1
weapon	1
which	1
will	1
always	1
secure	1
me	1
from	1
any	1
steps	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
I	1
leave	1
a	1
photograph	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
care	1
to	1
possess;	1
and	1
I	1
remain,	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
	1

"IRENE	1
NORTON,	1
née	1
ADLER."	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
woman--oh,	1
what	1
a	1
woman!"	1
cried	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia,	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
all	1
three	1
read	1
this	1
epistle.	1
"Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
quick	1
and	1
resolute	1
she	1
was?	1
Would	1
she	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
an	1
admirable	1
queen?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
on	1
my	1
level?"	1
	1
"From	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
she	1
seems	1
indeed	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
level	1
to	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
coldly.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
Majesty's	1
business	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
successful	1
conclusion."	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
cried	1
the	1
King;	1
"nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
successful.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
her	1
word	1
is	1
inviolate.	1
The	1
photograph	1
is	1
now	1
as	1
safe	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fire."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
Majesty	1
say	1
so."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
immensely	1
indebted	1
to	1
you.	1
Pray	1
tell	1
me	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
I	1
can	1
reward	1
you.	1
This	1
ring--"	1
He	1
slipped	1
an	1
emerald	1
snake	1
ring	1
from	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
has	1
something	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
value	1
even	1
more	1
highly,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
but	1
to	1
name	1
it."	1
	1
"This	1
photograph!"	1
	1
The	1
King	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
amazement.	1
	1
"Irene's	1
photograph!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Certainly,	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
thank	1
your	1
Majesty.	1
Then	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
wish	1
you	1
a	1
very	1
good-morning."	1
He	1
bowed,	1
and,	1
turning	1
away	1
without	1
observing	1
the	1
hand	1
which	1
the	1
King	1
had	1
stretched	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
my	1
company	1
for	1
his	1
chambers.	1
	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
a	1
great	1
scandal	1
threatened	1
to	1
affect	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Bohemia,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
best	1
plans	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
were	1
beaten	1
by	1
a	1
woman's	1
wit.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
make	1
merry	1
over	1
the	1
cleverness	1
of	1
women,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
of	1
late.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
speaks	1
of	1
Irene	1
Adler,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
refers	1
to	1
her	1
photograph,	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
under	1
the	1
honourable	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
woman.	1
	1
	1
	1
ADVENTURE	1
II.	1
THE	1
RED-HEADED	1
LEAGUE	1
	1
I	1
had	1
called	1
upon	1
my	1
friend,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
of	1
last	1
year	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
deep	1
conversation	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
stout,	1
florid-faced,	1
elderly	1
gentleman	1
with	1
fiery	1
red	1
hair.	1
With	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
my	1
intrusion,	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
withdraw	1
when	1
Holmes	1
pulled	1
me	1
abruptly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
me.	1
	1
"You	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
come	1
at	1
a	1
better	1
time,	1
my	1
dear	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
said	1
cordially.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
engaged."	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
am.	1
Very	1
much	1
so."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
can	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
This	1
gentleman,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
partner	1
and	1
helper	1
in	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
most	1
successful	1
cases,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
yours	1
also."	1
	1
The	1
stout	1
gentleman	1
half	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
bob	1
of	1
greeting,	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
little	1
questioning	1
glance	1
from	1
his	1
small	1
fat-encircled	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Try	1
the	1
settee,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
relapsing	1
into	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
fingertips	1
together,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
when	1
in	1
judicial	1
moods.	1
"I	1
know,	1
my	1
dear	1
Watson,	1
that	1
you	1
share	1
my	1
love	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
bizarre	1
and	1
outside	1
the	1
conventions	1
and	1
humdrum	1
routine	1
of	1
everyday	1
life.	1
You	1
have	1
shown	1
your	1
relish	1
for	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
which	1
has	1
prompted	1
you	1
to	1
chronicle,	1
and,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
saying	1
so,	1
somewhat	1
to	1
embellish	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
little	1
adventures."	1
	1
"Your	1
cases	1
have	1
indeed	1
been	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
interest	1
to	1
me,"	1
I	1
observed.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
remarked	1
the	1
other	1
day,	1
just	1
before	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
simple	1
problem	1
presented	1
by	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland,	1
that	1
for	1
strange	1
effects	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
combinations	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
life	1
itself,	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
far	1
more	1
daring	1
than	1
any	1
effort	1
of	1
the	1
imagination."	1
	1
"A	1
proposition	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
doubting."	1
	1
"You	1
did,	1
Doctor,	1
but	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
my	1
view,	1
for	1
otherwise	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
on	1
piling	1
fact	1
upon	1
fact	1
on	1
you	1
until	1
your	1
reason	1
breaks	1
down	1
under	1
them	1
and	1
acknowledges	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
right.	1
Now,	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson	1
here	1
has	1
been	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
me	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
narrative	1
which	1
promises	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
singular	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
listened	1
to	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
You	1
have	1
heard	1
me	1
remark	1
that	1
the	1
strangest	1
and	1
most	1
unique	1
things	1
are	1
very	1
often	1
connected	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
larger	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
smaller	1
crimes,	1
and	1
occasionally,	1
indeed,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
room	1
for	1
doubt	1
whether	1
any	1
positive	1
crime	1
has	1
been	1
committed.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
whether	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
is	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
crime	1
or	1
not,	1
but	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
is	1
certainly	1
among	1
the	1
most	1
singular	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
listened	1
to.	1
Perhaps,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
great	1
kindness	1
to	1
recommence	1
your	1
narrative.	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
not	1
merely	1
because	1
my	1
friend	1
Dr.	1
Watson	1
has	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
opening	1
part	1
but	1
also	1
because	1
the	1
peculiar	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
makes	1
me	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
every	1
possible	1
detail	1
from	1
your	1
lips.	1
As	1
a	1
rule,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
some	1
slight	1
indication	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events,	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
guide	1
myself	1
by	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
other	1
similar	1
cases	1
which	1
occur	1
to	1
my	1
memory.	1
In	1
the	1
present	1
instance	1
I	1
am	1
forced	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
facts	1
are,	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
belief,	1
unique."	1
	1
The	1
portly	1
client	1
puffed	1
out	1
his	1
chest	1
with	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
some	1
little	1
pride	1
and	1
pulled	1
a	1
dirty	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
newspaper	1
from	1
the	1
inside	1
pocket	1
of	1
his	1
greatcoat.	1
As	1
he	1
glanced	1
down	1
the	1
advertisement	1
column,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
thrust	1
forward	1
and	1
the	1
paper	1
flattened	1
out	1
upon	1
his	1
knee,	1
I	1
took	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
endeavoured,	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
my	1
companion,	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
indications	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
presented	1
by	1
his	1
dress	1
or	1
appearance.	1
	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
gain	1
very	1
much,	1
however,	1
by	1
my	1
inspection.	1
Our	1
visitor	1
bore	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
average	1
commonplace	1
British	1
tradesman,	1
obese,	1
pompous,	1
and	1
slow.	1
He	1
wore	1
rather	1
baggy	1
grey	1
shepherd's	1
check	1
trousers,	1
a	1
not	1
over-clean	1
black	1
frock-coat,	1
unbuttoned	1
in	1
the	1
front,	1
and	1
a	1
drab	1
waistcoat	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
brassy	1
Albert	1
chain,	1
and	1
a	1
square	1
pierced	1
bit	1
of	1
metal	1
dangling	1
down	1
as	1
an	1
ornament.	1
A	1
frayed	1
top-hat	1
and	1
a	1
faded	1
brown	1
overcoat	1
with	1
a	1
wrinkled	1
velvet	1
collar	1
lay	1
upon	1
a	1
chair	1
beside	1
him.	1
Altogether,	1
look	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable	1
about	1
the	1
man	1
save	1
his	1
blazing	1
red	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
extreme	1
chagrin	1
and	1
discontent	1
upon	1
his	1
features.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
quick	1
eye	1
took	1
in	1
my	1
occupation,	1
and	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
as	1
he	1
noticed	1
my	1
questioning	1
glances.	1
"Beyond	1
the	1
obvious	1
facts	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
at	1
some	1
time	1
done	1
manual	1
labour,	1
that	1
he	1
takes	1
snuff,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Freemason,	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
China,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
a	1
considerable	1
amount	1
of	1
writing	1
lately,	1
I	1
can	1
deduce	1
nothing	1
else."	1
	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson	1
started	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
forefinger	1
upon	1
the	1
paper,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
my	1
companion.	1
	1
"How,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
good-fortune,	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
know,	1
for	1
example,	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
manual	1
labour.	1
It's	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
gospel,	1
for	1
I	1
began	1
as	1
a	1
ship's	1
carpenter."	1
	1
"Your	1
hands,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
Your	1
right	1
hand	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
size	1
larger	1
than	1
your	1
left.	1
You	1
have	1
worked	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
muscles	1
are	1
more	1
developed."	1
	1
"Well,	1
the	1
snuff,	1
then,	1
and	1
the	1
Freemasonry?"	1
	1
"I	1
won't	1
insult	1
your	1
intelligence	1
by	1
telling	1
you	1
how	1
I	1
read	1
that,	1
especially	1
as,	1
rather	1
against	1
the	1
strict	1
rules	1
of	1
your	1
order,	1
you	1
use	1
an	1
arc-and-compass	1
breastpin."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
of	1
course,	1
I	1
forgot	1
that.	1
But	1
the	1
writing?"	1
	1
"What	1
else	1
can	1
be	1
indicated	1
by	1
that	1
right	1
cuff	1
so	1
very	1
shiny	1
for	1
five	1
inches,	1
and	1
the	1
left	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
smooth	1
patch	1
near	1
the	1
elbow	1
where	1
you	1
rest	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
desk?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
but	1
China?"	1
	1
"The	1
fish	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
tattooed	1
immediately	1
above	1
your	1
right	1
wrist	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
China.	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
small	1
study	1
of	1
tattoo	1
marks	1
and	1
have	1
even	1
contributed	1
to	1
the	1
literature	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
That	1
trick	1
of	1
staining	1
the	1
fishes'	1
scales	1
of	1
a	1
delicate	1
pink	1
is	1
quite	1
peculiar	1
to	1
China.	1
When,	1
in	1
addition,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
Chinese	1
coin	1
hanging	1
from	1
your	1
watch-chain,	1
the	1
matter	1
becomes	1
even	1
more	1
simple."	1
	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson	1
laughed	1
heavily.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
never!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
thought	1
at	1
first	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
done	1
something	1
clever,	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
it,	1
after	1
all."	1
	1
"I	1
begin	1
to	1
think,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
explaining.	1
'Omne	1
ignotum	1
pro	1
magnifico,'	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
my	1
poor	1
little	1
reputation,	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
will	1
suffer	1
shipwreck	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
candid.	1
Can	1
you	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
advertisement,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
it	1
now,"	1
he	1
answered	1
with	1
his	1
thick	1
red	1
finger	1
planted	1
halfway	1
down	1
the	1
column.	1
"Here	1
it	1
is.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
began	1
it	1
all.	1
You	1
just	1
read	1
it	1
for	1
yourself,	1
sir."	1
	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
paper	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
read	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
"TO	1
THE	1
RED-HEADED	1
LEAGUE:	1
On	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
bequest	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Ezekiah	1
Hopkins,	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
Pennsylvania,	1
U.	1
S.	1
A.,	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
another	1
vacancy	1
open	1
which	1
entitles	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
League	1
to	1
a	1
salary	1
of	1
4	1
pounds	1
a	1
week	1
for	1
purely	1
nominal	1
services.	1
All	1
red-headed	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
sound	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
mind	1
and	1
above	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twenty-one	1
years,	1
are	1
eligible.	1
Apply	1
in	1
person	1
on	1
Monday,	1
at	1
eleven	1
o'clock,	1
to	1
Duncan	1
Ross,	1
at	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
the	1
League,	1
7	1
Pope's	1
Court,	1
Fleet	1
Street."	1
	1
"What	1
on	1
earth	1
does	1
this	1
mean?"	1
I	1
ejaculated	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
twice	1
read	1
over	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
announcement.	1
	1
Holmes	1
chuckled	1
and	1
wriggled	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit	1
when	1
in	1
high	1
spirits.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
off	1
the	1
beaten	1
track,	1
isn't	1
it?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"And	1
now,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
off	1
you	1
go	1
at	1
scratch	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
yourself,	1
your	1
household,	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
which	1
this	1
advertisement	1
had	1
upon	1
your	1
fortunes.	1
You	1
will	1
first	1
make	1
a	1
note,	1
Doctor,	1
of	1
the	1
paper	1
and	1
the	1
date."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
The	1
Morning	1
Chronicle	1
of	1
April	1
27,	1
1890.	1
Just	1
two	1
months	1
ago."	1
	1
"Very	1
good.	1
Now,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
telling	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
Jabez	1
Wilson,	1
mopping	1
his	1
forehead;	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
small	1
pawnbroker's	1
business	1
at	1
Coburg	1
Square,	1
near	1
the	1
City.	1
It's	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
affair,	1
and	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
done	1
more	1
than	1
just	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
living.	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
two	1
assistants,	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
only	1
keep	1
one;	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
job	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
willing	1
to	1
come	1
for	1
half	1
wages	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
learn	1
the	1
business."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
obliging	1
youth?"	1
asked	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"His	1
name	1
is	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding,	1
and	1
he's	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
youth,	1
either.	1
It's	1
hard	1
to	1
say	1
his	1
age.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
wish	1
a	1
smarter	1
assistant,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
better	1
himself	1
and	1
earn	1
twice	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
him.	1
But,	1
after	1
all,	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
satisfied,	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
put	1
ideas	1
in	1
his	1
head?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
indeed?	1
You	1
seem	1
most	1
fortunate	1
in	1
having	1
an	1
employé	1
who	1
comes	1
under	1
the	1
full	1
market	1
price.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
common	1
experience	1
among	1
employers	1
in	1
this	1
age.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
assistant	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
remarkable	1
as	1
your	1
advertisement."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
faults,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Wilson.	1
"Never	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
fellow	1
for	1
photography.	1
Snapping	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
camera	1
when	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
improving	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
then	1
diving	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cellar	1
like	1
a	1
rabbit	1
into	1
its	1
hole	1
to	1
develop	1
his	1
pictures.	1
That	1
is	1
his	1
main	1
fault,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
he's	1
a	1
good	1
worker.	1
There's	1
no	1
vice	1
in	1
him."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
still	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
He	1
and	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
who	1
does	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
simple	1
cooking	1
and	1
keeps	1
the	1
place	1
clean--that's	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
widower	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
family.	1
We	1
live	1
very	1
quietly,	1
sir,	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
us;	1
and	1
we	1
keep	1
a	1
roof	1
over	1
our	1
heads	1
and	1
pay	1
our	1
debts,	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
nothing	1
more.	1
	1
"The	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
put	1
us	1
out	1
was	1
that	1
advertisement.	1
Spaulding,	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
office	1
just	1
this	1
day	1
eight	1
weeks,	1
with	1
this	1
very	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
says:	1
	1
"'I	1
wish	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
red-headed	1
man.'	1
	1
"'Why	1
that?'	1
I	1
asks.	1
	1
"'Why,'	1
says	1
he,	1
'here's	1
another	1
vacancy	1
on	1
the	1
League	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
Men.	1
It's	1
worth	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
fortune	1
to	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
gets	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
more	1
vacancies	1
than	1
there	1
are	1
men,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
trustees	1
are	1
at	1
their	1
wits'	1
end	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
money.	1
If	1
my	1
hair	1
would	1
only	1
change	1
colour,	1
here's	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
crib	1
all	1
ready	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
step	1
into.'	1
	1
"'Why,	1
what	1
is	1
it,	1
then?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
You	1
see,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
very	1
stay-at-home	1
man,	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
business	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
instead	1
of	1
my	1
having	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
it,	1
I	1
was	1
often	1
weeks	1
on	1
end	1
without	1
putting	1
my	1
foot	1
over	1
the	1
door-mat.	1
In	1
that	1
way	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
much	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
outside,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
news.	1
	1
"'Have	1
you	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
League	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
Men?'	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
open.	1
	1
"'Never.'	1
	1
"'Why,	1
I	1
wonder	1
at	1
that,	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
eligible	1
yourself	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
vacancies.'	1
	1
"'And	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
worth?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
merely	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hundred	1
a	1
year,	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
is	1
slight,	1
and	1
it	1
need	1
not	1
interfere	1
very	1
much	1
with	1
one's	1
other	1
occupations.'	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
can	1
easily	1
think	1
that	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
prick	1
up	1
my	1
ears,	1
for	1
the	1
business	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
over-good	1
for	1
some	1
years,	1
and	1
an	1
extra	1
couple	1
of	1
hundred	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
handy.	1
	1
"'Tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Well,'	1
said	1
he,	1
showing	1
me	1
the	1
advertisement,	1
'you	1
can	1
see	1
for	1
yourself	1
that	1
the	1
League	1
has	1
a	1
vacancy,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
address	1
where	1
you	1
should	1
apply	1
for	1
particulars.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out,	1
the	1
League	1
was	1
founded	1
by	1
an	1
American	1
millionaire,	1
Ezekiah	1
Hopkins,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
peculiar	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
red-headed,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
sympathy	1
for	1
all	1
red-headed	1
men;	1
so	1
when	1
he	1
died	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
enormous	1
fortune	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
trustees,	1
with	1
instructions	1
to	1
apply	1
the	1
interest	1
to	1
the	1
providing	1
of	1
easy	1
berths	1
to	1
men	1
whose	1
hair	1
is	1
of	1
that	1
colour.	1
From	1
all	1
I	1
hear	1
it	1
is	1
splendid	1
pay	1
and	1
very	1
little	1
to	1
do.'	1
	1
"'But,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'there	1
would	1
be	1
millions	1
of	1
red-headed	1
men	1
who	1
would	1
apply.'	1
	1
"'Not	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
you	1
might	1
think,'	1
he	1
answered.	1
'You	1
see	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
confined	1
to	1
Londoners,	1
and	1
to	1
grown	1
men.	1
This	1
American	1
had	1
started	1
from	1
London	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
young,	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
old	1
town	1
a	1
good	1
turn.	1
Then,	1
again,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
your	1
applying	1
if	1
your	1
hair	1
is	1
light	1
red,	1
or	1
dark	1
red,	1
or	1
anything	1
but	1
real	1
bright,	1
blazing,	1
fiery	1
red.	1
Now,	1
if	1
you	1
cared	1
to	1
apply,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
you	1
would	1
just	1
walk	1
in;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
hardly	1
be	1
worth	1
your	1
while	1
to	1
put	1
yourself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
pounds.'	1
	1
"Now,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fact,	1
gentlemen,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
my	1
hair	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
full	1
and	1
rich	1
tint,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
competition	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
I	1
stood	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
chance	1
as	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
met.	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
might	1
prove	1
useful,	1
so	1
I	1
just	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
shutters	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
right	1
away	1
with	1
me.	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
holiday,	1
so	1
we	1
shut	1
the	1
business	1
up	1
and	1
started	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
address	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
advertisement.	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
as	1
that	1
again,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
From	1
north,	1
south,	1
east,	1
and	1
west	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
red	1
in	1
his	1
hair	1
had	1
tramped	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
advertisement.	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
was	1
choked	1
with	1
red-headed	1
folk,	1
and	1
Pope's	1
Court	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
coster's	1
orange	1
barrow.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
country	1
as	1
were	1
brought	1
together	1
by	1
that	1
single	1
advertisement.	1
Every	1
shade	1
of	1
colour	1
they	1
were--straw,	1
lemon,	1
orange,	1
brick,	1
Irish-setter,	1
liver,	1
clay;	1
but,	1
as	1
Spaulding	1
said,	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
real	1
vivid	1
flame-coloured	1
tint.	1
When	1
I	1
saw	1
how	1
many	1
were	1
waiting,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
despair;	1
but	1
Spaulding	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
it.	1
How	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
imagine,	1
but	1
he	1
pushed	1
and	1
pulled	1
and	1
butted	1
until	1
he	1
got	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
steps	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
office.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
double	1
stream	1
upon	1
the	1
stair,	1
some	1
going	1
up	1
in	1
hope,	1
and	1
some	1
coming	1
back	1
dejected;	1
but	1
we	1
wedged	1
in	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
and	1
soon	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
office."	1
	1
"Your	1
experience	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
most	1
entertaining	1
one,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes	1
as	1
his	1
client	1
paused	1
and	1
refreshed	1
his	1
memory	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
pinch	1
of	1
snuff.	1
"Pray	1
continue	1
your	1
very	1
interesting	1
statement."	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
but	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
wooden	1
chairs	1
and	1
a	1
deal	1
table,	1
behind	1
which	1
sat	1
a	1
small	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
head	1
that	1
was	1
even	1
redder	1
than	1
mine.	1
He	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
each	1
candidate	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
always	1
managed	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
fault	1
in	1
them	1
which	1
would	1
disqualify	1
them.	1
Getting	1
a	1
vacancy	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
easy	1
matter,	1
after	1
all.	1
However,	1
when	1
our	1
turn	1
came	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
favourable	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
we	1
entered,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
private	1
word	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
"'This	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson,'	1
said	1
my	1
assistant,	1
'and	1
he	1
is	1
willing	1
to	1
fill	1
a	1
vacancy	1
in	1
the	1
League.'	1
	1
"'And	1
he	1
is	1
admirably	1
suited	1
for	1
it,'	1
the	1
other	1
answered.	1
'He	1
has	1
every	1
requirement.	1
I	1
cannot	1
recall	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
anything	1
so	1
fine.'	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
backward,	1
cocked	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
my	1
hair	1
until	1
I	1
felt	1
quite	1
bashful.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
he	1
plunged	1
forward,	1
wrung	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
congratulated	1
me	1
warmly	1
on	1
my	1
success.	1
	1
"'It	1
would	1
be	1
injustice	1
to	1
hesitate,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'You	1
will,	1
however,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
excuse	1
me	1
for	1
taking	1
an	1
obvious	1
precaution.'	1
With	1
that	1
he	1
seized	1
my	1
hair	1
in	1
both	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
tugged	1
until	1
I	1
yelled	1
with	1
the	1
pain.	1
'There	1
is	1
water	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,'	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
he	1
released	1
me.	1
'I	1
perceive	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be.	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
careful,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
twice	1
been	1
deceived	1
by	1
wigs	1
and	1
once	1
by	1
paint.	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
you	1
tales	1
of	1
cobbler's	1
wax	1
which	1
would	1
disgust	1
you	1
with	1
human	1
nature.'	1
He	1
stepped	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
shouted	1
through	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
that	1
the	1
vacancy	1
was	1
filled.	1
A	1
groan	1
of	1
disappointment	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
below,	1
and	1
the	1
folk	1
all	1
trooped	1
away	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
until	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
red-head	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
except	1
my	1
own	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
manager.	1
	1
"'My	1
name,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'is	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pensioners	1
upon	1
the	1
fund	1
left	1
by	1
our	1
noble	1
benefactor.	1
Are	1
you	1
a	1
married	1
man,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson?	1
Have	1
you	1
a	1
family?'	1
	1
"I	1
answered	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not.	1
	1
"His	1
face	1
fell	1
immediately.	1
	1
"'Dear	1
me!'	1
he	1
said	1
gravely,	1
'that	1
is	1
very	1
serious	1
indeed!	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
say	1
that.	1
The	1
fund	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
for	1
the	1
propagation	1
and	1
spread	1
of	1
the	1
red-heads	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
their	1
maintenance.	1
It	1
is	1
exceedingly	1
unfortunate	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
bachelor.'	1
	1
"My	1
face	1
lengthened	1
at	1
this,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
for	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
vacancy	1
after	1
all;	1
but	1
after	1
thinking	1
it	1
over	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
right.	1
	1
"'In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
another,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'the	1
objection	1
might	1
be	1
fatal,	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
stretch	1
a	1
point	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
head	1
of	1
hair	1
as	1
yours.	1
When	1
shall	1
you	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
your	1
new	1
duties?'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
awkward,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
business	1
already,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
never	1
mind	1
about	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson!'	1
said	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding.	1
'I	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
that	1
for	1
you.'	1
	1
"'What	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
hours?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Ten	1
to	1
two.'	1
	1
"Now	1
a	1
pawnbroker's	1
business	1
is	1
mostly	1
done	1
of	1
an	1
evening,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
especially	1
Thursday	1
and	1
Friday	1
evening,	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
before	1
pay-day;	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
suit	1
me	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
earn	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
mornings.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
my	1
assistant	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
to	1
anything	1
that	1
turned	1
up.	1
	1
"'That	1
would	1
suit	1
me	1
very	1
well,'	1
said	1
I.	1
'And	1
the	1
pay?'	1
	1
"'Is	1
4	1
pounds	1
a	1
week.'	1
	1
"'And	1
the	1
work?'	1
	1
"'Is	1
purely	1
nominal.'	1
	1
"'What	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
purely	1
nominal?'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
office,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
building,	1
the	1
whole	1
time.	1
If	1
you	1
leave,	1
you	1
forfeit	1
your	1
whole	1
position	1
forever.	1
The	1
will	1
is	1
very	1
clear	1
upon	1
that	1
point.	1
You	1
don't	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
conditions	1
if	1
you	1
budge	1
from	1
the	1
office	1
during	1
that	1
time.'	1
	1
"'It's	1
only	1
four	1
hours	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
leaving,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'No	1
excuse	1
will	1
avail,'	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross;	1
'neither	1
sickness	1
nor	1
business	1

anything	1
else.	1
There	1

	1
"'And	1
the	1

	1
"'Is	1

you	1
be	1
ready	1
to-morrow?'	1
	1
"'Certainly,'	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"'Then,	1
good-bye,	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
congratulate	1
you	1
once	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
important	1
position	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
gain.'	1
He	1
bowed	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
home	1
with	1
my	1
assistant,	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
do,	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
pleased	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
good	1
fortune.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
thought	1
over	1
the	1
matter	1
all	1
day,	1
and	1
by	1
evening	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
low	1
spirits	1
again;	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
quite	1
persuaded	1
myself	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
great	1
hoax	1
or	1
fraud,	1
though	1
what	1
its	1
object	1
might	1
be	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
imagine.	1
It	1
seemed	1
altogether	1
past	1
belief	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
make	1
such	1
a	1
will,	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
pay	1
such	1
a	1
sum	1
for	1
doing	1
anything	1
so	1
simple	1
as	1
copying	1
out	1
the	1
'Encyclopaedia	1
Britannica.'	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
cheer	1
me	1
up,	1
but	1
by	1
bedtime	1
I	1
had	1
reasoned	1
myself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
thing.	1
However,	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
anyhow,	1
so	1
I	1
bought	1
a	1
penny	1
bottle	1
of	1
ink,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
quill-pen,	1
and	1
seven	1
sheets	1
of	1
foolscap	1
paper,	1
I	1
started	1
off	1
for	1
Pope's	1
Court.	1
	1
"Well,	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
and	1
delight,	1
everything	1
was	1
as	1
right	1
as	1
possible.	1
The	1
table	1
was	1
set	1
out	1
ready	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
got	1
fairly	1
to	1
work.	1
He	1
started	1
me	1
off	1
upon	1
the	1
letter	1
A,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
left	1
me;	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
drop	1
in	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
right	1
with	1
me.	1
At	1
two	1
o'clock	1
he	1
bade	1
me	1
good-day,	1
complimented	1
me	1
upon	1
the	1
amount	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
written,	1
and	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
office	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
"This	1
went	1
on	1
day	1
after	1
day,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
on	1
Saturday	1
the	1
manager	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
planked	1
down	1
four	1
golden	1
sovereigns	1
for	1
my	1
week's	1
work.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
next	1
week,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
week	1
after.	1
Every	1
morning	1
I	1
was	1
there	1
at	1
ten,	1
and	1
every	1
afternoon	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
two.	1
By	1
degrees	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross	1
took	1
to	1
coming	1
in	1
only	1
once	1
of	1
a	1
morning,	1
and	1
then,	1
after	1
a	1
time,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
at	1
all.	1
Still,	1
of	1
course,	1
I	1
never	1
dared	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
sure	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
billet	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
and	1
suited	1
me	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
risk	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"Eight	1
weeks	1
passed	1
away	1
like	1
this,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
written	1
about	1
Abbots	1
and	1
Archery	1
and	1
Armour	1
and	1
Architecture	1
and	1
Attica,	1
and	1
hoped	1
with	1
diligence	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
get	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
B's	1
before	1
very	1
long.	1
It	1
cost	1
me	1
something	1
in	1
foolscap,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
filled	1
a	1
shelf	1
with	1
my	1
writings.	1
And	1
then	1
suddenly	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end."	1
	1
"To	1
an	1
end?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
And	1
no	1
later	1
than	1
this	1
morning.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
work	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
ten	1
o'clock,	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut	1
and	1
locked,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
square	1
of	1
cardboard	1
hammered	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
panel	1
with	1
a	1
tack.	1
Here	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
read	1
for	1
yourself."	1
	1
He	1
held	1
up	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
white	1
cardboard	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
note-paper.	1

October	1
9,	1
1890.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
and	1
I	1
surveyed	1
this	1
curt	1
announcement	1
and	1
the	1
rueful	1
face	1
behind	1
it,	1
until	1
the	1
comical	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
so	1
completely	1
overtopped	1
every	1
other	1
consideration	1
that	1
we	1
both	1
burst	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
laughter.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
very	1
funny,"	1
cried	1
our	1
client,	1
flushing	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
his	1
flaming	1
head.	1
"If	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
laugh	1
at	1
me,	1
I	1
can	1
go	1
elsewhere."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
cried	1
Holmes,	1
shoving	1
him	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
chair	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
half	1
risen.	1
"I	1
really	1
wouldn't	1
miss	1
your	1
case	1
for	1
the	1
world.	1
It	1
is	1
most	1
refreshingly	1
unusual.	1
But	1
there	1
is,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
saying	1
so,	1
something	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
funny	1
about	1
it.	1
Pray	1
what	1
steps	1
did	1
you	1
take	1
when	1
you	1
found	1
the	1
card	1
upon	1
the	1
door?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
staggered,	1
sir.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
Then	1
I	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
offices	1
round,	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
Finally,	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
landlord,	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
accountant	1
living	1
on	1
the	1
ground-floor,	1
and	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
League.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
any	1
such	1
body.	1
Then	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
who	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross	1
was.	1
He	1
answered	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
was	1
new	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"'Well,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'the	1
gentleman	1
at	1
No.	1
4.'	1
	1
"'What,	1
the	1
red-headed	1
man?'	1
	1
"'Yes.'	1
	1
"'Oh,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'his	1
name	1
was	1
William	1
Morris.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
solicitor	1
and	1
was	1
using	1
my	1
room	1
as	1
a	1
temporary	1
convenience	1
until	1
his	1
new	1
premises	1
were	1
ready.	1
He	1
moved	1
out	1
yesterday.'	1
	1
"'Where	1
could	1
I	1
find	1
him?'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
at	1
his	1
new	1
offices.	1
He	1
did	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
address.	1
Yes,	1
17	1
King	1
Edward	1
Street,	1
near	1
St.	1
Paul's.'	1
	1
"I	1
started	1
off,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
to	1
that	1
address	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
manufactory	1
of	1
artificial	1
knee-caps,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
either	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Morris	1
or	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"I	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square,	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
my	1
assistant.	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
me	1
in	1
any	1
way.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
waited	1
I	1
should	1
hear	1
by	1
post.	1
But	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
good	1
enough,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
lose	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
without	1
a	1
struggle,	1
so,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
give	1
advice	1
to	1
poor	1
folk	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
came	1
right	1
away	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
did	1
very	1
wisely,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Your	1
case	1
is	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
remarkable	1
one,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
it.	1
From	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
graver	1
issues	1
hang	1
from	1
it	1
than	1
might	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
appear."	1
	1
"Grave	1
enough!"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson.	1
"Why,	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
four	1
pound	1
a	1
week."	1
	1
"As	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
personally	1
concerned,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
grievance	1
against	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
league.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
you	1
are,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
richer	1
by	1
some	1
30	1
pounds,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
minute	1
knowledge	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
gained	1
on	1
every	1
subject	1
which	1
comes	1
under	1
the	1
letter	1
A.	1
You	1
have	1
lost	1
nothing	1
by	1
them."	1
	1
"No,	1
sir.	1
But	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
who	1
they	1
are,	1
and	1
what	1
their	1
object	1
was	1
in	1
playing	1
this	1
prank--if	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
prank--upon	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
pretty	1
expensive	1
joke	1
for	1
them,	1
for	1
it	1
cost	1
them	1
two	1
and	1
thirty	1
pounds."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
endeavour	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
these	1
points	1
for	1
you.	1
And,	1
first,	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
questions,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson.	1
This	1
assistant	1
of	1
yours	1
who	1
first	1
called	1
your	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
advertisement--how	1
long	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
with	1
you?"	1
	1
"About	1
a	1
month	1
then."	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
he	1
come?"	1
	1
"In	1
answer	1
to	1
an	1
advertisement."	1
	1
"Was	1
he	1
the	1
only	1
applicant?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
dozen."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
pick	1
him?"	1
	1
"Because	1
he	1
was	1
handy	1
and	1
would	1
come	1
cheap."	1
	1
"At	1
half-wages,	1
in	1
fact."	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
he	1
like,	1
this	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding?"	1
	1
"Small,	1
stout-built,	1
very	1
quick	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
no	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
though	1
he's	1
not	1
short	1
of	1
thirty.	1
Has	1
a	1
white	1
splash	1
of	1
acid	1
upon	1
his	1
forehead."	1
	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
in	1
considerable	1
excitement.	1
"I	1
thought	1
as	1
much,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Have	1
you	1
ever	1
observed	1
that	1
his	1
ears	1
are	1
pierced	1
for	1
earrings?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
a	1
gipsy	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
for	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
lad."	1
	1
"Hum!"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
sinking	1
back	1
in	1
deep	1
thought.	1
"He	1
is	1
still	1
with	1
you?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
sir;	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
just	1
left	1
him."	1
	1
"And	1
has	1
your	1
business	1
been	1
attended	1
to	1
in	1
your	1
absence?"	1
	1
"Nothing	1
to	1
complain	1
of,	1
sir.	1
There's	1
never	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
of	1
a	1
morning."	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
do,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
opinion	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two.	1
To-day	1
is	1
Saturday,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
by	1
Monday	1
we	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion."	1
	1
"Well,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
when	1
our	1
visitor	1
had	1
left	1
us,	1
"what	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
it	1
all?"	1
	1
"I	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
it,"	1
I	1
answered	1
frankly.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
mysterious	1
business."	1
	1
"As	1
a	1
rule,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"the	1
more	1
bizarre	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
less	1
mysterious	1
it	1
proves	1
to	1
be.	1
It	1
is	1
your	1
commonplace,	1
featureless	1
crimes	1
which	1
are	1
really	1
puzzling,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
commonplace	1
face	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
to	1
identify.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
prompt	1
over	1
this	1
matter."	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do,	1
then?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"To	1
smoke,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
three	1
pipe	1
problem,	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
won't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
fifty	1
minutes."	1
He	1
curled	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
knees	1
drawn	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
hawk-like	1
nose,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
his	1
black	1
clay	1
pipe	1
thrusting	1
out	1
like	1
the	1
bill	1
of	1
some	1
strange	1
bird.	1
I	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
dropped	1
asleep,	1
and	1
indeed	1
was	1
nodding	1
myself,	1
when	1
he	1
suddenly	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
with	1
the	1
gesture	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
pipe	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
mantelpiece.	1
	1
"Sarasate	1
plays	1
at	1
the	1
St.	1
James's	1
Hall	1
this	1
afternoon,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Watson?	1
Could	1
your	1
patients	1
spare	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
to-day.	1
My	1
practice	1
is	1
never	1
very	1
absorbing."	1
	1
"Then	1
put	1
on	1
your	1
hat	1
and	1
come.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
City	1
first,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
some	1
lunch	1
on	1
the	1
way.	1
I	1
observe	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
German	1
music	1
on	1
the	1
programme,	1
which	1
is	1
rather	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
taste	1
than	1
Italian	1
or	1
French.	1
It	1
is	1
introspective,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
introspect.	1
Come	1
along!"	1
	1
We	1
travelled	1
by	1
the	1
Underground	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Aldersgate;	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
walk	1
took	1
us	1
to	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square,	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
singular	1
story	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
poky,	1
little,	1
shabby-genteel	1
place,	1
where	1
four	1
lines	1
of	1
dingy	1
two-storied	1
brick	1
houses	1
looked	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
railed-in	1
enclosure,	1
where	1
a	1
lawn	1
of	1
weedy	1
grass	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
clumps	1
of	1
faded	1
laurel-bushes	1
made	1
a	1
hard	1
fight	1
against	1
a	1
smoke-laden	1
and	1
uncongenial	1
atmosphere.	1
Three	1
gilt	1
balls	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
board	1
with	1
"JABEZ	1
WILSON"	1
in	1
white	1
letters,	1
upon	1
a	1
corner	1
house,	1
announced	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
our	1
red-headed	1
client	1
carried	1
on	1
his	1
business.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
looked	1
it	1
all	1
over,	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
shining	1
brightly	1
between	1
puckered	1
lids.	1
Then	1
he	1
walked	1
slowly	1
up	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
then	1
down	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
corner,	1
still	1
looking	1
keenly	1
at	1
the	1
houses.	1
Finally	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
pawnbroker's,	1
and,	1
having	1
thumped	1
vigorously	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
with	1
his	1
stick	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
knocked.	1
It	1
was	1
instantly	1
opened	1
by	1
a	1
bright-looking,	1
clean-shaven	1
young	1
fellow,	1
who	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
step	1
in.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
how	1
you	1
would	1
go	1
from	1
here	1
to	1
the	1
Strand."	1
	1
"Third	1
right,	1
fourth	1
left,"	1
answered	1
the	1
assistant	1
promptly,	1
closing	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Smart	1
fellow,	1
that,"	1
observed	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
walked	1
away.	1
"He	1
is,	1
in	1
my	1
judgment,	1
the	1
fourth	1
smartest	1
man	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
for	1
daring	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
claim	1
to	1
be	1
third.	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
something	1
of	1
him	1
before."	1
	1
"Evidently,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"Mr.	1
Wilson's	1
assistant	1
counts	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
this	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
League.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
inquired	1
your	1
way	1
merely	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
see	1
him."	1
	1
"Not	1
him."	1
	1
"What	1
then?"	1
	1
"The	1
knees	1
of	1
his	1
trousers."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
see?"	1
	1
"What	1
I	1
expected	1
to	1
see."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
beat	1
the	1
pavement?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
doctor,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
observation,	1
not	1
for	1
talk.	1
We	1
are	1
spies	1
in	1
an	1
enemy's	1
country.	1
We	1
know	1
something	1
of	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
explore	1
the	1
parts	1
which	1
lie	1
behind	1
it."	1
	1
The	1
road	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
as	1
we	1
turned	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
from	1
the	1
retired	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square	1
presented	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
contrast	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
picture	1
does	1
to	1
the	1
back.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
arteries	1
which	1
conveyed	1
the	1
traffic	1
of	1
the	1
City	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
west.	1
The	1
roadway	1
was	1
blocked	1
with	1
the	1
immense	1
stream	1
of	1
commerce	1
flowing	1
in	1
a	1
double	1
tide	1
inward	1
and	1
outward,	1
while	1
the	1
footpaths	1
were	1
black	1
with	1
the	1
hurrying	1
swarm	1
of	1
pedestrians.	1
It	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
realise	1
as	1
we	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
fine	1
shops	1
and	1
stately	1
business	1
premises	1
that	1
they	1
really	1
abutted	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
upon	1
the	1
faded	1
and	1
stagnant	1
square	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
quitted.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
see,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
glancing	1
along	1
the	1
line,	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
just	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
here.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
hobby	1
of	1
mine	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
exact	1
knowledge	1
of	1
London.	1
There	1
is	1
Mortimer's,	1
the	1
tobacconist,	1
the	1
little	1
newspaper	1
shop,	1
the	1
Coburg	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
City	1
and	1
Suburban	1
Bank,	1
the	1
Vegetarian	1
Restaurant,	1
and	1
McFarlane's	1
carriage-building	1
depot.	1
That	1
carries	1
us	1
right	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
block.	1
And	1
now,	1
Doctor,	1
we've	1
done	1
our	1
work,	1
so	1
it's	1
time	1
we	1
had	1
some	1
play.	1
A	1
sandwich	1
and	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee,	1
and	1
then	1
off	1
to	1
violin-land,	1
where	1
all	1
is	1
sweetness	1
and	1
delicacy	1
and	1
harmony,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
red-headed	1
clients	1
to	1
vex	1
us	1
with	1
their	1
conundrums."	1
	1
My	1
friend	1
was	1
an	1
enthusiastic	1
musician,	1
being	1
himself	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
very	1
capable	1
performer	1
but	1
a	1
composer	1
of	1
no	1
ordinary	1
merit.	1
All	1
the	1
afternoon	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
stalls	1
wrapped	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
happiness,	1
gently	1
waving	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
fingers	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
music,	1
while	1
his	1
gently	1
smiling	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
languid,	1
dreamy	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
unlike	1
those	1
of	1
Holmes	1
the	1
sleuth-hound,	1
Holmes	1
the	1
relentless,	1
keen-witted,	1
ready-handed	1
criminal	1
agent,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
conceive.	1
In	1
his	1
singular	1
character	1
the	1
dual	1
nature	1
alternately	1
asserted	1
itself,	1
and	1
his	1
extreme	1
exactness	1
and	1
astuteness	1
represented,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
thought,	1
the	1
reaction	1
against	1
the	1
poetic	1
and	1
contemplative	1
mood	1
which	1
occasionally	1
predominated	1
in	1
him.	1
The	1
swing	1
of	1
his	1
nature	1
took	1
him	1
from	1
extreme	1
languor	1
to	1
devouring	1
energy;	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
well,	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
so	1
truly	1
formidable	1
as	1
when,	1
for	1
days	1
on	1
end,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
lounging	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
amid	1
his	1
improvisations	1
and	1
his	1
black-letter	1
editions.	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
chase	1
would	1
suddenly	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
brilliant	1
reasoning	1
power	1
would	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
intuition,	1
until	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
his	1
methods	1
would	1
look	1
askance	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
on	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
knowledge	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
of	1
other	1
mortals.	1
When	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
that	1
afternoon	1
so	1
enwrapped	1
in	1
the	1
music	1
at	1
St.	1
James's	1
Hall	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
an	1
evil	1
time	1
might	1
be	1
coming	1
upon	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
hunt	1
down.	1
	1
"You	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
home,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
Doctor,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
as	1
we	1
emerged.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
business	1
to	1
do	1
which	1
will	1
take	1
some	1
hours.	1
This	1
business	1
at	1
Coburg	1
Square	1
is	1
serious."	1
	1
"Why	1
serious?"	1
	1
"A	1
considerable	1
crime	1
is	1
in	1
contemplation.	1
I	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
stop	1
it.	1
But	1
to-day	1
being	1
Saturday	1
rather	1
complicates	1
matters.	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
your	1
help	1
to-night."	1
	1
"At	1
what	1
time?"	1
	1
"Ten	1
will	1
be	1
early	1
enough."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street	1
at	1
ten."	1
	1
"Very	1
well.	1
And,	1
I	1
say,	1
Doctor,	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
some	1
little	1
danger,	1
so	1
kindly	1
put	1
your	1
army	1
revolver	1
in	1
your	1
pocket."	1
He	1
waved	1
his	1
hand,	1
turned	1
on	1
his	1
heel,	1
and	1
disappeared	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
among	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
more	1
dense	1
than	1
my	1
neighbours,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
oppressed	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
stupidity	1
in	1
my	1
dealings	1
with	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
Here	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard,	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen,	1
and	1
yet	1
from	1
his	1
words	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen,	1
while	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
was	1
still	1
confused	1
and	1
grotesque.	1
As	1
I	1
drove	1
home	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
in	1
Kensington	1
I	1
thought	1
over	1
it	1
all,	1
from	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
red-headed	1
copier	1
of	1
the	1
"Encyclopaedia"	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square,	1
and	1
the	1
ominous	1
words	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
parted	1
from	1
me.	1
What	1
was	1
this	1
nocturnal	1
expedition,	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
go	1
armed?	1
Where	1
were	1
we	1
going,	1
and	1
what	1
were	1
we	1
to	1
do?	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
hint	1
from	1
Holmes	1
that	1
this	1
smooth-faced	1
pawnbroker's	1
assistant	1
was	1
a	1
formidable	1
man--a	1
man	1
who	1
might	1
play	1
a	1
deep	1
game.	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
puzzle	1
it	1
out,	1
but	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
despair	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
matter	1
aside	1
until	1
night	1
should	1
bring	1
an	1
explanation.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
quarter-past	1
nine	1
when	1
I	1
started	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
Park,	1
and	1
so	1
through	1
Oxford	1
Street	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
Two	1
hansoms	1
were	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
passage	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
from	1
above.	1
On	1
entering	1
his	1
room	1
I	1
found	1
Holmes	1
in	1
animated	1
conversation	1
with	1
two	1
men,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
recognised	1
as	1
Peter	1
Jones,	1
the	1
official	1
police	1
agent,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
thin,	1
sad-faced	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
shiny	1
hat	1
and	1
oppressively	1
respectable	1
frock-coat.	1
	1
"Ha!	1
Our	1
party	1
is	1
complete,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
pea-jacket	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
heavy	1
hunting	1
crop	1
from	1
the	1
rack.	1
"Watson,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
Mr.	1
Jones,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard?	1
Let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
companion	1
in	1
to-night's	1
adventure."	1
	1
"We're	1
hunting	1
in	1
couples	1
again,	1
Doctor,	1
you	1
see,"	1
said	1
Jones	1
in	1
his	1
consequential	1
way.	1
"Our	1
friend	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
man	1
for	1
starting	1
a	1
chase.	1
All	1
he	1
wants	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
dog	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
running	1
down."	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
a	1
wild	1
goose	1
may	1
not	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
our	1
chase,"	1
observed	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
gloomily.	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
place	1
considerable	1
confidence	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
police	1
agent	1
loftily.	1
"He	1
has	1
his	1
own	1
little	1
methods,	1
which	1
are,	1
if	1
he	1
won't	1
mind	1
my	1
saying	1
so,	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
theoretical	1
and	1
fantastic,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
makings	1
of	1
a	1
detective	1
in	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
once	1
or	1
twice,	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
Sholto	1
murder	1
and	1
the	1
Agra	1
treasure,	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
more	1
nearly	1
correct	1
than	1
the	1
official	1
force."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
you	1
say	1
so,	1
Mr.	1
Jones,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger	1
with	1
deference.	1
"Still,	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
miss	1
my	1
rubber.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
Saturday	1
night	1
for	1
seven-and-twenty	1
years	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
my	1
rubber."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
find,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
you	1
will	1
play	1
for	1
a	1
higher	1
stake	1
to-night	1
than	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
yet,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
play	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
exciting.	1
For	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
the	1
stake	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
30,000	1
pounds;	1
and	1
for	1
you,	1
Jones,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
upon	1
whom	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
lay	1
your	1
hands."	1
	1
"John	1
Clay,	1
the	1
murderer,	1
thief,	1
smasher,	1
and	1
forger.	1
He's	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
profession,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
my	1
bracelets	1
on	1
him	1
than	1
on	1
any	1
criminal	1
in	1
London.	1
He's	1
a	1
remarkable	1
man,	1
is	1
young	1
John	1
Clay.	1
His	1
grandfather	1
was	1
a	1
royal	1
duke,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
Eton	1
and	1
Oxford.	1
His	1
brain	1
is	1
as	1
cunning	1
as	1
his	1
fingers,	1
and	1
though	1
we	1
meet	1
signs	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
every	1
turn,	1
we	1
never	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
man	1
himself.	1
He'll	1
crack	1
a	1
crib	1
in	1
Scotland	1
one	1
week,	1
and	1
be	1
raising	1
money	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
orphanage	1
in	1
Cornwall	1
the	1
next.	1
I've	1
been	1
on	1
his	1
track	1
for	1
years	1
and	1
have	1
never	1
set	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
yet."	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
introducing	1
you	1
to-night.	1
I've	1
had	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
little	1
turns	1
also	1
with	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Clay,	1
and	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
profession.	1
It	1
is	1
past	1
ten,	1
however,	1
and	1
quite	1
time	1
that	1
we	1
started.	1
If	1
you	1
two	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
hansom,	1
Watson	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
in	1
the	1
second."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
communicative	1
during	1
the	1
long	1
drive	1
and	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
cab	1
humming	1
the	1
tunes	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
We	1
rattled	1
through	1
an	1
endless	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
gas-lit	1
streets	1
until	1
we	1
emerged	1
into	1
Farrington	1
Street.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
close	1
there	1
now,"	1
my	1
friend	1
remarked.	1
"This	1
fellow	1
Merryweather	1
is	1
a	1
bank	1
director,	1
and	1
personally	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
have	1
Jones	1
with	1
us	1
also.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
fellow,	1
though	1
an	1
absolute	1
imbecile	1
in	1
his	1
profession.	1
He	1
has	1
one	1
positive	1
virtue.	1
He	1
is	1
as	1
brave	1
as	1
a	1
bulldog	1
and	1
as	1
tenacious	1
as	1
a	1
lobster	1
if	1
he	1
gets	1
his	1
claws	1
upon	1
anyone.	1
Here	1
we	1
are,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
waiting	1
for	1
us."	1
	1
We	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
same	1
crowded	1
thoroughfare	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
Our	1
cabs	1
were	1
dismissed,	1
and,	1
following	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
we	1
passed	1
down	1
a	1
narrow	1
passage	1
and	1
through	1
a	1
side	1
door,	1
which	1
he	1
opened	1
for	1
us.	1
Within	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
corridor,	1
which	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
massive	1
iron	1
gate.	1
This	1
also	1
was	1
opened,	1
and	1
led	1
down	1
a	1
flight	1
of	1
winding	1
stone	1
steps,	1
which	1
terminated	1
at	1
another	1
formidable	1
gate.	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
stopped	1
to	1
light	1
a	1
lantern,	1
and	1
then	1
conducted	1
us	1
down	1
a	1
dark,	1
earth-smelling	1
passage,	1
and	1
so,	1
after	1
opening	1
a	1
third	1
door,	1
into	1
a	1
huge	1
vault	1
or	1
cellar,	1
which	1
was	1
piled	1
all	1
round	1
with	1
crates	1
and	1
massive	1
boxes.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
vulnerable	1
from	1
above,"	1
Holmes	1
remarked	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
lantern	1
and	1
gazed	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"Nor	1
from	1
below,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
striking	1
his	1
stick	1
upon	1
the	1
flags	1
which	1
lined	1
the	1
floor.	1
"Why,	1
dear	1
me,	1
it	1
sounds	1
quite	1
hollow!"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
looking	1
up	1
in	1
surprise.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
really	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
quiet!"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
severely.	1
"You	1
have	1
already	1
imperilled	1
the	1
whole	1
success	1
of	1
our	1
expedition.	1
Might	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
boxes,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
interfere?"	1
	1
The	1
solemn	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
perched	1
himself	1
upon	1
a	1
crate,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
injured	1
expression	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
while	1
Holmes	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
lantern	1
and	1
a	1
magnifying	1
lens,	1
began	1
to	1
examine	1
minutely	1
the	1
cracks	1
between	1
the	1
stones.	1
A	1
few	1
seconds	1
sufficed	1
to	1
satisfy	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
again	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
glass	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
us,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"for	1
they	1
can	1
hardly	1
take	1
any	1
steps	1
until	1
the	1
good	1
pawnbroker	1
is	1
safely	1
in	1
bed.	1
Then	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
lose	1
a	1
minute,	1
for	1
the	1
sooner	1
they	1
do	1
their	1
work	1
the	1
longer	1
time	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
for	1
their	1
escape.	1
We	1
are	1
at	1
present,	1
Doctor--as	1
no	1
doubt	1
you	1
have	1
divined--in	1
the	1
cellar	1
of	1
the	1
City	1
branch	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
London	1
banks.	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
is	1
the	1
chairman	1
of	1
directors,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
explain	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
reasons	1
why	1
the	1
more	1
daring	1
criminals	1
of	1
London	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
considerable	1
interest	1
in	1
this	1
cellar	1
at	1
present."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
our	1
French	1
gold,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
director.	1
"We	1
have	1
had	1
several	1
warnings	1
that	1
an	1
attempt	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
upon	1
it."	1
	1
"Your	1
French	1
gold?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
We	1
had	1
occasion	1
some	1
months	1
ago	1
to	1
strengthen	1
our	1
resources	1
and	1
borrowed	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
30,000	1
napoleons	1
from	1
the	1
Bank	1
of	1
France.	1
It	1
has	1
become	1
known	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
occasion	1
to	1
unpack	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
lying	1
in	1
our	1
cellar.	1
The	1
crate	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
sit	1
contains	1
2,000	1
napoleons	1
packed	1
between	1
layers	1
of	1
lead	1
foil.	1
Our	1
reserve	1
of	1
bullion	1
is	1
much	1
larger	1
at	1
present	1
than	1
is	1
usually	1
kept	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
branch	1
office,	1
and	1
the	1
directors	1
have	1
had	1
misgivings	1
upon	1
the	1
subject."	1
	1
"Which	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
justified,"	1
observed	1
Holmes.	1
"And	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
that	1
we	1
arranged	1
our	1
little	1
plans.	1
I	1
expect	1
that	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
matters	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
head.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
the	1
screen	1
over	1
that	1
dark	1
lantern."	1
	1
"And	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
dark?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
so.	1
I	1
had	1
brought	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
cards	1
in	1
my	1
pocket,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
that,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
a	1
partie	1
carrée,	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
your	1
rubber	1
after	1
all.	1
But	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
enemy's	1
preparations	1
have	1
gone	1
so	1
far	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
risk	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
light.	1
And,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
we	1
must	1
choose	1
our	1
positions.	1
These	1
are	1
daring	1
men,	1
and	1
though	1
we	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
at	1
a	1
disadvantage,	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
us	1
some	1
harm	1
unless	1
we	1
are	1
careful.	1
I	1
shall	1
stand	1
behind	1
this	1
crate,	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
conceal	1
yourselves	1
behind	1
those.	1
Then,	1
when	1
I	1
flash	1
a	1
light	1
upon	1
them,	1
close	1
in	1
swiftly.	1
If	1
they	1
fire,	1
Watson,	1
have	1
no	1
compunction	1
about	1
shooting	1
them	1
down."	1
	1
I	1
placed	1
my	1
revolver,	1
cocked,	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wooden	1
case	1
behind	1
which	1
I	1
crouched.	1
Holmes	1
shot	1
the	1
slide	1
across	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
lantern	1
and	1
left	1
us	1
in	1
pitch	1
darkness--such	1
an	1
absolute	1
darkness	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
before	1
experienced.	1
The	1
smell	1
of	1
hot	1
metal	1
remained	1
to	1
assure	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
still	1
there,	1
ready	1
to	1
flash	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
moment's	1
notice.	1
To	1
me,	1
with	1
my	1
nerves	1
worked	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
pitch	1
of	1
expectancy,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
depressing	1
and	1
subduing	1
in	1
the	1
sudden	1
gloom,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
dank	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
vault.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
retreat,"	1
whispered	1
Holmes.	1
"That	1
is	1
back	1
through	1
the	1
house	1
into	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
I	1
asked	1
you,	1
Jones?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
inspector	1
and	1
two	1
officers	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door."	1
	1
"Then	1
we	1
have	1
stopped	1
all	1
the	1
holes.	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
silent	1
and	1
wait."	1
	1
What	1
a	1
time	1
it	1
seemed!	1
From	1
comparing	1
notes	1
afterwards	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
quarter,	1
yet	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
night	1
must	1
have	1
almost	1
gone	1
and	1
the	1
dawn	1
be	1
breaking	1
above	1
us.	1
My	1
limbs	1
were	1
weary	1
and	1
stiff,	1
for	1
I	1
feared	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
position;	1
yet	1
my	1
nerves	1
were	1
worked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch	1
of	1
tension,	1
and	1
my	1
hearing	1
was	1
so	1
acute	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
only	1
hear	1
the	1
gentle	1
breathing	1
of	1
my	1
companions,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
distinguish	1
the	1
deeper,	1
heavier	1
in-breath	1
of	1
the	1
bulky	1
Jones	1
from	1
the	1
thin,	1
sighing	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
director.	1
From	1
my	1
position	1
I	1
could	1
look	1
over	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
floor.	1
Suddenly	1
my	1
eyes	1
caught	1
the	1
glint	1
of	1
a	1
light.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
lurid	1
spark	1
upon	1
the	1
stone	1
pavement.	1
Then	1
it	1
lengthened	1
out	1
until	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
yellow	1
line,	1
and	1
then,	1
without	1
any	1
warning	1
or	1
sound,	1
a	1
gash	1
seemed	1
to	1
open	1
and	1
a	1
hand	1
appeared,	1
a	1
white,	1
almost	1
womanly	1
hand,	1
which	1
felt	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
area	1
of	1
light.	1
For	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
more	1
the	1
hand,	1
with	1
its	1
writhing	1
fingers,	1
protruded	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
floor.	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
withdrawn	1
as	1
suddenly	1
as	1
it	1
appeared,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
dark	1
again	1
save	1
the	1
single	1
lurid	1
spark	1
which	1
marked	1
a	1
chink	1
between	1
the	1
stones.	1
	1
Its	1
disappearance,	1
however,	1
was	1
but	1
momentary.	1
With	1
a	1
rending,	1
tearing	1
sound,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
broad,	1
white	1
stones	1
turned	1
over	1
upon	1
its	1
side	1
and	1
left	1
a	1
square,	1
gaping	1
hole,	1
through	1
which	1
streamed	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
lantern.	1
Over	1
the	1
edge	1
there	1
peeped	1
a	1
clean-cut,	1
boyish	1
face,	1
which	1
looked	1
keenly	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
a	1
hand	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
aperture,	1
drew	1
itself	1
shoulder-high	1
and	1
waist-high,	1
until	1
one	1
knee	1
rested	1
upon	1
the	1
edge.	1
In	1
another	1
instant	1
he	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hole	1
and	1
was	1
hauling	1
after	1
him	1
a	1
companion,	1
lithe	1
and	1
small	1
like	1
himself,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
very	1
red	1
hair.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
clear,"	1
he	1
whispered.	1
"Have	1
you	1
the	1
chisel	1
and	1
the	1
bags?	1
Great	1
Scott!	1
Jump,	1
Archie,	1
jump,	1
and	1
I'll	1
swing	1
for	1
it!"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
sprung	1
out	1
and	1
seized	1
the	1
intruder	1
by	1
the	1
collar.	1
The	1
other	1
dived	1
down	1
the	1
hole,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
rending	1
cloth	1
as	1
Jones	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
skirts.	1
The	1
light	1
flashed	1
upon	1
the	1
barrel	1
of	1
a	1
revolver,	1
but	1
Holmes'	1
hunting	1
crop	1
came	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
man's	1
wrist,	1
and	1
the	1
pistol	1
clinked	1
upon	1
the	1
stone	1
floor.	1
	1
"It's	1
no	1
use,	1
John	1
Clay,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
blandly.	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
chance	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
see,"	1
the	1
other	1
answered	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
coolness.	1
"I	1
fancy	1
that	1
my	1
pal	1
is	1
all	1
right,	1
though	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
his	1
coat-tails."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
three	1
men	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
indeed!	1
You	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
thing	1
very	1
completely.	1
I	1
must	1
compliment	1
you."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
you,"	1
Holmes	1
answered.	1
"Your	1
red-headed	1
idea	1
was	1
very	1
new	1
and	1
effective."	1
	1
"You'll	1
see	1
your	1
pal	1
again	1
presently,"	1
said	1
Jones.	1
"He's	1
quicker	1
at	1
climbing	1
down	1
holes	1
than	1
I	1
am.	1
Just	1
hold	1
out	1
while	1
I	1
fix	1
the	1
derbies."	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
touch	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
filthy	1
hands,"	1
remarked	1
our	1
prisoner	1
as	1
the	1
handcuffs	1
clattered	1
upon	1
his	1
wrists.	1
"You	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
aware	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
royal	1
blood	1
in	1
my	1
veins.	1
Have	1
the	1
goodness,	1
also,	1
when	1
you	1
address	1
me	1
always	1
to	1
say	1
'sir'	1
and	1
'please.'"	1
	1
"All	1
right,"	1
said	1
Jones	1
with	1
a	1
stare	1
and	1
a	1
snigger.	1
"Well,	1
would	1
you	1
please,	1
sir,	1
march	1
upstairs,	1
where	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
cab	1
to	1
carry	1
your	1
Highness	1
to	1
the	1
police-station?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
better,"	1
said	1
John	1
Clay	1
serenely.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
sweeping	1
bow	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
walked	1
quietly	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
the	1
detective.	1
	1
"Really,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
as	1
we	1
followed	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
cellar,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
bank	1
can	1
thank	1
you	1
or	1
repay	1
you.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
detected	1
and	1
defeated	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
complete	1
manner	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
determined	1
attempts	1
at	1
bank	1
robbery	1
that	1
have	1
ever	1
come	1
within	1
my	1
experience."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
little	1
scores	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
to	1
settle	1
with	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Clay,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
some	1
small	1
expense	1
over	1
this	1
matter,	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
expect	1
the	1
bank	1
to	1
refund,	1
but	1
beyond	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
amply	1
repaid	1
by	1
having	1
had	1
an	1
experience	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
many	1
ways	1
unique,	1
and	1
by	1
hearing	1
the	1
very	1
remarkable	1
narrative	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
League."	1
	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
explained	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
over	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
whisky	1
and	1
soda	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
"it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
obvious	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
possible	1
object	1
of	1
this	1
rather	1
fantastic	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
advertisement	1
of	1
the	1
League,	1
and	1
the	1
copying	1
of	1
the	1
'Encyclopaedia,'	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
get	1
this	1
not	1
over-bright	1
pawnbroker	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
hours	1
every	1
day.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
curious	1
way	1
of	1
managing	1
it,	1
but,	1
really,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
suggest	1
a	1
better.	1
The	1
method	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
suggested	1
to	1
Clay's	1
ingenious	1
mind	1
by	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
his	1
accomplice's	1
hair.	1
The	1
4	1
pounds	1
a	1
week	1
was	1
a	1
lure	1
which	1
must	1
draw	1
him,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
who	1
were	1
playing	1
for	1
thousands?	1
They	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
advertisement,	1
one	1
rogue	1
has	1
the	1
temporary	1
office,	1
the	1
other	1
rogue	1
incites	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
apply	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
together	1
they	1
manage	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
absence	1
every	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
week.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
assistant	1
having	1
come	1
for	1
half	1
wages,	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
strong	1
motive	1
for	1
securing	1
the	1
situation."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
guess	1
what	1
the	1
motive	1
was?"	1
	1
"Had	1
there	1
been	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
suspected	1
a	1
mere	1
vulgar	1
intrigue.	1
That,	1
however,	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
The	1
man's	1
business	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
one,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
which	1
could	1
account	1
for	1
such	1
elaborate	1
preparations,	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
expenditure	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
at.	1
It	1
must,	1
then,	1
be	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
What	1
could	1
it	1
be?	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
assistant's	1
fondness	1
for	1
photography,	1
and	1
his	1
trick	1
of	1
vanishing	1
into	1
the	1
cellar.	1
The	1
cellar!	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
tangled	1
clue.	1
Then	1
I	1
made	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
mysterious	1
assistant	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
coolest	1
and	1
most	1
daring	1
criminals	1
in	1
London.	1
He	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
cellar--something	1
which	1
took	1
many	1
hours	1
a	1
day	1
for	1
months	1
on	1
end.	1
What	1
could	1
it	1
be,	1
once	1
more?	1
I	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
save	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
a	1
tunnel	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
building.	1
	1
"So	1
far	1
I	1
had	1
got	1
when	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action.	1
I	1
surprised	1
you	1
by	1
beating	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
with	1
my	1
stick.	1
I	1
was	1
ascertaining	1
whether	1
the	1
cellar	1
stretched	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
or	1
behind.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
front.	1
Then	1
I	1
rang	1
the	1
bell,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
hoped,	1
the	1
assistant	1
answered	1
it.	1
We	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
skirmishes,	1
but	1
we	1
had	1
never	1
set	1
eyes	1
upon	1
each	1
other	1
before.	1
I	1
hardly	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
face.	1
His	1
knees	1
were	1
what	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
see.	1
You	1
must	1
yourself	1
have	1
remarked	1
how	1
worn,	1
wrinkled,	1
and	1
stained	1
they	1
were.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
those	1
hours	1
of	1
burrowing.	1
The	1
only	1
remaining	1
point	1
was	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
burrowing	1
for.	1
I	1
walked	1
round	1
the	1
corner,	1
saw	1
the	1
City	1
and	1
Suburban	1
Bank	1
abutted	1
on	1
our	1
friend's	1
premises,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
solved	1
my	1
problem.	1
When	1
you	1
drove	1
home	1
after	1
the	1
concert	1
I	1
called	1
upon	1
Scotland	1
Yard	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
chairman	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
directors,	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
seen."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
tell	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
make	1
their	1
attempt	1
to-night?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Well,	1
when	1
they	1
closed	1
their	1
League	1
offices	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
they	1
cared	1
no	1
longer	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson's	1
presence--in	1
other	1
words,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
completed	1
their	1
tunnel.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
essential	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
use	1
it	1
soon,	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
discovered,	1
or	1
the	1
bullion	1
might	1
be	1
removed.	1
Saturday	1
would	1
suit	1
them	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
day,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
two	1
days	1
for	1
their	1
escape.	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
reasons	1
I	1
expected	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
to-night."	1
	1
"You	1
reasoned	1
it	1
out	1
beautifully,"	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
unfeigned	1
admiration.	1
"It	1
is	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
chain,	1
and	1
yet	1
every	1
link	1
rings	1
true."	1
	1
"It	1
saved	1
me	1
from	1
ennui,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
yawning.	1
"Alas!	1
I	1
already	1
feel	1
it	1
closing	1
in	1
upon	1
me.	1
My	1
life	1
is	1
spent	1
in	1
one	1
long	1
effort	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
commonplaces	1
of	1
existence.	1
These	1
little	1
problems	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
benefactor	1
of	1
the	1
race,"	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"Well,	1
perhaps,	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
some	1
little	1
use,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"'L'homme	1
c'est	1
rien--l'oeuvre	1
c'est	1
tout,'	1
as	1
Gustave	1
Flaubert	1
wrote	1
to	1
George	1
Sand."	1
	1
	1
	1
ADVENTURE	1
III.	1
A	1
CASE	1
OF	1
IDENTITY	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
his	1
lodgings	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
"life	1
is	1
infinitely	1
stranger	1
than	1
anything	1
which	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man	1
could	1
invent.	1
We	1
would	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
conceive	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
really	1
mere	1
commonplaces	1
of	1
existence.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
fly	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
window	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
hover	1
over	1
this	1
great	1
city,	1
gently	1
remove	1
the	1
roofs,	1
and	1
peep	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
queer	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
going	1
on,	1
the	1
strange	1
coincidences,	1
the	1
plannings,	1
the	1
cross-purposes,	1
the	1
wonderful	1
chains	1
of	1
events,	1
working	1
through	1
generations,	1
and	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
outré	1
results,	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
all	1
fiction	1
with	1
its	1
conventionalities	1
and	1
foreseen	1
conclusions	1
most	1
stale	1
and	1
unprofitable."	1
	1
"And	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
convinced	1
of	1
it,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
"The	1
cases	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
are,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
bald	1
enough,	1
and	1
vulgar	1
enough.	1
We	1
have	1
in	1
our	1
police	1
reports	1
realism	1
pushed	1
to	1
its	1
extreme	1
limits,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
result	1
is,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
confessed,	1
neither	1
fascinating	1
nor	1
artistic."	1
	1
"A	1
certain	1
selection	1
and	1
discretion	1
must	1
be	1
used	1
in	1
producing	1
a	1
realistic	1
effect,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes.	1
"This	1
is	1
wanting	1
in	1
the	1
police	1
report,	1
where	1
more	1
stress	1
is	1
laid,	1
perhaps,	1
upon	1
the	1
platitudes	1
of	1
the	1
magistrate	1
than	1
upon	1
the	1
details,	1
which	1
to	1
an	1
observer	1
contain	1
the	1
vital	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
matter.	1
Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
unnatural	1
as	1
the	1
commonplace."	1
	1
I	1
smiled	1
and	1
shook	1
my	1
head.	1
"I	1
can	1
quite	1
understand	1
your	1
thinking	1
so,"	1
I	1
said.	1
"Of	1
course,	1
in	1
your	1
position	1
of	1
unofficial	1
adviser	1
and	1
helper	1
to	1
everybody	1
who	1
is	1
absolutely	1
puzzled,	1
throughout	1
three	1
continents,	1
you	1
are	1
brought	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
strange	1
and	1
bizarre.	1
But	1
here"--I	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
morning	1
paper	1
from	1
the	1
ground--"let	1
us	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
practical	1
test.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
heading	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
come.	1
'A	1
husband's	1
cruelty	1
to	1
his	1
wife.'	1
There	1
is	1
half	1
a	1
column	1
of	1
print,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
without	1
reading	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
perfectly	1
familiar	1
to	1
me.	1
There	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
the	1
other	1
woman,	1
the	1
drink,	1
the	1
push,	1
the	1
blow,	1
the	1
bruise,	1
the	1
sympathetic	1
sister	1
or	1
landlady.	1
The	1
crudest	1
of	1
writers	1
could	1
invent	1
nothing	1
more	1
crude."	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
your	1
example	1
is	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
one	1
for	1
your	1
argument,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
taking	1
the	1
paper	1
and	1
glancing	1
his	1
eye	1
down	1
it.	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
Dundas	1
separation	1
case,	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
happens,	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
clearing	1
up	1
some	1
small	1
points	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
it.	1
The	1
husband	1
was	1
a	1
teetotaler,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
conduct	1
complained	1
of	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
drifted	1
into	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
winding	1
up	1
every	1
meal	1
by	1
taking	1
out	1
his	1
false	1
teeth	1
and	1
hurling	1
them	1
at	1
his	1
wife,	1
which,	1
you	1
will	1
allow,	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
action	1
likely	1
to	1
occur	1
to	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
average	1
story-teller.	1
Take	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
snuff,	1
Doctor,	1
and	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
scored	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
example."	1
	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
snuffbox	1
of	1
old	1
gold,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
amethyst	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
lid.	1
Its	1
splendour	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
homely	1
ways	1
and	1
simple	1
life	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
commenting	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
"Ah,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
forgot	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
you	1
for	1
some	1
weeks.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
souvenir	1
from	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
my	1
assistance	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Irene	1
Adler	1
papers."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
ring?"	1
I	1
asked,	1
glancing	1
at	1
a	1
remarkable	1
brilliant	1
which	1
sparkled	1
upon	1
his	1
finger.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
reigning	1
family	1
of	1
Holland,	1
though	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
served	1
them	1
was	1
of	1
such	1
delicacy	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
confide	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
chronicle	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
my	1
little	1
problems."	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
any	1
on	1
hand	1
just	1
now?"	1
I	1
asked	1
with	1
interest.	1
	1
"Some	1
ten	1
or	1
twelve,	1
but	1
none	1
which	1
present	1
any	1
feature	1
of	1
interest.	1
They	1
are	1
important,	1
you	1
understand,	1
without	1
being	1
interesting.	1
Indeed,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
usually	1
in	1
unimportant	1
matters	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
field	1
for	1
the	1
observation,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
quick	1
analysis	1
of	1
cause	1
and	1
effect	1
which	1
gives	1
the	1
charm	1
to	1
an	1
investigation.	1
The	1
larger	1
crimes	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
simpler,	1
for	1
the	1
bigger	1
the	1
crime	1
the	1
more	1
obvious,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
is	1
the	1
motive.	1
In	1
these	1
cases,	1
save	1
for	1
one	1
rather	1
intricate	1
matter	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
referred	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
Marseilles,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
which	1
presents	1
any	1
features	1
of	1
interest.	1
It	1
is	1
possible,	1
however,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
something	1
better	1
before	1
very	1
many	1
minutes	1
are	1
over,	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
clients,	1
or	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken."	1
	1
He	1
had	1
risen	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
was	1
standing	1
between	1
the	1
parted	1
blinds	1
gazing	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
dull	1
neutral-tinted	1
London	1
street.	1
Looking	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
pavement	1
opposite	1
there	1
stood	1
a	1
large	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
fur	1
boa	1
round	1
her	1
neck,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
curling	1
red	1
feather	1
in	1
a	1
broad-brimmed	1
hat	1
which	1
was	1
tilted	1
in	1
a	1
coquettish	1
Duchess	1
of	1
Devonshire	1
fashion	1
over	1
her	1
ear.	1
From	1
under	1
this	1
great	1
panoply	1
she	1
peeped	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
nervous,	1
hesitating	1
fashion	1
at	1
our	1
windows,	1
while	1
her	1
body	1
oscillated	1
backward	1
and	1
forward,	1
and	1
her	1
fingers	1
fidgeted	1
with	1
her	1
glove	1
buttons.	1
Suddenly,	1
with	1
a	1
plunge,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
swimmer	1
who	1
leaves	1
the	1
bank,	1
she	1
hurried	1
across	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
sharp	1
clang	1
of	1
the	1
bell.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
those	1
symptoms	1
before,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
throwing	1
his	1
cigarette	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
"Oscillation	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
always	1
means	1
an	1
affaire	1
de	1
coeur.	1
She	1
would	1
like	1
advice,	1
but	1
is	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
delicate	1
for	1
communication.	1
And	1
yet	1
even	1
here	1
we	1
may	1
discriminate.	1
When	1
a	1
woman	1
has	1
been	1
seriously	1
wronged	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
oscillates,	1
and	1
the	1
usual	1
symptom	1
is	1
a	1
broken	1
bell	1
wire.	1
Here	1
we	1
may	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
love	1
matter,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
maiden	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
angry	1
as	1
perplexed,	1
or	1
grieved.	1
But	1
here	1
she	1
comes	1
in	1
person	1
to	1
resolve	1
our	1
doubts."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tap	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
boy	1
in	1
buttons	1
entered	1
to	1
announce	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland,	1
while	1
the	1
lady	1
herself	1
loomed	1
behind	1
his	1
small	1
black	1
figure	1
like	1
a	1
full-sailed	1
merchant-man	1
behind	1
a	1
tiny	1
pilot	1
boat.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
welcomed	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
easy	1
courtesy	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
remarkable,	1
and,	1
having	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
bowed	1
her	1
into	1
an	1
armchair,	1
he	1
looked	1
her	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
minute	1
and	1
yet	1
abstracted	1
fashion	1
which	1
was	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
not	1
find,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
with	1
your	1
short	1
sight	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
typewriting?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
at	1
first,"	1
she	1
answered,	1
"but	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
the	1
letters	1
are	1
without	1
looking."	1
Then,	1
suddenly	1
realising	1
the	1
full	1
purport	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
violent	1
start	1
and	1
looked	1
up,	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
astonishment	1
upon	1
her	1
broad,	1
good-humoured	1
face.	1
"You've	1
heard	1
about	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"else	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
that?"	1
	1
"Never	1
mind,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing;	1
"it	1
is	1
my	1
business	1
to	1
know	1
things.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
have	1
trained	1
myself	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
others	1
overlook.	1
If	1
not,	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
consult	1
me?"	1
	1
"I	1
came	1
to	1
you,	1
sir,	1
because	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Etherege,	1
whose	1
husband	1
you	1
found	1
so	1
easy	1
when	1
the	1
police	1
and	1
everyone	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
dead.	1
Oh,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
would	1
do	1
as	1
much	1
for	1
me.	1
I'm	1
not	1
rich,	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
hundred	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
right,	1
besides	1
the	1
little	1
that	1
I	1
make	1
by	1
the	1
machine,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
away	1
to	1
consult	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry?"	1
asked	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
with	1
his	1
finger-tips	1
together	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
	1
Again	1
a	1
startled	1
look	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
somewhat	1
vacuous	1
face	1
of	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
did	1
bang	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"for	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
angry	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
easy	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Windibank--that	1
is,	1
my	1
father--took	1
it	1
all.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
police,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
so	1
at	1
last,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
nothing	1
and	1
kept	1
on	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
harm	1
done,	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
mad,	1
and	1
I	1
just	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
things	1
and	1
came	1
right	1
away	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Your	1
father,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"your	1
stepfather,	1
surely,	1
since	1
the	1
name	1
is	1
different."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
stepfather.	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
father,	1
though	1
it	1
sounds	1
funny,	1
too,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
five	1
years	1
and	1
two	1
months	1
older	1
than	1
myself."	1
	1
"And	1
your	1
mother	1
is	1
alive?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
mother	1
is	1
alive	1
and	1
well.	1
I	1
wasn't	1
best	1
pleased,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
when	1
she	1
married	1
again	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
father's	1
death,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
nearly	1
fifteen	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
herself.	1
Father	1
was	1
a	1
plumber	1
in	1
the	1
Tottenham	1
Court	1
Road,	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
a	1
tidy	1
business	1
behind	1
him,	1
which	1
mother	1
carried	1
on	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Hardy,	1
the	1
foreman;	1
but	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
came	1
he	1
made	1
her	1
sell	1
the	1
business,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
superior,	1
being	1
a	1
traveller	1
in	1
wines.	1
They	1
got	1
4700	1
pounds	1
for	1
the	1
goodwill	1
and	1
interest,	1
which	1
wasn't	1
near	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
father	1
could	1
have	1
got	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
alive."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
impatient	1
under	1
this	1
rambling	1
and	1
inconsequential	1
narrative,	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
had	1
listened	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
concentration	1
of	1
attention.	1
	1
"Your	1
own	1
little	1
income,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
"does	1
it	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
business?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
sir.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
separate	1
and	1
was	1
left	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
uncle	1
Ned	1
in	1
Auckland.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
New	1
Zealand	1
stock,	1
paying	1
4	1
1/2	1
per	1
cent.	1
Two	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
was	1
the	1
amount,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
touch	1
the	1
interest."	1
	1
"You	1
interest	1
me	1
extremely,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"And	1
since	1
you	1
draw	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
sum	1
as	1
a	1
hundred	1
a	1
year,	1
with	1
what	1
you	1
earn	1
into	1
the	1
bargain,	1
you	1
no	1
doubt	1
travel	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
indulge	1
yourself	1
in	1
every	1
way.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
a	1
single	1
lady	1
can	1
get	1
on	1
very	1
nicely	1
upon	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
about	1
60	1
pounds."	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
do	1
with	1
much	1
less	1
than	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
but	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live	1
at	1
home	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
just	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
staying	1
with	1
them.	1
Of	1
course,	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
just	1
for	1
the	1
time.	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
draws	1
my	1
interest	1
every	1
quarter	1
and	1
pays	1
it	1
over	1
to	1
mother,	1
and	1
I	1
find	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
pretty	1
well	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
earn	1
at	1
typewriting.	1
It	1
brings	1
me	1
twopence	1
a	1
sheet,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
often	1
do	1
from	1
fifteen	1
to	1
twenty	1
sheets	1
in	1
a	1
day."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
position	1
very	1
clear	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
friend,	1
Dr.	1
Watson,	1
before	1
whom	1
you	1
can	1
speak	1
as	1
freely	1
as	1
before	1
myself.	1
Kindly	1
tell	1
us	1
now	1
all	1
about	1
your	1
connection	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
A	1
flush	1
stole	1
over	1
Miss	1
Sutherland's	1
face,	1
and	1
she	1
picked	1
nervously	1
at	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
her	1
jacket.	1
"I	1
met	1
him	1
first	1
at	1
the	1
gasfitters'	1
ball,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"They	1
used	1
to	1
send	1
father	1
tickets	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alive,	1
and	1
then	1
afterwards	1
they	1
remembered	1
us,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
mother.	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
us	1
to	1
go.	1
He	1
never	1
did	1
wish	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere.	1
He	1
would	1
get	1
quite	1
mad	1
if	1
I	1
wanted	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
join	1
a	1
Sunday-school	1
treat.	1
But	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
set	1
on	1
going,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
go;	1
for	1
what	1
right	1
had	1
he	1
to	1
prevent?	1
He	1
said	1
the	1
folk	1
were	1
not	1
fit	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
know,	1
when	1
all	1
father's	1
friends	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
nothing	1
fit	1
to	1
wear,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
purple	1
plush	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawer.	1
At	1
last,	1
when	1
nothing	1
else	1
would	1
do,	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
France	1
upon	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
firm,	1
but	1
we	1
went,	1
mother	1
and	1
I,	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Hardy,	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
foreman,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
I	1
met	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
France	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
annoyed	1
at	1
your	1
having	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
ball."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
about	1
it.	1
He	1
laughed,	1
I	1
remember,	1
and	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
use	1
denying	1
anything	1
to	1
a	1
woman,	1
for	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
her	1
way."	1
	1
"I	1
see.	1
Then	1
at	1
the	1
gasfitters'	1
ball	1
you	1
met,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
a	1
gentleman	1
called	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
ask	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
got	1
home	1
all	1
safe,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
met	1
him--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
twice	1
for	1
walks,	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
father	1
came	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
any	1
more."	1
	1
"No?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know	1
father	1
didn't	1
like	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
He	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
any	1
visitors	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
help	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
family	1
circle.	1
But	1
then,	1
as	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
mother,	1
a	1
woman	1
wants	1
her	1
own	1
circle	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
mine	1
yet."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel?	1
Did	1
he	1
make	1
no	1
attempt	1
to	1
see	1
you?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
father	1
was	1
going	1
off	1
to	1
France	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
week,	1
and	1
Hosmer	1
wrote	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
safer	1
and	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
gone.	1
We	1
could	1
write	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
and	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
write	1
every	1
day.	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
letters	1
in	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
father	1
to	1
know."	1
	1
"Were	1
you	1
engaged	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
at	1
this	1
time?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
We	1
were	1
engaged	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
walk	1
that	1
we	1
took.	1
Hosmer--Mr.	1
Angel--was	1
a	1
cashier	1
in	1
an	1
office	1
in	1
Leadenhall	1
Street--and--"	1
	1
"What	1
office?"	1
	1
"That's	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
don't	1
know."	1
	1
"Where	1
did	1
he	1
live,	1
then?"	1
	1
"He	1
slept	1
on	1
the	1
premises."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
his	1
address?"	1
	1
"No--except	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Leadenhall	1
Street."	1
	1
"Where	1
did	1
you	1
address	1
your	1
letters,	1
then?"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
Leadenhall	1
Street	1
Post	1
Office,	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
till	1
called	1
for.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
office	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
chaffed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
clerks	1
about	1
having	1
letters	1
from	1
a	1
lady,	1
so	1
I	1
offered	1
to	1
typewrite	1
them,	1
like	1
he	1
did	1
his,	1
but	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
that,	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
wrote	1
them	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
me,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
typewritten	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
machine	1
had	1
come	1
between	1
us.	1
That	1
will	1
just	1
show	1
you	1
how	1
fond	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
of."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
most	1
suggestive,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"It	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
an	1
axiom	1
of	1
mine	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
things	1
are	1
infinitely	1
the	1
most	1
important.	1
Can	1
you	1
remember	1
any	1
other	1
little	1
things	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel?"	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
shy	1
man,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
He	1
would	1
rather	1
walk	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
daylight,	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
hated	1
to	1
be	1
conspicuous.	1
Very	1
retiring	1
and	1
gentlemanly	1
he	1
was.	1
Even	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
gentle.	1
He'd	1
had	1
the	1
quinsy	1
and	1
swollen	1
glands	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
young,	1
he	1
told	1
me,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
weak	1
throat,	1
and	1
a	1
hesitating,	1
whispering	1
fashion	1
of	1
speech.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
well	1
dressed,	1
very	1
neat	1
and	1
plain,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
weak,	1
just	1
as	1
mine	1
are,	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
tinted	1
glasses	1
against	1
the	1
glare."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
happened	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,	1
your	1
stepfather,	1
returned	1
to	1
France?"	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
again	1
and	1
proposed	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
marry	1
before	1
father	1
came	1
back.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
dreadful	1
earnest	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
swear,	1
with	1
my	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
Testament,	1
that	1
whatever	1
happened	1
I	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
him.	1
Mother	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
right	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
swear,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
his	1
passion.	1
Mother	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
fonder	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
I	1
was.	1
Then,	1
when	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
marrying	1
within	1
the	1
week,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
about	1
father;	1
but	1
they	1
both	1
said	1
never	1
to	1
mind	1
about	1
father,	1
but	1
just	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
afterwards,	1
and	1
mother	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
right	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
didn't	1
quite	1
like	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
It	1
seemed	1
funny	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
ask	1
his	1
leave,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
didn't	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
on	1
the	1
sly,	1
so	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
father	1
at	1
Bordeaux,	1
where	1
the	1
company	1
has	1
its	1
French	1
offices,	1
but	1
the	1
letter	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
wedding."	1
	1
"It	1
missed	1
him,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
started	1
to	1
England	1
just	1
before	1
it	1
arrived."	1
	1
"Ha!	1
that	1
was	1
unfortunate.	1
Your	1
wedding	1
was	1
arranged,	1
then,	1
for	1
the	1
Friday.	1
Was	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
church?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
but	1
very	1
quietly.	1
It	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
St.	1
Saviour's,	1
near	1
King's	1
Cross,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
breakfast	1
afterwards	1
at	1
the	1
St.	1
Pancras	1
Hotel.	1
Hosmer	1
came	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
hansom,	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
of	1
us	1
he	1
put	1
us	1
both	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
stepped	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
four-wheeler,	1
which	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
other	1
cab	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
We	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
first,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
four-wheeler	1
drove	1
up	1
we	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
step	1
out,	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
did,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
cabman	1
got	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
looked	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
there!	1
The	1
cabman	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
get	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
That	1
was	1
last	1
Friday,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
anything	1
since	1
then	1
to	1
throw	1
any	1
light	1
upon	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
shamefully	1
treated,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
sir!	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
good	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
so.	1
Why,	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
me	1
that,	1
whatever	1
happened,	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
true;	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
something	1
quite	1
unforeseen	1
occurred	1
to	1
separate	1
us,	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
pledged	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
claim	1
his	1
pledge	1
sooner	1
or	1
later.	1
It	1
seemed	1
strange	1
talk	1
for	1
a	1
wedding-morning,	1
but	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
since	1
gives	1
a	1
meaning	1
to	1
it."	1
	1
"Most	1
certainly	1
it	1
does.	1
Your	1
own	1
opinion	1
is,	1
then,	1
that	1
some	1
unforeseen	1
catastrophe	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
foresaw	1
some	1
danger,	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
talked	1
so.	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
foresaw	1
happened."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
notion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been?"	1
	1
"None."	1
	1
"One	1
more	1
question.	1
How	1
did	1
your	1
mother	1
take	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
angry,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
never	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
again."	1
	1
"And	1
your	1
father?	1
Did	1
you	1
tell	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
think,	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
hear	1
of	1
Hosmer	1
again.	1
As	1
he	1
said,	1
what	1
interest	1
could	1
anyone	1
have	1
in	1
bringing	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
then	1
leaving	1
me?	1
Now,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
borrowed	1
my	1
money,	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
me	1
and	1
got	1
my	1
money	1
settled	1
on	1
him,	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
reason,	1
but	1
Hosmer	1
was	1
very	1
independent	1
about	1
money	1
and	1
never	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
shilling	1
of	1
mine.	1
And	1
yet,	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
happened?	1
And	1
why	1
could	1
he	1
not	1
write?	1
Oh,	1
it	1
drives	1
me	1
half-mad	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
sleep	1
a	1
wink	1
at	1
night."	1
She	1
pulled	1
a	1
little	1
handkerchief	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
muff	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
heavily	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
glance	1
into	1
the	1
case	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
rising,	1
"and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
reach	1
some	1
definite	1
result.	1
Let	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
rest	1
upon	1
me	1
now,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
your	1
mind	1
dwell	1
upon	1
it	1
further.	1
Above	1
all,	1
try	1
to	1
let	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel	1
vanish	1
from	1
your	1
memory,	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
from	1
your	1
life."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
don't	1
think	1
I'll	1
see	1
him	1
again?"	1
	1
"I	1
fear	1
not."	1
	1
"Then	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
leave	1
that	1
question	1
in	1
my	1
hands.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
an	1
accurate	1
description	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
any	1
letters	1
of	1
his	1
which	1
you	1
can	1
spare."	1
	1
"I	1
advertised	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
last	1
Saturday's	1
Chronicle,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Here	1
is	1
the	1
slip	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
four	1
letters	1
from	1
him."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
And	1
your	1
address?"	1
	1
"No.	1
31	1
Lyon	1
Place,	1
Camberwell."	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Angel's	1
address	1
you	1
never	1
had,	1
I	1
understand.	1
Where	1
is	1
your	1
father's	1
place	1
of	1
business?"	1
	1
"He	1
travels	1
for	1
Westhouse	1
&	1
Marbank,	1
the	1
great	1
claret	1
importers	1
of	1
Fenchurch	1
Street."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
You	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
statement	1
very	1
clearly.	1
You	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
papers	1
here,	1
and	1
remember	1
the	1
advice	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you.	1
Let	1
the	1
whole	1
incident	1
be	1
a	1
sealed	1
book,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
it	1
to	1
affect	1
your	1
life."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
kind,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
that.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
Hosmer.	1
He	1
shall	1
find	1
me	1
ready	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
back."	1
	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
preposterous	1
hat	1
and	1
the	1
vacuous	1
face,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
noble	1
in	1
the	1
simple	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
visitor	1
which	1
compelled	1
our	1
respect.	1
She	1
laid	1
her	1
little	1
bundle	1
of	1
papers	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
went	1
her	1
way,	1
with	1
a	1
promise	1
to	1
come	1
again	1
whenever	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
summoned.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
with	1
his	1
fingertips	1
still	1
pressed	1
together,	1
his	1
legs	1
stretched	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
gaze	1
directed	1
upward	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
rack	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
oily	1
clay	1
pipe,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
counsellor,	1
and,	1
having	1
lit	1
it,	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
the	1
thick	1
blue	1
cloud-wreaths	1
spinning	1
up	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
infinite	1
languor	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Quite	1
an	1
interesting	1
study,	1
that	1
maiden,"	1
he	1
observed.	1
"I	1
found	1
her	1
more	1
interesting	1
than	1
her	1
little	1
problem,	1
which,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
trite	1
one.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
parallel	1
cases,	1
if	1
you	1
consult	1
my	1
index,	1
in	1
Andover	1
in	1
'77,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
at	1
The	1
Hague	1
last	1
year.	1
Old	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
idea,	1
however,	1
there	1
were	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
details	1
which	1
were	1
new	1
to	1
me.	1
But	1
the	1
maiden	1
herself	1
was	1
most	1
instructive."	1
	1
"You	1
appeared	1
to	1
read	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
upon	1
her	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
invisible	1
to	1
me,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Not	1
invisible	1
but	1
unnoticed,	1
Watson.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
look,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
missed	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
important.	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
realise	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
sleeves,	1
the	1
suggestiveness	1
of	1
thumb-nails,	1
or	1
the	1
great	1
issues	1
that	1
may	1
hang	1
from	1
a	1
boot-lace.	1
Now,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
gather	1
from	1
that	1
woman's	1
appearance?	1
Describe	1
it."	1
	1
"Well,	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
slate-coloured,	1
broad-brimmed	1
straw	1
hat,	1
with	1
a	1
feather	1
of	1
a	1
brickish	1
red.	1
Her	1
jacket	1
was	1
black,	1
with	1
black	1
beads	1
sewn	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
a	1
fringe	1
of	1
little	1
black	1
jet	1
ornaments.	1
Her	1
dress	1
was	1
brown,	1
rather	1
darker	1
than	1
coffee	1
colour,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
purple	1
plush	1
at	1
the	1
neck	1
and	1
sleeves.	1
Her	1
gloves	1
were	1
greyish	1
and	1
were	1
worn	1
through	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
forefinger.	1
Her	1
boots	1
I	1
didn't	1
observe.	1
She	1
had	1
small	1
round,	1
hanging	1
gold	1
earrings,	1
and	1
a	1
general	1
air	1
of	1
being	1
fairly	1
well-to-do	1
in	1
a	1
vulgar,	1
comfortable,	1
easy-going	1
way."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands	1
softly	1
together	1
and	1
chuckled.	1
	1
"'Pon	1
my	1
word,	1
Watson,	1
you	1
are	1
coming	1
along	1
wonderfully.	1
You	1
have	1
really	1
done	1
very	1
well	1
indeed.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
missed	1
everything	1
of	1
importance,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
hit	1
upon	1
the	1
method,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
quick	1
eye	1
for	1
colour.	1
Never	1
trust	1
to	1
general	1
impressions,	1
my	1
boy,	1
but	1
concentrate	1
yourself	1
upon	1
details.	1
My	1
first	1
glance	1
is	1
always	1
at	1
a	1
woman's	1
sleeve.	1
In	1
a	1
man	1
it	1
is	1
perhaps	1
better	1
first	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
knee	1
of	1
the	1
trouser.	1
As	1
you	1
observe,	1
this	1
woman	1
had	1
plush	1
upon	1
her	1
sleeves,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
useful	1
material	1
for	1
showing	1
traces.	1
The	1
double	1
line	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
the	1
wrist,	1
where	1
the	1
typewritist	1
presses	1
against	1
the	1
table,	1
was	1
beautifully	1
defined.	1
The	1
sewing-machine,	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
type,	1
leaves	1
a	1
similar	1
mark,	1
but	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
arm,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
farthest	1
from	1
the	1
thumb,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
broadest	1
part,	1
as	1
this	1
was.	1
I	1
then	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
face,	1
and,	1
observing	1
the	1
dint	1
of	1
a	1
pince-nez	1
at	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
nose,	1
I	1
ventured	1
a	1
remark	1
upon	1
short	1
sight	1
and	1
typewriting,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
surprise	1
her."	1
	1
"It	1
surprised	1
me."	1
	1
"But,	1
surely,	1
it	1
was	1
obvious.	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
much	1
surprised	1
and	1
interested	1
on	1
glancing	1
down	1
to	1
observe	1
that,	1
though	1
the	1
boots	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
wearing	1
were	1
not	1
unlike	1
each	1
other,	1
they	1
were	1
really	1
odd	1
ones;	1
the	1
one	1
having	1
a	1
slightly	1
decorated	1
toe-cap,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
plain	1
one.	1
One	1
was	1
buttoned	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
lower	1
buttons	1
out	1
of	1
five,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
third,	1
and	1
fifth.	1
Now,	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
a	1
young	1
lady,	1
otherwise	1
neatly	1
dressed,	1
has	1
come	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
with	1
odd	1
boots,	1
half-buttoned,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
deduction	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
came	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
hurry."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
else?"	1
I	1
asked,	1
keenly	1
interested,	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
was,	1
by	1
my	1
friend's	1
incisive	1
reasoning.	1
	1
"I	1
noted,	1
in	1
passing,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
a	1
note	1
before	1
leaving	1
home	1
but	1
after	1
being	1
fully	1
dressed.	1
You	1
observed	1
that	1
her	1
right	1
glove	1
was	1
torn	1
at	1
the	1
forefinger,	1
but	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
apparently	1
see	1
that	1
both	1
glove	1
and	1
finger	1
were	1
stained	1
with	1
violet	1
ink.	1
She	1
had	1
written	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
and	1
dipped	1
her	1
pen	1
too	1
deep.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
this	1
morning,	1
or	1
the	1
mark	1
would	1
not	1
remain	1
clear	1
upon	1
the	1
finger.	1
All	1
this	1
is	1
amusing,	1
though	1
rather	1
elementary,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
business,	1
Watson.	1
Would	1
you	1
mind	1
reading	1
me	1
the	1
advertised	1
description	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel?"	1
	1
I	1
held	1
the	1
little	1
printed	1
slip	1
to	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
"Missing,"	1
it	1
said,	1
"on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
fourteenth,	1
a	1
gentleman	1
named	1
Hosmer	1
Angel.	1
About	1
five	1
ft.	1
seven	1
in.	1
in	1
height;	1
strongly	1
built,	1
sallow	1
complexion,	1
black	1
hair,	1
a	1
little	1
bald	1
in	1
the	1
centre,	1
bushy,	1
black	1
side-whiskers	1
and	1
moustache;	1
tinted	1
glasses,	1
slight	1
infirmity	1
of	1
speech.	1
Was	1
dressed,	1
when	1
last	1
seen,	1
in	1
black	1
frock-coat	1
faced	1
with	1
silk,	1
black	1
waistcoat,	1
gold	1
Albert	1
chain,	1
and	1
grey	1
Harris	1
tweed	1
trousers,	1
with	1
brown	1
gaiters	1
over	1
elastic-sided	1
boots.	1
Known	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
employed	1
in	1
an	1
office	1
in	1
Leadenhall	1
Street.	1
Anybody	1
bringing--"	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
do,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"As	1
to	1
the	1
letters,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
glancing	1
over	1
them,	1
"they	1
are	1
very	1
commonplace.	1
Absolutely	1
no	1
clue	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Angel,	1
save	1
that	1
he	1
quotes	1
Balzac	1
once.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
remarkable	1
point,	1
however,	1
which	1
will	1
no	1
doubt	1
strike	1
you."	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
typewritten,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
the	1
signature	1
is	1
typewritten.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
neat	1
little	1
'Hosmer	1
Angel'	1
at	1
the	1
bottom.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
date,	1
you	1
see,	1
but	1
no	1
superscription	1
except	1
Leadenhall	1
Street,	1
which	1
is	1
rather	1
vague.	1
The	1
point	1
about	1
the	1
signature	1
is	1
very	1
suggestive--in	1
fact,	1
we	1
may	1
call	1
it	1
conclusive."	1
	1
"Of	1
what?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
strongly	1
it	1
bears	1
upon	1
the	1
case?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deny	1
his	1
signature	1
if	1
an	1
action	1
for	1
breach	1
of	1
promise	1
were	1
instituted."	1
	1
"No,	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
However,	1
I	1
shall	1
write	1
two	1
letters,	1
which	1
should	1
settle	1
the	1
matter.	1
One	1
is	1
to	1
a	1
firm	1
in	1
the	1
City,	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady's	1
stepfather,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,	1
asking	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
meet	1
us	1
here	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock	1
tomorrow	1
evening.	1
It	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
do	1
business	1
with	1
the	1
male	1
relatives.	1
And	1
now,	1
Doctor,	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
until	1
the	1
answers	1
to	1
those	1
letters	1
come,	1
so	1
we	1
may	1
put	1
our	1
little	1
problem	1
upon	1
the	1
shelf	1
for	1
the	1
interim."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
reasons	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
friend's	1
subtle	1
powers	1
of	1
reasoning	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
energy	1
in	1
action	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
solid	1
grounds	1
for	1
the	1
assured	1
and	1
easy	1
demeanour	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
treated	1
the	1
singular	1
mystery	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
fathom.	1
Once	1
only	1
had	1
I	1
known	1
him	1
to	1
fail,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Irene	1
Adler	1
photograph;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
weird	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
Sign	1
of	1
Four,	1
and	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
circumstances	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Study	1
in	1
Scarlet,	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
strange	1
tangle	1
indeed	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
unravel.	1
	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
then,	1
still	1
puffing	1
at	1
his	1
black	1
clay	1
pipe,	1
with	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
evening	1
I	1
would	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
all	1
the	1
clues	1
which	1
would	1
lead	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
identity	1
of	1
the	1
disappearing	1
bridegroom	1
of	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland.	1
	1
A	1
professional	1
case	1
of	1
great	1
gravity	1
was	1
engaging	1
my	1
own	1
attention	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
next	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
busy	1
at	1
the	1
bedside	1
of	1
the	1
sufferer.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
until	1
close	1
upon	1
six	1
o'clock	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
free	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
spring	1
into	1
a	1
hansom	1
and	1
drive	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
half	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
assist	1
at	1
the	1
dénouement	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
mystery.	1
I	1
found	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
alone,	1
however,	1
half	1
asleep,	1
with	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
form	1
curled	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
recesses	1
of	1
his	1
armchair.	1
A	1
formidable	1
array	1
of	1
bottles	1
and	1
test-tubes,	1
with	1
the	1
pungent	1
cleanly	1
smell	1
of	1
hydrochloric	1
acid,	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
his	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
chemical	1
work	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
have	1
you	1
solved	1
it?"	1
I	1
asked	1
as	1
I	1
entered.	1
	1
"Yes.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
bisulphate	1
of	1
baryta."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
the	1
mystery!"	1
I	1
cried.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that!	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
salt	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
working	1
upon.	1
There	1
was	1
never	1
any	1
mystery	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
though,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
yesterday,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
details	1
are	1
of	1
interest.	1
The	1
only	1
drawback	1
is	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law,	1
I	1
fear,	1
that	1
can	1
touch	1
the	1
scoundrel."	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
he,	1
then,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
his	1
object	1
in	1
deserting	1
Miss	1
Sutherland?"	1
	1
The	1
question	1
was	1
hardly	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
Holmes	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
opened	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
reply,	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
a	1
heavy	1
footfall	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
a	1
tap	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
girl's	1
stepfather,	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Windibank,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"He	1
has	1
written	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
here	1
at	1
six.	1
Come	1
in!"	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
entered	1
was	1
a	1
sturdy,	1
middle-sized	1
fellow,	1
some	1
thirty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
clean-shaven,	1
and	1
sallow-skinned,	1
with	1
a	1
bland,	1
insinuating	1
manner,	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
wonderfully	1
sharp	1
and	1
penetrating	1
grey	1
eyes.	1
He	1
shot	1
a	1
questioning	1
glance	1
at	1
each	1
of	1
us,	1
placed	1
his	1
shiny	1
top-hat	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
sidled	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
nearest	1
chair.	1
	1
"Good-evening,	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Windibank,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
typewritten	1
letter	1
is	1
from	1
you,	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
made	1
an	1
appointment	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
six	1
o'clock?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
little	1
late,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
quite	1
my	1
own	1
master,	1
you	1
know.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
that	1
Miss	1
Sutherland	1
has	1
troubled	1
you	1
about	1
this	1
little	1
matter,	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
wash	1
linen	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
in	1
public.	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
against	1
my	1
wishes	1
that	1
she	1
came,	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
excitable,	1
impulsive	1
girl,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
noticed,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
easily	1
controlled	1
when	1
she	1
has	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
on	1
a	1
point.	1
Of	1
course,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mind	1
you	1
so	1
much,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
official	1
police,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
pleasant	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
family	1
misfortune	1
like	1
this	1
noised	1
abroad.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
useless	1
expense,	1
for	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
possibly	1
find	1
this	1
Hosmer	1
Angel?"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
quietly;	1
"I	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
succeed	1
in	1
discovering	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
gave	1
a	1
violent	1
start	1
and	1
dropped	1
his	1
gloves.	1
"I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
hear	1
it,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
curious	1
thing,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
a	1
typewriter	1
has	1
really	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
individuality	1
as	1
a	1
man's	1
handwriting.	1
Unless	1
they	1
are	1
quite	1
new,	1
no	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
write	1
exactly	1
alike.	1
Some	1
letters	1
get	1
more	1
worn	1
than	1
others,	1
and	1
some	1
wear	1
only	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
Now,	1
you	1
remark	1
in	1
this	1
note	1
of	1
yours,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
little	1
slurring	1
over	1
of	1
the	1
'e,'	1
and	1
a	1
slight	1
defect	1
in	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
'r.'	1
There	1
are	1
fourteen	1
other	1
characteristics,	1
but	1
those	1
are	1
the	1
more	1
obvious."	1
	1
"We	1
do	1
all	1
our	1
correspondence	1
with	1
this	1
machine	1
at	1
the	1
office,	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
worn,"	1
our	1
visitor	1
answered,	1
glancing	1
keenly	1
at	1
Holmes	1
with	1
his	1
bright	1
little	1
eyes.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
study,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,"	1
Holmes	1
continued.	1
"I	1
think	1
of	1
writing	1
another	1
little	1
monograph	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
typewriter	1
and	1
its	1
relation	1
to	1
crime.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
subject	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
devoted	1
some	1
little	1
attention.	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
four	1
letters	1
which	1
purport	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
missing	1
man.	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
typewritten.	1
In	1
each	1
case,	1
not	1
only	1
are	1
the	1
'e's'	1
slurred	1
and	1
the	1
'r's'	1
tailless,	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
observe,	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
use	1
my	1
magnifying	1
lens,	1
that	1
the	1
fourteen	1
other	1
characteristics	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
alluded	1
are	1
there	1
as	1
well."	1
	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
his	1
hat.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
waste	1
time	1
over	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
fantastic	1
talk,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"If	1
you	1
can	1
catch	1
the	1
man,	1
catch	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
it."	1
	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
stepping	1
over	1
and	1
turning	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
door.	1
"I	1
let	1
you	1
know,	1
then,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
him!"	1
	1
"What!	1
where?"	1
shouted	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,	1
turning	1
white	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
glancing	1
about	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
rat	1
in	1
a	1
trap.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
won't	1
do--really	1
it	1
won't,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
suavely.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
possible	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
too	1
transparent,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
compliment	1
when	1
you	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
solve	1
so	1
simple	1
a	1
question.	1
That's	1
right!	1
Sit	1
down	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
it	1
over."	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
collapsed	1
into	1
a	1
chair,	1
with	1
a	1
ghastly	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
glitter	1
of	1
moisture	1
on	1
his	1
brow.	1
"It--it's	1
not	1
actionable,"	1
he	1
stammered.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not.	1
But	1
between	1
ourselves,	1
Windibank,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
cruel	1
and	1
selfish	1
and	1
heartless	1
a	1
trick	1
in	1
a	1
petty	1
way	1
as	1
ever	1
came	1
before	1
me.	1
Now,	1
let	1
me	1
just	1
run	1
over	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
contradict	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
wrong."	1
	1
The	1
man	1
sat	1
huddled	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
utterly	1
crushed.	1
Holmes	1
stuck	1
his	1
feet	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
and,	1
leaning	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets,	1
began	1
talking,	1
rather	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
than	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
"The	1
man	1
married	1
a	1
woman	1
very	1
much	1
older	1
than	1
himself	1
for	1
her	1
money,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"and	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
lived	1
with	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
considerable	1
sum,	1
for	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
position,	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
serious	1
difference.	1
It	1
was	1
worth	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
preserve	1
it.	1
The	1
daughter	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
good,	1
amiable	1
disposition,	1
but	1
affectionate	1
and	1
warm-hearted	1
in	1
her	1
ways,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
with	1
her	1
fair	1
personal	1
advantages,	1
and	1
her	1
little	1
income,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
remain	1
single	1
long.	1
Now	1
her	1
marriage	1
would	1
mean,	1
of	1
course,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
a	1
year,	1
so	1
what	1
does	1
her	1
stepfather	1
do	1
to	1
prevent	1
it?	1
He	1
takes	1
the	1
obvious	1
course	1
of	1
keeping	1
her	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
forbidding	1
her	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
people	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
age.	1
But	1
soon	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
answer	1
forever.	1
She	1
became	1
restive,	1
insisted	1
upon	1
her	1
rights,	1
and	1
finally	1
announced	1
her	1
positive	1
intention	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
ball.	1
What	1
does	1
her	1
clever	1
stepfather	1
do	1
then?	1
He	1
conceives	1
an	1
idea	1
more	1
creditable	1
to	1
his	1
head	1
than	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
With	1
the	1
connivance	1
and	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
disguised	1
himself,	1
covered	1
those	1
keen	1
eyes	1
with	1
tinted	1
glasses,	1
masked	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
moustache	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
bushy	1
whiskers,	1
sunk	1
that	1
clear	1
voice	1
into	1
an	1
insinuating	1
whisper,	1
and	1
doubly	1
secure	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
girl's	1
short	1
sight,	1
he	1
appears	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel,	1
and	1
keeps	1
off	1
other	1
lovers	1
by	1
making	1
love	1
himself."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
joke	1
at	1
first,"	1
groaned	1
our	1
visitor.	1
"We	1
never	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
carried	1
away."	1
	1
"Very	1
likely	1
not.	1
However	1
that	1
may	1
be,	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
was	1
very	1
decidedly	1
carried	1
away,	1
and,	1
having	1
quite	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
her	1
stepfather	1
was	1
in	1
France,	1
the	1
suspicion	1
of	1
treachery	1
never	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
entered	1
her	1
mind.	1
She	1
was	1
flattered	1
by	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
attentions,	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
was	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
loudly	1
expressed	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
mother.	1
Then	1
Mr.	1
Angel	1
began	1
to	1
call,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
should	1
be	1
pushed	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
go	1
if	1
a	1
real	1
effect	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
produced.	1
There	1
were	1
meetings,	1
and	1
an	1
engagement,	1
which	1
would	1
finally	1
secure	1
the	1
girl's	1
affections	1
from	1
turning	1
towards	1
anyone	1
else.	1
But	1
the	1
deception	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
up	1
forever.	1
These	1
pretended	1
journeys	1
to	1
France	1
were	1
rather	1
cumbrous.	1
The	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
clearly	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
business	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
dramatic	1
manner	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
leave	1
a	1
permanent	1
impression	1
upon	1
the	1
young	1
lady's	1
mind	1
and	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
looking	1
upon	1
any	1
other	1
suitor	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
come.	1
Hence	1
those	1
vows	1
of	1
fidelity	1
exacted	1
upon	1
a	1
Testament,	1
and	1
hence	1
also	1
the	1
allusions	1
to	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
something	1
happening	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
wedding.	1
James	1
Windibank	1
wished	1
Miss	1
Sutherland	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
bound	1
to	1
Hosmer	1
Angel,	1
and	1
so	1
uncertain	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
fate,	1
that	1
for	1
ten	1
years	1
to	1
come,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
another	1
man.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
church	1
door	1
he	1
brought	1
her,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
no	1
farther,	1
he	1
conveniently	1
vanished	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
old	1
trick	1
of	1
stepping	1
in	1
at	1
one	1
door	1
of	1
a	1
four-wheeler	1
and	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
events,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank!"	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
had	1
recovered	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
assurance	1
while	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
talking,	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
now	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
sneer	1
upon	1
his	1
pale	1
face.	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
so,	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
not,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
very	1
sharp	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
sharp	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
breaking	1
the	1
law	1
now,	1
and	1
not	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
actionable	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
but	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
keep	1
that	1
door	1
locked	1
you	1
lay	1
yourself	1
open	1
to	1
an	1
action	1
for	1
assault	1
and	1
illegal	1
constraint."	1
	1
"The	1
law	1
cannot,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
touch	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
unlocking	1
and	1
throwing	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
"yet	1
there	1
never	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
deserved	1
punishment	1
more.	1
If	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
has	1
a	1
brother	1
or	1
a	1
friend,	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
lay	1
a	1
whip	1
across	1
your	1
shoulders.	1
By	1
Jove!"	1
he	1
continued,	1
flushing	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
bitter	1
sneer	1
upon	1
the	1
man's	1
face,	1
"it	1
is	1
not	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
duties	1
to	1
my	1
client,	1
but	1
here's	1
a	1
hunting	1
crop	1
handy,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
just	1
treat	1
myself	1
to--"	1
He	1
took	1
two	1
swift	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
whip,	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
grasp	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wild	1
clatter	1
of	1
steps	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
the	1
heavy	1
hall	1
door	1
banged,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Windibank	1
running	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
speed	1
down	1
the	1
road.	1
	1
"There's	1
a	1
cold-blooded	1
scoundrel!"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing,	1
as	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
down	1
into	1
his	1
chair	1
once	1
more.	1
"That	1
fellow	1
will	1
rise	1
from	1
crime	1
to	1
crime	1
until	1
he	1
does	1
something	1
very	1
bad,	1
and	1
ends	1
on	1
a	1
gallows.	1
The	1
case	1
has,	1
in	1
some	1
respects,	1
been	1
not	1
entirely	1
devoid	1
of	1
interest."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
now	1
entirely	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
your	1
reasoning,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
this	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
strong	1
object	1
for	1
his	1
curious	1
conduct,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
equally	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
really	1
profited	1
by	1
the	1
incident,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
see,	1
was	1
the	1
stepfather.	1
Then	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
were	1
never	1
together,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
always	1
appeared	1
when	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
away,	1
was	1
suggestive.	1
So	1
were	1
the	1
tinted	1
spectacles	1
and	1
the	1
curious	1
voice,	1
which	1
both	1
hinted	1
at	1
a	1
disguise,	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
bushy	1
whiskers.	1
My	1
suspicions	1
were	1
all	1
confirmed	1
by	1
his	1
peculiar	1
action	1
in	1
typewriting	1
his	1
signature,	1
which,	1
of	1
course,	1
inferred	1
that	1
his	1
handwriting	1
was	1
so	1
familiar	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
recognise	1
even	1
the	1
smallest	1
sample	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
see	1
all	1
these	1
isolated	1
facts,	1
together	1
with	1
many	1
minor	1
ones,	1
all	1
pointed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
verify	1
them?"	1
	1
"Having	1
once	1
spotted	1
my	1
man,	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
get	1
corroboration.	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
firm	1
for	1
which	1
this	1
man	1
worked.	1
Having	1
taken	1
the	1
printed	1
description.	1
I	1
eliminated	1
everything	1
from	1
it	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
a	1
disguise--the	1
whiskers,	1
the	1
glasses,	1
the	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
firm,	1
with	1
a	1
request	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
inform	1
me	1
whether	1
it	1
answered	1
to	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
travellers.	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
noticed	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
the	1
typewriter,	1
and	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
himself	1
at	1
his	1
business	1
address	1
asking	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
here.	1
As	1
I	1
expected,	1
his	1
reply	1
was	1
typewritten	1
and	1
revealed	1
the	1
same	1
trivial	1
but	1
characteristic	1
defects.	1
The	1
same	1
post	1
brought	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Westhouse	1
&	1
Marbank,	1
of	1
Fenchurch	1
Street,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
description	1
tallied	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
their	1
employé,	1
James	1
Windibank.	1
Voilà	1
tout!"	1
	1
"And	1
Miss	1
Sutherland?"	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
me.	1
You	1
may	1
remember	1
the	1
old	1
Persian	1
saying,	1
'There	1
is	1
danger	1
for	1
him	1
who	1
taketh	1
the	1
tiger	1
cub,	1
and	1
danger	1
also	1
for	1
whoso	1
snatches	1
a	1
delusion	1
from	1
a	1
woman.'	1
There	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
sense	1
in	1
Hafiz	1
as	1
in	1
Horace,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
world."	1
	1
	1
	1
ADVENTURE	1
IV.	1
THE	1
BOSCOMBE	1
VALLEY	1
MYSTERY	1
	1
We	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
breakfast	1
one	1
morning,	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
I,	1
when	1
the	1
maid	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
telegram.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
to	1
spare?	1
Have	1
just	1
been	1
wired	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
England	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
Boscombe	1
Valley	1
tragedy.	1
Shall	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
me.	1
Air	1
and	1
scenery	1
perfect.	1
Leave	1
Paddington	1
by	1
the	1
11:15."	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
say,	1
dear?"	1
said	1
my	1
wife,	1
looking	1
across	1
at	1
me.	1
"Will	1
you	1
go?"	1
	1
"I	1
really	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
fairly	1
long	1
list	1
at	1
present."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Anstruther	1
would	1
do	1
your	1
work	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
a	1
little	1
pale	1
lately.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
change	1
would	1
do	1
you	1
good,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
so	1
interested	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
cases."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
ungrateful	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
not,	1
seeing	1
what	1
I	1
gained	1
through	1
one	1
of	1
them,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
"But	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
go,	1
I	1
must	1
pack	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
half	1
an	1
hour."	1
	1
My	1
experience	1
of	1
camp	1
life	1
in	1
Afghanistan	1
had	1
at	1
least	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
making	1
me	1
a	1
prompt	1
and	1
ready	1
traveller.	1
My	1
wants	1
were	1
few	1
and	1
simple,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
time	1
stated	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
cab	1
with	1
my	1
valise,	1
rattling	1
away	1
to	1
Paddington	1
Station.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
platform,	1
his	1
tall,	1
gaunt	1
figure	1
made	1
even	1
gaunter	1
and	1
taller	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
grey	1
travelling-cloak	1
and	1
close-fitting	1
cloth	1
cap.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
really	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
makes	1
a	1
considerable	1
difference	1
to	1
me,	1
having	1
someone	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
thoroughly	1
rely.	1
Local	1
aid	1
is	1
always	1
either	1
worthless	1
or	1
else	1
biassed.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
two	1
corner	1
seats	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
the	1
tickets."	1
	1
We	1
had	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
ourselves	1
save	1
for	1
an	1
immense	1
litter	1
of	1
papers	1
which	1
Holmes	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him.	1
Among	1
these	1
he	1
rummaged	1
and	1
read,	1
with	1
intervals	1
of	1
note-taking	1
and	1
of	1
meditation,	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
past	1
Reading.	1
Then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
rolled	1
them	1
all	1
into	1
a	1
gigantic	1
ball	1
and	1
tossed	1
them	1
up	1
onto	1
the	1
rack.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
heard	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
case?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
word.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
a	1
paper	1
for	1
some	1
days."	1
	1
"The	1
London	1
press	1
has	1
not	1
had	1
very	1
full	1
accounts.	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
looking	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
recent	1
papers	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
master	1
the	1
particulars.	1
It	1
seems,	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
gather,	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
simple	1
cases	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
extremely	1
difficult."	1
	1
"That	1
sounds	1
a	1
little	1
paradoxical."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
profoundly	1
true.	1
Singularity	1
is	1
almost	1
invariably	1
a	1
clue.	1
The	1
more	1
featureless	1
and	1
commonplace	1
a	1
crime	1
is,	1
the	1
more	1
difficult	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
home.	1
In	1
this	1
case,	1
however,	1
they	1
have	1
established	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
case	1
against	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
murdered	1
man."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
murder,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
conjectured	1
to	1
be	1
so.	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
nothing	1
for	1
granted	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
looking	1
personally	1
into	1
it.	1
I	1
will	1
explain	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
you,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
it,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
"Boscombe	1
Valley	1
is	1
a	1
country	1
district	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
Ross,	1
in	1
Herefordshire.	1
The	1
largest	1
landed	1
proprietor	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
is	1
a	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Turner,	1
who	1
made	1
his	1
money	1
in	1
Australia	1
and	1
returned	1
some	1
years	1
ago	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
country.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
farms	1
which	1
he	1
held,	1
that	1
of	1
Hatherley,	1
was	1
let	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Charles	1
McCarthy,	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
an	1
ex-Australian.	1
The	1
men	1
had	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
colonies,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unnatural	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
so	1
as	1
near	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
possible.	1
Turner	1
was	1
apparently	1
the	1
richer	1
man,	1
so	1
McCarthy	1
became	1
his	1
tenant	1
but	1
still	1
remained,	1
it	1
seems,	1
upon	1
terms	1
of	1
perfect	1
equality,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
frequently	1
together.	1
McCarthy	1
had	1
one	1
son,	1
a	1
lad	1
of	1
eighteen,	1
and	1
Turner	1
had	1
an	1
only	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age,	1
but	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
wives	1
living.	1
They	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
avoided	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
English	1
families	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
led	1
retired	1
lives,	1
though	1
both	1
the	1
McCarthys	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
sport	1
and	1
were	1
frequently	1
seen	1
at	1
the	1
race-meetings	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
McCarthy	1
kept	1
two	1
servants--a	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
girl.	1
Turner	1
had	1
a	1
considerable	1
household,	1
some	1
half-dozen	1
at	1
the	1
least.	1
That	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
gather	1
about	1
the	1
families.	1
Now	1
for	1
the	1
facts.	1
	1
"On	1
June	1
3rd,	1
that	1
is,	1
on	1
Monday	1
last,	1
McCarthy	1
left	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
Hatherley	1
about	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
and	1
walked	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
lake	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
spreading	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
which	1
runs	1
down	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Valley.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
serving-man	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
at	1
Ross,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
hurry,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
appointment	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
keep	1
at	1
three.	1
From	1
that	1
appointment	1
he	1
never	1
came	1
back	1
alive.	1
	1
"From	1
Hatherley	1
Farm-house	1
to	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool	1
is	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile,	1
and	1
two	1
people	1
saw	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
this	1
ground.	1
One	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
woman,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
not	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
William	1
Crowder,	1
a	1
game-keeper	1
in	1
the	1
employ	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Turner.	1
Both	1
these	1
witnesses	1
depose	1
that	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
walking	1
alone.	1
The	1
game-keeper	1
adds	1
that	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
of	1
his	1
seeing	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
pass	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
son,	1
Mr.	1
James	1
McCarthy,	1
going	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
with	1
a	1
gun	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
To	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
belief,	1
the	1
father	1
was	1
actually	1
in	1
sight	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
was	1
following	1
him.	1
He	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
until	1
he	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy	1
that	1
had	1
occurred.	1
	1
"The	1
two	1
McCarthys	1
were	1
seen	1
after	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
William	1
Crowder,	1
the	1
game-keeper,	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
Boscombe	1
Pool	1
is	1
thickly	1
wooded	1
round,	1
with	1
just	1
a	1
fringe	1
of	1
grass	1
and	1
of	1
reeds	1
round	1
the	1
edge.	1
A	1
girl	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
Patience	1
Moran,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
lodge-keeper	1
of	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Valley	1
estate,	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
picking	1
flowers.	1
She	1
states	1
that	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
she	1
saw,	1
at	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
lake,	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
having	1
a	1
violent	1
quarrel.	1
She	1
heard	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
the	1
elder	1
using	1
very	1
strong	1
language	1
to	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
latter	1
raise	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
strike	1
his	1
father.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
by	1
their	1
violence	1
that	1
she	1
ran	1
away	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
mother	1
when	1
she	1
reached	1
home	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
two	1
McCarthys	1
quarrelling	1
near	1
Boscombe	1
Pool,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
fight.	1
She	1
had	1
hardly	1
said	1
the	1
words	1
when	1
young	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
came	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
lodge	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
his	1
father	1
dead	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
lodge-keeper.	1
He	1
was	1
much	1
excited,	1
without	1
either	1
his	1
gun	1
or	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
sleeve	1
were	1
observed	1
to	1
be	1
stained	1
with	1
fresh	1
blood.	1
On	1
following	1
him	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
stretched	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
grass	1
beside	1
the	1
pool.	1
The	1
head	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
in	1
by	1
repeated	1
blows	1
of	1
some	1
heavy	1
and	1
blunt	1
weapon.	1
The	1
injuries	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
inflicted	1
by	1
the	1
butt-end	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
gun,	1
which	1
was	1
found	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
Under	1
these	1
circumstances	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
instantly	1
arrested,	1
and	1
a	1
verdict	1
of	1
'wilful	1
murder'	1
having	1
been	1
returned	1
at	1
the	1
inquest	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
magistrates	1
at	1
Ross,	1
who	1
have	1
referred	1
the	1
case	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
Assizes.	1
Those	1
are	1
the	1
main	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
coroner	1
and	1
the	1
police-court."	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
hardly	1
imagine	1
a	1
more	1
damning	1
case,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
"If	1
ever	1
circumstantial	1
evidence	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
criminal	1
it	1
does	1
so	1
here."	1
	1
"Circumstantial	1
evidence	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
tricky	1
thing,"	1
answered	1
Holmes	1
thoughtfully.	1
"It	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
point	1
very	1
straight	1
to	1
one	1
thing,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
shift	1
your	1
own	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
a	1
little,	1
you	1
may	1
find	1
it	1
pointing	1
in	1
an	1
equally	1
uncompromising	1
manner	1
to	1
something	1
entirely	1
different.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
confessed,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
case	1
looks	1
exceedingly	1
grave	1
against	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
culprit.	1
There	1
are	1
several	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
however,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
Miss	1
Turner,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
landowner,	1
who	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
innocence,	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
retained	1
Lestrade,	1
whom	1
you	1
may	1
recollect	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
Study	1
in	1
Scarlet,	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
his	1
interest.	1
Lestrade,	1
being	1
rather	1
puzzled,	1
has	1
referred	1
the	1
case	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
hence	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
two	1
middle-aged	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
flying	1
westward	1
at	1
fifty	1
miles	1
an	1
hour	1
instead	1
of	1
quietly	1
digesting	1
their	1
breakfasts	1
at	1
home."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"that	1
the	1
facts	1
are	1
so	1
obvious	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
little	1
credit	1
to	1
be	1
gained	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
case."	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
deceptive	1
than	1
an	1
obvious	1
fact,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
laughing.	1
"Besides,	1
we	1
may	1
chance	1
to	1
hit	1
upon	1
some	1
other	1
obvious	1
facts	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
obvious	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade.	1
You	1
know	1
me	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
boasting	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
either	1
confirm	1
or	1
destroy	1
his	1
theory	1
by	1
means	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
incapable	1
of	1
employing,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
understanding.	1
To	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
example	1
to	1
hand,	1
I	1
very	1
clearly	1
perceive	1
that	1
in	1
your	1
bedroom	1
the	1
window	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
right-hand	1
side,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
question	1
whether	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade	1
would	1
have	1
noted	1
even	1
so	1
self-evident	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
that."	1
	1
"How	1
on	1
earth--"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
well.	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
military	1
neatness	1
which	1
characterises	1
you.	1
You	1
shave	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
season	1
you	1
shave	1
by	1
the	1
sunlight;	1
but	1
since	1
your	1
shaving	1
is	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
complete	1
as	1
we	1
get	1
farther	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side,	1
until	1
it	1
becomes	1
positively	1
slovenly	1
as	1
we	1
get	1
round	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
jaw,	1
it	1
is	1
surely	1
very	1
clear	1
that	1
that	1
side	1
is	1
less	1
illuminated	1
than	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
your	1
habits	1
looking	1
at	1
himself	1
in	1
an	1
equal	1
light	1
and	1
being	1
satisfied	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
result.	1
I	1
only	1
quote	1
this	1
as	1
a	1
trivial	1
example	1
of	1
observation	1
and	1
inference.	1
Therein	1
lies	1
my	1
métier,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
possible	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
investigation	1
which	1
lies	1
before	1
us.	1
There	1
are	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
minor	1
points	1
which	1
were	1
brought	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
inquest,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
worth	1
considering."	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
they?"	1
	1
"It	1
appears	1
that	1
his	1
arrest	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
at	1
once,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
return	1
to	1
Hatherley	1
Farm.	1
On	1
the	1
inspector	1
of	1
constabulary	1
informing	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
he	1
remarked	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
deserts.	1
This	1
observation	1
of	1
his	1
had	1
the	1
natural	1
effect	1
of	1
removing	1
any	1
traces	1
of	1
doubt	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
coroner's	1
jury."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
confession,"	1
I	1
ejaculated.	1
	1
"No,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
protestation	1
of	1
innocence."	1
	1
"Coming	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
damning	1
series	1
of	1
events,	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
most	1
suspicious	1
remark."	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"it	1
is	1
the	1
brightest	1
rift	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
at	1
present	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
clouds.	1
However	1
innocent	1
he	1
might	1
be,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
such	1
an	1
absolute	1
imbecile	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
circumstances	1
were	1
very	1
black	1
against	1
him.	1
Had	1
he	1
appeared	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
arrest,	1
or	1
feigned	1
indignation	1
at	1
it,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
looked	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
highly	1
suspicious,	1
because	1
such	1
surprise	1
or	1
anger	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
natural	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
yet	1
might	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
policy	1
to	1
a	1
scheming	1
man.	1
His	1
frank	1
acceptance	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
marks	1
him	1
as	1
either	1
an	1
innocent	1
man,	1
or	1
else	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
considerable	1
self-restraint	1
and	1
firmness.	1
As	1
to	1
his	1
remark	1
about	1
his	1
deserts,	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
not	1
unnatural	1
if	1
you	1
consider	1
that	1
he	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
very	1
day	1
so	1
far	1
forgotten	1
his	1
filial	1
duty	1
as	1
to	1
bandy	1
words	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
even,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
whose	1
evidence	1
is	1
so	1
important,	1
to	1
raise	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
strike	1
him.	1
The	1
self-reproach	1
and	1
contrition	1
which	1
are	1
displayed	1
in	1
his	1
remark	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
mind	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
guilty	1
one."	1
	1
I	1
shook	1
my	1
head.	1
"Many	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
hanged	1
on	1
far	1
slighter	1
evidence,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"So	1
they	1
have.	1
And	1
many	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
wrongfully	1
hanged."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
own	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"It	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
not	1
very	1
encouraging	1
to	1
his	1
supporters,	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
points	1
in	1
it	1
which	1
are	1
suggestive.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
here,	1
and	1
may	1
read	1
it	1
for	1
yourself."	1
	1
He	1
picked	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
bundle	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
local	1
Herefordshire	1
paper,	1
and	1
having	1
turned	1
down	1
the	1
sheet	1
he	1
pointed	1
out	1
the	1
paragraph	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
own	1
statement	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
I	1
settled	1
myself	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
read	1
it	1
very	1
carefully.	1
It	1
ran	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
	1
"Mr.	1
James	1
McCarthy,	1
the	1
only	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
deceased,	1
was	1
then	1
called	1
and	1
gave	1
evidence	1
as	1
follows:	1
'I	1
had	1
been	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
at	1
Bristol,	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
returned	1
upon	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
last	1
Monday,	1
the	1
3rd.	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
absent	1
from	1
home	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
arrival,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
informed	1
by	1
the	1
maid	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
over	1
to	1
Ross	1
with	1
John	1
Cobb,	1
the	1
groom.	1
Shortly	1
after	1
my	1
return	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
his	1
trap	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
and,	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
window,	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
get	1
out	1
and	1
walk	1
rapidly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard,	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
in	1
which	1
direction	1
he	1
was	1
going.	1
I	1
then	1
took	1
my	1
gun	1
and	1
strolled	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool,	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
visiting	1
the	1
rabbit	1
warren	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
On	1
my	1
way	1
I	1
saw	1
William	1
Crowder,	1
the	1
game-keeper,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
stated	1
in	1
his	1
evidence;	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
mistaken	1
in	1
thinking	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
following	1
my	1
father.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me.	1
When	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
from	1
the	1
pool	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
"Cooee!"	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
usual	1
signal	1
between	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
myself.	1
I	1
then	1
hurried	1
forward,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
pool.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
surprised	1
at	1
seeing	1
me	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
rather	1
roughly	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
doing	1
there.	1
A	1
conversation	1
ensued	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
high	1
words	1
and	1
almost	1
to	1
blows,	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
violent	1
temper.	1
Seeing	1
that	1
his	1
passion	1
was	1
becoming	1
ungovernable,	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
and	1
returned	1
towards	1
Hatherley	1
Farm.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
more	1
than	1
150	1
yards,	1
however,	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
hideous	1
outcry	1
behind	1
me,	1
which	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
run	1
back	1
again.	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
father	1
expiring	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
terribly	1
injured.	1
I	1
dropped	1
my	1
gun	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
arms,	1
but	1
he	1
almost	1
instantly	1
expired.	1
I	1
knelt	1
beside	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
minutes,	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Turner's	1
lodge-keeper,	1
his	1
house	1
being	1
the	1
nearest,	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
assistance.	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
one	1
near	1
my	1
father	1
when	1
I	1
returned,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
how	1
he	1
came	1
by	1
his	1
injuries.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
popular	1
man,	1
being	1
somewhat	1
cold	1
and	1
forbidding	1
in	1
his	1
manners,	1
but	1
he	1
had,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know,	1
no	1
active	1
enemies.	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
further	1
of	1
the	1
matter.'	1
	1
"The	1

"Witness:	1
Nothing	1

	1
"The	1
Coroner:	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
	1
"Witness:	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
disturbed	1
and	1
excited	1
as	1
I	1
rushed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
except	1
of	1
my	1
father.	1
Yet	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
vague	1
impression	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
ran	1
forward	1
something	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
me.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
grey	1
in	1
colour,	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
or	1
a	1
plaid	1
perhaps.	1
When	1
I	1
rose	1
from	1
my	1
father	1
I	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
gone.	1
	1
"'Do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
it	1
disappeared	1
before	1
you	1
went	1
for	1
help?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
gone.'	1
	1
"'You	1
cannot	1
say	1
what	1
it	1
was?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
something	1
was	1
there.'	1
	1
"'How	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
body?'	1
	1
"'A	1
dozen	1
yards	1
or	1
so.'	1
	1
"'And	1
how	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood?'	1
	1
"'About	1
the	1
same.'	1
	1
"'Then	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
removed	1
it	1
was	1
while	1
you	1
were	1
within	1
a	1
dozen	1
yards	1
of	1
it?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
but	1
with	1
my	1
back	1
towards	1
it.'	1
	1
"This	1
concluded	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
witness."	1
	1
"I	1
see,"	1
said	1
I	1
as	1
I	1
glanced	1
down	1
the	1
column,	1
"that	1
the	1
coroner	1
in	1
his	1
concluding	1
remarks	1
was	1
rather	1
severe	1
upon	1
young	1
McCarthy.	1
He	1
calls	1
attention,	1
and	1
with	1
reason,	1
to	1
the	1
discrepancy	1
about	1
his	1
father	1
having	1
signalled	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
seeing	1
him,	1
also	1
to	1
his	1
refusal	1
to	1
give	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
singular	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
dying	1
words.	1
They	1
are	1
all,	1
as	1
he	1
remarks,	1
very	1
much	1
against	1
the	1
son."	1
	1
Holmes	1
laughed	1
softly	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
stretched	1
himself	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
cushioned	1
seat.	1
"Both	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
coroner	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
some	1
pains,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"to	1
single	1
out	1
the	1
very	1
strongest	1
points	1
in	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
favour.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
alternately	1
give	1
him	1
credit	1
for	1
having	1
too	1
much	1
imagination	1
and	1
too	1
little?	1
Too	1
little,	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
invent	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
quarrel	1
which	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
sympathy	1
of	1
the	1
jury;	1
too	1
much,	1
if	1
he	1
evolved	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
inner	1
consciousness	1
anything	1
so	1
outré	1
as	1
a	1
dying	1
reference	1
to	1
a	1
rat,	1
and	1
the	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
vanishing	1
cloth.	1
No,	1
sir,	1
I	1
shall	1
approach	1
this	1
case	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
that	1
what	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
says	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
whither	1
that	1
hypothesis	1
will	1
lead	1
us.	1
And	1
now	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
pocket	1
Petrarch,	1
and	1
not	1
another	1
word	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
of	1
this	1
case	1
until	1
we	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action.	1
We	1
lunch	1
at	1
Swindon,	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
there	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
four	1
o'clock	1
when	1
we	1
at	1
last,	1
after	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Stroud	1
Valley,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
broad	1
gleaming	1
Severn,	1
found	1
ourselves	1
at	1
the	1
pretty	1
little	1
country-town	1
of	1
Ross.	1
A	1
lean,	1
ferret-like	1
man,	1
furtive	1
and	1
sly-looking,	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
us	1
upon	1
the	1
platform.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
brown	1
dustcoat	1
and	1
leather-leggings	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
in	1
deference	1
to	1
his	1
rustic	1
surroundings,	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
recognising	1
Lestrade,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard.	1
With	1
him	1
we	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
Hereford	1
Arms	1
where	1
a	1
room	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
engaged	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
ordered	1
a	1
carriage,"	1
said	1
Lestrade	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
over	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea.	1
"I	1
knew	1
your	1
energetic	1
nature,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
happy	1
until	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
crime."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
complimentary	1
of	1
you,"	1
Holmes	1
answered.	1
"It	1
is	1
entirely	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
barometric	1
pressure."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
looked	1
startled.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
quite	1
follow,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
the	1
glass?	1
Twenty-nine,	1
I	1
see.	1
No	1
wind,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
cloud	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
caseful	1
of	1
cigarettes	1
here	1
which	1
need	1
smoking,	1
and	1
the	1
sofa	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
country	1
hotel	1
abomination.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
use	1
the	1
carriage	1
to-night."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
laughed	1
indulgently.	1
"You	1
have,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
already	1
formed	1
your	1
conclusions	1
from	1
the	1
newspapers,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"The	1
case	1
is	1
as	1
plain	1
as	1
a	1
pikestaff,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
one	1
goes	1
into	1
it	1
the	1
plainer	1
it	1
becomes.	1
Still,	1
of	1
course,	1
one	1
can't	1
refuse	1
a	1
lady,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
positive	1
one,	1
too.	1
She	1
has	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
your	1
opinion,	1
though	1
I	1
repeatedly	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
which	1
you	1
could	1
do	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
already	1
done.	1
Why,	1
bless	1
my	1
soul!	1
here	1
is	1
her	1
carriage	1
at	1
the	1
door."	1
	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
spoken	1
before	1
there	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
lovely	1
young	1
women	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
Her	1
violet	1
eyes	1
shining,	1
her	1
lips	1
parted,	1
a	1
pink	1
flush	1
upon	1
her	1
cheeks,	1
all	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
natural	1
reserve	1
lost	1
in	1
her	1
overpowering	1
excitement	1
and	1
concern.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
glancing	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
finally,	1
with	1
a	1
woman's	1
quick	1
intuition,	1
fastening	1
upon	1
my	1
companion,	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
come.	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
down	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
so.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
James	1
didn't	1
do	1
it.	1
I	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
start	1
upon	1
your	1
work	1
knowing	1
it,	1
too.	1
Never	1
let	1
yourself	1
doubt	1
upon	1
that	1
point.	1
We	1
have	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
since	1
we	1
were	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
his	1
faults	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
does;	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
tender-hearted	1
to	1
hurt	1
a	1
fly.	1
Such	1
a	1
charge	1
is	1
absurd	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
really	1
knows	1
him."	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
we	1
may	1
clear	1
him,	1
Miss	1
Turner,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
"You	1
may	1
rely	1
upon	1
my	1
doing	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
can."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
evidence.	1
You	1
have	1
formed	1
some	1
conclusion?	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
see	1
some	1
loophole,	1
some	1
flaw?	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
yourself	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
innocent?"	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
probable."	1
	1
"There,	1
now!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
throwing	1
back	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
looking	1
defiantly	1
at	1
Lestrade.	1
"You	1
hear!	1
He	1
gives	1
me	1
hopes."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
my	1
colleague	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
quick	1
in	1
forming	1
his	1
conclusions,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
is	1
right.	1
Oh!	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
right.	1
James	1
never	1
did	1
it.	1
And	1
about	1
his	1
quarrel	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
speak	1
about	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
coroner	1
was	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
concerned	1
in	1
it."	1
	1
"In	1
what	1
way?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
hide	1
anything.	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
many	1
disagreements	1
about	1
me.	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
marriage	1
between	1
us.	1
James	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
loved	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
brother	1
and	1
sister;	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
has	1
seen	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
life	1
yet,	1
and--and--well,	1
he	1
naturally	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
like	1
that	1
yet.	1
So	1
there	1
were	1
quarrels,	1
and	1
this,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
"And	1
your	1
father?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
"Was	1
he	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
union?"	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
was	1
averse	1
to	1
it	1
also.	1
No	1
one	1
but	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
it."	1
A	1
quick	1
blush	1
passed	1
over	1
her	1
fresh	1
young	1
face	1
as	1
Holmes	1
shot	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
keen,	1
questioning	1
glances	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you	1
for	1
this	1
information,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"May	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
father	1
if	1
I	1
call	1
to-morrow?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
the	1
doctor	1
won't	1
allow	1
it."	1
	1
"The	1
doctor?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
heard?	1
Poor	1
father	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
strong	1
for	1
years	1
back,	1
but	1
this	1
has	1
broken	1
him	1
down	1
completely.	1
He	1
has	1
taken	1
to	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Willows	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
wreck	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
nervous	1
system	1
is	1
shattered.	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
alive	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
dad	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
in	1
Victoria."	1
	1
"Ha!	1
In	1
Victoria!	1
That	1
is	1
important."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
at	1
the	1
mines."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so;	1
at	1
the	1
gold-mines,	1
where,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
Mr.	1
Turner	1
made	1
his	1
money."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
certainly."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Turner.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
material	1
assistance	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
news	1
to-morrow.	1
No	1
doubt	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
see	1
James.	1
Oh,	1
if	1
you	1
do,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
do	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
innocent."	1
	1
"I	1
will,	1
Miss	1
Turner."	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
home	1
now,	1
for	1
dad	1
is	1
very	1
ill,	1
and	1
he	1
misses	1
me	1
so	1
if	1
I	1
leave	1
him.	1
Good-bye,	1
and	1
God	1
help	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
undertaking."	1
She	1
hurried	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
impulsively	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
entered,	1
and	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
her	1
carriage	1
rattle	1
off	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you,	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
Lestrade	1
with	1
dignity	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
silence.	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
raise	1
up	1
hopes	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
disappoint?	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
over-tender	1
of	1
heart,	1
but	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
cruel."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
clearing	1
James	1
McCarthy,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Have	1
you	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
prison?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
reconsider	1
my	1
resolution	1
about	1
going	1
out.	1
We	1
have	1
still	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
train	1
to	1
Hereford	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
to-night?"	1
	1
"Ample."	1
	1
"Then	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
so.	1
Watson,	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
very	1
slow,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
only	1
be	1
away	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours."	1
	1
I	1
walked	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
wandered	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
town,	1
finally	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
hotel,	1
where	1
I	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
interest	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
yellow-backed	1
novel.	1
The	1
puny	1
plot	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
so	1
thin,	1
however,	1
when	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
deep	1
mystery	1
through	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
groping,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
attention	1
wander	1
so	1
continually	1
from	1
the	1
action	1
to	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
I	1
at	1
last	1
flung	1
it	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
gave	1
myself	1
up	1
entirely	1
to	1
a	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Supposing	1
that	1
this	1
unhappy	1
young	1
man's	1
story	1
were	1
absolutely	1
true,	1
then	1
what	1
hellish	1
thing,	1
what	1
absolutely	1
unforeseen	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
calamity	1
could	1
have	1
occurred	1
between	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
parted	1
from	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
when,	1
drawn	1
back	1
by	1
his	1
screams,	1
he	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
glade?	1
It	1
was	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
deadly.	1
What	1
could	1
it	1
be?	1
Might	1
not	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
injuries	1
reveal	1
something	1
to	1
my	1
medical	1
instincts?	1
I	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
weekly	1
county	1
paper,	1
which	1
contained	1
a	1
verbatim	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
inquest.	1
In	1
the	1
surgeon's	1
deposition	1
it	1
was	1
stated	1
that	1
the	1
posterior	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
parietal	1
bone	1
and	1
the	1
left	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
occipital	1
bone	1
had	1
been	1
shattered	1
by	1
a	1
heavy	1
blow	1
from	1
a	1
blunt	1
weapon.	1
I	1
marked	1
the	1
spot	1
upon	1
my	1
own	1
head.	1
Clearly	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
struck	1
from	1
behind.	1
That	1
was	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
accused,	1
as	1
when	1
seen	1
quarrelling	1
he	1
was	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
father.	1
Still,	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
for	1
very	1
much,	1
for	1
the	1
older	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
before	1
the	1
blow	1
fell.	1
Still,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
worth	1
while	1
to	1
call	1
Holmes'	1
attention	1
to	1
it.	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
peculiar	1
dying	1
reference	1
to	1
a	1
rat.	1
What	1
could	1
that	1
mean?	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
delirium.	1
A	1
man	1
dying	1
from	1
a	1
sudden	1
blow	1
does	1
not	1
commonly	1
become	1
delirious.	1
No,	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
he	1
met	1
his	1
fate.	1
But	1
what	1
could	1
it	1
indicate?	1
I	1
cudgelled	1
my	1
brains	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
possible	1
explanation.	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
grey	1
cloth	1
seen	1
by	1
young	1
McCarthy.	1
If	1
that	1
were	1
true	1
the	1
murderer	1
must	1
have	1
dropped	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
dress,	1
presumably	1
his	1
overcoat,	1
in	1
his	1
flight,	1
and	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
hardihood	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
the	1
son	1
was	1
kneeling	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
turned	1
not	1
a	1
dozen	1
paces	1
off.	1
What	1
a	1
tissue	1
of	1
mysteries	1
and	1
improbabilities	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
was!	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wonder	1
at	1
Lestrade's	1
opinion,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
faith	1
in	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
insight	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
lose	1
hope	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
every	1
fresh	1
fact	1
seemed	1
to	1
strengthen	1
his	1
conviction	1
of	1
young	1
McCarthy's	1
innocence.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
late	1
before	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
returned.	1
He	1
came	1
back	1
alone,	1
for	1
Lestrade	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
lodgings	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
"The	1
glass	1
still	1
keeps	1
very	1
high,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
down.	1
"It	1
is	1
of	1
importance	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
rain	1
before	1
we	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
ground.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
his	1
very	1
best	1
and	1
keenest	1
for	1
such	1
nice	1
work	1
as	1
that,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
when	1
fagged	1
by	1
a	1
long	1
journey.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
young	1
McCarthy."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
learn	1
from	1
him?"	1
	1
"Nothing."	1
	1
"Could	1
he	1
throw	1
no	1
light?"	1
	1
"None	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
was	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
screening	1
him	1
or	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
puzzled	1
as	1
everyone	1
else.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
quick-witted	1
youth,	1
though	1
comely	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
and,	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
sound	1
at	1
heart."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
admire	1
his	1
taste,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
"if	1
it	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
averse	1
to	1
a	1
marriage	1
with	1
so	1
charming	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
as	1
this	1
Miss	1
Turner."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
thereby	1
hangs	1
a	1
rather	1
painful	1
tale.	1
This	1
fellow	1
is	1
madly,	1
insanely,	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her,	1
but	1
some	1
two	1
years	1
ago,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
lad,	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
really	1
knew	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
away	1
five	1
years	1
at	1
a	1
boarding-school,	1
what	1
does	1
the	1
idiot	1
do	1
but	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
clutches	1
of	1
a	1
barmaid	1
in	1
Bristol	1
and	1
marry	1
her	1
at	1
a	1
registry	1
office?	1
No	1
one	1
knows	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
but	1
you	1
can	1
imagine	1
how	1
maddening	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
upbraided	1
for	1
not	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
his	1
very	1
eyes	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
knows	1
to	1
be	1
absolutely	1
impossible.	1
It	1
was	1
sheer	1
frenzy	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
throw	1
his	1
hands	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
when	1
his	1
father,	1
at	1
their	1
last	1
interview,	1
was	1
goading	1
him	1
on	1
to	1
propose	1
to	1
Miss	1
Turner.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
supporting	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
by	1
all	1
accounts	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
man,	1
would	1
have	1
thrown	1
him	1
over	1
utterly	1
had	1
he	1
known	1
the	1
truth.	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
barmaid	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
last	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
Bristol,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
Mark	1
that	1
point.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
importance.	1
Good	1
has	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
evil,	1
however,	1
for	1
the	1
barmaid,	1
finding	1
from	1
the	1
papers	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
serious	1
trouble	1
and	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
hanged,	1
has	1
thrown	1
him	1
over	1
utterly	1
and	1
has	1
written	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
husband	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
Bermuda	1
Dockyard,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
no	1
tie	1
between	1
them.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
that	1
bit	1
of	1
news	1
has	1
consoled	1
young	1
McCarthy	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
suffered."	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
innocent,	1
who	1
has	1
done	1
it?"	1
	1
"Ah!	1
who?	1
I	1
would	1
call	1
your	1
attention	1
very	1
particularly	1
to	1
two	1
points.	1
One	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
murdered	1
man	1
had	1
an	1
appointment	1
with	1
someone	1
at	1
the	1
pool,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
someone	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
son,	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
return.	1
The	1
second	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
murdered	1
man	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
cry	1
'Cooee!'	1
before	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
returned.	1
Those	1
are	1
the	1
crucial	1
points	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
case	1
depends.	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
George	1
Meredith,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
leave	1
all	1
minor	1
matters	1
until	1
to-morrow."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
rain,	1
as	1
Holmes	1
had	1
foretold,	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
broke	1
bright	1
and	1
cloudless.	1
At	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
Lestrade	1
called	1
for	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
we	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Hatherley	1
Farm	1
and	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
serious	1
news	1
this	1
morning,"	1
Lestrade	1
observed.	1
"It	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Turner,	1
of	1
the	1
Hall,	1
is	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
despaired	1
of."	1
	1
"An	1
elderly	1
man,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"About	1
sixty;	1
but	1
his	1
constitution	1
has	1
been	1
shattered	1
by	1
his	1
life	1
abroad,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
failing	1
health	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
This	1
business	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
effect	1
upon	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
McCarthy's,	1
and,	1
I	1
may	1
add,	1
a	1
great	1
benefactor	1
to	1
him,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
Hatherley	1
Farm	1
rent	1
free."	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
That	1
is	1
interesting,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!	1
In	1
a	1
hundred	1
other	1
ways	1
he	1
has	1
helped	1
him.	1
Everybody	1
about	1
here	1
speaks	1
of	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
him."	1
	1
"Really!	1
Does	1
it	1
not	1
strike	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
singular	1
that	1
this	1
McCarthy,	1
who	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
little	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
such	1
obligations	1
to	1
Turner,	1
should	1
still	1
talk	1
of	1
marrying	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
Turner's	1
daughter,	1
who	1
is,	1
presumably,	1
heiress	1
to	1
the	1
estate,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
cocksure	1
manner,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
merely	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
proposal	1
and	1
all	1
else	1
would	1
follow?	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
strange,	1
since	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
Turner	1
himself	1
was	1
averse	1
to	1
the	1
idea.	1
The	1
daughter	1
told	1
us	1
as	1
much.	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
deduce	1
something	1
from	1
that?"	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
deductions	1
and	1
the	1
inferences,"	1
said	1
Lestrade,	1
winking	1
at	1
me.	1
"I	1
find	1
it	1
hard	1
enough	1
to	1
tackle	1
facts,	1
Holmes,	1
without	1
flying	1
away	1
after	1
theories	1
and	1
fancies."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
right,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
demurely;	1
"you	1
do	1
find	1
it	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
tackle	1
the	1
facts."	1
	1
"Anyhow,	1
I	1
have	1
grasped	1
one	1
fact	1
which	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of,"	1
replied	1
Lestrade	1
with	1
some	1
warmth.	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
is--"	1
	1
"That	1
McCarthy	1
senior	1
met	1
his	1
death	1
from	1
McCarthy	1
junior	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
theories	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
are	1
the	1
merest	1
moonshine."	1
	1
"Well,	1
moonshine	1
is	1
a	1
brighter	1
thing	1
than	1
fog,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
Hatherley	1
Farm	1
upon	1
the	1
left."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
it."	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
widespread,	1
comfortable-looking	1
building,	1
two-storied,	1
slate-roofed,	1
with	1
great	1
yellow	1
blotches	1
of	1
lichen	1
upon	1
the	1
grey	1
walls.	1
The	1
drawn	1
blinds	1
and	1
the	1
smokeless	1
chimneys,	1
however,	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
stricken	1
look,	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
this	1
horror	1
still	1
lay	1
heavy	1
upon	1
it.	1
We	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
when	1
the	1
maid,	1
at	1
Holmes'	1
request,	1
showed	1
us	1
the	1
boots	1
which	1
her	1
master	1
wore	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
the	1
son's,	1
though	1
not	1
the	1
pair	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
then	1
had.	1
Having	1
measured	1
these	1
very	1
carefully	1
from	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
different	1
points,	1
Holmes	1
desired	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
court-yard,	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
all	1
followed	1
the	1
winding	1
track	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
Boscombe	1
Pool.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
transformed	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
hot	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
scent	1
as	1
this.	1
Men	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
known	1
the	1
quiet	1
thinker	1
and	1
logician	1
of	1
Baker	1
Street	1
would	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
recognise	1
him.	1
His	1
face	1
flushed	1
and	1
darkened.	1
His	1
brows	1
were	1
drawn	1
into	1
two	1
hard	1
black	1
lines,	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
shone	1
out	1
from	1
beneath	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
steely	1
glitter.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
bent	1
downward,	1
his	1
shoulders	1
bowed,	1
his	1
lips	1
compressed,	1
and	1
the	1
veins	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
whipcord	1
in	1
his	1
long,	1
sinewy	1
neck.	1
His	1
nostrils	1
seemed	1
to	1
dilate	1
with	1
a	1
purely	1
animal	1
lust	1
for	1
the	1
chase,	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
so	1
absolutely	1
concentrated	1
upon	1
the	1
matter	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
question	1
or	1
remark	1
fell	1
unheeded	1
upon	1
his	1
ears,	1
or,	1
at	1
the	1
most,	1
only	1
provoked	1
a	1
quick,	1
impatient	1
snarl	1
in	1
reply.	1
Swiftly	1
and	1
silently	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
along	1
the	1
track	1
which	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
meadows,	1
and	1
so	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
to	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool.	1
It	1
was	1
damp,	1
marshy	1
ground,	1
as	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
district,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
marks	1
of	1
many	1
feet,	1
both	1
upon	1
the	1
path	1
and	1
amid	1
the	1
short	1
grass	1
which	1
bounded	1
it	1
on	1
either	1
side.	1
Sometimes	1
Holmes	1
would	1
hurry	1
on,	1
sometimes	1
stop	1
dead,	1
and	1
once	1
he	1
made	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
detour	1
into	1
the	1
meadow.	1
Lestrade	1
and	1
I	1
walked	1
behind	1
him,	1
the	1
detective	1
indifferent	1
and	1
contemptuous,	1
while	1
I	1
watched	1
my	1
friend	1
with	1
the	1
interest	1
which	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
actions	1
was	1
directed	1
towards	1
a	1
definite	1
end.	1
	1
The	1
Boscombe	1
Pool,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
reed-girt	1
sheet	1
of	1
water	1
some	1
fifty	1
yards	1
across,	1
is	1
situated	1
at	1
the	1
boundary	1
between	1
the	1
Hatherley	1
Farm	1
and	1
the	1
private	1
park	1
of	1
the	1
wealthy	1
Mr.	1
Turner.	1
Above	1
the	1
woods	1
which	1
lined	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
red,	1
jutting	1
pinnacles	1
which	1
marked	1
the	1
site	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
landowner's	1
dwelling.	1
On	1
the	1
Hatherley	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pool	1
the	1
woods	1
grew	1
very	1
thick,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
narrow	1
belt	1
of	1
sodden	1
grass	1
twenty	1
paces	1
across	1
between	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
the	1
reeds	1
which	1
lined	1
the	1
lake.	1
Lestrade	1
showed	1
us	1
the	1
exact	1
spot	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
body	1
had	1
been	1
found,	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
so	1
moist	1
was	1
the	1
ground,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
plainly	1
see	1
the	1
traces	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
the	1
stricken	1
man.	1
To	1
Holmes,	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
his	1
eager	1
face	1
and	1
peering	1
eyes,	1
very	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
read	1
upon	1
the	1
trampled	1
grass.	1
He	1
ran	1
round,	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
who	1
is	1
picking	1
up	1
a	1
scent,	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
upon	1
my	1
companion.	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
pool	1
for?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
fished	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
rake.	1
I	1
thought	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
weapon	1
or	1
other	1
trace.	1
But	1
how	1
on	1
earth--"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
tut,	1
tut!	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
time!	1
That	1
left	1
foot	1
of	1
yours	1
with	1
its	1
inward	1
twist	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
place.	1
A	1
mole	1
could	1
trace	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
vanishes	1
among	1
the	1
reeds.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
simple	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
have	1
been	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
here	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
like	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
buffalo	1
and	1
wallowed	1
all	1
over	1
it.	1
Here	1
is	1
where	1
the	1
party	1
with	1
the	1
lodge-keeper	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
covered	1
all	1
tracks	1
for	1
six	1
or	1
eight	1
feet	1
round	1
the	1
body.	1
But	1
here	1
are	1
three	1
separate	1
tracks	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
feet."	1
He	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
lens	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
waterproof	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
better	1
view,	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
rather	1
to	1
himself	1
than	1
to	1
us.	1
"These	1
are	1
young	1
McCarthy's	1
feet.	1
Twice	1
he	1
was	1
walking,	1
and	1
once	1
he	1
ran	1
swiftly,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
soles	1
are	1
deeply	1
marked	1
and	1
the	1
heels	1
hardly	1
visible.	1
That	1
bears	1
out	1
his	1
story.	1
He	1
ran	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
father	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
Then	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
father's	1
feet	1
as	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down.	1
What	1
is	1
this,	1
then?	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
butt-end	1
of	1
the	1
gun	1
as	1
the	1
son	1
stood	1
listening.	1
And	1
this?	1
Ha,	1
ha!	1
What	1
have	1
we	1
here?	1
Tiptoes!	1
tiptoes!	1
Square,	1
too,	1
quite	1
unusual	1
boots!	1
They	1
come,	1
they	1
go,	1
they	1
come	1
again--of	1
course	1
that	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
cloak.	1
Now	1
where	1
did	1
they	1
come	1
from?"	1
He	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
sometimes	1
losing,	1
sometimes	1
finding	1
the	1
track	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
well	1
within	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
beech,	1
the	1
largest	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
Holmes	1
traced	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
once	1
more	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
cry	1
of	1
satisfaction.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
remained	1
there,	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
leaves	1
and	1
dried	1
sticks,	1
gathering	1
up	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
dust	1
into	1
an	1
envelope	1
and	1
examining	1
with	1
his	1
lens	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
ground	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
bark	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
reach.	1
A	1
jagged	1
stone	1
was	1
lying	1
among	1
the	1
moss,	1
and	1
this	1
also	1
he	1
carefully	1
examined	1
and	1
retained.	1
Then	1
he	1
followed	1
a	1
pathway	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
highroad,	1
where	1
all	1
traces	1
were	1
lost.	1
	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
considerable	1
interest,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
natural	1
manner.	1
"I	1
fancy	1
that	1
this	1
grey	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
lodge.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
Moran,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
write	1
a	1
little	1
note.	1
Having	1
done	1
that,	1
we	1
may	1
drive	1
back	1
to	1
our	1
luncheon.	1
You	1
may	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
presently."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes	1
before	1
we	1
regained	1
our	1
cab	1
and	1
drove	1
back	1
into	1
Ross,	1
Holmes	1
still	1
carrying	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
"This	1
may	1
interest	1
you,	1
Lestrade,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
holding	1
it	1
out.	1
"The	1
murder	1
was	1
done	1
with	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
no	1
marks."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
none."	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
then?"	1
	1
"The	1
grass	1
was	1
growing	1
under	1
it.	1
It	1
had	1
only	1
lain	1
there	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
whence	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
taken.	1
It	1
corresponds	1
with	1
the	1
injuries.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
weapon."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
murderer?"	1
	1
"Is	1
a	1
tall	1
man,	1
left-handed,	1
limps	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
leg,	1
wears	1
thick-soled	1
shooting-boots	1
and	1
a	1
grey	1
cloak,	1
smokes	1
Indian	1
cigars,	1
uses	1
a	1
cigar-holder,	1
and	1
carries	1
a	1
blunt	1
pen-knife	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
There	1
are	1
several	1
other	1
indications,	1
but	1
these	1
may	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
aid	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
search."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
laughed.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
a	1
sceptic,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Theories	1
are	1
all	1
very	1
well,	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
a	1
hard-headed	1
British	1
jury."	1
	1
"Nous	1
verrons,"	1
answered	1
Holmes	1
calmly.	1
"You	1
work	1
your	1
own	1
method,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
work	1
mine.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
busy	1
this	1
afternoon,	1
and	1
shall	1
probably	1
return	1
to	1
London	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
train."	1
	1
"And	1
leave	1
your	1
case	1
unfinished?"	1
	1
"No,	1
finished."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
mystery?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
solved."	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
the	1
criminal,	1
then?"	1
	1
"The	1
gentleman	1
I	1
describe."	1
	1
"But	1
who	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"Surely	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
out.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
populous	1
neighbourhood."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
practical	1
man,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
I	1
really	1
cannot	1
undertake	1
to	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
country	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
left-handed	1
gentleman	1
with	1
a	1
game	1
leg.	1
I	1
should	1
become	1
the	1
laughing-stock	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard."	1
	1
"All	1
right,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
quietly.	1
"I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
chance.	1
Here	1
are	1
your	1
lodgings.	1
Good-bye.	1
I	1
shall	1
drop	1
you	1
a	1
line	1
before	1
I	1
leave."	1
	1
Having	1
left	1
Lestrade	1
at	1
his	1
rooms,	1
we	1
drove	1
to	1
our	1
hotel,	1
where	1
we	1
found	1
lunch	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
Holmes	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
buried	1
in	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
pained	1
expression	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
finds	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
perplexing	1
position.	1
	1
"Look	1
here,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
the	1
cloth	1
was	1
cleared	1
"just	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
this	1
chair	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
preach	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
little.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
quite	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
value	1
your	1
advice.	1
Light	1
a	1
cigar	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
expound."	1
	1
	1
"Pray	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
"Well,	1
now,	1
in	1
considering	1
this	1
case	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
points	1
about	1
young	1
McCarthy's	1
narrative	1
which	1
struck	1
us	1
both	1
instantly,	1
although	1
they	1
impressed	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
and	1
you	1
against	1
him.	1
One	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
should,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
account,	1
cry	1
'Cooee!'	1
before	1
seeing	1
him.	1
The	1
other	1
was	1
his	1
singular	1
dying	1
reference	1
to	1
a	1
rat.	1
He	1
mumbled	1
several	1
words,	1
you	1
understand,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
caught	1
the	1
son's	1
ear.	1
Now	1
from	1
this	1
double	1
point	1
our	1
research	1
must	1
commence,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
begin	1
it	1
by	1
presuming	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
lad	1
says	1
is	1
absolutely	1
true."	1
	1
"What	1
of	1
this	1
'Cooee!'	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
obviously	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
meant	1
for	1
the	1
son.	1
The	1
son,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
knew,	1
was	1
in	1
Bristol.	1
It	1
was	1
mere	1
chance	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
within	1
earshot.	1
The	1
'Cooee!'	1
was	1
meant	1
to	1
attract	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
whoever	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
appointment	1
with.	1
But	1
'Cooee'	1
is	1
a	1
distinctly	1
Australian	1
cry,	1
and	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
used	1
between	1
Australians.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
presumption	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
whom	1
McCarthy	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
Boscombe	1
Pool	1
was	1
someone	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Australia."	1
	1
"What	1
of	1
the	1
rat,	1
then?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
took	1
a	1
folded	1
paper	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
flattened	1
it	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
Colony	1
of	1
Victoria,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
wired	1
to	1
Bristol	1
for	1
it	1
last	1
night."	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
map.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
read?"	1
	1
"ARAT,"	1
I	1
read.	1
	1
"And	1
now?"	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"BALLARAT."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
the	1
man	1
uttered,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
son	1
only	1
caught	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
syllables.	1
He	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
murderer.	1
So	1
and	1
so,	1
of	1
Ballarat."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
wonderful!"	1
I	1
exclaimed.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
obvious.	1
And	1
now,	1
you	1
see,	1
I	1
had	1
narrowed	1
the	1
field	1
down	1
considerably.	1
The	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
grey	1
garment	1
was	1
a	1
third	1
point	1
which,	1
granting	1
the	1
son's	1
statement	1
to	1
be	1
correct,	1
was	1
a	1
certainty.	1
We	1
have	1
come	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
mere	1
vagueness	1
to	1
the	1
definite	1
conception	1
of	1
an	1
Australian	1
from	1
Ballarat	1
with	1
a	1
grey	1
cloak."	1
	1
"Certainly."	1
	1
"And	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
district,	1
for	1
the	1
pool	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
approached	1
by	1
the	1
farm	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
estate,	1
where	1
strangers	1
could	1
hardly	1
wander."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so."	1
	1
"Then	1
comes	1
our	1
expedition	1
of	1
to-day.	1
By	1
an	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
I	1
gained	1
the	1
trifling	1
details	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
that	1
imbecile	1
Lestrade,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
personality	1
of	1
the	1
criminal."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
gain	1
them?"	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
my	1
method.	1
It	1
is	1
founded	1
upon	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
trifles."	1
	1
"His	1
height	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
roughly	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
stride.	1
His	1
boots,	1
too,	1
might	1
be	1
told	1
from	1
their	1
traces."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
were	1
peculiar	1
boots."	1
	1
"But	1
his	1
lameness?"	1
	1
"The	1
impression	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
foot	1
was	1
always	1
less	1
distinct	1
than	1
his	1
left.	1
He	1
put	1
less	1
weight	1
upon	1
it.	1
Why?	1
Because	1
he	1
limped--he	1
was	1
lame."	1
	1
"But	1
his	1
left-handedness."	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
yourself	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
injury	1
as	1
recorded	1
by	1
the	1
surgeon	1
at	1
the	1
inquest.	1
The	1
blow	1
was	1
struck	1
from	1
immediately	1
behind,	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
side.	1
Now,	1
how	1
can	1
that	1
be	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
a	1
left-handed	1
man?	1
He	1
had	1
stood	1
behind	1
that	1
tree	1
during	1
the	1
interview	1
between	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
He	1
had	1
even	1
smoked	1
there.	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
ash	1
of	1
a	1
cigar,	1
which	1
my	1
special	1
knowledge	1
of	1
tobacco	1
ashes	1
enables	1
me	1
to	1
pronounce	1
as	1
an	1
Indian	1
cigar.	1
I	1
have,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
devoted	1
some	1
attention	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
written	1
a	1
little	1
monograph	1
on	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
140	1
different	1
varieties	1
of	1
pipe,	1
cigar,	1
and	1
cigarette	1
tobacco.	1
Having	1
found	1
the	1
ash,	1
I	1
then	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
discovered	1
the	1
stump	1
among	1
the	1
moss	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
tossed	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
Indian	1
cigar,	1
of	1
the	1
variety	1
which	1
are	1
rolled	1
in	1
Rotterdam."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
cigar-holder?"	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
end	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
used	1
a	1
holder.	1
The	1
tip	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
off,	1
not	1
bitten	1
off,	1
but	1
the	1
cut	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
clean	1
one,	1
so	1
I	1
deduced	1
a	1
blunt	1
pen-knife."	1
	1
"Holmes,"	1
I	1
said,	1
"you	1
have	1
drawn	1
a	1
net	1
round	1
this	1
man	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
cannot	1
escape,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
saved	1
an	1
innocent	1
human	1
life	1
as	1
truly	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
cut	1
the	1
cord	1
which	1
was	1
hanging	1
him.	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
this	1
points.	1
The	1
culprit	1
is--"	1
	1
"Mr.	1
John	1
Turner,"	1
cried	1
the	1
hotel	1
waiter,	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
our	1
sitting-room,	1
and	1
ushering	1
in	1
a	1
visitor.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
entered	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
impressive	1
figure.	1
His	1
slow,	1
limping	1
step	1
and	1
bowed	1
shoulders	1
gave	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
decrepitude,	1
and	1
yet	1
his	1
hard,	1
deep-lined,	1
craggy	1
features,	1
and	1
his	1
enormous	1
limbs	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
possessed	1
of	1
unusual	1
strength	1
of	1
body	1
and	1
of	1
character.	1
His	1
tangled	1
beard,	1
grizzled	1
hair,	1
and	1
outstanding,	1
drooping	1
eyebrows	1
combined	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
power	1
to	1
his	1
appearance,	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
ashen	1
white,	1
while	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
nostrils	1
were	1
tinged	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
blue.	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
grip	1
of	1
some	1
deadly	1
and	1
chronic	1
disease.	1
	1
"Pray	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
gently.	1
"You	1
had	1
my	1
note?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
lodge-keeper	1
brought	1
it	1
up.	1
You	1
said	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
here	1
to	1
avoid	1
scandal."	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
people	1
would	1
talk	1
if	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Hall."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
me?"	1
He	1
looked	1
across	1
at	1
my	1
companion	1
with	1
despair	1
in	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes,	1
as	1
though	1
his	1
question	1
was	1
already	1
answered.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
answering	1
the	1
look	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
words.	1
"It	1
is	1
so.	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
McCarthy."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
sank	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
"God	1
help	1
me!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
come	1
to	1
harm.	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
spoken	1
out	1
if	1
it	1
went	1
against	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
Assizes."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
say	1
so,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
gravely.	1
	1
"I	1
would	1
have	1
spoken	1
now	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
my	1
dear	1
girl.	1
It	1
would	1
break	1
her	1
heart--it	1
will	1
break	1
her	1
heart	1
when	1
she	1
hears	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
arrested."	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
that,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"What?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
no	1
official	1
agent.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
your	1
daughter	1
who	1
required	1
my	1
presence	1
here,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
acting	1
in	1
her	1
interests.	1
Young	1
McCarthy	1
must	1
be	1
got	1
off,	1
however."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
dying	1
man,"	1
said	1
old	1
Turner.	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
diabetes	1
for	1
years.	1
My	1
doctor	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
live	1
a	1
month.	1
Yet	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
die	1
under	1
my	1
own	1
roof	1
than	1
in	1
a	1
gaol."	1
	1
Holmes	1
rose	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
paper	1
before	1
him.	1
"Just	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
truth,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
shall	1
jot	1
down	1
the	1
facts.	1
You	1
will	1
sign	1
it,	1
and	1
Watson	1
here	1
can	1
witness	1
it.	1
Then	1
I	1
could	1
produce	1
your	1
confession	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
extremity	1
to	1
save	1
young	1
McCarthy.	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
use	1
it	1
unless	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
needed."	1
	1
"It's	1
as	1
well,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
"it's	1
a	1
question	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
live	1
to	1
the	1
Assizes,	1
so	1
it	1
matters	1
little	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
spare	1
Alice	1
the	1
shock.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
thing	1
clear	1
to	1
you;	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
acting,	1
but	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
me	1
long	1
to	1
tell.	1
	1
"You	1
didn't	1
know	1
this	1
dead	1
man,	1
McCarthy.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
devil	1
incarnate.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that.	1
God	1
keep	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
clutches	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
he.	1
His	1
grip	1
has	1
been	1
upon	1
me	1
these	1
twenty	1
years,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
blasted	1
my	1
life.	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
first	1
how	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
'60's	1
at	1
the	1
diggings.	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
chap	1
then,	1
hot-blooded	1
and	1
reckless,	1
ready	1
to	1
turn	1
my	1
hand	1
at	1
anything;	1
I	1
got	1
among	1
bad	1
companions,	1
took	1
to	1
drink,	1
had	1
no	1
luck	1
with	1
my	1
claim,	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
bush,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
became	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
call	1
over	1
here	1
a	1
highway	1
robber.	1
There	1
were	1
six	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
wild,	1
free	1
life	1
of	1
it,	1
sticking	1
up	1
a	1
station	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
or	1
stopping	1
the	1
wagons	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
diggings.	1
Black	1
Jack	1
of	1
Ballarat	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
I	1
went	1
under,	1
and	1
our	1
party	1
is	1
still	1
remembered	1
in	1
the	1
colony	1
as	1
the	1
Ballarat	1
Gang.	1
	1
"One	1
day	1
a	1
gold	1
convoy	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Ballarat	1
to	1
Melbourne,	1
and	1
we	1
lay	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
attacked	1
it.	1
There	1
were	1
six	1
troopers	1
and	1
six	1
of	1
us,	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
close	1
thing,	1
but	1
we	1
emptied	1
four	1
of	1
their	1
saddles	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
volley.	1
Three	1
of	1
our	1
boys	1
were	1
killed,	1
however,	1
before	1
we	1
got	1
the	1
swag.	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
pistol	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wagon-driver,	1
who	1
was	1
this	1
very	1
man	1
McCarthy.	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
shot	1
him	1
then,	1
but	1
I	1
spared	1
him,	1
though	1
I	1
saw	1
his	1
wicked	1
little	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
my	1
face,	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
remember	1
every	1
feature.	1
We	1
got	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
gold,	1
became	1
wealthy	1
men,	1
and	1
made	1
our	1
way	1
over	1
to	1
England	1
without	1
being	1
suspected.	1
There	1
I	1
parted	1
from	1
my	1
old	1
pals	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
respectable	1
life.	1
I	1
bought	1
this	1
estate,	1
which	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
market,	1
and	1
I	1
set	1
myself	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
little	1
good	1
with	1
my	1
money,	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
earned	1
it.	1
I	1
married,	1
too,	1
and	1
though	1
my	1
wife	1
died	1
young	1
she	1
left	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
little	1
Alice.	1
Even	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
baby	1
her	1
wee	1
hand	1
seemed	1
to	1
lead	1
me	1
down	1
the	1
right	1
path	1
as	1
nothing	1
else	1
had	1
ever	1
done.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
I	1
turned	1
over	1
a	1
new	1
leaf	1
and	1
did	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
past.	1
All	1
was	1
going	1
well	1
when	1
McCarthy	1
laid	1
his	1
grip	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
town	1
about	1
an	1
investment,	1
and	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
Regent	1
Street	1
with	1
hardly	1
a	1
coat	1
to	1
his	1
back	1
or	1
a	1
boot	1
to	1
his	1
foot.	1
	1
"'Here	1
we	1
are,	1
Jack,'	1
says	1
he,	1
touching	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
arm;	1
'we'll	1
be	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
family	1
to	1
you.	1
There's	1
two	1
of	1
us,	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
have	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
us.	1
If	1
you	1
don't--it's	1
a	1
fine,	1
law-abiding	1
country	1
is	1
England,	1
and	1
there's	1
always	1
a	1
policeman	1
within	1
hail.'	1
	1
"Well,	1
down	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
country,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
shaking	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
have	1
lived	1
rent	1
free	1
on	1
my	1
best	1
land	1
ever	1
since.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
rest	1
for	1
me,	1
no	1
peace,	1
no	1
forgetfulness;	1
turn	1
where	1
I	1
would,	1
there	1
was	1
his	1
cunning,	1
grinning	1
face	1
at	1
my	1
elbow.	1
It	1
grew	1
worse	1
as	1
Alice	1
grew	1
up,	1
for	1
he	1
soon	1
saw	1
I	1
was	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
knowing	1
my	1
past	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
police.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
wanted	1
he	1
must	1
have,	1
and	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
without	1
question,	1
land,	1
money,	1
houses,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
give.	1
He	1
asked	1
for	1
Alice.	1
	1
"His	1
son,	1
you	1
see,	1
had	1
grown	1
up,	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
my	1
girl,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
weak	1
health,	1
it	1
seemed	1
a	1
fine	1
stroke	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
lad	1
should	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
whole	1
property.	1
But	1
there	1
I	1
was	1
firm.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
his	1
cursed	1
stock	1
mixed	1
with	1
mine;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
dislike	1
to	1
the	1
lad,	1
but	1
his	1
blood	1
was	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
enough.	1
I	1
stood	1
firm.	1
McCarthy	1
threatened.	1
I	1
braved	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
worst.	1
We	1
were	1
to	1
meet	1
at	1
the	1
pool	1
midway	1
between	1
our	1
houses	1
to	1
talk	1
it	1
over.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
there	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
talking	1
with	1
his	1
son,	1
so	1
I	1
smoked	1
a	1
cigar	1
and	1
waited	1
behind	1
a	1
tree	1
until	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
alone.	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
talk	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
black	1
and	1
bitter	1
in	1
me	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
uppermost.	1
He	1
was	1
urging	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
marry	1
my	1
daughter	1
with	1
as	1
little	1
regard	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
think	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
a	1
slut	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
streets.	1
It	1
drove	1
me	1
mad	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
held	1
most	1
dear	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
this.	1
Could	1
I	1
not	1
snap	1
the	1
bond?	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
a	1
dying	1
and	1
a	1
desperate	1
man.	1
Though	1
clear	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
fairly	1
strong	1
of	1
limb,	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
my	1
own	1
fate	1
was	1
sealed.	1
But	1
my	1
memory	1
and	1
my	1
girl!	1
Both	1
could	1
be	1
saved	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
but	1
silence	1
that	1
foul	1
tongue.	1
I	1
did	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
it	1
again.	1
Deeply	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
sinned,	1
I	1
have	1
led	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
martyrdom	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
it.	1
But	1
that	1
my	1
girl	1
should	1
be	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
meshes	1
which	1
held	1
me	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
suffer.	1
I	1
struck	1
him	1
down	1
with	1
no	1
more	1
compunction	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
foul	1
and	1
venomous	1
beast.	1
His	1
cry	1
brought	1
back	1
his	1
son;	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
the	1
wood,	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
cloak	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
dropped	1
in	1
my	1
flight.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
story,	1
gentlemen,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
occurred."	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
judge	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
signed	1
the	1
statement	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
out.	1
"I	1
pray	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
never	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
temptation."	1
	1
"I	1
pray	1
not,	1
sir.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
intend	1
to	1
do?"	1
	1
"In	1
view	1
of	1
your	1
health,	1
nothing.	1
You	1
are	1
yourself	1
aware	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
soon	1
have	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
your	1
deed	1
at	1
a	1
higher	1
court	1
than	1
the	1
Assizes.	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
your	1
confession,	1
and	1
if	1
McCarthy	1
is	1
condemned	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
use	1
it.	1
If	1
not,	1
it	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
mortal	1
eye;	1
and	1
your	1
secret,	1
whether	1
you	1
be	1
alive	1
or	1
dead,	1
shall	1
be	1
safe	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
"Farewell,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
solemnly.	1
"Your	1
own	1
deathbeds,	1
when	1
they	1
come,	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
easier	1
for	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
mine."	1
Tottering	1
and	1
shaking	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
giant	1
frame,	1
he	1
stumbled	1
slowly	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"God	1
help	1
us!"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
silence.	1
"Why	1
does	1
fate	1
play	1
such	1
tricks	1
with	1
poor,	1
helpless	1
worms?	1
I	1
never	1
hear	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
as	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Baxter's	1
words,	1
and	1
say,	1
'There,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
goes	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.'"	1
	1
James	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
acquitted	1
at	1
the	1
Assizes	1
on	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
objections	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
out	1
by	1
Holmes	1
and	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
defending	1
counsel.	1
Old	1
Turner	1
lived	1
for	1
seven	1
months	1
after	1
our	1
interview,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
dead;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
every	1
prospect	1
that	1
the	1
son	1
and	1
daughter	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
live	1
happily	1
together	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
cloud	1
which	1
rests	1
upon	1
their	1
past.	1
	1
	1
	1
ADVENTURE	1
V.	1
THE	1
FIVE	1
ORANGE	1
PIPS	1
	1
When	1
I	1
glance	1
over	1
my	1
notes	1
and	1
records	1
of	1
the	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
cases	1
between	1
the	1
years	1
'82	1
and	1
'90,	1
I	1
am	1
faced	1
by	1
so	1
many	1
which	1
present	1
strange	1
and	1
interesting	1
features	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
know	1
which	1
to	1
choose	1
and	1
which	1
to	1
leave.	1
Some,	1
however,	1
have	1
already	1
gained	1
publicity	1
through	1
the	1
papers,	1
and	1
others	1
have	1
not	1
offered	1
a	1
field	1
for	1
those	1
peculiar	1
qualities	1
which	1
my	1
friend	1
possessed	1
in	1
so	1
high	1
a	1
degree,	1
and	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
these	1
papers	1
to	1
illustrate.	1
Some,	1
too,	1
have	1
baffled	1
his	1
analytical	1
skill,	1
and	1
would	1
be,	1
as	1
narratives,	1
beginnings	1
without	1
an	1
ending,	1
while	1
others	1
have	1
been	1
but	1
partially	1
cleared	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
their	1
explanations	1
founded	1
rather	1
upon	1
conjecture	1
and	1
surmise	1
than	1
on	1
that	1
absolute	1
logical	1
proof	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
him.	1
There	1
is,	1
however,	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
last	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
remarkable	1
in	1
its	1
details	1
and	1
so	1
startling	1
in	1
its	1
results	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
tempted	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
account	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
points	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
it	1
which	1
never	1
have	1
been,	1
and	1
probably	1
never	1
will	1
be,	1
entirely	1
cleared	1
up.	1
	1
The	1
year	1
'87	1
furnished	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
series	1
of	1
cases	1
of	1
greater	1
or	1
less	1
interest,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
retain	1
the	1
records.	1
Among	1
my	1
headings	1
under	1
this	1
one	1
twelve	1
months	1
I	1
find	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
Paradol	1
Chamber,	1
of	1
the	1
Amateur	1
Mendicant	1
Society,	1
who	1
held	1
a	1
luxurious	1
club	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
vault	1
of	1
a	1
furniture	1
warehouse,	1
of	1
the	1
facts	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
barque	1
"Sophy	1
Anderson",	1
of	1
the	1
singular	1
adventures	1
of	1
the	1
Grice	1
Patersons	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Uffa,	1
and	1
finally	1
of	1
the	1
Camberwell	1
poisoning	1
case.	1
In	1
the	1
latter,	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
remembered,	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
able,	1
by	1
winding	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
man's	1
watch,	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
wound	1
up	1
two	1
hours	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
the	1
deceased	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
within	1
that	1
time--a	1
deduction	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
importance	1
in	1
clearing	1
up	1
the	1
case.	1
All	1
these	1
I	1
may	1
sketch	1
out	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
date,	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
present	1
such	1
singular	1
features	1
as	1
the	1
strange	1
train	1
of	1
circumstances	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
taken	1
up	1
my	1
pen	1
to	1
describe.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
of	1
September,	1
and	1
the	1
equinoctial	1
gales	1
had	1
set	1
in	1
with	1
exceptional	1
violence.	1
All	1
day	1
the	1
wind	1
had	1
screamed	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
had	1
beaten	1
against	1
the	1
windows,	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
great,	1
hand-made	1
London	1
we	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
raise	1
our	1
minds	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
from	1
the	1
routine	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
recognise	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
those	1
great	1
elemental	1
forces	1
which	1
shriek	1
at	1
mankind	1
through	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
his	1
civilisation,	1
like	1
untamed	1
beasts	1
in	1
a	1
cage.	1
As	1
evening	1
drew	1
in,	1
the	1
storm	1
grew	1
higher	1
and	1
louder,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
cried	1
and	1
sobbed	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
the	1
chimney.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
moodily	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fireplace	1
cross-indexing	1
his	1
records	1
of	1
crime,	1
while	1
I	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
deep	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
Clark	1
Russell's	1
fine	1
sea-stories	1
until	1
the	1
howl	1
of	1
the	1
gale	1
from	1
without	1
seemed	1
to	1
blend	1
with	1
the	1
text,	1
and	1
the	1
splash	1
of	1
the	1
rain	1
to	1
lengthen	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
long	1
swash	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
waves.	1
My	1
wife	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
her	1
mother's,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
dweller	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
old	1
quarters	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
I,	1
glancing	1
up	1
at	1
my	1
companion,	1
"that	1
was	1
surely	1
the	1
bell.	1
Who	1
could	1
come	1
to-night?	1
Some	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
perhaps?"	1
	1
"Except	1
yourself	1
I	1
have	1
none,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
encourage	1
visitors."	1
	1
"A	1
client,	1
then?"	1
	1
"If	1
so,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
serious	1
case.	1
Nothing	1
less	1
would	1
bring	1
a	1
man	1
out	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
hour.	1
But	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
crony	1
of	1
the	1
landlady's."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
wrong	1
in	1
his	1
conjecture,	1
however,	1
for	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
step	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
a	1
tapping	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
long	1
arm	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
lamp	1
away	1
from	1
himself	1
and	1
towards	1
the	1
vacant	1
chair	1
upon	1
which	1
a	1
newcomer	1
must	1
sit.	1
	1
"Come	1
in!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
entered	1
was	1
young,	1
some	1
two-and-twenty	1
at	1
the	1
outside,	1
well-groomed	1
and	1
trimly	1
clad,	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
refinement	1
and	1
delicacy	1
in	1
his	1
bearing.	1
The	1
streaming	1
umbrella	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
his	1
long	1
shining	1
waterproof	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
weather	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
come.	1
He	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
anxiously	1
in	1
the	1
glare	1
of	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
heavy,	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
weighed	1
down	1
with	1
some	1
great	1
anxiety.	1
	1
"I	1
owe	1
you	1
an	1
apology,"	1
he	1
said,	1
raising	1
his	1
golden	1
pince-nez	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
trust	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
intruding.	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
some	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
and	1
rain	1
into	1
your	1
snug	1
chamber."	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
your	1
coat	1
and	1
umbrella,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"They	1
may	1
rest	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
hook	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
dry	1
presently.	1
You	1
have	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
south-west,	1
I	1
see."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
from	1
Horsham."	1
	1
"That	1
clay	1
and	1
chalk	1
mixture	1
which	1
I	1
see	1
upon	1
your	1
toe	1
caps	1
is	1
quite	1
distinctive."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
for	1
advice."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
easily	1
got."	1
	1
"And	1
help."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
so	1
easy."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
heard	1
from	1
Major	1
Prendergast	1
how	1
you	1
saved	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Tankerville	1
Club	1
scandal."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
of	1
course.	1
He	1
was	1
wrongfully	1
accused	1
of	1
cheating	1
at	1
cards."	1
	1
"He	1
said	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
solve	1
anything."	1
	1
"He	1
said	1
too	1
much."	1
	1
"That	1
you	1
are	1
never	1
beaten."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
beaten	1
four	1
times--three	1
times	1
by	1
men,	1
and	1
once	1
by	1
a	1
woman."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
successes?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
generally	1
successful."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
draw	1
your	1
chair	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
favour	1
me	1
with	1
some	1
details	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
case."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
ordinary	1
one."	1
	1
"None	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
are.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
last	1
court	1
of	1
appeal."	1
	1
"And	1
yet	1
I	1
question,	1
sir,	1
whether,	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
experience,	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
listened	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
mysterious	1
and	1
inexplicable	1
chain	1
of	1
events	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
happened	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
family."	1
	1
"You	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
interest,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Pray	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
essential	1
facts	1
from	1
the	1
commencement,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
afterwards	1
question	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
details	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
important."	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
pulled	1
his	1
chair	1
up	1
and	1
pushed	1
his	1
wet	1
feet	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
blaze.	1
	1
"My	1
name,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"is	1
John	1
Openshaw,	1
but	1
my	1
own	1
affairs	1
have,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
understand,	1
little	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
awful	1
business.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
hereditary	1
matter;	1
so	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
facts,	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
affair.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
grandfather	1
had	1
two	1
sons--my	1
uncle	1
Elias	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
Joseph.	1
My	1
father	1
had	1
a	1
small	1
factory	1
at	1
Coventry,	1
which	1
he	1
enlarged	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
bicycling.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
patentee	1
of	1
the	1
Openshaw	1
unbreakable	1
tire,	1
and	1
his	1
business	1
met	1
with	1
such	1
success	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
sell	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
retire	1
upon	1
a	1
handsome	1
competence.	1
	1
"My	1
uncle	1
Elias	1
emigrated	1
to	1
America	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
became	1
a	1
planter	1
in	1
Florida,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
very	1
well.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
he	1
fought	1
in	1
Jackson's	1
army,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
under	1
Hood,	1
where	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
colonel.	1
When	1
Lee	1
laid	1
down	1
his	1
arms	1
my	1
uncle	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
plantation,	1
where	1
he	1
remained	1
for	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
years.	1
About	1
1869	1
or	1
1870	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
Europe	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
estate	1
in	1
Sussex,	1
near	1
Horsham.	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
fortune	1
in	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
his	1
reason	1
for	1
leaving	1
them	1
was	1
his	1
aversion	1
to	1
the	1
negroes,	1
and	1
his	1
dislike	1
of	1
the	1
Republican	1
policy	1
in	1
extending	1
the	1
franchise	1
to	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
singular	1
man,	1
fierce	1
and	1
quick-tempered,	1
very	1
foul-mouthed	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
angry,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
retiring	1
disposition.	1
During	1
all	1
the	1
years	1
that	1
he	1
lived	1
at	1
Horsham,	1
I	1
doubt	1
if	1
ever	1
he	1
set	1
foot	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
garden	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
fields	1
round	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
his	1
exercise,	1
though	1
very	1
often	1
for	1
weeks	1
on	1
end	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
leave	1
his	1
room.	1
He	1
drank	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
brandy	1
and	1
smoked	1
very	1
heavily,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
no	1
society	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
friends,	1
not	1
even	1
his	1
own	1
brother.	1
	1
"He	1
didn't	1
mind	1
me;	1
in	1
fact,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
first	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
youngster	1
of	1
twelve	1
or	1
so.	1
This	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1878,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
years	1
in	1
England.	1
He	1
begged	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
way.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
sober	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
playing	1
backgammon	1
and	1
draughts	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
me	1
his	1
representative	1
both	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
tradespeople,	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
sixteen	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
I	1
kept	1
all	1
the	1
keys	1
and	1
could	1
go	1
where	1
I	1
liked	1
and	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
liked,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
disturb	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
privacy.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
singular	1
exception,	1
however,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
single	1
room,	1
a	1
lumber-room	1
up	1
among	1
the	1
attics,	1
which	1
was	1
invariably	1
locked,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
permit	1
either	1
me	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
to	1
enter.	1
With	1
a	1
boy's	1
curiosity	1
I	1
have	1
peeped	1
through	1
the	1
keyhole,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
never	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
more	1
than	1
such	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
old	1
trunks	1
and	1
bundles	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
expected	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
room.	1
	1
"One	1
day--it	1
was	1
in	1
March,	1
1883--a	1
letter	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
stamp	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
colonel's	1
plate.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
common	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
receive	1
letters,	1
for	1
his	1
bills	1
were	1
all	1
paid	1
in	1
ready	1
money,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
friends	1
of	1
any	1
sort.	1
'From	1
India!'	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
'Pondicherry	1
postmark!	1
What	1
can	1
this	1
be?'	1
Opening	1
it	1
hurriedly,	1
out	1
there	1
jumped	1
five	1
little	1
dried	1
orange	1
pips,	1
which	1
pattered	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
plate.	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
this,	1
but	1
the	1
laugh	1
was	1
struck	1
from	1
my	1
lips	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
face.	1
His	1
lip	1
had	1
fallen,	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
protruding,	1
his	1
skin	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
putty,	1
and	1
he	1
glared	1
at	1
the	1
envelope	1
which	1
he	1
still	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
trembling	1
hand,	1
'K.	1
K.	1
K.!'	1
he	1
shrieked,	1
and	1
then,	1
'My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
my	1
sins	1
have	1
overtaken	1
me!'	1
	1
"'What	1
is	1
it,	1
uncle?'	1
I	1
cried.	1
	1
"'Death,'	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
retired	1
to	1
his	1
room,	1
leaving	1
me	1
palpitating	1
with	1
horror.	1
I	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
envelope	1
and	1
saw	1
scrawled	1
in	1
red	1
ink	1
upon	1
the	1
inner	1
flap,	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
gum,	1
the	1
letter	1
K	1
three	1
times	1
repeated.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
save	1
the	1
five	1
dried	1
pips.	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
overpowering	1
terror?	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
breakfast-table,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
ascended	1
the	1
stair	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
coming	1
down	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
rusty	1
key,	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
attic,	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
brass	1
box,	1
like	1
a	1
cashbox,	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"'They	1
may	1
do	1
what	1
they	1
like,	1
but	1
I'll	1
checkmate	1
them	1
still,'	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
an	1
oath.	1
'Tell	1
Mary	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
my	1
room	1
to-day,	1
and	1
send	1
down	1
to	1
Fordham,	1
the	1
Horsham	1
lawyer.'	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
ordered,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
lawyer	1
arrived	1
I	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
step	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
fire	1
was	1
burning	1
brightly,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
grate	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
black,	1
fluffy	1
ashes,	1
as	1
of	1
burned	1
paper,	1
while	1
the	1
brass	1
box	1
stood	1
open	1
and	1
empty	1
beside	1
it.	1
As	1
I	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
box	1
I	1
noticed,	1
with	1
a	1
start,	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
lid	1
was	1
printed	1
the	1
treble	1
K	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
upon	1
the	1
envelope.	1
	1
"'I	1
wish	1
you,	1
John,'	1
said	1
my	1
uncle,	1
'to	1
witness	1
my	1
will.	1
I	1
leave	1
my	1
estate,	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
advantages	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
disadvantages,	1
to	1
my	1
brother,	1
your	1
father,	1
whence	1
it	1
will,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
descend	1
to	1
you.	1
If	1
you	1
can	1
enjoy	1
it	1
in	1
peace,	1
well	1
and	1
good!	1
If	1
you	1
find	1
you	1
cannot,	1
take	1
my	1
advice,	1
my	1
boy,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
deadliest	1
enemy.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
such	1
a	1
two-edged	1
thing,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
say	1
what	1
turn	1
things	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
take.	1
Kindly	1
sign	1
the	1
paper	1
where	1
Mr.	1
Fordham	1
shows	1
you.'	1
	1
"I	1
signed	1
the	1
paper	1
as	1
directed,	1
and	1
the	1
lawyer	1
took	1
it	1
away	1
with	1
him.	1
The	1
singular	1
incident	1
made,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
think,	1
the	1
deepest	1
impression	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
pondered	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
every	1
way	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
anything	1
of	1
it.	1
Yet	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
dread	1
which	1
it	1
left	1
behind,	1
though	1
the	1
sensation	1
grew	1
less	1
keen	1
as	1
the	1
weeks	1
passed	1
and	1
nothing	1
happened	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
usual	1
routine	1
of	1
our	1
lives.	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
my	1
uncle,	1
however.	1
He	1
drank	1
more	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
less	1
inclined	1
for	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
society.	1
Most	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
he	1
would	1
spend	1
in	1
his	1
room,	1
with	1
the	1
door	1
locked	1
upon	1
the	1
inside,	1
but	1
sometimes	1
he	1
would	1
emerge	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
drunken	1
frenzy	1
and	1
would	1
burst	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
tear	1
about	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
a	1
revolver	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
screaming	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
no	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
cooped	1
up,	1
like	1
a	1
sheep	1
in	1
a	1
pen,	1
by	1
man	1
or	1
devil.	1
When	1
these	1
hot	1
fits	1
were	1
over,	1
however,	1
he	1
would	1
rush	1
tumultuously	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
lock	1
and	1
bar	1
it	1
behind	1
him,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
brazen	1
it	1
out	1
no	1
longer	1
against	1
the	1
terror	1
which	1
lies	1
at	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
his	1
soul.	1
At	1
such	1
times	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
face,	1
even	1
on	1
a	1
cold	1
day,	1
glisten	1
with	1
moisture,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
new	1
raised	1
from	1
a	1
basin.	1
	1
"Well,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
abuse	1
your	1
patience,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
drunken	1
sallies	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
came	1
back.	1
We	1
found	1
him,	1
when	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
him,	1
face	1
downward	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
green-scummed	1
pool,	1
which	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
but	1
two	1
feet	1
deep,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
jury,	1
having	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
known	1
eccentricity,	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
verdict	1
of	1
'suicide.'	1
But	1
I,	1
who	1
knew	1
how	1
he	1
winced	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
of	1
death,	1
had	1
much	1
ado	1
to	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
meet	1
it.	1
The	1
matter	1
passed,	1
however,	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
entered	1
into	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
estate,	1
and	1
of	1
some	1
14,000	1
pounds,	1
which	1
lay	1
to	1
his	1
credit	1
at	1
the	1
bank."	1
	1
"One	1
moment,"	1
Holmes	1
interposed,	1
"your	1
statement	1
is,	1
I	1
foresee,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
listened.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
the	1
reception	1
by	1
your	1
uncle	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
his	1
supposed	1
suicide."	1
	1
"The	1
letter	1
arrived	1
on	1
March	1
10,	1
1883.	1
His	1
death	1
was	1
seven	1
weeks	1
later,	1
upon	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
May	1
2nd."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
Pray	1
proceed."	1
	1
"When	1
my	1
father	1
took	1
over	1
the	1
Horsham	1
property,	1
he,	1
at	1
my	1
request,	1
made	1
a	1
careful	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
attic,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
locked	1
up.	1
We	1
found	1
the	1
brass	1
box	1
there,	1
although	1
its	1
contents	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
On	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
cover	1
was	1
a	1
paper	1
label,	1
with	1
the	1
initials	1
of	1
K.	1
K.	1
K.	1
repeated	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
'Letters,	1
memoranda,	1
receipts,	1
and	1
a	1
register'	1
written	1
beneath.	1
These,	1
we	1
presume,	1
indicated	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
papers	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
by	1
Colonel	1
Openshaw.	1
For	1
the	1
rest,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
of	1
much	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
attic	1
save	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
scattered	1
papers	1
and	1
note-books	1
bearing	1
upon	1
my	1
uncle's	1
life	1
in	1
America.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
time	1
and	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
his	1
duty	1
well	1
and	1
had	1
borne	1
the	1
repute	1
of	1
a	1
brave	1
soldier.	1
Others	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
date	1
during	1
the	1
reconstruction	1
of	1
the	1
Southern	1
states,	1
and	1
were	1
mostly	1
concerned	1
with	1
politics,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
taken	1
a	1
strong	1
part	1
in	1
opposing	1
the	1
carpet-bag	1
politicians	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
North.	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
'84	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
came	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
Horsham,	1
and	1
all	1
went	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
possible	1
with	1
us	1
until	1
the	1
January	1
of	1
'85.	1
On	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
new	1
year	1
I	1
heard	1
my	1
father	1
give	1
a	1
sharp	1
cry	1
of	1
surprise	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
breakfast-table.	1
There	1
he	1
was,	1
sitting	1
with	1
a	1
newly	1
opened	1
envelope	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
five	1
dried	1
orange	1
pips	1
in	1
the	1
outstretched	1
palm	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
one.	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
laughed	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
called	1
my	1
cock-and-bull	1
story	1
about	1
the	1
colonel,	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
scared	1
and	1
puzzled	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
himself.	1
	1
"'Why,	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
does	1
this	1
mean,	1
John?'	1
he	1
stammered.	1
	1
"My	1
heart	1
had	1
turned	1
to	1
lead.	1
'It	1
is	1
K.	1
K.	1
K.,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"He	1
looked	1
inside	1
the	1
envelope.	1
'So	1
it	1
is,'	1
he	1
cried.	1
'Here	1
are	1
the	1
very	1
letters.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
written	1
above	1
them?'	1
	1
"'Put	1
the	1
papers	1
on	1
the	1
sundial,'	1
I	1
read,	1
peeping	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"'What	1
papers?	1
What	1
sundial?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'The	1
sundial	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
other,'	1
said	1
I;	1
'but	1
the	1
papers	1
must	1
be	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
destroyed.'	1
	1
"'Pooh!'	1
said	1
he,	1
gripping	1
hard	1
at	1
his	1
courage.	1
'We	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
civilised	1
land	1
here,	1
and	1
we	1
can't	1
have	1
tomfoolery	1
of	1
this	1
kind.	1
Where	1
does	1
the	1
thing	1
come	1
from?'	1
	1
"'From	1
Dundee,'	1
I	1
answered,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
postmark.	1
	1
"'Some	1
preposterous	1
practical	1
joke,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
sundials	1
and	1
papers?	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
such	1
nonsense.'	1
	1
"'I	1
should	1
certainly	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
police,'	1
I	1
said.	1
	1
"'And	1
be	1
laughed	1
at	1
for	1
my	1
pains.	1
Nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort.'	1
	1
"'Then	1
let	1
me	1
do	1
so?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
forbid	1
you.	1
I	1
won't	1
have	1
a	1
fuss	1
made	1
about	1
such	1
nonsense.'	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
argue	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
obstinate	1
man.	1
I	1
went	1
about,	1
however,	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
forebodings.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
my	1
father	1
went	1
from	1
home	1
to	1
visit	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
his,	1
Major	1
Freebody,	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
forts	1
upon	1
Portsdown	1
Hill.	1
I	1
was	1
glad	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
farther	1
from	1
danger	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
away	1
from	1
home.	1
In	1
that,	1
however,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
error.	1
Upon	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
I	1
received	1
a	1
telegram	1
from	1
the	1
major,	1
imploring	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
once.	1
My	1
father	1
had	1
fallen	1
over	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
chalk-pits	1
which	1
abound	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
was	1
lying	1
senseless,	1
with	1
a	1
shattered	1
skull.	1
I	1
hurried	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
passed	1
away	1
without	1
having	1
ever	1
recovered	1
his	1
consciousness.	1
He	1
had,	1
as	1
it	1
appears,	1
been	1
returning	1
from	1
Fareham	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
unknown	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
chalk-pit	1
unfenced,	1
the	1
jury	1
had	1
no	1
hesitation	1
in	1
bringing	1
in	1
a	1
verdict	1
of	1
'death	1
from	1
accidental	1
causes.'	1
Carefully	1
as	1
I	1
examined	1
every	1
fact	1
connected	1
with	1
his	1
death,	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
anything	1
which	1
could	1
suggest	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
murder.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
violence,	1
no	1
footmarks,	1
no	1
robbery,	1
no	1
record	1
of	1
strangers	1
having	1
been	1
seen	1
upon	1
the	1
roads.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
well-nigh	1
certain	1
that	1
some	1
foul	1
plot	1
had	1
been	1
woven	1
round	1
him.	1
	1
"In	1
this	1
sinister	1
way	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
inheritance.	1
You	1
will	1
ask	1
me	1
why	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
dispose	1
of	1
it?	1
I	1
answer,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
well	1
convinced	1
that	1
our	1
troubles	1
were	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
dependent	1
upon	1
an	1
incident	1
in	1
my	1
uncle's	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
danger	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
pressing	1
in	1
one	1
house	1
as	1
in	1
another.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
in	1
January,	1
'85,	1
that	1
my	1
poor	1
father	1
met	1
his	1
end,	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
and	1
eight	1
months	1
have	1
elapsed	1
since	1
then.	1
During	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
happily	1
at	1
Horsham,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
this	1
curse	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
ended	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
generation.	1
I	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
take	1
comfort	1
too	1
soon,	1
however;	1
yesterday	1
morning	1
the	1
blow	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
shape	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
father."	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
a	1
crumpled	1
envelope,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
shook	1
out	1
upon	1
it	1
five	1
little	1
dried	1
orange	1
pips.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
envelope,"	1
he	1
continued.	1
"The	1
postmark	1
is	1
London--eastern	1
division.	1
Within	1
are	1
the	1
very	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
my	1
father's	1
last	1
message:	1
'K.	1
K.	1
K.';	1
and	1
then	1
'Put	1
the	1
papers	1
on	1
the	1
sundial.'"	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
done?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Nothing."	1
	1
"Nothing?"	1
	1
"To	1
tell	1
the	1
truth"--he	1
sank	1
his	1
face	1
into	1
his	1
thin,	1
white	1
hands--"I	1
have	1
felt	1
helpless.	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
poor	1
rabbits	1
when	1
the	1
snake	1
is	1
writhing	1
towards	1
it.	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
some	1
resistless,	1
inexorable	1
evil,	1
which	1
no	1
foresight	1
and	1
no	1
precautions	1
can	1
guard	1
against."	1
	1
"Tut!	1
tut!"	1
cried	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
"You	1
must	1
act,	1
man,	1
or	1
you	1
are	1
lost.	1
Nothing	1
but	1
energy	1
can	1
save	1
you.	1
This	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
despair."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
police."	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
listened	1
to	1
my	1
story	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
inspector	1
has	1
formed	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
letters	1
are	1
all	1
practical	1
jokes,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
my	1
relations	1
were	1
really	1
accidents,	1
as	1
the	1
jury	1
stated,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
warnings."	1
	1
Holmes	1
shook	1
his	1
clenched	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
"Incredible	1
imbecility!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
"They	1
have,	1
however,	1
allowed	1
me	1
a	1
policeman,	1
who	1
may	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"Has	1
he	1
come	1
with	1
you	1
to-night?"	1
	1
"No.	1
His	1
orders	1
were	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
house."	1
	1
Again	1
Holmes	1
raved	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"and,	1
above	1
all,	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
once?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
to-day	1
that	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
Major	1
Prendergast	1
about	1
my	1
troubles	1
and	1
was	1
advised	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
really	1
two	1
days	1
since	1
you	1
had	1
the	1
letter.	1
We	1
should	1
have	1
acted	1
before	1
this.	1
You	1
have	1
no	1
further	1
evidence,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
placed	1
before	1
us--no	1
suggestive	1
detail	1
which	1
might	1
help	1
us?"	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing,"	1
said	1
John	1
Openshaw.	1
He	1
rummaged	1
in	1
his	1
coat	1
pocket,	1
and,	1
drawing	1
out	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
discoloured,	1
blue-tinted	1
paper,	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
"I	1
have	1
some	1
remembrance,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
my	1
uncle	1
burned	1
the	1
papers	1
I	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
small,	1
unburned	1
margins	1
which	1
lay	1
amid	1
the	1
ashes	1
were	1
of	1
this	1
particular	1
colour.	1
I	1
found	1
this	1
single	1
sheet	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
his	1
room,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
papers	1
which	1
has,	1
perhaps,	1
fluttered	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
has	1
escaped	1
destruction.	1
Beyond	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
pips,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
helps	1
us	1
much.	1
I	1
think	1
myself	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
page	1
from	1
some	1
private	1
diary.	1
The	1
writing	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
my	1
uncle's."	1
	1
Holmes	1
moved	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
we	1
both	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper,	1
which	1
showed	1
by	1
its	1
ragged	1
edge	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
indeed	1
been	1
torn	1
from	1
a	1
book.	1
It	1
was	1
headed,	1
"March,	1
1869,"	1
and	1
beneath	1
were	1
the	1
following	1
enigmatical	1
notices:	1
	1
"4th.	1
Hudson	1
came.	1
Same	1
old	1
platform.	1
	1
"7th.	1
Set	1
the	1
pips	1
on	1
McCauley,	1
Paramore,	1
and	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
John	1
Swain,	1
of	1
St.	1
Augustine.	1
	1
"9th.	1
McCauley	1
cleared.	1
	1
"10th.	1
John	1
Swain	1
cleared.	1
	1
"12th.	1
Visited	1
Paramore.	1
All	1
well."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you!"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
folding	1
up	1
the	1
paper	1
and	1
returning	1
it	1
to	1
our	1
visitor.	1
"And	1
now	1
you	1
must	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
lose	1
another	1
instant.	1
We	1
cannot	1
spare	1
time	1
even	1
to	1
discuss	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me.	1
You	1
must	1
get	1
home	1
instantly	1
and	1
act."	1
	1
"What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?"	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
do.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
at	1
once.	1
You	1
must	1
put	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
paper	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
shown	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
brass	1
box	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
described.	1
You	1
must	1
also	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
papers	1
were	1
burned	1
by	1
your	1
uncle,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
which	1
remains.	1
You	1
must	1
assert	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
words	1
as	1
will	1
carry	1
conviction	1
with	1
them.	1
Having	1
done	1
this,	1
you	1
must	1
at	1
once	1
put	1
the	1
box	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
sundial,	1
as	1
directed.	1
Do	1
you	1
understand?"	1
	1
"Entirely."	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
revenge,	1
or	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
at	1
present.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
gain	1
that	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
web	1
to	1
weave,	1
while	1
theirs	1
is	1
already	1
woven.	1
The	1
first	1
consideration	1
is	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
pressing	1
danger	1
which	1
threatens	1
you.	1
The	1
second	1
is	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
the	1
mystery	1
and	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
guilty	1
parties."	1
	1
"I	1
thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
rising	1
and	1
pulling	1
on	1
his	1
overcoat.	1
"You	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
fresh	1
life	1
and	1
hope.	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
advise."	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
lose	1
an	1
instant.	1
And,	1
above	1
all,	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile,	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
doubt	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
threatened	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
real	1
and	1
imminent	1
danger.	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
go	1
back?"	1
	1
"By	1
train	1
from	1
Waterloo."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
nine.	1
The	1
streets	1
will	1
be	1
crowded,	1
so	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
safety.	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
cannot	1
guard	1
yourself	1
too	1
closely."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
armed."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
well.	1
To-morrow	1
I	1
shall	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
upon	1
your	1
case."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
Horsham,	1
then?"	1
	1
"No,	1
your	1
secret	1
lies	1
in	1
London.	1
It	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
seek	1
it."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
day,	1
or	1
in	1
two	1
days,	1
with	1
news	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
the	1
papers.	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
your	1
advice	1
in	1
every	1
particular."	1
He	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
leave.	1
Outside	1
the	1
wind	1
still	1
screamed	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
splashed	1
and	1
pattered	1
against	1
the	1
windows.	1
This	1
strange,	1
wild	1
story	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
mad	1
elements--blown	1
in	1
upon	1
us	1
like	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
sea-weed	1
in	1
a	1
gale--and	1
now	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
reabsorbed	1
by	1
them	1
once	1
more.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
silence,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
forward	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
bent	1
upon	1
the	1
red	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
Then	1
he	1
lit	1
his	1
pipe,	1
and	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
he	1
watched	1
the	1
blue	1
smoke-rings	1
as	1
they	1
chased	1
each	1
other	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
	1
"I	1
think,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
at	1
last,	1
"that	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
cases	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
none	1
more	1
fantastic	1
than	1
this."	1
	1
"Save,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
Sign	1
of	1
Four."	1
	1
"Well,	1
yes.	1
Save,	1
perhaps,	1
that.	1
And	1
yet	1
this	1
John	1
Openshaw	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
walking	1
amid	1
even	1
greater	1
perils	1
than	1
did	1
the	1
Sholtos."	1
	1
"But	1
have	1
you,"	1
I	1
asked,	1
"formed	1
any	1
definite	1
conception	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
these	1
perils	1
are?"	1
	1
"There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
nature,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
	1
"Then	1
what	1
are	1
they?	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
K.	1
K.	1
K.,	1
and	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
pursue	1
this	1
unhappy	1
family?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
placed	1
his	1
elbows	1
upon	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
finger-tips	1
together.	1
"The	1
ideal	1
reasoner,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"would,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
shown	1
a	1
single	1
fact	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
bearings,	1
deduce	1
from	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
all	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
events	1
which	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
results	1
which	1
would	1
follow	1
from	1
it.	1
As	1
Cuvier	1
could	1
correctly	1
describe	1
a	1
whole	1
animal	1
by	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
bone,	1
so	1
the	1
observer	1
who	1
has	1
thoroughly	1
understood	1
one	1
link	1
in	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
incidents	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
accurately	1
state	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
ones,	1
both	1
before	1
and	1
after.	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
grasped	1
the	1
results	1
which	1
the	1
reason	1
alone	1
can	1
attain	1
to.	1
Problems	1
may	1
be	1
solved	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
which	1
have	1
baffled	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
sought	1
a	1
solution	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
their	1
senses.	1
To	1
carry	1
the	1
art,	1
however,	1
to	1
its	1
highest	1
pitch,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
reasoner	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
utilise	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
which	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
knowledge;	1
and	1
this	1
in	1
itself	1
implies,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
readily	1
see,	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
knowledge,	1
which,	1
even	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
free	1
education	1
and	1
encyclopaedias,	1
is	1
a	1
somewhat	1
rare	1
accomplishment.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
impossible,	1
however,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
possess	1
all	1
knowledge	1
which	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
in	1
my	1
case	1
to	1
do.	1
If	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly,	1
you	1
on	1
one	1
occasion,	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
friendship,	1
defined	1
my	1
limits	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
precise	1
fashion."	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
I	1
answered,	1
laughing.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
singular	1
document.	1
Philosophy,	1
astronomy,	1
and	1
politics	1
were	1
marked	1
at	1
zero,	1
I	1
remember.	1
Botany	1
variable,	1
geology	1
profound	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
mud-stains	1
from	1
any	1
region	1
within	1
fifty	1
miles	1
of	1
town,	1
chemistry	1
eccentric,	1
anatomy	1
unsystematic,	1
sensational	1
literature	1
and	1
crime	1
records	1
unique,	1
violin-player,	1
boxer,	1
swordsman,	1
lawyer,	1
and	1
self-poisoner	1
by	1
cocaine	1
and	1
tobacco.	1
Those,	1
I	1
think,	1
were	1
the	1
main	1
points	1
of	1
my	1
analysis."	1
	1
Holmes	1
grinned	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
item.	1
"Well,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
say	1
now,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
then,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
keep	1
his	1
little	1
brain-attic	1
stocked	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
use,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
he	1
can	1
put	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
lumber-room	1
of	1
his	1
library,	1
where	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
it	1
if	1
he	1
wants	1
it.	1
Now,	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
submitted	1
to	1
us	1
to-night,	1
we	1
need	1
certainly	1
to	1
muster	1
all	1
our	1
resources.	1
Kindly	1
hand	1
me	1
down	1
the	1
letter	1
K	1
of	1
the	1
'American	1
Encyclopaedia'	1
which	1
stands	1
upon	1
the	1
shelf	1
beside	1
you.	1
Thank	1
you.	1
Now	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
the	1
situation	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
deduced	1
from	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
we	1
may	1
start	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
presumption	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Openshaw	1
had	1
some	1
very	1
strong	1
reason	1
for	1
leaving	1
America.	1
Men	1
at	1
his	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
do	1
not	1
change	1
all	1
their	1
habits	1
and	1
exchange	1
willingly	1
the	1
charming	1
climate	1
of	1
Florida	1
for	1
the	1
lonely	1
life	1
of	1
an	1
English	1
provincial	1
town.	1
His	1
extreme	1
love	1
of	1
solitude	1
in	1
England	1
suggests	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
someone	1
or	1
something,	1
so	1
we	1
may	1
assume	1
as	1
a	1
working	1
hypothesis	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
fear	1
of	1
someone	1
or	1
something	1
which	1
drove	1
him	1
from	1
America.	1
As	1
to	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
feared,	1
we	1
can	1
only	1
deduce	1
that	1
by	1
considering	1
the	1
formidable	1
letters	1
which	1
were	1
received	1
by	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
successors.	1
Did	1
you	1
remark	1
the	1
postmarks	1
of	1
those	1
letters?"	1
	1
"The	1
first	1
was	1
from	1
Pondicherry,	1
the	1
second	1
from	1
Dundee,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
from	1
London."	1
	1
"From	1
East	1
London.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
deduce	1
from	1
that?"	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
seaports.	1
That	1
the	1
writer	1
was	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
a	1
ship."	1
	1
"Excellent.	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
a	1
clue.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
probability--the	1
strong	1
probability--is	1
that	1
the	1
writer	1
was	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
a	1
ship.	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
another	1
point.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Pondicherry,	1
seven	1
weeks	1
elapsed	1
between	1
the	1
threat	1
and	1
its	1
fulfilment,	1
in	1
Dundee	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
some	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days.	1
Does	1
that	1
suggest	1
anything?"	1
	1
"A	1
greater	1
distance	1
to	1
travel."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
letter	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
greater	1
distance	1
to	1
come."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
point."	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
presumption	1
that	1
the	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
or	1
men	1
are	1
is	1
a	1
sailing-ship.	1
It	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
always	1
send	1
their	1
singular	1
warning	1
or	1
token	1
before	1
them	1
when	1
starting	1
upon	1
their	1
mission.	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
quickly	1
the	1
deed	1
followed	1
the	1
sign	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
Dundee.	1
If	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Pondicherry	1
in	1
a	1
steamer	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
arrived	1
almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
their	1
letter.	1
But,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact,	1
seven	1
weeks	1
elapsed.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
those	1
seven	1
weeks	1
represented	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
mail-boat	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
the	1
sailing	1
vessel	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
writer."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"More	1
than	1
that.	1
It	1
is	1
probable.	1
And	1
now	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
deadly	1
urgency	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
case,	1
and	1
why	1
I	1
urged	1
young	1
Openshaw	1
to	1
caution.	1
The	1
blow	1
has	1
always	1
fallen	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
senders	1
to	1
travel	1
the	1
distance.	1
But	1
this	1
one	1
comes	1
from	1
London,	1
and	1
therefore	1
we	1
cannot	1
count	1
upon	1
delay."	1
	1
"Good	1
God!"	1
I	1
cried.	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
mean,	1
this	1
relentless	1
persecution?"	1
	1
"The	1
papers	1
which	1
Openshaw	1
carried	1
are	1
obviously	1
of	1
vital	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
person	1
or	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
sailing-ship.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
clear	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
A	1
single	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
carried	1
out	1
two	1
deaths	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
deceive	1
a	1
coroner's	1
jury.	1
There	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
several	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
men	1
of	1
resource	1
and	1
determination.	1
Their	1
papers	1
they	1
mean	1
to	1
have,	1
be	1
the	1
holder	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
it	1
may.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
you	1
see	1
K.	1
K.	1
K.	1
ceases	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
initials	1
of	1
an	1
individual	1
and	1
becomes	1
the	1
badge	1
of	1
a	1
society."	1
	1
"But	1
of	1
what	1
society?"	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
never--"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
sinking	1
his	1
voice--"have	1
you	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
Ku	1
Klux	1
Klan?"	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
have."	1
	1
Holmes	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
upon	1
his	1
knee.	1
"Here	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
he	1
presently:	1
	1
"'Ku	1
Klux	1
Klan.	1
A	1
name	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
fanciful	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
produced	1
by	1
cocking	1
a	1
rifle.	1
This	1
terrible	1
secret	1
society	1
was	1
formed	1
by	1
some	1
ex-Confederate	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
Southern	1
states	1
after	1
the	1
Civil	1
War,	1
and	1
it	1
rapidly	1
formed	1
local	1
branches	1
in	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
notably	1
in	1
Tennessee,	1
Louisiana,	1
the	1
Carolinas,	1
Georgia,	1
and	1
Florida.	1
Its	1
power	1
was	1
used	1
for	1
political	1
purposes,	1
principally	1
for	1
the	1
terrorising	1
of	1
the	1
negro	1
voters	1
and	1
the	1
murdering	1
and	1
driving	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
opposed	1
to	1
its	1
views.	1
Its	1
outrages	1
were	1
usually	1
preceded	1
by	1
a	1
warning	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
marked	1
man	1
in	1
some	1
fantastic	1
but	1
generally	1
recognised	1
shape--a	1
sprig	1
of	1
oak-leaves	1
in	1
some	1
parts,	1
melon	1
seeds	1
or	1
orange	1
pips	1
in	1
others.	1
On	1
receiving	1
this	1
the	1
victim	1
might	1
either	1
openly	1
abjure	1
his	1
former	1
ways,	1
or	1
might	1
fly	1
from	1
the	1
country.	1
If	1
he	1
braved	1
the	1
matter	1
out,	1
death	1
would	1
unfailingly	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
usually	1
in	1
some	1
strange	1
and	1
unforeseen	1
manner.	1
So	1
perfect	1
was	1
the	1
organisation	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
and	1
so	1
systematic	1
its	1
methods,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
case	1
upon	1
record	1
where	1
any	1
man	1
succeeded	1
in	1
braving	1
it	1
with	1
impunity,	1
or	1
in	1
which	1
any	1
of	1
its	1
outrages	1
were	1
traced	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
perpetrators.	1
For	1
some	1
years	1
the	1
organisation	1
flourished	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
government	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
better	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
in	1
the	1
South.	1
Eventually,	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1869,	1
the	1
movement	1
rather	1
suddenly	1
collapsed,	1
although	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
sporadic	1
outbreaks	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
since	1
that	1
date.'	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
observe,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
volume,	1
"that	1
the	1
sudden	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
was	1
coincident	1
with	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
Openshaw	1
from	1
America	1
with	1
their	1
papers.	1
It	1
may	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
cause	1
and	1
effect.	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
have	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
implacable	1
spirits	1
upon	1
their	1
track.	1
You	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
this	1
register	1
and	1
diary	1
may	1
implicate	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
South,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
many	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
sleep	1
easy	1
at	1
night	1
until	1
it	1
is	1
recovered."	1
	1
"Then	1
the	1
page	1
we	1
have	1
seen--"	1
	1
"Is	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
might	1
expect.	1
It	1
ran,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
right,	1
'sent	1
the	1
pips	1
to	1
A,	1
B,	1
and	1
C'--that	1
is,	1
sent	1
the	1
society's	1
warning	1
to	1
them.	1
Then	1
there	1
are	1
successive	1
entries	1
that	1
A	1
and	1
B	1
cleared,	1
or	1
left	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
finally	1
that	1
C	1
was	1
visited,	1
with,	1
I	1
fear,	1
a	1
sinister	1
result	1
for	1
C.	1
Well,	1
I	1
think,	1
Doctor,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
let	1
some	1
light	1
into	1
this	1
dark	1
place,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
chance	1
young	1
Openshaw	1
has	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
him.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to-night,	1
so	1
hand	1
me	1
over	1
my	1
violin	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
forget	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1
miserable	1
weather	1
and	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
miserable	1
ways	1
of	1
our	1
fellow-men."	1
	1
	1
It	1
had	1
cleared	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
shining	1
with	1
a	1
subdued	1
brightness	1
through	1
the	1
dim	1
veil	1
which	1
hangs	1
over	1
the	1
great	1
city.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
already	1
at	1
breakfast	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
down.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
me	1
for	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"I	1
have,	1
I	1
foresee,	1
a	1
very	1
busy	1
day	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
looking	1
into	1
this	1
case	1
of	1
young	1
Openshaw's."	1
	1
"What	1
steps	1
will	1
you	1
take?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"It	1
will	1
very	1
much	1
depend	1
upon	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
my	1
first	1
inquiries.	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Horsham,	1
after	1
all."	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
there	1
first?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
shall	1
commence	1
with	1
the	1
City.	1
Just	1
ring	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
your	1
coffee."	1
	1
As	1
I	1
waited,	1
I	1
lifted	1
the	1
unopened	1
newspaper	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
glanced	1
my	1
eye	1
over	1
it.	1
It	1
rested	1
upon	1
a	1
heading	1
which	1
sent	1
a	1
chill	1
to	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
"Holmes,"	1
I	1
cried,	1
"you	1
are	1
too	1
late."	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
he,	1
laying	1
down	1
his	1
cup,	1
"I	1
feared	1
as	1
much.	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
done?"	1
He	1
spoke	1
calmly,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
deeply	1
moved.	1
	1
"My	1
eye	1
caught	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Openshaw,	1
and	1
the	1
heading	1
'Tragedy	1
Near	1
Waterloo	1
Bridge.'	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
account:	1
	1
"Between	1
nine	1
and	1
ten	1
last	1
night	1
Police-Constable	1
Cook,	1
of	1
the	1
H	1
Division,	1
on	1
duty	1
near	1
Waterloo	1
Bridge,	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
for	1
help	1
and	1
a	1
splash	1
in	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
night,	1
however,	1
was	1
extremely	1
dark	1
and	1
stormy,	1
so	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
several	1
passers-by,	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
impossible	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
rescue.	1
The	1
alarm,	1
however,	1
was	1
given,	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
water-police,	1
the	1
body	1
was	1
eventually	1
recovered.	1
It	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
gentleman	1
whose	1
name,	1
as	1
it	1
appears	1
from	1
an	1
envelope	1
which	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
was	1
John	1
Openshaw,	1
and	1
whose	1
residence	1
is	1
near	1
Horsham.	1
It	1
is	1
conjectured	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
hurrying	1
down	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
last	1
train	1
from	1
Waterloo	1
Station,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
haste	1
and	1
the	1
extreme	1
darkness	1
he	1
missed	1
his	1
path	1
and	1
walked	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
landing-places	1
for	1
river	1
steamboats.	1
The	1
body	1
exhibited	1
no	1
traces	1
of	1
violence,	1
and	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
deceased	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
accident,	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
calling	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
authorities	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
riverside	1
landing-stages."	1
	1
We	1
sat	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
minutes,	1
Holmes	1
more	1
depressed	1
and	1
shaken	1
than	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
"That	1
hurts	1
my	1
pride,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
petty	1
feeling,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
but	1
it	1
hurts	1
my	1
pride.	1
It	1
becomes	1
a	1
personal	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
now,	1
and,	1
if	1
God	1
sends	1
me	1
health,	1
I	1
shall	1
set	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
this	1
gang.	1
That	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
help,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
send	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
death--!"	1
He	1
sprang	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
paced	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
uncontrollable	1
agitation,	1
with	1
a	1
flush	1
upon	1
his	1
sallow	1
cheeks	1
and	1
a	1
nervous	1
clasping	1
and	1
unclasping	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
thin	1
hands.	1
	1
"They	1
must	1
be	1
cunning	1
devils,"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
last.	1
"How	1
could	1
they	1
have	1
decoyed	1
him	1
down	1
there?	1
The	1
Embankment	1
is	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
direct	1
line	1
to	1
the	1
station.	1
The	1
bridge,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
was	1
too	1
crowded,	1
even	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
night,	1
for	1
their	1
purpose.	1
Well,	1
Watson,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
who	1
will	1
win	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
run.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
out	1
now!"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
police?"	1
	1
"No;	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
own	1
police.	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
spun	1
the	1
web	1
they	1
may	1
take	1
the	1
flies,	1
but	1
not	1
before."	1
	1
All	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
my	1
professional	1
work,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
I	1
returned	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
yet.	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
before	1
he	1
entered,	1
looking	1
pale	1
and	1
worn.	1
He	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
and	1
tearing	1
a	1
piece	1
from	1
the	1
loaf	1
he	1
devoured	1
it	1
voraciously,	1
washing	1
it	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
draught	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
hungry,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Starving.	1
It	1
had	1
escaped	1
my	1
memory.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
since	1
breakfast."	1
	1
"Nothing?"	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
bite.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
succeeded?"	1
	1
"Well."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
clue?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
Young	1
Openshaw	1
shall	1
not	1
long	1
remain	1
unavenged.	1
Why,	1
Watson,	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
their	1
own	1
devilish	1
trade-mark	1
upon	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
thought	1
of!"	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
	1
He	1
took	1
an	1
orange	1
from	1
the	1
cupboard,	1
and	1
tearing	1
it	1
to	1
pieces	1
he	1
squeezed	1
out	1
the	1
pips	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
Of	1
these	1
he	1
took	1
five	1
and	1
thrust	1
them	1
into	1
an	1
envelope.	1
On	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
flap	1
he	1
wrote	1
"S.	1
H.	1
for	1
J.	1
O."	1
Then	1
he	1
sealed	1
it	1
and	1
addressed	1
it	1
to	1
"Captain	1
James	1
Calhoun,	1
Barque	1
'Lone	1
Star,'	1
Savannah,	1
Georgia."	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
await	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
enters	1
port,"	1
said	1
he,	1
chuckling.	1
"It	1
may	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night.	1
He	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
as	1
sure	1
a	1
precursor	1
of	1
his	1
fate	1
as	1
Openshaw	1
did	1
before	1
him."	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
Captain	1
Calhoun?"	1
	1
"The	1
leader	1
of	1
the	1
gang.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
others,	1
but	1
he	1
first."	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
trace	1
it,	1
then?"	1
	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
large	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
from	1
his	1
pocket,	1
all	1
covered	1
with	1
dates	1
and	1
names.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
day,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"over	1
Lloyd's	1
registers	1
and	1
files	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
papers,	1
following	1
the	1
future	1
career	1
of	1
every	1
vessel	1
which	1
touched	1
at	1
Pondicherry	1
in	1
January	1
and	1
February	1
in	1
'83.	1
There	1
were	1
thirty-six	1
ships	1
of	1
fair	1
tonnage	1
which	1
were	1
reported	1
there	1
during	1
those	1
months.	1
Of	1
these,	1
one,	1
the	1
'Lone	1
Star,'	1
instantly	1
attracted	1
my	1
attention,	1
since,	1
although	1
it	1
was	1
reported	1
as	1
having	1
cleared	1
from	1
London,	1
the	1
name	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
states	1
of	1
the	1
Union."	1
	1
"Texas,	1
I	1
think."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
and	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
which;	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
must	1
have	1
an	1
American	1
origin."	1
	1
"What	1
then?"	1
	1
"I	1
searched	1
the	1
Dundee	1
records,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
barque	1
'Lone	1
Star'	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
January,	1
'85,	1
my	1
suspicion	1
became	1
a	1
certainty.	1
I	1
then	1
inquired	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
vessels	1
which	1
lay	1
at	1
present	1
in	1
the	1
port	1
of	1
London."	1
	1
"Yes?"	1
	1
"The	1
'Lone	1
Star'	1
had	1
arrived	1
here	1
last	1
week.	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Albert	1
Dock	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
down	1
the	1
river	1
by	1
the	1
early	1
tide	1
this	1
morning,	1
homeward	1
bound	1
to	1
Savannah.	1
I	1
wired	1
to	1
Gravesend	1
and	1
learned	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
some	1
time	1
ago,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
easterly	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
past	1
the	1
Goodwins	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
Wight."	1
	1
"What	1
will	1
you	1
do,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
him.	1
He	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
mates,	1
are	1
as	1
I	1
learn,	1
the	1
only	1
native-born	1
Americans	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
The	1
others	1
are	1
Finns	1
and	1
Germans.	1
I	1
know,	1
also,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
three	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
last	1
night.	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
stevedore	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
loading	1
their	1
cargo.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
their	1
sailing-ship	1
reaches	1
Savannah	1
the	1
mail-boat	1
will	1
have	1
carried	1
this	1
letter,	1
and	1
the	1
cable	1
will	1
have	1
informed	1
the	1
police	1
of	1
Savannah	1
that	1
these	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
badly	1
wanted	1
here	1
upon	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
murder."	1
	1
There	1
is	1
ever	1
a	1
flaw,	1
however,	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
laid	1
of	1
human	1
plans,	1
and	1
the	1
murderers	1
of	1
John	1
Openshaw	1
were	1
never	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
orange	1
pips	1
which	1
would	1
show	1
them	1
that	1
another,	1
as	1
cunning	1
and	1
as	1
resolute	1
as	1
themselves,	1
was	1
upon	1
their	1
track.	1
Very	1
long	1
and	1
very	1
severe	1
were	1
the	1
equinoctial	1
gales	1
that	1
year.	1
We	1
waited	1
long	1
for	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
"Lone	1
Star"	1
of	1
Savannah,	1
but	1
none	1
ever	1
reached	1
us.	1
We	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
hear	1
that	1
somewhere	1
far	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
a	1
shattered	1
stern-post	1
of	1
a	1
boat	1
was	1
seen	1
swinging	1
in	1
the	1
trough	1
of	1
a	1
wave,	1
with	1
the	1
letters	1
"L.	1
S."	1
carved	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
ever	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
"Lone	1
Star."	1

	1
ADVENTURE	1
VI.	1
THE	1
MAN	1
WITH	1
THE	1
TWISTED	1
LIP	1
	1
Isa	1
Whitney,	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Elias	1
Whitney,	1
D.D.,	1
Principal	1
of	1
the	1
Theological	1
College	1
of	1
St.	1
George's,	1
was	1
much	1
addicted	1
to	1
opium.	1
The	1
habit	1
grew	1
upon	1
him,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
from	1
some	1
foolish	1
freak	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
college;	1
for	1
having	1
read	1
De	1
Quincey's	1
description	1
of	1
his	1
dreams	1
and	1
sensations,	1
he	1
had	1
drenched	1
his	1
tobacco	1
with	1
laudanum	1
in	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
same	1
effects.	1
He	1
found,	1
as	1
so	1
many	1
more	1
have	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
practice	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
attain	1
than	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of,	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
the	1
drug,	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
mingled	1
horror	1
and	1
pity	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
relatives.	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
him	1
now,	1
with	1
yellow,	1
pasty	1
face,	1
drooping	1
lids,	1
and	1
pin-point	1
pupils,	1
all	1
huddled	1
in	1
a	1
chair,	1
the	1
wreck	1
and	1
ruin	1
of	1
a	1
noble	1
man.	1
	1
One	1
night--it	1
was	1
in	1
June,	1
'89--there	1
came	1
a	1
ring	1
to	1
my	1
bell,	1
about	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
gives	1
his	1
first	1
yawn	1
and	1
glances	1
at	1
the	1
clock.	1
I	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
chair,	1
and	1
my	1
wife	1
laid	1
her	1
needle-work	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
lap	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
face	1
of	1
disappointment.	1
	1
"A	1
patient!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"You'll	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
out."	1
	1
I	1
groaned,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
newly	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
a	1
weary	1
day.	1
	1
We	1
heard	1
the	1
door	1
open,	1
a	1
few	1
hurried	1
words,	1
and	1
then	1
quick	1
steps	1
upon	1
the	1
linoleum.	1
Our	1
own	1
door	1
flew	1
open,	1
and	1
a	1
lady,	1
clad	1
in	1
some	1
dark-coloured	1
stuff,	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
veil,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
calling	1
so	1
late,"	1
she	1
began,	1
and	1
then,	1
suddenly	1
losing	1
her	1
self-control,	1
she	1
ran	1
forward,	1
threw	1
her	1
arms	1
about	1
my	1
wife's	1
neck,	1
and	1
sobbed	1
upon	1
her	1
shoulder.	1
"Oh,	1
I'm	1
in	1
such	1
trouble!"	1
she	1
cried;	1
"I	1
do	1
so	1
want	1
a	1
little	1
help."	1
	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
my	1
wife,	1
pulling	1
up	1
her	1
veil,	1
"it	1
is	1
Kate	1
Whitney.	1
How	1
you	1
startled	1
me,	1
Kate!	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
an	1
idea	1
who	1
you	1
were	1
when	1
you	1
came	1
in."	1
	1
"I	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
so	1
I	1
came	1
straight	1
to	1
you."	1
That	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
way.	1
Folk	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
grief	1
came	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
like	1
birds	1
to	1
a	1
light-house.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
very	1
sweet	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come.	1
Now,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
wine	1
and	1
water,	1
and	1
sit	1
here	1
comfortably	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
Or	1
should	1
you	1
rather	1
that	1
I	1
sent	1
James	1
off	1
to	1
bed?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
no!	1
I	1
want	1
the	1
doctor's	1
advice	1
and	1
help,	1
too.	1
It's	1
about	1
Isa.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
home	1
for	1
two	1
days.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
frightened	1
about	1
him!"	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
trouble,	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
doctor,	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
and	1
school	1
companion.	1
We	1
soothed	1
and	1
comforted	1
her	1
by	1
such	1
words	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
find.	1
Did	1
she	1
know	1
where	1
her	1
husband	1
was?	1
Was	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
bring	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
her?	1
	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
it	1
was.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
surest	1
information	1
that	1
of	1
late	1
he	1
had,	1
when	1
the	1
fit	1
was	1
on	1
him,	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
an	1
opium	1
den	1
in	1
the	1
farthest	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
City.	1
Hitherto	1
his	1
orgies	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
confined	1
to	1
one	1
day,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
back,	1
twitching	1
and	1
shattered,	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
spell	1
had	1
been	1
upon	1
him	1
eight-and-forty	1
hours,	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
there,	1
doubtless	1
among	1
the	1
dregs	1
of	1
the	1
docks,	1
breathing	1
in	1
the	1
poison	1
or	1
sleeping	1
off	1
the	1
effects.	1
There	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
it,	1
at	1
the	1
Bar	1
of	1
Gold,	1
in	1
Upper	1
Swandam	1
Lane.	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
she	1
to	1
do?	1
How	1
could	1
she,	1
a	1
young	1
and	1
timid	1
woman,	1
make	1
her	1
way	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
pluck	1
her	1
husband	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
ruffians	1
who	1
surrounded	1
him?	1
	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
Might	1
I	1
not	1
escort	1
her	1
to	1
this	1
place?	1
And	1
then,	1
as	1
a	1
second	1
thought,	1
why	1
should	1
she	1
come	1
at	1
all?	1
I	1
was	1
Isa	1
Whitney's	1
medical	1
adviser,	1
and	1
as	1
such	1
I	1
had	1
influence	1
over	1
him.	1
I	1
could	1
manage	1
it	1
better	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
alone.	1
I	1
promised	1
her	1
on	1
my	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
send	1
him	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
cab	1
within	1
two	1
hours	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
indeed	1
at	1
the	1
address	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
me.	1
And	1
so	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
my	1
armchair	1
and	1
cheery	1
sitting-room	1
behind	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
speeding	1
eastward	1
in	1
a	1
hansom	1
on	1
a	1
strange	1
errand,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
though	1
the	1
future	1
only	1
could	1
show	1
how	1
strange	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
great	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
my	1
adventure.	1
Upper	1
Swandam	1
Lane	1
is	1
a	1
vile	1
alley	1
lurking	1
behind	1
the	1
high	1
wharves	1
which	1
line	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
London	1
Bridge.	1
Between	1
a	1
slop-shop	1
and	1
a	1
gin-shop,	1
approached	1
by	1
a	1
steep	1
flight	1
of	1
steps	1
leading	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
black	1
gap	1
like	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
cave,	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
search.	1
Ordering	1
my	1
cab	1
to	1
wait,	1
I	1
passed	1
down	1
the	1
steps,	1
worn	1
hollow	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
by	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
tread	1
of	1
drunken	1
feet;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
flickering	1
oil-lamp	1
above	1
the	1
door	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
latch	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
into	1
a	1
long,	1
low	1
room,	1
thick	1
and	1
heavy	1
with	1
the	1
brown	1
opium	1
smoke,	1
and	1
terraced	1
with	1
wooden	1
berths,	1
like	1
the	1
forecastle	1
of	1
an	1
emigrant	1
ship.	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
gloom	1
one	1
could	1
dimly	1
catch	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
bodies	1
lying	1
in	1
strange	1
fantastic	1
poses,	1
bowed	1
shoulders,	1
bent	1
knees,	1
heads	1
thrown	1
back,	1
and	1
chins	1
pointing	1
upward,	1
with	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
dark,	1
lack-lustre	1
eye	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
newcomer.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
shadows	1
there	1
glimmered	1
little	1
red	1
circles	1
of	1
light,	1
now	1
bright,	1
now	1
faint,	1
as	1
the	1
burning	1
poison	1
waxed	1
or	1
waned	1
in	1
the	1
bowls	1
of	1
the	1
metal	1
pipes.	1
The	1
most	1
lay	1
silent,	1
but	1
some	1
muttered	1
to	1
themselves,	1
and	1
others	1
talked	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
strange,	1
low,	1
monotonous	1
voice,	1
their	1
conversation	1
coming	1
in	1
gushes,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
tailing	1
off	1
into	1
silence,	1
each	1
mumbling	1
out	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
and	1
paying	1
little	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
At	1
the	1
farther	1
end	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
brazier	1
of	1
burning	1
charcoal,	1
beside	1
which	1
on	1
a	1
three-legged	1
wooden	1
stool	1
there	1
sat	1
a	1
tall,	1
thin	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
his	1
jaw	1
resting	1
upon	1
his	1
two	1
fists,	1
and	1
his	1
elbows	1
upon	1
his	1
knees,	1
staring	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
As	1
I	1
entered,	1
a	1
sallow	1
Malay	1
attendant	1
had	1
hurried	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
pipe	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
drug,	1
beckoning	1
me	1
to	1
an	1
empty	1
berth.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
stay,"	1
said	1
I.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
here,	1
Mr.	1
Isa	1
Whitney,	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
movement	1
and	1
an	1
exclamation	1
from	1
my	1
right,	1
and	1
peering	1
through	1
the	1
gloom,	1
I	1
saw	1
Whitney,	1
pale,	1
haggard,	1
and	1
unkempt,	1
staring	1
out	1
at	1
me.	1
	1
"My	1
God!	1
It's	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
pitiable	1
state	1
of	1
reaction,	1
with	1
every	1
nerve	1
in	1
a	1
twitter.	1
"I	1
say,	1
Watson,	1
what	1
o'clock	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Nearly	1
eleven."	1
	1
"Of	1
what	1
day?"	1
	1
"Of	1
Friday,	1
June	1
19th."	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
Wednesday.	1
It	1
is	1
Wednesday.	1
What	1
d'you	1
want	1
to	1
frighten	1
a	1
chap	1
for?"	1
He	1
sank	1
his	1
face	1
onto	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
treble	1
key.	1
	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
Friday,	1
man.	1
Your	1
wife	1
has	1
been	1
waiting	1
this	1
two	1
days	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself!"	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
am.	1
But	1
you've	1
got	1
mixed,	1
Watson,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
been	1
here	1
a	1
few	1
hours,	1
three	1
pipes,	1
four	1
pipes--I	1
forget	1
how	1
many.	1
But	1
I'll	1
go	1
home	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
frighten	1
Kate--poor	1
little	1
Kate.	1
Give	1
me	1
your	1
hand!	1
Have	1
you	1
a	1
cab?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
waiting."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
it.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
owe	1
something.	1
Find	1
what	1
I	1
owe,	1
Watson.	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
off	1
colour.	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
for	1
myself."	1
	1
I	1
walked	1
down	1
the	1
narrow	1
passage	1
between	1
the	1
double	1
row	1
of	1
sleepers,	1
holding	1
my	1
breath	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
the	1
vile,	1
stupefying	1
fumes	1
of	1
the	1
drug,	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
manager.	1
As	1
I	1
passed	1
the	1
tall	1
man	1
who	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
brazier	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
sudden	1
pluck	1
at	1
my	1
skirt,	1
and	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
whispered,	1
"Walk	1
past	1
me,	1
and	1
then	1
look	1
back	1
at	1
me."	1
The	1
words	1
fell	1
quite	1
distinctly	1
upon	1
my	1
ear.	1
I	1
glanced	1
down.	1
They	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
my	1
side,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
sat	1
now	1
as	1
absorbed	1
as	1
ever,	1
very	1
thin,	1
very	1
wrinkled,	1
bent	1
with	1
age,	1
an	1
opium	1
pipe	1
dangling	1
down	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
knees,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
dropped	1
in	1
sheer	1
lassitude	1
from	1
his	1
fingers.	1
I	1
took	1
two	1
steps	1
forward	1
and	1
looked	1
back.	1
It	1
took	1
all	1
my	1
self-control	1
to	1
prevent	1
me	1
from	1
breaking	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
astonishment.	1
He	1
had	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
so	1
that	1
none	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
I.	1
His	1
form	1
had	1
filled	1
out,	1
his	1
wrinkles	1
were	1
gone,	1
the	1
dull	1
eyes	1
had	1
regained	1
their	1
fire,	1
and	1
there,	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
grinning	1
at	1
my	1
surprise,	1
was	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
slight	1
motion	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
approach	1
him,	1
and	1
instantly,	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
half	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
once	1
more,	1
subsided	1
into	1
a	1
doddering,	1
loose-lipped	1
senility.	1
	1
"Holmes!"	1
I	1
whispered,	1
"what	1
on	1
earth	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
in	1
this	1
den?"	1
	1
"As	1
low	1
as	1
you	1
can,"	1
he	1
answered;	1
"I	1
have	1
excellent	1
ears.	1
If	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
great	1
kindness	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
that	1
sottish	1
friend	1
of	1
yours	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
talk	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
cab	1
outside."	1
	1
"Then	1
pray	1
send	1
him	1
home	1
in	1
it.	1
You	1
may	1
safely	1
trust	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
limp	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
any	1
mischief.	1
I	1
should	1
recommend	1
you	1
also	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
note	1
by	1
the	1
cabman	1
to	1
your	1
wife	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
thrown	1
in	1
your	1
lot	1
with	1
me.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
wait	1
outside,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
five	1
minutes."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
refuse	1
any	1
of	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
requests,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
always	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
definite,	1
and	1
put	1
forward	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
quiet	1
air	1
of	1
mastery.	1
I	1
felt,	1
however,	1
that	1
when	1
Whitney	1
was	1
once	1
confined	1
in	1
the	1
cab	1
my	1
mission	1
was	1
practically	1
accomplished;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
anything	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
be	1
associated	1
with	1
my	1
friend	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
singular	1
adventures	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
normal	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
existence.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
I	1
had	1
written	1
my	1
note,	1
paid	1
Whitney's	1
bill,	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
seen	1
him	1
driven	1
through	1
the	1
darkness.	1
In	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
a	1
decrepit	1
figure	1
had	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
opium	1
den,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
walking	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
with	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
For	1
two	1
streets	1
he	1
shuffled	1
along	1
with	1
a	1
bent	1
back	1
and	1
an	1
uncertain	1
foot.	1
Then,	1
glancing	1
quickly	1
round,	1
he	1
straightened	1
himself	1
out	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
hearty	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter.	1
	1
"I	1
suppose,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
added	1
opium-smoking	1
to	1
cocaine	1
injections,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
little	1
weaknesses	1
on	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
favoured	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
medical	1
views."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
certainly	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
there."	1
	1
"But	1
not	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
I	1
to	1
find	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
came	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
friend."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
enemy."	1
	1
"An	1
enemy?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
natural	1
enemies,	1
or,	1
shall	1
I	1
say,	1
my	1
natural	1
prey.	1
Briefly,	1
Watson,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
remarkable	1
inquiry,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
clue	1
in	1
the	1
incoherent	1
ramblings	1
of	1
these	1
sots,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
before	1
now.	1
Had	1
I	1
been	1
recognised	1
in	1
that	1
den	1
my	1
life	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
worth	1
an	1
hour's	1
purchase;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
used	1
it	1
before	1
now	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
purposes,	1
and	1
the	1
rascally	1
Lascar	1
who	1
runs	1
it	1
has	1
sworn	1
to	1
have	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
me.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
trap-door	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
that	1
building,	1
near	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Paul's	1
Wharf,	1
which	1
could	1
tell	1
some	1
strange	1
tales	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
passed	1
through	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
moonless	1
nights."	1
	1
"What!	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
bodies?"	1
	1
"Ay,	1
bodies,	1
Watson.	1
We	1
should	1
be	1
rich	1
men	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
1000	1
pounds	1
for	1
every	1
poor	1
devil	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
that	1
den.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
vilest	1
murder-trap	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
riverside,	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
has	1
entered	1
it	1
never	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
more.	1
But	1
our	1
trap	1
should	1
be	1
here."	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
two	1
forefingers	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
whistled	1
shrilly--a	1
signal	1
which	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
a	1
similar	1
whistle	1
from	1
the	1
distance,	1
followed	1
shortly	1
by	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
clink	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs.	1
	1
"Now,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
as	1
a	1
tall	1
dog-cart	1
dashed	1
up	1
through	1
the	1
gloom,	1
throwing	1
out	1
two	1
golden	1
tunnels	1
of	1
yellow	1
light	1
from	1
its	1
side	1
lanterns.	1
"You'll	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
won't	1
you?"	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
use."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
a	1
trusty	1
comrade	1
is	1
always	1
of	1
use;	1
and	1
a	1
chronicler	1
still	1
more	1
so.	1
My	1
room	1
at	1
The	1
Cedars	1
is	1
a	1
double-bedded	1
one."	1
	1
"The	1
Cedars?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
that	1
is	1
Mr.	1
St.	1
Clair's	1
house.	1
I	1
am	1
staying	1
there	1
while	1
I	1
conduct	1
the	1
inquiry."	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
it,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Near	1
Lee,	1
in	1
Kent.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
seven-mile	1
drive	1
before	1
us."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
dark."	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
you	1
are.	1
You'll	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
presently.	1
Jump	1
up	1
here.	1
All	1
right,	1
John;	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
need	1
you.	1
Here's	1
half	1
a	1
crown.	1
Look	1
out	1
for	1
me	1
to-morrow,	1
about	1
eleven.	1
Give	1
her	1
her	1
head.	1
So	1
long,	1
then!"	1
	1
He	1
flicked	1
the	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
whip,	1
and	1
we	1
dashed	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
endless	1
succession	1
of	1
sombre	1
and	1
deserted	1
streets,	1
which	1
widened	1
gradually,	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
flying	1
across	1
a	1
broad	1
balustraded	1
bridge,	1
with	1
the	1
murky	1
river	1
flowing	1
sluggishly	1
beneath	1
us.	1
Beyond	1
lay	1
another	1
dull	1
wilderness	1
of	1
bricks	1
and	1
mortar,	1
its	1
silence	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
heavy,	1
regular	1
footfall	1
of	1
the	1
policeman,	1
or	1
the	1
songs	1
and	1
shouts	1
of	1
some	1
belated	1
party	1
of	1
revellers.	1
A	1
dull	1
wrack	1
was	1
drifting	1
slowly	1
across	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
a	1
star	1
or	1
two	1
twinkled	1
dimly	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
through	1
the	1
rifts	1
of	1
the	1
clouds.	1
Holmes	1
drove	1
in	1
silence,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
lost	1
in	1
thought,	1
while	1
I	1
sat	1
beside	1
him,	1
curious	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
this	1
new	1
quest	1
might	1
be	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
tax	1
his	1
powers	1
so	1
sorely,	1
and	1
yet	1
afraid	1
to	1
break	1
in	1
upon	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
We	1
had	1
driven	1
several	1
miles,	1
and	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
the	1
belt	1
of	1
suburban	1
villas,	1
when	1
he	1
shook	1
himself,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
lit	1
up	1
his	1
pipe	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
acting	1
for	1
the	1
best.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
grand	1
gift	1
of	1
silence,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
makes	1
you	1
quite	1
invaluable	1
as	1
a	1
companion.	1
'Pon	1
my	1
word,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
thing	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
to	1
talk	1
to,	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
thoughts	1
are	1
not	1
over-pleasant.	1
I	1
was	1
wondering	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
dear	1
little	1
woman	1
to-night	1
when	1
she	1
meets	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
door."	1
	1
"You	1
forget	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
just	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
we	1
get	1
to	1
Lee.	1
It	1
seems	1
absurdly	1
simple,	1
and	1
yet,	1
somehow	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
nothing	1
to	1
go	1
upon.	1
There's	1
plenty	1
of	1
thread,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
get	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
hand.	1
Now,	1
I'll	1
state	1
the	1
case	1
clearly	1
and	1
concisely	1
to	1
you,	1
Watson,	1
and	1
maybe	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
a	1
spark	1
where	1
all	1
is	1
dark	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Proceed,	1
then."	1
	1
"Some	1
years	1
ago--to	1
be	1
definite,	1
in	1
May,	1
1884--there	1
came	1
to	1
Lee	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
by	1
name,	1
who	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
money.	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
large	1
villa,	1
laid	1
out	1
the	1
grounds	1
very	1
nicely,	1
and	1
lived	1
generally	1
in	1
good	1
style.	1
By	1
degrees	1
he	1
made	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
in	1
1887	1
he	1
married	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
local	1
brewer,	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
has	1
two	1
children.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
occupation,	1
but	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
several	1
companies	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
town	1
as	1
a	1
rule	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
returning	1
by	1
the	1
5:14	1
from	1
Cannon	1
Street	1
every	1
night.	1
Mr.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
is	1
now	1
thirty-seven	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
temperate	1
habits,	1
a	1
good	1
husband,	1
a	1
very	1
affectionate	1
father,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
popular	1
with	1
all	1
who	1
know	1
him.	1
I	1
may	1
add	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
debts	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
ascertain,	1
amount	1
to	1
88	1
pounds	1
10s.,	1
while	1
he	1
has	1
220	1
pounds	1
standing	1
to	1
his	1
credit	1
in	1
the	1
Capital	1
and	1
Counties	1
Bank.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
reason,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
money	1
troubles	1
have	1
been	1
weighing	1
upon	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"Last	1
Monday	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
went	1
into	1
town	1
rather	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual,	1
remarking	1
before	1
he	1
started	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
important	1
commissions	1
to	1
perform,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
bring	1
his	1
little	1
boy	1
home	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
bricks.	1
Now,	1
by	1
the	1
merest	1
chance,	1
his	1
wife	1
received	1
a	1
telegram	1
upon	1
this	1
same	1
Monday,	1
very	1
shortly	1
after	1
his	1
departure,	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
a	1
small	1
parcel	1
of	1
considerable	1
value	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
expecting	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
the	1
Aberdeen	1
Shipping	1
Company.	1
Now,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
well	1
up	1
in	1
your	1
London,	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
is	1
in	1
Fresno	1
Street,	1
which	1
branches	1
out	1
of	1
Upper	1
Swandam	1
Lane,	1
where	1
you	1
found	1
me	1
to-night.	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
had	1
her	1
lunch,	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
City,	1
did	1
some	1
shopping,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
company's	1
office,	1
got	1
her	1
packet,	1
and	1
found	1
herself	1
at	1
exactly	1
4:35	1
walking	1
through	1
Swandam	1
Lane	1
on	1
her	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
station.	1
Have	1
you	1
followed	1
me	1
so	1
far?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
clear."	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
remember,	1
Monday	1
was	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
hot	1
day,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
walked	1
slowly,	1
glancing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
a	1
cab,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself.	1
While	1
she	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
down	1
Swandam	1
Lane,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
an	1
ejaculation	1
or	1
cry,	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
cold	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
husband	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her,	1
beckoning	1
to	1
her	1
from	1
a	1
second-floor	1
window.	1
The	1
window	1
was	1
open,	1
and	1
she	1
distinctly	1
saw	1
his	1
face,	1
which	1
she	1
describes	1
as	1
being	1
terribly	1
agitated.	1
He	1
waved	1
his	1
hands	1
frantically	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
vanished	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
so	1
suddenly	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
plucked	1
back	1
by	1
some	1
irresistible	1
force	1
from	1
behind.	1
One	1
singular	1
point	1
which	1
struck	1
her	1
quick	1
feminine	1
eye	1
was	1
that	1
although	1
he	1
wore	1
some	1
dark	1
coat,	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
started	1
to	1
town	1
in,	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
neither	1
collar	1
nor	1
necktie.	1
	1
"Convinced	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
amiss	1
with	1
him,	1
she	1
rushed	1
down	1
the	1
steps--for	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
the	1
opium	1
den	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
found	1
me	1
to-night--and	1
running	1
through	1
the	1
front	1
room	1
she	1
attempted	1
to	1
ascend	1
the	1
stairs	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
floor.	1
At	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
however,	1
she	1
met	1
this	1
Lascar	1
scoundrel	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
who	1
thrust	1
her	1
back	1
and,	1
aided	1
by	1
a	1
Dane,	1
who	1
acts	1
as	1
assistant	1
there,	1
pushed	1
her	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
Filled	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
maddening	1
doubts	1
and	1
fears,	1
she	1
rushed	1
down	1
the	1
lane	1
and,	1
by	1
rare	1
good-fortune,	1
met	1
in	1
Fresno	1
Street	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
constables	1
with	1
an	1
inspector,	1
all	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
their	1
beat.	1
The	1
inspector	1
and	1
two	1
men	1
accompanied	1
her	1
back,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
continued	1
resistance	1
of	1
the	1
proprietor,	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
Mr.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
had	1
last	1
been	1
seen.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
him	1
there.	1
In	1
fact,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
floor	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
save	1
a	1
crippled	1
wretch	1
of	1
hideous	1
aspect,	1
who,	1
it	1
seems,	1
made	1
his	1
home	1
there.	1
Both	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
Lascar	1
stoutly	1
swore	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
room	1
during	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
So	1
determined	1
was	1
their	1
denial	1
that	1
the	1
inspector	1
was	1
staggered,	1
and	1
had	1
almost	1
come	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
had	1
been	1
deluded	1
when,	1
with	1
a	1
cry,	1
she	1
sprang	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
deal	1
box	1
which	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
tore	1
the	1
lid	1
from	1
it.	1
Out	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
cascade	1
of	1
children's	1
bricks.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
toy	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
bring	1
home.	1
	1
"This	1
discovery,	1
and	1
the	1
evident	1
confusion	1
which	1
the	1
cripple	1
showed,	1
made	1
the	1
inspector	1
realise	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
serious.	1
The	1
rooms	1
were	1
carefully	1
examined,	1
and	1
results	1
all	1
pointed	1
to	1
an	1
abominable	1
crime.	1
The	1
front	1
room	1
was	1
plainly	1
furnished	1
as	1
a	1
sitting-room	1
and	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
bedroom,	1
which	1
looked	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wharves.	1
Between	1
the	1
wharf	1
and	1
the	1
bedroom	1
window	1
is	1
a	1
narrow	1
strip,	1
which	1
is	1
dry	1
at	1
low	1
tide	1
but	1
is	1
covered	1
at	1
high	1
tide	1
with	1
at	1
least	1
four	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
feet	1
of	1
water.	1
The	1
bedroom	1
window	1
was	1
a	1
broad	1
one	1
and	1
opened	1
from	1
below.	1
On	1
examination	1
traces	1
of	1
blood	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
upon	1
the	1
windowsill,	1
and	1
several	1
scattered	1
drops	1
were	1
visible	1
upon	1
the	1
wooden	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
Thrust	1
away	1
behind	1
a	1
curtain	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
room	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
clothes	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
his	1
coat.	1
His	1
boots,	1
his	1
socks,	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
his	1
watch--all	1
were	1
there.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
violence	1
upon	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
garments,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
other	1
traces	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
he	1
must	1
apparently	1
have	1
gone	1
for	1
no	1
other	1
exit	1
could	1
be	1
discovered,	1
and	1
the	1
ominous	1
bloodstains	1
upon	1
the	1
sill	1
gave	1
little	1
promise	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
save	1
himself	1
by	1
swimming,	1
for	1
the	1
tide	1
was	1
at	1
its	1
very	1
highest	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
villains	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
immediately	1
implicated	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
The	1
Lascar	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
vilest	1
antecedents,	1
but	1
as,	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair's	1
story,	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
stair	1
within	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
seconds	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
appearance	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
accessory	1
to	1
the	1
crime.	1
His	1
defence	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
absolute	1
ignorance,	1
and	1
he	1
protested	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
Hugh	1
Boone,	1
his	1
lodger,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
account	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
gentleman's	1
clothes.	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
Lascar	1
manager.	1
Now	1
for	1
the	1
sinister	1
cripple	1
who	1
lives	1
upon	1
the	1
second	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
opium	1
den,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
certainly	1
the	1
last	1
human	1
being	1
whose	1
eyes	1
rested	1
upon	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair.	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
Hugh	1
Boone,	1
and	1
his	1
hideous	1
face	1
is	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
familiar	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
goes	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
City.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
professional	1
beggar,	1
though	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
police	1
regulations	1
he	1
pretends	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
trade	1
in	1
wax	1
vestas.	1
Some	1
little	1
distance	1
down	1
Threadneedle	1
Street,	1
upon	1
the	1
left-hand	1
side,	1
there	1
is,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
remarked,	1
a	1
small	1
angle	1
in	1
the	1
wall.	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
this	1
creature	1
takes	1
his	1
daily	1
seat,	1
cross-legged	1
with	1
his	1
tiny	1
stock	1
of	1
matches	1
on	1
his	1
lap,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
piteous	1
spectacle	1
a	1
small	1
rain	1
of	1
charity	1
descends	1
into	1
the	1
greasy	1
leather	1
cap	1
which	1
lies	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
beside	1
him.	1
I	1
have	1
watched	1
the	1
fellow	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
before	1
ever	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
making	1
his	1
professional	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
harvest	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
reaped	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
His	1
appearance,	1
you	1
see,	1
is	1
so	1
remarkable	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
pass	1
him	1
without	1
observing	1
him.	1
A	1
shock	1
of	1
orange	1
hair,	1
a	1
pale	1
face	1
disfigured	1
by	1
a	1
horrible	1
scar,	1
which,	1
by	1
its	1
contraction,	1
has	1
turned	1
up	1
the	1
outer	1
edge	1
of	1
his	1
upper	1
lip,	1
a	1
bulldog	1
chin,	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
very	1
penetrating	1
dark	1
eyes,	1
which	1
present	1
a	1
singular	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
his	1
hair,	1
all	1
mark	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
common	1
crowd	1
of	1
mendicants	1
and	1
so,	1
too,	1
does	1
his	1
wit,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
ever	1
ready	1
with	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
any	1
piece	1
of	1
chaff	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
thrown	1
at	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
passers-by.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
we	1
now	1
learn	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
lodger	1
at	1
the	1
opium	1
den,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
gentleman	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
quest."	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
cripple!"	1
said	1
I.	1
"What	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
done	1
single-handed	1
against	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
prime	1
of	1
life?"	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
cripple	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
he	1
walks	1
with	1
a	1
limp;	1
but	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
he	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
powerful	1
and	1
well-nurtured	1
man.	1
Surely	1
your	1
medical	1
experience	1
would	1
tell	1
you,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
weakness	1
in	1
one	1
limb	1
is	1
often	1
compensated	1
for	1
by	1
exceptional	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
others."	1
	1
"Pray	1
continue	1
your	1
narrative."	1
	1
"Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
had	1
fainted	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
escorted	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
cab	1
by	1
the	1
police,	1
as	1
her	1
presence	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
help	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
investigations.	1
Inspector	1
Barton,	1
who	1
had	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
careful	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
premises,	1
but	1
without	1
finding	1
anything	1
which	1
threw	1
any	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
matter.	1
One	1
mistake	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
not	1
arresting	1
Boone	1
instantly,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
allowed	1
some	1
few	1
minutes	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
communicated	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
Lascar,	1
but	1
this	1
fault	1
was	1
soon	1
remedied,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
and	1
searched,	1
without	1
anything	1
being	1
found	1
which	1
could	1
incriminate	1
him.	1
There	1
were,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
some	1
blood-stains	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
shirt-sleeve,	1
but	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
his	1
ring-finger,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
near	1
the	1
nail,	1
and	1
explained	1
that	1
the	1
bleeding	1
came	1
from	1
there,	1
adding	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
not	1
long	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
stains	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
observed	1
there	1
came	1
doubtless	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
source.	1
He	1
denied	1
strenuously	1
having	1
ever	1
seen	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
and	1
swore	1
that	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
clothes	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
mystery	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
police.	1
As	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair's	1
assertion	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
actually	1
seen	1
her	1
husband	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
he	1
declared	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
either	1
mad	1
or	1
dreaming.	1
He	1
was	1
removed,	1
loudly	1
protesting,	1
to	1
the	1
police-station,	1
while	1
the	1
inspector	1
remained	1
upon	1
the	1
premises	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
ebbing	1
tide	1
might	1
afford	1
some	1
fresh	1
clue.	1
	1
"And	1
it	1
did,	1
though	1
they	1
hardly	1
found	1
upon	1
the	1
mud-bank	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
feared	1
to	1
find.	1
It	1
was	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair's	1
coat,	1
and	1
not	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
which	1
lay	1
uncovered	1
as	1
the	1
tide	1
receded.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
they	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
pockets?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
guess.	1
Every	1
pocket	1
stuffed	1
with	1
pennies	1
and	1
half-pennies--421	1
pennies	1
and	1
270	1
half-pennies.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
swept	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
tide.	1
But	1
a	1
human	1
body	1
is	1
a	1
different	1
matter.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
fierce	1
eddy	1
between	1
the	1
wharf	1
and	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
seemed	1
likely	1
enough	1
that	1
the	1
weighted	1
coat	1
had	1
remained	1
when	1
the	1
stripped	1
body	1
had	1
been	1
sucked	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
river."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
clothes	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Would	1
the	1
body	1
be	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
coat	1
alone?"	1
	1
"No,	1
sir,	1
but	1
the	1
facts	1
might	1
be	1
met	1
speciously	1
enough.	1
Suppose	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
Boone	1
had	1
thrust	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
through	1
the	1
window,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
human	1
eye	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
deed.	1
What	1
would	1
he	1
do	1
then?	1
It	1
would	1
of	1
course	1
instantly	1
strike	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
tell-tale	1
garments.	1
He	1
would	1
seize	1
the	1
coat,	1
then,	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
throwing	1
it	1
out,	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
swim	1
and	1
not	1
sink.	1
He	1
has	1
little	1
time,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
heard	1
the	1
scuffle	1
downstairs	1
when	1
the	1
wife	1
tried	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
way	1
up,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
he	1
has	1
already	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
Lascar	1
confederate	1
that	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
hurrying	1
up	1
the	1
street.	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
be	1
lost.	1
He	1
rushes	1
to	1
some	1
secret	1
hoard,	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
accumulated	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
his	1
beggary,	1
and	1
he	1
stuffs	1
all	1
the	1
coins	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
can	1
lay	1
his	1
hands	1
into	1
the	1
pockets	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
coat's	1
sinking.	1
He	1
throws	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
garments	1
had	1
not	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
steps	1
below,	1
and	1
only	1
just	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
close	1
the	1
window	1
when	1
the	1
police	1
appeared."	1
	1
"It	1
certainly	1
sounds	1
feasible."	1
	1
"Well,	1
we	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
working	1
hypothesis	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
better.	1
Boone,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you,	1
was	1
arrested	1
and	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
station,	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
shown	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
been	1
anything	1
against	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
for	1
years	1
been	1
known	1
as	1
a	1
professional	1
beggar,	1
but	1
his	1
life	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
quiet	1
and	1
innocent	1
one.	1
There	1
the	1
matter	1
stands	1
at	1
present,	1
and	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
solved--what	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
was	1
doing	1
in	1
the	1
opium	1
den,	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
there,	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
now,	1
and	1
what	1
Hugh	1
Boone	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
disappearance--are	1
all	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
a	1
solution	1
as	1
ever.	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
recall	1
any	1
case	1
within	1
my	1
experience	1
which	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
yet	1
which	1
presented	1
such	1
difficulties."	1
	1
While	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
detailing	1
this	1
singular	1
series	1
of	1
events,	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
whirling	1
through	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
town	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
straggling	1
houses	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
behind,	1
and	1
we	1
rattled	1
along	1
with	1
a	1
country	1
hedge	1
upon	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
us.	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
finished,	1
however,	1
we	1
drove	1
through	1
two	1
scattered	1
villages,	1
where	1
a	1
few	1
lights	1
still	1
glimmered	1
in	1
the	1
windows.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
Lee,"	1
said	1
my	1
companion.	1
"We	1
have	1
touched	1
on	1
three	1
English	1
counties	1
in	1
our	1
short	1
drive,	1
starting	1
in	1
Middlesex,	1
passing	1
over	1
an	1
angle	1
of	1
Surrey,	1
and	1
ending	1
in	1
Kent.	1
See	1
that	1
light	1
among	1
the	1
trees?	1
That	1
is	1
The	1
Cedars,	1
and	1
beside	1
that	1
lamp	1
sits	1
a	1
woman	1
whose	1
anxious	1
ears	1
have	1
already,	1
I	1
have	1
little	1
doubt,	1
caught	1
the	1
clink	1
of	1
our	1
horse's	1
feet."	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
conducting	1
the	1
case	1
from	1
Baker	1
Street?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Because	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
inquiries	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
made	1
out	1
here.	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
has	1
most	1
kindly	1
put	1
two	1
rooms	1
at	1
my	1
disposal,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
rest	1
assured	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
welcome	1
for	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
colleague.	1
I	1
hate	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
Watson,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
news	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
Here	1
we	1
are.	1
Whoa,	1
there,	1
whoa!"	1
	1
We	1
had	1
pulled	1
up	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
villa	1
which	1
stood	1
within	1
its	1
own	1
grounds.	1
A	1
stable-boy	1
had	1
run	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
horse's	1
head,	1
and	1
springing	1
down,	1
I	1
followed	1
Holmes	1
up	1
the	1
small,	1
winding	1
gravel-drive	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
As	1
we	1
approached,	1
the	1
door	1
flew	1
open,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
blonde	1
woman	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
opening,	1
clad	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
light	1
mousseline	1
de	1
soie,	1
with	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
fluffy	1
pink	1
chiffon	1
at	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
wrists.	1
She	1
stood	1
with	1
her	1
figure	1
outlined	1
against	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
light,	1
one	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
door,	1
one	1
half-raised	1
in	1
her	1
eagerness,	1
her	1
body	1
slightly	1
bent,	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
face	1
protruded,	1
with	1
eager	1
eyes	1
and	1
parted	1
lips,	1
a	1
standing	1
question.	1
	1
"Well?"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"well?"	1
And	1
then,	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
of	1
us,	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
hope	1
which	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
groan	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
my	1
companion	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"No	1
good	1
news?"	1
	1
"None."	1
	1
"No	1
bad?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"Thank	1
God	1
for	1
that.	1
But	1
come	1
in.	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
weary,	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
day."	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
friend,	1
Dr.	1
Watson.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
of	1
most	1
vital	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
my	1
cases,	1
and	1
a	1
lucky	1
chance	1
has	1
made	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
associate	1
him	1
with	1
this	1
investigation."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
pressing	1
my	1
hand	1
warmly.	1
"You	1
will,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
forgive	1
anything	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
wanting	1
in	1
our	1
arrangements,	1
when	1
you	1
consider	1
the	1
blow	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
so	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
us."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
madam,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
campaigner,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
not	1
I	1
can	1
very	1
well	1
see	1
that	1
no	1
apology	1
is	1
needed.	1
If	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
assistance,	1
either	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
here,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
indeed	1
happy."	1
	1
"Now,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
as	1
we	1
entered	1
a	1
well-lit	1
dining-room,	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
cold	1
supper	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
out,	1
"I	1
should	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
plain	1
questions,	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
a	1
plain	1
answer."	1
	1
"Certainly,	1
madam."	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
trouble	1
about	1
my	1
feelings.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
hysterical,	1
nor	1
given	1
to	1
fainting.	1
I	1
simply	1
wish	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
real,	1
real	1
opinion."	1
	1
"Upon	1
what	1
point?"	1
	1
"In	1
your	1
heart	1
of	1
hearts,	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
Neville	1
is	1
alive?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
embarrassed	1
by	1
the	1
question.	1
"Frankly,	1
now!"	1
she	1
repeated,	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
looking	1
keenly	1
down	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
basket-chair.	1
	1
"Frankly,	1
then,	1
madam,	1
I	1
do	1
not."	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
dead?"	1
	1
"I	1
do."	1
	1
"Murdered?"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
say	1
that.	1
Perhaps."	1
	1
"And	1
on	1
what	1
day	1
did	1
he	1
meet	1
his	1
death?"	1
	1
"On	1
Monday."	1
	1
"Then	1
perhaps,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him	1
to-day."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
galvanised.	1
	1
"What!"	1
he	1
roared.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
to-day."	1
She	1
stood	1
smiling,	1
holding	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
slip	1
of	1
paper	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
see	1
it?"	1
	1
"Certainly."	1
	1
He	1
snatched	1
it	1
from	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
eagerness,	1
and	1
smoothing	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
drew	1
over	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
examined	1
it	1
intently.	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
my	1
chair	1
and	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
it	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
The	1
envelope	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
coarse	1
one	1
and	1
was	1
stamped	1
with	1
the	1
Gravesend	1
postmark	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
that	1
very	1
day,	1
or	1
rather	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
considerably	1
after	1
midnight.	1
	1
"Coarse	1
writing,"	1
murmured	1
Holmes.	1
"Surely	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
husband's	1
writing,	1
madam."	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
the	1
enclosure	1
is."	1
	1
"I	1
perceive	1
also	1
that	1
whoever	1
addressed	1
the	1
envelope	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
inquire	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
address."	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
that?"	1
	1
"The	1
name,	1
you	1
see,	1
is	1
in	1
perfectly	1
black	1
ink,	1
which	1
has	1
dried	1
itself.	1
The	1
rest	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
greyish	1
colour,	1
which	1
shows	1
that	1
blotting-paper	1
has	1
been	1
used.	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
written	1
straight	1
off,	1
and	1
then	1
blotted,	1
none	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
deep	1
black	1
shade.	1
This	1
man	1
has	1
written	1
the	1
name,	1
and	1
there	1
has	1
then	1
been	1
a	1
pause	1
before	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
address,	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
familiar	1
with	1
it.	1
It	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
a	1
trifle,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
important	1
as	1
trifles.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
see	1
the	1
letter.	1
Ha!	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
enclosure	1
here!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
ring.	1
His	1
signet-ring."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
husband's	1
hand?"	1
	1
"One	1
of	1
his	1
hands."	1
	1
"One?"	1
	1
"His	1
hand	1
when	1
he	1
wrote	1
hurriedly.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
unlike	1
his	1
usual	1
writing,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
well."	1
	1
"'Dearest	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
frightened.	1
All	1
will	1
come	1
well.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
huge	1
error	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
take	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
to	1
rectify.	1
Wait	1
in	1
patience.--NEVILLE.'	1

pencil	1

the	1
fly-leaf	1
of	1
a	1

octavo	1
size,	1

Hum!	1
Posted	1
to-day	1
in	1
Gravesend	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
dirty	1
thumb.	1
Ha!	1
And	1
the	1
flap	1
has	1
been	1
gummed,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
error,	1
by	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
chewing	1
tobacco.	1
And	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
husband's	1
hand,	1
madam?"	1
	1
"None.	1
Neville	1
wrote	1
those	1
words."	1
	1
"And	1
they	1
were	1
posted	1
to-day	1
at	1
Gravesend.	1
Well,	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
the	1
clouds	1
lighten,	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
danger	1
is	1
over."	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
alive,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes."	1
	1
"Unless	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
clever	1
forgery	1
to	1
put	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
scent.	1
The	1
ring,	1
after	1
all,	1
proves	1
nothing.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
him."	1
	1
"No,	1
no;	1
it	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
very	1
own	1
writing!"	1
	1
"Very	1
well.	1
It	1
may,	1
however,	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
on	1
Monday	1
and	1
only	1
posted	1
to-day."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"If	1
so,	1
much	1
may	1
have	1
happened	1
between."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
discourage	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
well	1
with	1
him.	1
There	1
is	1
so	1
keen	1
a	1
sympathy	1
between	1
us	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
know	1
if	1
evil	1
came	1
upon	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
last	1
he	1
cut	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
rushed	1
upstairs	1
instantly	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
certainty	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened.	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
respond	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
trifle	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
his	1
death?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
too	1
much	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
valuable	1
than	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
an	1
analytical	1
reasoner.	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
letter	1
you	1
certainly	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
strong	1
piece	1
of	1
evidence	1
to	1
corroborate	1
your	1
view.	1
But	1
if	1
your	1
husband	1
is	1
alive	1
and	1
able	1
to	1
write	1
letters,	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
remain	1
away	1
from	1
you?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine.	1
It	1
is	1
unthinkable."	1
	1
"And	1
on	1
Monday	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
remarks	1
before	1
leaving	1
you?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
were	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
Swandam	1
Lane?"	1
	1
"Very	1
much	1
so."	1
	1
"Was	1
the	1
window	1
open?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Then	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
called	1
to	1
you?"	1
	1
"He	1
might."	1
	1
"He	1
only,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
gave	1
an	1
inarticulate	1
cry?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"A	1
call	1
for	1
help,	1
you	1
thought?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
He	1
waved	1
his	1
hands."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
surprise.	1
Astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
unexpected	1
sight	1
of	1
you	1
might	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
throw	1
up	1
his	1
hands?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
pulled	1
back?"	1
	1
"He	1
disappeared	1
so	1
suddenly."	1
	1
"He	1
might	1
have	1
leaped	1
back.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
anyone	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
room?"	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
this	1
horrible	1
man	1
confessed	1
to	1
having	1
been	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
Lascar	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
stairs."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
Your	1
husband,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
could	1
see,	1
had	1
his	1
ordinary	1
clothes	1
on?"	1
	1
"But	1
without	1
his	1
collar	1
or	1
tie.	1
I	1
distinctly	1
saw	1
his	1
bare	1
throat."	1
	1
"Had	1
he	1
ever	1
spoken	1
of	1
Swandam	1
Lane?"	1
	1
"Never."	1
	1
"Had	1
he	1
ever	1
showed	1
any	1
signs	1
of	1
having	1
taken	1
opium?"	1
	1
"Never."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair.	1
Those	1
are	1
the	1
principal	1
points	1
about	1
which	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
absolutely	1
clear.	1
We	1
shall	1
now	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
supper	1
and	1
then	1
retire,	1
for	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
busy	1
day	1
to-morrow."	1
	1
A	1
large	1
and	1
comfortable	1
double-bedded	1
room	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
at	1
our	1
disposal,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
quickly	1
between	1
the	1
sheets,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
weary	1
after	1
my	1
night	1
of	1
adventure.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
however,	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
unsolved	1
problem	1
upon	1
his	1
mind,	1
would	1
go	1
for	1
days,	1
and	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
week,	1
without	1
rest,	1
turning	1
it	1
over,	1
rearranging	1
his	1
facts,	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
either	1
fathomed	1
it	1
or	1
convinced	1
himself	1
that	1
his	1
data	1
were	1
insufficient.	1
It	1
was	1
soon	1
evident	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
preparing	1
for	1
an	1
all-night	1
sitting.	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
waistcoat,	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
blue	1
dressing-gown,	1
and	1
then	1
wandered	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
collecting	1
pillows	1
from	1
his	1
bed	1
and	1
cushions	1
from	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
armchairs.	1
With	1
these	1
he	1
constructed	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Eastern	1
divan,	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
perched	1
himself	1
cross-legged,	1
with	1
an	1
ounce	1
of	1
shag	1
tobacco	1
and	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
matches	1
laid	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
sitting	1
there,	1
an	1
old	1
briar	1
pipe	1
between	1
his	1
lips,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
vacantly	1
upon	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
ceiling,	1
the	1
blue	1
smoke	1
curling	1
up	1
from	1
him,	1
silent,	1
motionless,	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
shining	1
upon	1
his	1
strong-set	1
aquiline	1
features.	1
So	1
he	1
sat	1
as	1
I	1
dropped	1
off	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
sat	1
when	1
a	1
sudden	1
ejaculation	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
wake	1
up,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
summer	1
sun	1
shining	1
into	1
the	1
apartment.	1
The	1
pipe	1
was	1
still	1
between	1
his	1
lips,	1
the	1
smoke	1
still	1
curled	1
upward,	1
and	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
dense	1
tobacco	1
haze,	1
but	1
nothing	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
shag	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
upon	1
the	1
previous	1
night.	1
	1
"Awake,	1
Watson?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Game	1
for	1
a	1
morning	1
drive?"	1
	1
"Certainly."	1
	1
"Then	1
dress.	1
No	1
one	1
is	1
stirring	1
yet,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
the	1
stable-boy	1
sleeps,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
have	1
the	1
trap	1
out."	1
He	1
chuckled	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
his	1
eyes	1
twinkled,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
a	1
different	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
sombre	1
thinker	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
night.	1
	1
As	1
I	1
dressed	1
I	1
glanced	1
at	1
my	1
watch.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
stirring.	1
It	1
was	1
twenty-five	1
minutes	1
past	1
four.	1
I	1
had	1
hardly	1
finished	1
when	1
Holmes	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
putting	1
in	1
the	1
horse.	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
test	1
a	1
little	1
theory	1
of	1
mine,"	1
said	1
he,	1
pulling	1
on	1
his	1
boots.	1
"I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
absolute	1
fools	1
in	1
Europe.	1
I	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
kicked	1
from	1
here	1
to	1
Charing	1
Cross.	1
But	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
now."	1
	1
"And	1
where	1
is	1
it?"	1
I	1
asked,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
bathroom,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
joking,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
seeing	1
my	1
look	1
of	1
incredulity.	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
there,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
Gladstone	1
bag.	1
Come	1
on,	1
my	1
boy,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
fit	1
the	1
lock."	1
	1
We	1
made	1
our	1
way	1
downstairs	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
bright	1
morning	1
sunshine.	1
In	1
the	1
road	1
stood	1
our	1
horse	1
and	1
trap,	1
with	1
the	1
half-clad	1
stable-boy	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
head.	1
We	1
both	1
sprang	1
in,	1
and	1
away	1
we	1
dashed	1
down	1
the	1
London	1
Road.	1
A	1
few	1
country	1
carts	1
were	1
stirring,	1
bearing	1
in	1
vegetables	1
to	1
the	1
metropolis,	1
but	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
villas	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
were	1
as	1
silent	1
and	1
lifeless	1
as	1
some	1
city	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
some	1
points	1
a	1
singular	1
case,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
flicking	1
the	1
horse	1
on	1
into	1
a	1
gallop.	1
"I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
blind	1
as	1
a	1
mole,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
learn	1
wisdom	1
late	1
than	1
never	1
to	1
learn	1
it	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
In	1
town	1
the	1
earliest	1
risers	1
were	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
look	1
sleepily	1
from	1
their	1
windows	1
as	1
we	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
Surrey	1
side.	1
Passing	1
down	1
the	1
Waterloo	1
Bridge	1
Road	1
we	1
crossed	1
over	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
dashing	1
up	1
Wellington	1
Street	1
wheeled	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
Bow	1
Street.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
force,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
constables	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
saluted	1
him.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
held	1
the	1
horse's	1
head	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
led	1
us	1
in.	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
on	1
duty?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Inspector	1
Bradstreet,	1
sir."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Bradstreet,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
A	1
tall,	1
stout	1
official	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
the	1
stone-flagged	1
passage,	1
in	1
a	1
peaked	1
cap	1
and	1
frogged	1
jacket.	1
"I	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
quiet	1
word	1
with	1
you,	1
Bradstreet."	1
"Certainly,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
Step	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
here."	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
office-like	1
room,	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
ledger	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
a	1
telephone	1
projecting	1
from	1
the	1
wall.	1
The	1
inspector	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
desk.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes?"	1
	1
"I	1
called	1
about	1
that	1
beggarman,	1
Boone--the	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
charged	1
with	1
being	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
of	1
Lee."	1
	1
"Yes.	1
He	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
and	1
remanded	1
for	1
further	1
inquiries."	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
heard.	1
You	1
have	1
him	1
here?"	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
cells."	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
quiet?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
gives	1
no	1
trouble.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
dirty	1
scoundrel."	1
	1
"Dirty?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
wash	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
is	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
a	1
tinker's.	1
Well,	1
when	1
once	1
his	1
case	1
has	1
been	1
settled,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
regular	1
prison	1
bath;	1
and	1
I	1
think,	1
if	1
you	1
saw	1
him,	1
you	1
would	1
agree	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
needed	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
very	1
much."	1
	1
"Would	1
you?	1
That	1
is	1
easily	1
done.	1
Come	1
this	1
way.	1
You	1
can	1
leave	1
your	1
bag."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I'll	1
take	1
it."	1
	1
"Very	1
good.	1
Come	1
this	1
way,	1
if	1
you	1
please."	1
He	1
led	1
us	1
down	1
a	1
passage,	1
opened	1
a	1
barred	1
door,	1
passed	1
down	1
a	1
winding	1
stair,	1
and	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
whitewashed	1
corridor	1
with	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
doors	1
on	1
each	1
side.	1
	1
"The	1
third	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
is	1
his,"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector.	1
"Here	1
it	1
is!"	1
He	1
quietly	1
shot	1
back	1
a	1
panel	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
glanced	1
through.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
asleep,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
can	1
see	1
him	1
very	1
well."	1
	1
We	1
both	1
put	1
our	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
grating.	1
The	1
prisoner	1
lay	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
towards	1
us,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
deep	1
sleep,	1
breathing	1
slowly	1
and	1
heavily.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
middle-sized	1
man,	1
coarsely	1
clad	1
as	1
became	1
his	1
calling,	1
with	1
a	1
coloured	1
shirt	1
protruding	1
through	1
the	1
rent	1
in	1
his	1
tattered	1
coat.	1
He	1
was,	1
as	1
the	1
inspector	1
had	1
said,	1
extremely	1
dirty,	1
but	1
the	1
grime	1
which	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
its	1
repulsive	1
ugliness.	1
A	1
broad	1
wheal	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
scar	1
ran	1
right	1
across	1
it	1
from	1
eye	1
to	1
chin,	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
contraction	1
had	1
turned	1
up	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
lip,	1
so	1
that	1
three	1
teeth	1
were	1
exposed	1
in	1
a	1
perpetual	1
snarl.	1
A	1
shock	1
of	1
very	1
bright	1
red	1
hair	1
grew	1
low	1
over	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
forehead.	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
beauty,	1
isn't	1
he?"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector.	1
	1
"He	1
certainly	1
needs	1
a	1
wash,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes.	1
"I	1
had	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
might,	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
bringing	1
the	1
tools	1
with	1
me."	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
Gladstone	1
bag	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
and	1
took	1
out,	1
to	1
my	1
astonishment,	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
bath-sponge.	1
	1
"He!	1
he!	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
funny	1
one,"	1
chuckled	1
the	1
inspector.	1
	1
"Now,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
great	1
goodness	1
to	1
open	1
that	1
door	1
very	1
quietly,	1
we	1
will	1
soon	1
make	1
him	1
cut	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
respectable	1
figure."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
not,"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector.	1
"He	1
doesn't	1
look	1
a	1
credit	1
to	1
the	1
Bow	1
Street	1
cells,	1
does	1
he?"	1
He	1
slipped	1
his	1
key	1
into	1
the	1
lock,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
very	1
quietly	1
entered	1
the	1
cell.	1
The	1
sleeper	1
half	1
turned,	1
and	1
then	1
settled	1
down	1
once	1
more	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
slumber.	1
Holmes	1
stooped	1
to	1
the	1
water-jug,	1
moistened	1
his	1
sponge,	1
and	1
then	1
rubbed	1
it	1
twice	1
vigorously	1
across	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
prisoner's	1
face.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you,"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
"to	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
of	1
Lee,	1
in	1
the	1
county	1
of	1
Kent."	1
	1
Never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
sight.	1
The	1
man's	1
face	1
peeled	1
off	1
under	1
the	1
sponge	1
like	1
the	1
bark	1
from	1
a	1
tree.	1
Gone	1
was	1
the	1
coarse	1
brown	1
tint!	1
Gone,	1
too,	1
was	1
the	1
horrid	1
scar	1
which	1
had	1
seamed	1
it	1
across,	1
and	1
the	1
twisted	1
lip	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
repulsive	1
sneer	1
to	1
the	1
face!	1
A	1
twitch	1
brought	1
away	1
the	1
tangled	1
red	1
hair,	1
and	1
there,	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
bed,	1
was	1
a	1
pale,	1
sad-faced,	1
refined-looking	1
man,	1
black-haired	1
and	1
smooth-skinned,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
staring	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
sleepy	1
bewilderment.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
realising	1
the	1
exposure,	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
scream	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
"Great	1
heavens!"	1
cried	1
the	1
inspector,	1
"it	1
is,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
missing	1
man.	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
photograph."	1
	1
The	1
prisoner	1
turned	1
with	1
the	1
reckless	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
abandons	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
destiny.	1
"Be	1
it	1
so,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"And	1
pray	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
charged	1
with?"	1
	1
"With	1
making	1
away	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.--	1
Oh,	1
come,	1
you	1
can't	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
that	1
unless	1
they	1
make	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
attempted	1
suicide	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector	1
with	1
a	1
grin.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
twenty-seven	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
force,	1
but	1
this	1
really	1
takes	1
the	1
cake."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
am	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
no	1
crime	1
has	1
been	1
committed,	1
and	1
that,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
am	1
illegally	1
detained."	1
	1
"No	1
crime,	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
error	1
has	1
been	1
committed,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"You	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
better	1
to	1
have	1
trusted	1
your	1
wife."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
wife;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
children,"	1
groaned	1
the	1
prisoner.	1
"God	1
help	1
me,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
them	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
father.	1
My	1
God!	1
What	1
an	1
exposure!	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
do?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
couch	1
and	1
patted	1
him	1
kindly	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
law	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
matter	1
up,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"of	1
course	1
you	1
can	1
hardly	1
avoid	1
publicity.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
if	1
you	1
convince	1
the	1
police	1
authorities	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
possible	1
case	1
against	1
you,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
reason	1
that	1
the	1
details	1
should	1
find	1
their	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
papers.	1
Inspector	1
Bradstreet	1
would,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
make	1
notes	1
upon	1
anything	1
which	1
you	1
might	1
tell	1
us	1
and	1
submit	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
proper	1
authorities.	1
The	1
case	1
would	1
then	1
never	1
go	1
into	1
court	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
"God	1
bless	1
you!"	1
cried	1
the	1
prisoner	1
passionately.	1
"I	1
would	1
have	1
endured	1
imprisonment,	1
ay,	1
even	1
execution,	1
rather	1
than	1
have	1
left	1
my	1
miserable	1
secret	1
as	1
a	1
family	1
blot	1
to	1
my	1
children.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
have	1
ever	1
heard	1
my	1
story.	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
schoolmaster	1
in	1
Chesterfield,	1
where	1
I	1
received	1
an	1
excellent	1
education.	1
I	1
travelled	1
in	1
my	1
youth,	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
stage,	1
and	1
finally	1
became	1
a	1
reporter	1
on	1
an	1
evening	1
paper	1
in	1
London.	1
One	1
day	1
my	1
editor	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
articles	1
upon	1
begging	1
in	1
the	1
metropolis,	1
and	1
I	1
volunteered	1
to	1
supply	1
them.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
point	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
my	1
adventures	1
started.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
trying	1
begging	1
as	1
an	1
amateur	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
the	1
facts	1
upon	1
which	1
to	1
base	1
my	1
articles.	1
When	1
an	1
actor	1
I	1
had,	1
of	1
course,	1
learned	1
all	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
making	1
up,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
famous	1
in	1
the	1
green-room	1
for	1
my	1
skill.	1
I	1
took	1
advantage	1
now	1
of	1
my	1
attainments.	1
I	1
painted	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
myself	1
as	1
pitiable	1
as	1
possible	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
good	1
scar	1
and	1
fixed	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
my	1
lip	1
in	1
a	1
twist	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
slip	1
of	1
flesh-coloured	1
plaster.	1
Then	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
head	1
of	1
hair,	1
and	1
an	1
appropriate	1
dress,	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
station	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
ostensibly	1
as	1
a	1
match-seller	1
but	1
really	1
as	1
a	1
beggar.	1
For	1
seven	1
hours	1
I	1
plied	1
my	1
trade,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
returned	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
I	1
found	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
received	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
26s.	1
4d.	1
	1
"I	1
wrote	1
my	1
articles	1
and	1
thought	1
little	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
until,	1
some	1
time	1
later,	1
I	1
backed	1
a	1
bill	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
writ	1
served	1
upon	1
me	1
for	1
25	1
pounds.	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
my	1
wit's	1
end	1
where	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
money,	1
but	1
a	1
sudden	1
idea	1
came	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
begged	1
a	1
fortnight's	1
grace	1
from	1
the	1
creditor,	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
holiday	1
from	1
my	1
employers,	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
begging	1
in	1
the	1
City	1
under	1
my	1
disguise.	1
In	1
ten	1
days	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
had	1
paid	1
the	1
debt.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
can	1
imagine	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
to	1
arduous	1
work	1
at	1
2	1
pounds	1
a	1
week	1
when	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
earn	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
by	1
smearing	1
my	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
paint,	1
laying	1
my	1
cap	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
sitting	1
still.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
fight	1
between	1
my	1
pride	1
and	1
the	1
money,	1
but	1
the	1
dollars	1
won	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
I	1
threw	1
up	1
reporting	1
and	1
sat	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
first	1
chosen,	1
inspiring	1
pity	1
by	1
my	1
ghastly	1
face	1
and	1
filling	1
my	1
pockets	1
with	1
coppers.	1
Only	1
one	1
man	1
knew	1
my	1
secret.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
a	1
low	1
den	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
lodge	1
in	1
Swandam	1
Lane,	1
where	1
I	1
could	1
every	1
morning	1
emerge	1
as	1
a	1
squalid	1
beggar	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evenings	1
transform	1
myself	1
into	1
a	1
well-dressed	1
man	1
about	1
town.	1
This	1
fellow,	1
a	1
Lascar,	1
was	1
well	1
paid	1
by	1
me	1
for	1
his	1
rooms,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
my	1
secret	1
was	1
safe	1
in	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
"Well,	1
very	1
soon	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
saving	1
considerable	1
sums	1
of	1
money.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
any	1
beggar	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
London	1
could	1
earn	1
700	1
pounds	1
a	1
year--which	1
is	1
less	1
than	1
my	1
average	1
takings--but	1
I	1
had	1
exceptional	1
advantages	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
up,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
facility	1
of	1
repartee,	1
which	1
improved	1
by	1
practice	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
quite	1
a	1
recognised	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
City.	1
All	1
day	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
pennies,	1
varied	1
by	1
silver,	1
poured	1
in	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
failed	1
to	1
take	1
2	1
pounds.	1
	1
"As	1
I	1
grew	1
richer	1
I	1
grew	1
more	1
ambitious,	1
took	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
eventually	1
married,	1
without	1
anyone	1
having	1
a	1
suspicion	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
real	1
occupation.	1
My	1
dear	1
wife	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
business	1
in	1
the	1
City.	1
She	1
little	1
knew	1
what.	1
	1
"Last	1
Monday	1
I	1
had	1
finished	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
was	1
dressing	1
in	1
my	1
room	1
above	1
the	1
opium	1
den	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
window	1
and	1
saw,	1
to	1
my	1
horror	1
and	1
astonishment,	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
full	1
upon	1
me.	1
I	1
gave	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
surprise,	1
threw	1
up	1
my	1
arms	1
to	1
cover	1
my	1
face,	1
and,	1
rushing	1
to	1
my	1
confidant,	1
the	1
Lascar,	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
prevent	1
anyone	1
from	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
heard	1
her	1
voice	1
downstairs,	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
ascend.	1
Swiftly	1
I	1
threw	1
off	1
my	1
clothes,	1
pulled	1
on	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
beggar,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
pigments	1
and	1
wig.	1
Even	1
a	1
wife's	1
eyes	1
could	1
not	1
pierce	1
so	1
complete	1
a	1
disguise.	1
But	1
then	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
search	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
clothes	1
might	1
betray	1
me.	1
I	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
reopening	1
by	1
my	1
violence	1
a	1
small	1
cut	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
that	1
morning.	1
Then	1
I	1
seized	1
my	1
coat,	1
which	1
was	1
weighted	1
by	1
the	1
coppers	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
transferred	1
to	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
leather	1
bag	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
carried	1
my	1
takings.	1
I	1
hurled	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
it	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
Thames.	1
The	1
other	1
clothes	1
would	1
have	1
followed,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
constables	1
up	1
the	1
stair,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
I	1
found,	1
rather,	1
I	1
confess,	1
to	1
my	1
relief,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
identified	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
I	1
was	1
arrested	1
as	1
his	1
murderer.	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
else	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
explain.	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
preserve	1
my	1
disguise	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
hence	1
my	1
preference	1
for	1
a	1
dirty	1
face.	1
Knowing	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
would	1
be	1
terribly	1
anxious,	1
I	1
slipped	1
off	1
my	1
ring	1
and	1
confided	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Lascar	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
no	1
constable	1
was	1
watching	1
me,	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
hurried	1
scrawl,	1
telling	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
fear."	1
	1
"That	1
note	1
only	1
reached	1
her	1
yesterday,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Good	1
God!	1
What	1
a	1
week	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
spent!"	1
	1
"The	1
police	1
have	1
watched	1
this	1
Lascar,"	1
said	1
Inspector	1
Bradstreet,	1
"and	1
I	1
can	1
quite	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
post	1
a	1
letter	1
unobserved.	1
Probably	1
he	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
some	1
sailor	1
customer	1
of	1
his,	1
who	1
forgot	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
some	1
days."	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
it,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
nodding	1
approvingly;	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
have	1
you	1
never	1
been	1
prosecuted	1
for	1
begging?"	1
	1
"Many	1
times;	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
to	1
me?"	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
stop	1
here,	1
however,"	1
said	1
Bradstreet.	1
"If	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
to	1
hush	1
this	1
thing	1
up,	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
Hugh	1
Boone."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
sworn	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
oaths	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
take."	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
no	1
further	1
steps	1
may	1
be	1
taken.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
found	1
again,	1
then	1
all	1
must	1
come	1
out.	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
indebted	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
having	1
cleared	1
the	1
matter	1
up.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
you	1
reach	1
your	1
results."	1
	1
"I	1
reached	1
this	1
one,"	1
said	1
my	1
friend,	1
"by	1
sitting	1
upon	1
five	1
pillows	1
and	1
consuming	1
an	1
ounce	1
of	1
shag.	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
drive	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street	1
we	1
shall	1
just	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
breakfast."	1
	1
	1
	1
VII.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
BLUE	1
CARBUNCLE	1
	1
I	1
had	1
called	1
upon	1
my	1
friend	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
upon	1
the	1
second	1
morning	1
after	1
Christmas,	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
wishing	1
him	1
the	1
compliments	1
of	1
the	1
season.	1
He	1
was	1
lounging	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
a	1
purple	1
dressing-gown,	1
a	1
pipe-rack	1
within	1
his	1
reach	1
upon	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
crumpled	1
morning	1
papers,	1
evidently	1
newly	1
studied,	1
near	1
at	1
hand.	1
Beside	1
the	1
couch	1
was	1
a	1
wooden	1
chair,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
back	1
hung	1
a	1
very	1
seedy	1
and	1
disreputable	1
hard-felt	1
hat,	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
wear,	1
and	1
cracked	1
in	1
several	1
places.	1
A	1
lens	1
and	1
a	1
forceps	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
suggested	1
that	1
the	1
hat	1
had	1
been	1
suspended	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
examination.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
engaged,"	1
said	1
I;	1
"perhaps	1
I	1
interrupt	1
you."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
friend	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
discuss	1
my	1
results.	1
The	1
matter	1
is	1
a	1
perfectly	1
trivial	1
one"--he	1
jerked	1
his	1
thumb	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
hat--"but	1
there	1
are	1
points	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
it	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
entirely	1
devoid	1
of	1
interest	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
instruction."	1
	1
I	1
seated	1
myself	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
warmed	1
my	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
crackling	1
fire,	1
for	1
a	1
sharp	1
frost	1
had	1
set	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
thick	1
with	1
the	1
ice	1
crystals.	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
"that,	1
homely	1
as	1
it	1
looks,	1
this	1
thing	1
has	1
some	1
deadly	1
story	1
linked	1
on	1
to	1
it--that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
clue	1
which	1
will	1
guide	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
some	1
mystery	1
and	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
some	1
crime."	1
	1
"No,	1
no.	1
No	1
crime,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"Only	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
whimsical	1
little	1
incidents	1
which	1
will	1
happen	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
four	1
million	1
human	1
beings	1
all	1
jostling	1
each	1
other	1
within	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
square	1
miles.	1
Amid	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
reaction	1
of	1
so	1
dense	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
humanity,	1
every	1
possible	1
combination	1
of	1
events	1
may	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
take	1
place,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
little	1
problem	1
will	1
be	1
presented	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
striking	1
and	1
bizarre	1
without	1
being	1
criminal.	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
had	1
experience	1
of	1
such."	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
so,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
"that	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
six	1
cases	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
added	1
to	1
my	1
notes,	1
three	1
have	1
been	1
entirely	1
free	1
of	1
any	1
legal	1
crime."	1
	1
"Precisely.	1
You	1
allude	1
to	1
my	1
attempt	1
to	1
recover	1
the	1
Irene	1
Adler	1
papers,	1
to	1
the	1
singular	1
case	1
of	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
twisted	1
lip.	1
Well,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
small	1
matter	1
will	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
innocent	1
category.	1
You	1
know	1
Peterson,	1
the	1
commissionaire?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
trophy	1
belongs."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
his	1
hat."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
he	1
found	1
it.	1
Its	1
owner	1
is	1
unknown.	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
look	1
upon	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
battered	1
billycock	1
but	1
as	1
an	1
intellectual	1
problem.	1
And,	1
first,	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
it	1
came	1
here.	1
It	1
arrived	1
upon	1
Christmas	1
morning,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
fat	1
goose,	1
which	1
is,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt,	1
roasting	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Peterson's	1
fire.	1
The	1
facts	1
are	1
these:	1
about	1
four	1
o'clock	1
on	1
Christmas	1
morning,	1
Peterson,	1
who,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
honest	1
fellow,	1
was	1
returning	1
from	1
some	1
small	1
jollification	1
and	1
was	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
homeward	1
down	1
Tottenham	1
Court	1
Road.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
saw,	1
in	1
the	1
gaslight,	1
a	1
tallish	1
man,	1
walking	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
stagger,	1
and	1
carrying	1
a	1
white	1
goose	1
slung	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
As	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Goodge	1
Street,	1
a	1
row	1
broke	1
out	1
between	1
this	1
stranger	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
knot	1
of	1
roughs.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
knocked	1
off	1
the	1
man's	1
hat,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
stick	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
and,	1
swinging	1
it	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
smashed	1
the	1
shop	1
window	1
behind	1
him.	1
Peterson	1
had	1
rushed	1
forward	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
stranger	1
from	1
his	1
assailants;	1
but	1
the	1
man,	1
shocked	1
at	1
having	1
broken	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
seeing	1
an	1
official-looking	1
person	1
in	1
uniform	1
rushing	1
towards	1
him,	1
dropped	1
his	1
goose,	1
took	1
to	1
his	1
heels,	1
and	1
vanished	1
amid	1
the	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
small	1
streets	1
which	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
Tottenham	1
Court	1
Road.	1
The	1
roughs	1
had	1
also	1
fled	1
at	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
Peterson,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
victory	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
this	1
battered	1
hat	1
and	1
a	1
most	1
unimpeachable	1
Christmas	1
goose."	1
	1
"Which	1
surely	1
he	1
restored	1
to	1
their	1
owner?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
there	1
lies	1
the	1
problem.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
'For	1
Mrs.	1
Henry	1
Baker'	1
was	1
printed	1
upon	1
a	1
small	1
card	1
which	1
was	1
tied	1
to	1
the	1
bird's	1
left	1
leg,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
initials	1
'H.	1
B.'	1
are	1
legible	1
upon	1
the	1
lining	1
of	1
this	1
hat,	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
thousands	1
of	1
Bakers,	1
and	1
some	1
hundreds	1
of	1
Henry	1
Bakers	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
of	1
ours,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
restore	1
lost	1
property	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
"What,	1
then,	1
did	1
Peterson	1
do?"	1
	1
"He	1
brought	1
round	1
both	1
hat	1
and	1
goose	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
Christmas	1
morning,	1
knowing	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
smallest	1
problems	1
are	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
me.	1
The	1
goose	1
we	1
retained	1
until	1
this	1
morning,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
signs	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
slight	1
frost,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
eaten	1
without	1
unnecessary	1
delay.	1
Its	1
finder	1
has	1
carried	1
it	1
off,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
ultimate	1
destiny	1
of	1
a	1
goose,	1
while	1
I	1
continue	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
hat	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
gentleman	1
who	1
lost	1
his	1
Christmas	1
dinner."	1
	1
"Did	1
he	1
not	1
advertise?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"Then,	1
what	1
clue	1
could	1
you	1
have	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
identity?"	1
	1
"Only	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
deduce."	1
	1
"From	1
his	1
hat?"	1
	1
"Precisely."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
are	1
joking.	1
What	1
can	1
you	1
gather	1
from	1
this	1
old	1
battered	1
felt?"	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
my	1
lens.	1
You	1
know	1
my	1
methods.	1
What	1
can	1
you	1
gather	1
yourself	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
individuality	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
worn	1
this	1
article?"	1
	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
tattered	1
object	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
over	1
rather	1
ruefully.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
ordinary	1
black	1
hat	1
of	1
the	1
usual	1
round	1
shape,	1
hard	1
and	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
wear.	1
The	1
lining	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
red	1
silk,	1
but	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
discoloured.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
maker's	1
name;	1
but,	1
as	1
Holmes	1
had	1
remarked,	1
the	1
initials	1
"H.	1
B."	1
were	1
scrawled	1
upon	1
one	1
side.	1
It	1
was	1
pierced	1
in	1
the	1
brim	1
for	1
a	1
hat-securer,	1
but	1
the	1
elastic	1
was	1
missing.	1
For	1
the	1
rest,	1
it	1
was	1
cracked,	1
exceedingly	1
dusty,	1
and	1
spotted	1
in	1
several	1
places,	1
although	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
attempt	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
discoloured	1
patches	1
by	1
smearing	1
them	1
with	1
ink.	1
	1
"I	1
can	1
see	1
nothing,"	1
said	1
I,	1
handing	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
friend.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
Watson,	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
everything.	1
You	1
fail,	1
however,	1
to	1
reason	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
see.	1
You	1
are	1
too	1
timid	1
in	1
drawing	1
your	1
inferences."	1
	1
"Then,	1
pray	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
infer	1
from	1
this	1
hat?"	1
	1
He	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
peculiar	1
introspective	1
fashion	1
which	1
was	1
characteristic	1
of	1
him.	1
"It	1
is	1
perhaps	1
less	1
suggestive	1
than	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"and	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
inferences	1
which	1
are	1
very	1
distinct,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
others	1
which	1
represent	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
strong	1
balance	1
of	1
probability.	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
highly	1
intellectual	1
is	1
of	1
course	1
obvious	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
fairly	1
well-to-do	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
three	1
years,	1
although	1
he	1
has	1
now	1
fallen	1
upon	1
evil	1
days.	1
He	1
had	1
foresight,	1
but	1
has	1
less	1
now	1
than	1
formerly,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
moral	1
retrogression,	1
which,	1
when	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
his	1
fortunes,	1
seems	1
to	1
indicate	1
some	1
evil	1
influence,	1
probably	1
drink,	1
at	1
work	1
upon	1
him.	1
This	1
may	1
account	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
obvious	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
has	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
him."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Holmes!"	1
	1
"He	1
has,	1
however,	1
retained	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
self-respect,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
disregarding	1
my	1
remonstrance.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
leads	1
a	1
sedentary	1
life,	1
goes	1
out	1
little,	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
training	1
entirely,	1
is	1
middle-aged,	1
has	1
grizzled	1
hair	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
cut	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
anoints	1
with	1
lime-cream.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
more	1
patent	1
facts	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
deduced	1
from	1
his	1
hat.	1
Also,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
extremely	1
improbable	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
gas	1
laid	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
house."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
certainly	1
joking,	1
Holmes."	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
even	1
now,	1
when	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
these	1
results,	1
you	1
are	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
are	1
attained?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
stupid,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
follow	1
you.	1
For	1
example,	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
deduce	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
intellectual?"	1
	1
For	1
answer	1
Holmes	1
clapped	1
the	1
hat	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
It	1
came	1
right	1
over	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
settled	1
upon	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
his	1
nose.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
cubic	1
capacity,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"a	1
man	1
with	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
brain	1
must	1
have	1
something	1
in	1
it."	1
	1
"The	1
decline	1
of	1
his	1
fortunes,	1
then?"	1
	1
"This	1
hat	1
is	1
three	1
years	1
old.	1
These	1
flat	1
brims	1
curled	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
came	1
in	1
then.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
hat	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
quality.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
band	1
of	1
ribbed	1
silk	1
and	1
the	1
excellent	1
lining.	1
If	1
this	1
man	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
buy	1
so	1
expensive	1
a	1
hat	1
three	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
has	1
had	1
no	1
hat	1
since,	1
then	1
he	1
has	1
assuredly	1
gone	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
clear	1
enough,	1
certainly.	1
But	1
how	1
about	1
the	1
foresight	1
and	1
the	1
moral	1
retrogression?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
laughed.	1
"Here	1
is	1
the	1
foresight,"	1
said	1
he	1
putting	1
his	1
finger	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
disc	1
and	1
loop	1
of	1
the	1
hat-securer.	1
"They	1
are	1
never	1
sold	1
upon	1
hats.	1
If	1
this	1
man	1
ordered	1
one,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
foresight,	1
since	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
take	1
this	1
precaution	1
against	1
the	1
wind.	1
But	1
since	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
broken	1
the	1
elastic	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
troubled	1
to	1
replace	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
less	1
foresight	1
now	1
than	1
formerly,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
distinct	1
proof	1
of	1
a	1
weakening	1
nature.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
he	1
has	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
conceal	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
stains	1
upon	1
the	1
felt	1
by	1
daubing	1
them	1
with	1
ink,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
entirely	1
lost	1
his	1
self-respect."	1
	1
"Your	1
reasoning	1
is	1
certainly	1
plausible."	1
	1
"The	1
further	1
points,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
middle-aged,	1
that	1
his	1
hair	1
is	1
grizzled,	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
recently	1
cut,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
uses	1
lime-cream,	1
are	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
from	1
a	1
close	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
lining.	1
The	1
lens	1
discloses	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
hair-ends,	1
clean	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
scissors	1
of	1
the	1
barber.	1
They	1
all	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
adhesive,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
distinct	1
odour	1
of	1
lime-cream.	1
This	1
dust,	1
you	1
will	1
observe,	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
gritty,	1
grey	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
but	1
the	1
fluffy	1
brown	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
showing	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
hung	1
up	1
indoors	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
time,	1
while	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
moisture	1
upon	1
the	1
inside	1
are	1
proof	1
positive	1
that	1
the	1
wearer	1
perspired	1
very	1
freely,	1
and	1
could	1
therefore,	1
hardly	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
training."	1
	1
"But	1
his	1
wife--you	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
him."	1
	1
"This	1
hat	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
brushed	1
for	1
weeks.	1
When	1
I	1
see	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
Watson,	1
with	1
a	1
week's	1
accumulation	1
of	1
dust	1
upon	1
your	1
hat,	1
and	1
when	1
your	1
wife	1
allows	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state,	1
I	1
shall	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
also	1
have	1
been	1
unfortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
lose	1
your	1
wife's	1
affection."	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
bachelor."	1
	1
"Nay,	1
he	1
was	1
bringing	1
home	1
the	1
goose	1
as	1
a	1
peace-offering	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
Remember	1
the	1
card	1
upon	1
the	1
bird's	1
leg."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
everything.	1
But	1
how	1
on	1
earth	1
do	1
you	1
deduce	1
that	1
the	1
gas	1
is	1
not	1
laid	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
house?"	1
	1
"One	1
tallow	1
stain,	1
or	1
even	1
two,	1
might	1
come	1
by	1
chance;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
five,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
individual	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
frequent	1
contact	1
with	1
burning	1
tallow--walks	1
upstairs	1
at	1
night	1
probably	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
guttering	1
candle	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
Anyhow,	1
he	1
never	1
got	1
tallow-stains	1
from	1
a	1
gas-jet.	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
ingenious,"	1
said	1
I,	1
laughing;	1
"but	1
since,	1
as	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now,	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
crime	1
committed,	1
and	1
no	1
harm	1
done	1
save	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
goose,	1
all	1
this	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
rather	1
a	1
waste	1
of	1
energy."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
reply,	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
flew	1
open,	1
and	1
Peterson,	1
the	1
commissionaire,	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
apartment	1
with	1
flushed	1
cheeks	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
dazed	1
with	1
astonishment.	1
	1
"The	1
goose,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes!	1
The	1
goose,	1
sir!"	1
he	1
gasped.	1
	1
"Eh?	1
What	1
of	1
it,	1
then?	1
Has	1
it	1
returned	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
flapped	1
off	1
through	1
the	1
kitchen	1
window?"	1
Holmes	1
twisted	1
himself	1
round	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
fairer	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
excited	1
face.	1
	1
"See	1
here,	1
sir!	1
See	1
what	1
my	1
wife	1
found	1
in	1
its	1
crop!"	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
displayed	1
upon	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
palm	1
a	1
brilliantly	1
scintillating	1
blue	1
stone,	1
rather	1
smaller	1
than	1
a	1
bean	1
in	1
size,	1
but	1
of	1
such	1
purity	1
and	1
radiance	1
that	1
it	1
twinkled	1
like	1
an	1
electric	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
whistle.	1
"By	1
Jove,	1
Peterson!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"this	1
is	1
treasure	1
trove	1
indeed.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
got?"	1
	1
"A	1
diamond,	1
sir?	1
A	1
precious	1
stone.	1
It	1
cuts	1
into	1
glass	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
putty."	1
	1
"It's	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
precious	1
stone.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
precious	1
stone."	1
	1
"Not	1
the	1
Countess	1
of	1
Morcar's	1
blue	1
carbuncle!"	1
I	1
ejaculated.	1
	1
"Precisely	1
so.	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
its	1
size	1
and	1
shape,	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
advertisement	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
The	1
Times	1
every	1
day	1
lately.	1
It	1
is	1
absolutely	1
unique,	1
and	1
its	1
value	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
conjectured,	1
but	1
the	1
reward	1
offered	1
of	1
1000	1
pounds	1
is	1
certainly	1
not	1
within	1
a	1
twentieth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
market	1
price."	1
	1
"A	1
thousand	1
pounds!	1
Great	1
Lord	1
of	1
mercy!"	1
The	1
commissionaire	1
plumped	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
stared	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
reward,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
sentimental	1
considerations	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
which	1
would	1
induce	1
the	1
Countess	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
half	1
her	1
fortune	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
but	1
recover	1
the	1
gem."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
lost,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
aright,	1
at	1
the	1
Hotel	1
Cosmopolitan,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Precisely	1
so,	1
on	1
December	1
22nd,	1
just	1
five	1
days	1
ago.	1
John	1
Horner,	1
a	1
plumber,	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
having	1
abstracted	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
lady's	1
jewel-case.	1
The	1
evidence	1
against	1
him	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
the	1
case	1
has	1
been	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
Assizes.	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
here,	1
I	1
believe."	1
He	1
rummaged	1
amid	1
his	1
newspapers,	1
glancing	1
over	1
the	1
dates,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
smoothed	1
one	1
out,	1
doubled	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
following	1
paragraph:	1
	1
"Hotel	1
Cosmopolitan	1
Jewel	1
Robbery.	1
John	1
Horner,	1
26,	1
plumber,	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
having	1
upon	1
the	1
22nd	1
inst.,	1
abstracted	1
from	1
the	1
jewel-case	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
of	1
Morcar	1
the	1
valuable	1
gem	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
blue	1
carbuncle.	1
James	1
Ryder,	1
upper-attendant	1
at	1
the	1
hotel,	1
gave	1
his	1
evidence	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shown	1
Horner	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dressing-room	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
of	1
Morcar	1
upon	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
robbery	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
solder	1
the	1
second	1
bar	1
of	1
the	1
grate,	1
which	1
was	1
loose.	1
He	1
had	1
remained	1
with	1
Horner	1
some	1
little	1
time,	1
but	1
had	1
finally	1
been	1
called	1
away.	1
On	1
returning,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
Horner	1
had	1
disappeared,	1
that	1
the	1
bureau	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
open,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
small	1
morocco	1
casket	1
in	1
which,	1
as	1
it	1
afterwards	1
transpired,	1
the	1
Countess	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
jewel,	1
was	1
lying	1
empty	1
upon	1
the	1
dressing-table.	1
Ryder	1
instantly	1
gave	1
the	1
alarm,	1
and	1
Horner	1
was	1
arrested	1
the	1
same	1
evening;	1
but	1
the	1
stone	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
either	1
upon	1
his	1
person	1
or	1
in	1
his	1
rooms.	1
Catherine	1
Cusack,	1
maid	1
to	1
the	1
Countess,	1
deposed	1
to	1
having	1
heard	1
Ryder's	1
cry	1
of	1
dismay	1
on	1
discovering	1
the	1
robbery,	1
and	1
to	1
having	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
where	1
she	1
found	1
matters	1
as	1
described	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
witness.	1
Inspector	1
Bradstreet,	1
B	1
division,	1
gave	1
evidence	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
arrest	1
of	1
Horner,	1
who	1
struggled	1
frantically,	1
and	1
protested	1
his	1
innocence	1
in	1
the	1
strongest	1
terms.	1
Evidence	1
of	1
a	1
previous	1
conviction	1
for	1
robbery	1
having	1
been	1
given	1
against	1
the	1
prisoner,	1
the	1
magistrate	1
refused	1
to	1
deal	1
summarily	1
with	1
the	1
offence,	1
but	1
referred	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Assizes.	1
Horner,	1
who	1
had	1
shown	1
signs	1
of	1
intense	1
emotion	1
during	1
the	1
proceedings,	1
fainted	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
conclusion	1
and	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
of	1
court."	1
	1
"Hum!	1
So	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
police-court,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
thoughtfully,	1
tossing	1
aside	1
the	1
paper.	1
"The	1
question	1
for	1
us	1
now	1
to	1
solve	1
is	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
events	1
leading	1
from	1
a	1
rifled	1
jewel-case	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
crop	1
of	1
a	1
goose	1
in	1
Tottenham	1
Court	1
Road	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
You	1
see,	1
Watson,	1
our	1
little	1
deductions	1
have	1
suddenly	1
assumed	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
important	1
and	1
less	1
innocent	1
aspect.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
stone;	1
the	1
stone	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
goose,	1
and	1
the	1
goose	1
came	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker,	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
bad	1
hat	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
characteristics	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
bored	1
you.	1
So	1
now	1
we	1
must	1
set	1
ourselves	1
very	1
seriously	1
to	1
finding	1
this	1
gentleman	1
and	1
ascertaining	1
what	1
part	1
he	1
has	1
played	1
in	1
this	1
little	1
mystery.	1
To	1
do	1
this,	1
we	1
must	1
try	1
the	1
simplest	1
means	1
first,	1
and	1
these	1
lie	1
undoubtedly	1
in	1
an	1
advertisement	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
papers.	1
If	1
this	1
fail,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
other	1
methods."	1
	1
"What	1
will	1
you	1
say?"	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
a	1
pencil	1
and	1
that	1
slip	1
of	1
paper.	1
Now,	1
then:	1
'Found	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Goodge	1
Street,	1
a	1
goose	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
felt	1
hat.	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker	1
can	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
by	1
applying	1
at	1
6:30	1
this	1
evening	1
at	1
221B,	1
Baker	1
Street.'	1
That	1
is	1
clear	1
and	1
concise."	1
	1
"Very.	1
But	1
will	1
he	1
see	1
it?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
he	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
keep	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
papers,	1
since,	1
to	1
a	1
poor	1
man,	1
the	1
loss	1
was	1
a	1
heavy	1
one.	1
He	1
was	1
clearly	1
so	1
scared	1
by	1
his	1
mischance	1
in	1
breaking	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
Peterson	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
flight,	1
but	1
since	1
then	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
bitterly	1
regretted	1
the	1
impulse	1
which	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
drop	1
his	1
bird.	1
Then,	1
again,	1
the	1
introduction	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
it,	1
for	1
everyone	1
who	1
knows	1
him	1
will	1
direct	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
it.	1
Here	1
you	1
are,	1
Peterson,	1
run	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
advertising	1
agency	1
and	1
have	1
this	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
papers."	1
	1
"In	1
which,	1
sir?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
in	1
the	1
Globe,	1
Star,	1
Pall	1
Mall,	1
St.	1
James's,	1
Evening	1
News,	1
Standard,	1
Echo,	1
and	1
any	1
others	1
that	1
occur	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
sir.	1
And	1
this	1
stone?"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes,	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
stone.	1
Thank	1
you.	1
And,	1
I	1
say,	1
Peterson,	1
just	1
buy	1
a	1
goose	1
on	1
your	1
way	1
back	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
here	1
with	1
me,	1
for	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
one	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
this	1
gentleman	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
your	1
family	1
is	1
now	1
devouring."	1
	1
When	1
the	1
commissionaire	1
had	1
gone,	1
Holmes	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
stone	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
against	1
the	1
light.	1
"It's	1
a	1
bonny	1
thing,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Just	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
glints	1
and	1
sparkles.	1
Of	1
course	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
nucleus	1
and	1
focus	1
of	1
crime.	1
Every	1
good	1
stone	1
is.	1
They	1
are	1
the	1
devil's	1
pet	1
baits.	1
In	1
the	1
larger	1
and	1
older	1
jewels	1
every	1
facet	1
may	1
stand	1
for	1
a	1
bloody	1
deed.	1
This	1
stone	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
twenty	1
years	1
old.	1
It	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
Amoy	1
River	1
in	1
southern	1
China	1
and	1
is	1
remarkable	1
in	1
having	1
every	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
carbuncle,	1
save	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
blue	1
in	1
shade	1
instead	1
of	1
ruby	1
red.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
its	1
youth,	1
it	1
has	1
already	1
a	1
sinister	1
history.	1
There	1
have	1
been	1
two	1
murders,	1
a	1
vitriol-throwing,	1
a	1
suicide,	1
and	1
several	1
robberies	1
brought	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
this	1
forty-grain	1
weight	1
of	1
crystallised	1
charcoal.	1
Who	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
so	1
pretty	1
a	1
toy	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
purveyor	1
to	1
the	1
gallows	1
and	1
the	1
prison?	1
I'll	1
lock	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
strong	1
box	1
now	1
and	1
drop	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
it."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
Horner	1
is	1
innocent?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
tell."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
do	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
this	1
other	1
one,	1
Henry	1
Baker,	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"It	1
is,	1
I	1
think,	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
that	1
Henry	1
Baker	1
is	1
an	1
absolutely	1
innocent	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
bird	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
carrying	1
was	1
of	1
considerably	1
more	1
value	1
than	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
solid	1
gold.	1
That,	1
however,	1
I	1
shall	1
determine	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
test	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
our	1
advertisement."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
until	1
then?"	1
	1
"Nothing."	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
I	1
shall	1
continue	1
my	1
professional	1
round.	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
you	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
so	1
tangled	1
a	1
business."	1
	1
"Very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
I	1
dine	1
at	1
seven.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
woodcock,	1
I	1
believe.	1
By	1
the	1
way,	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
recent	1
occurrences,	1
perhaps	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
ask	1
Mrs.	1
Hudson	1
to	1
examine	1
its	1
crop."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
delayed	1
at	1
a	1
case,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
after	1
half-past	1
six	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street	1
once	1
more.	1
As	1
I	1
approached	1
the	1
house	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
Scotch	1
bonnet	1
with	1
a	1
coat	1
which	1
was	1
buttoned	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
chin	1
waiting	1
outside	1
in	1
the	1
bright	1
semicircle	1
which	1
was	1
thrown	1
from	1
the	1
fanlight.	1
Just	1
as	1
I	1
arrived	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
opened,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
shown	1
up	1
together	1
to	1
Holmes'	1
room.	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker,	1
I	1
believe,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
greeting	1
his	1
visitor	1
with	1
the	1
easy	1
air	1
of	1
geniality	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
so	1
readily	1
assume.	1
"Pray	1
take	1
this	1
chair	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
Mr.	1
Baker.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
cold	1
night,	1
and	1
I	1
observe	1
that	1
your	1
circulation	1
is	1
more	1
adapted	1
for	1
summer	1
than	1
for	1
winter.	1
Ah,	1
Watson,	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time.	1
Is	1
that	1
your	1
hat,	1
Mr.	1
Baker?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
that	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
my	1
hat."	1
	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
man	1
with	1
rounded	1
shoulders,	1
a	1
massive	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
broad,	1
intelligent	1
face,	1
sloping	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
pointed	1
beard	1
of	1
grizzled	1
brown.	1
A	1
touch	1
of	1
red	1
in	1
nose	1
and	1
cheeks,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
tremor	1
of	1
his	1
extended	1
hand,	1
recalled	1
Holmes'	1
surmise	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
habits.	1
His	1
rusty	1
black	1
frock-coat	1
was	1
buttoned	1
right	1
up	1
in	1
front,	1
with	1
the	1
collar	1
turned	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
lank	1
wrists	1
protruded	1
from	1
his	1
sleeves	1
without	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
cuff	1
or	1
shirt.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
slow	1
staccato	1
fashion,	1
choosing	1
his	1
words	1
with	1
care,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
impression	1
generally	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
learning	1
and	1
letters	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
ill-usage	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
fortune.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
retained	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
some	1
days,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"because	1
we	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
an	1
advertisement	1
from	1
you	1
giving	1
your	1
address.	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
know	1
now	1
why	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
advertise."	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
gave	1
a	1
rather	1
shamefaced	1
laugh.	1
"Shillings	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
plentiful	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
they	1
once	1
were,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"I	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
gang	1
of	1
roughs	1
who	1
assaulted	1
me	1
had	1
carried	1
off	1
both	1
my	1
hat	1
and	1
the	1
bird.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
spend	1
more	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
hopeless	1
attempt	1
at	1
recovering	1
them."	1
	1
"Very	1
naturally.	1
By	1
the	1
way,	1
about	1
the	1
bird,	1
we	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
eat	1
it."	1
	1
"To	1
eat	1
it!"	1
Our	1
visitor	1
half	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
in	1
his	1
excitement.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anyone	1
had	1
we	1
not	1
done	1
so.	1
But	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
this	1
other	1
goose	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
which	1
is	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
weight	1
and	1
perfectly	1
fresh,	1
will	1
answer	1
your	1
purpose	1
equally	1
well?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
certainly,	1
certainly,"	1
answered	1
Mr.	1
Baker	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief.	1
	1
"Of	1
course,	1
we	1
still	1
have	1
the	1
feathers,	1
legs,	1
crop,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
bird,	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
wish--"	1
	1
The	1
man	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
hearty	1
laugh.	1
"They	1
might	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
relics	1
of	1
my	1
adventure,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
beyond	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
see	1
what	1
use	1
the	1
disjecta	1
membra	1
of	1
my	1
late	1
acquaintance	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
me.	1
No,	1
sir,	1
I	1
think	1
that,	1
with	1
your	1
permission,	1
I	1
will	1
confine	1
my	1
attentions	1
to	1
the	1
excellent	1
bird	1
which	1
I	1
perceive	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
glanced	1
sharply	1
across	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
shrug	1
of	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
your	1
hat,	1
then,	1
and	1
there	1
your	1
bird,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
would	1
it	1
bore	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
you	1
got	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
from?	1
I	1
am	1
somewhat	1
of	1
a	1
fowl	1
fancier,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
seldom	1
seen	1
a	1
better	1
grown	1
goose."	1
	1
"Certainly,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Baker,	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
tucked	1
his	1
newly	1
gained	1
property	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
"There	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
frequent	1
the	1
Alpha	1
Inn,	1
near	1
the	1
Museum--we	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
Museum	1
itself	1
during	1
the	1
day,	1
you	1
understand.	1
This	1
year	1
our	1
good	1
host,	1
Windigate	1
by	1
name,	1
instituted	1
a	1
goose	1
club,	1
by	1
which,	1
on	1
consideration	1
of	1
some	1
few	1
pence	1
every	1
week,	1
we	1
were	1
each	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
bird	1
at	1
Christmas.	1
My	1
pence	1
were	1
duly	1
paid,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
familiar	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
indebted	1
to	1
you,	1
sir,	1
for	1
a	1
Scotch	1
bonnet	1
is	1
fitted	1
neither	1
to	1
my	1
years	1
nor	1
my	1
gravity."	1
With	1
a	1
comical	1
pomposity	1
of	1
manner	1
he	1
bowed	1
solemnly	1
to	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
strode	1
off	1
upon	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him.	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
about	1
the	1
matter.	1
Are	1
you	1
hungry,	1
Watson?"	1
	1
"Not	1
particularly."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
suggest	1
that	1
we	1
turn	1
our	1
dinner	1
into	1
a	1
supper	1
and	1
follow	1
up	1
this	1
clue	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
hot."	1
	1
"By	1
all	1
means."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bitter	1
night,	1
so	1
we	1
drew	1
on	1
our	1
ulsters	1
and	1
wrapped	1
cravats	1
about	1
our	1
throats.	1
Outside,	1
the	1
stars	1
were	1
shining	1
coldly	1
in	1
a	1
cloudless	1
sky,	1
and	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
passers-by	1
blew	1
out	1
into	1
smoke	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
pistol	1
shots.	1
Our	1
footfalls	1
rang	1
out	1
crisply	1
and	1
loudly	1
as	1
we	1
swung	1
through	1
the	1
doctors'	1
quarter,	1
Wimpole	1
Street,	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
and	1
so	1
through	1
Wigmore	1
Street	1
into	1
Oxford	1
Street.	1
In	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
Bloomsbury	1
at	1
the	1
Alpha	1
Inn,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
public-house	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
which	1
runs	1
down	1
into	1
Holborn.	1
Holmes	1
pushed	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
private	1
bar	1
and	1
ordered	1
two	1
glasses	1
of	1
beer	1
from	1
the	1
ruddy-faced,	1
white-aproned	1
landlord.	1
	1
"Your	1
beer	1
should	1
be	1
excellent	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
your	1
geese,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"My	1
geese!"	1
The	1
man	1
seemed	1
surprised.	1
	1
"Yes.	1
I	1
was	1
speaking	1
only	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
your	1
goose	1
club."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
yes,	1
I	1
see.	1
But	1
you	1
see,	1
sir,	1
them's	1
not	1
our	1
geese."	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
Whose,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
got	1
the	1
two	1
dozen	1
from	1
a	1
salesman	1
in	1
Covent	1
Garden."	1
	1
"Indeed?	1
I	1
know	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
Which	1
was	1
it?"	1
	1
"Breckinridge	1
is	1
his	1
name."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
him.	1
Well,	1
here's	1
your	1
good	1
health	1
landlord,	1
and	1
prosperity	1
to	1
your	1
house.	1
Good-night."	1
	1
"Now	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Breckinridge,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
we	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
frosty	1
air.	1
"Remember,	1
Watson	1
that	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
so	1
homely	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
goose	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
chain,	1
we	1
have	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
will	1
certainly	1
get	1
seven	1
years'	1
penal	1
servitude	1
unless	1
we	1
can	1
establish	1
his	1
innocence.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
our	1
inquiry	1
may	1
but	1
confirm	1
his	1
guilt;	1
but,	1
in	1
any	1
case,	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
investigation	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
missed	1
by	1
the	1
police,	1
and	1
which	1
a	1
singular	1
chance	1
has	1
placed	1
in	1
our	1
hands.	1
Let	1
us	1
follow	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
bitter	1
end.	1
Faces	1
to	1
the	1
south,	1
then,	1
and	1
quick	1
march!"	1
	1
We	1
passed	1
across	1
Holborn,	1
down	1
Endell	1
Street,	1
and	1
so	1
through	1
a	1
zigzag	1
of	1
slums	1
to	1
Covent	1
Garden	1
Market.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
stalls	1
bore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Breckinridge	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
proprietor	1
a	1
horsey-looking	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
face	1
and	1
trim	1
side-whiskers	1
was	1
helping	1
a	1
boy	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
shutters.	1
	1
"Good-evening.	1
It's	1
a	1
cold	1
night,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
The	1
salesman	1
nodded	1
and	1
shot	1
a	1
questioning	1
glance	1
at	1
my	1
companion.	1
	1
"Sold	1
out	1
of	1
geese,	1
I	1
see,"	1
continued	1
Holmes,	1
pointing	1
at	1
the	1
bare	1
slabs	1
of	1
marble.	1
	1
"Let	1
you	1
have	1
five	1
hundred	1
to-morrow	1
morning."	1
	1
"That's	1
no	1
good."	1
	1
"Well,	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
on	1
the	1
stall	1
with	1
the	1
gas-flare."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
recommended	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Who	1
by?"	1
	1
"The	1
landlord	1
of	1
the	1
Alpha."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes;	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen."	1
	1
"Fine	1
birds	1
they	1
were,	1
too.	1
Now	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
them	1
from?"	1
	1
To	1
my	1
surprise	1
the	1
question	1
provoked	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
anger	1
from	1
the	1
salesman.	1
	1
"Now,	1
then,	1
mister,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
cocked	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
akimbo,	1
"what	1
are	1
you	1
driving	1
at?	1
Let's	1
have	1
it	1
straight,	1
now."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
straight	1
enough.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
sold	1
you	1
the	1
geese	1
which	1
you	1
supplied	1
to	1
the	1
Alpha."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
I	1
shan't	1
tell	1
you.	1
So	1
now!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
no	1
importance;	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
warm	1
over	1
such	1
a	1
trifle."	1
	1
"Warm!	1
You'd	1
be	1
as	1
warm,	1
maybe,	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
as	1
pestered	1
as	1
I	1
am.	1
When	1
I	1
pay	1
good	1
money	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
article	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
business;	1
but	1
it's	1
'Where	1
are	1
the	1
geese?'	1
and	1
'Who	1
did	1
you	1
sell	1
the	1
geese	1
to?'	1
and	1
'What	1
will	1
you	1
take	1
for	1
the	1
geese?'	1
One	1
would	1
think	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
geese	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
fuss	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
over	1
them."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
inquiries,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
carelessly.	1
"If	1
you	1
won't	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
bet	1
is	1
off,	1
that	1
is	1
all.	1
But	1
I'm	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
back	1
my	1
opinion	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fowls,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
fiver	1
on	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
bird	1
I	1
ate	1
is	1
country	1
bred."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
you've	1
lost	1
your	1
fiver,	1
for	1
it's	1
town	1
bred,"	1
snapped	1
the	1
salesman.	1
	1
"It's	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind."	1
	1
"I	1
say	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it."	1
	1
"D'you	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
fowls	1
than	1
I,	1
who	1
have	1
handled	1
them	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
nipper?	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
all	1
those	1
birds	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Alpha	1
were	1
town	1
bred."	1
	1
"You'll	1
never	1
persuade	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
that."	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
bet,	1
then?"	1
	1
"It's	1
merely	1
taking	1
your	1
money,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
right.	1
But	1
I'll	1
have	1
a	1
sovereign	1
on	1
with	1
you,	1
just	1
to	1
teach	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
obstinate."	1
	1
The	1
salesman	1
chuckled	1
grimly.	1
"Bring	1
me	1
the	1
books,	1
Bill,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
small	1
boy	1
brought	1
round	1
a	1
small	1
thin	1
volume	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
greasy-backed	1
one,	1
laying	1
them	1
out	1
together	1
beneath	1
the	1
hanging	1
lamp.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
Mr.	1
Cocksure,"	1
said	1
the	1
salesman,	1
"I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
geese,	1
but	1
before	1
I	1
finish	1
you'll	1
find	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
one	1
left	1
in	1
my	1
shop.	1
You	1
see	1
this	1
little	1
book?"	1
	1
"Well?"	1
	1
"That's	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
folk	1
from	1
whom	1
I	1
buy.	1
D'you	1
see?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
here	1
on	1
this	1
page	1
are	1
the	1
country	1
folk,	1
and	1
the	1
numbers	1
after	1
their	1
names	1
are	1
where	1
their	1
accounts	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
ledger.	1
Now,	1
then!	1
You	1
see	1
this	1
other	1
page	1
in	1
red	1
ink?	1
Well,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
my	1
town	1
suppliers.	1
Now,	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
third	1
name.	1
Just	1
read	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Mrs.	1
Oakshott,	1
117,	1
Brixton	1
Road--249,"	1
read	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
Now	1
turn	1
that	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
ledger."	1
	1
Holmes	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
page	1
indicated.	1
"Here	1
you	1
are,	1
'Mrs.	1
Oakshott,	1
117,	1
Brixton	1
Road,	1
egg	1
and	1
poultry	1
supplier.'"	1
	1
"Now,	1
then,	1
what's	1
the	1
last	1
entry?"	1
	1
"'December	1
22nd.	1
Twenty-four	1
geese	1
at	1
7s.	1
6d.'"	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
There	1
you	1
are.	1
And	1
underneath?"	1
	1
"'Sold	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Windigate	1
of	1
the	1
Alpha,	1
at	1
12s.'"	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
now?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
looked	1
deeply	1
chagrined.	1
He	1
drew	1
a	1
sovereign	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
slab,	1
turning	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
disgust	1
is	1
too	1
deep	1
for	1
words.	1
A	1
few	1
yards	1
off	1
he	1
stopped	1
under	1
a	1
lamp-post	1
and	1
laughed	1
in	1
the	1
hearty,	1
noiseless	1
fashion	1
which	1
was	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"When	1
you	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
whiskers	1
of	1
that	1
cut	1
and	1
the	1
'Pink	1
'un'	1
protruding	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket,	1
you	1
can	1
always	1
draw	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
bet,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
daresay	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
put	1
100	1
pounds	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
such	1
complete	1
information	1
as	1
was	1
drawn	1
from	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
me	1
on	1
a	1
wager.	1
Well,	1
Watson,	1
we	1
are,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
nearing	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
our	1
quest,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
point	1
which	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
determined	1
is	1
whether	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
this	1
Mrs.	1
Oakshott	1
to-night,	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
should	1
reserve	1
it	1
for	1
to-morrow.	1
It	1
is	1
clear	1
from	1
what	1
that	1
surly	1
fellow	1
said	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
besides	1
ourselves	1
who	1
are	1
anxious	1
about	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
I	1
should--"	1
	1
His	1
remarks	1
were	1
suddenly	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
a	1
loud	1
hubbub	1
which	1
broke	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
stall	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
left.	1
Turning	1
round	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
little	1
rat-faced	1
fellow	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
yellow	1
light	1
which	1
was	1
thrown	1
by	1
the	1
swinging	1
lamp,	1
while	1
Breckinridge,	1
the	1
salesman,	1
framed	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
stall,	1
was	1
shaking	1
his	1
fists	1
fiercely	1
at	1
the	1
cringing	1
figure.	1
	1
"I've	1
had	1
enough	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
geese,"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
were	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
devil	1
together.	1
If	1
you	1
come	1
pestering	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
with	1
your	1
silly	1
talk	1
I'll	1
set	1
the	1
dog	1
at	1
you.	1
You	1
bring	1
Mrs.	1
Oakshott	1
here	1
and	1
I'll	1
answer	1
her,	1
but	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it?	1
Did	1
I	1
buy	1
the	1
geese	1
off	1
you?"	1
	1
"No;	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
mine	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
whined	1
the	1
little	1
man.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
ask	1
Mrs.	1
Oakshott	1
for	1
it."	1
	1
"She	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
can	1
ask	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Proosia,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
care.	1
I've	1
had	1
enough	1
of	1
it.	1
Get	1
out	1
of	1
this!"	1
He	1
rushed	1
fiercely	1
forward,	1
and	1
the	1
inquirer	1
flitted	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"Ha!	1
this	1
may	1
save	1
us	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
Brixton	1
Road,"	1
whispered	1
Holmes.	1
"Come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
this	1
fellow."	1
Striding	1
through	1
the	1
scattered	1
knots	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
lounged	1
round	1
the	1
flaring	1
stalls,	1
my	1
companion	1
speedily	1
overtook	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
and	1
touched	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
He	1
sprang	1
round,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
gas-light	1
that	1
every	1
vestige	1
of	1
colour	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
from	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you,	1
then?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
he	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
quavering	1
voice.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
me,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
blandly,	1
"but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
overhearing	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
you	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
salesman	1
just	1
now.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
assistance	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"You?	1
Who	1
are	1
you?	1
How	1
could	1
you	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
business	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
other	1
people	1
don't	1
know."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
can	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
this?"	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me,	1
I	1
know	1
everything	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
are	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
trace	1
some	1
geese	1
which	1
were	1
sold	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Oakshott,	1
of	1
Brixton	1
Road,	1
to	1
a	1
salesman	1
named	1
Breckinridge,	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
turn	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Windigate,	1
of	1
the	1
Alpha,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
club,	1
of	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker	1
is	1
a	1
member."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
sir,	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
longed	1
to	1
meet,"	1
cried	1
the	1
little	1
fellow	1
with	1
outstretched	1
hands	1
and	1
quivering	1
fingers.	1
"I	1
can	1
hardly	1
explain	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
interested	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
this	1
matter."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
hailed	1
a	1
four-wheeler	1
which	1
was	1
passing.	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
discuss	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
cosy	1
room	1
rather	1
than	1
in	1
this	1
wind-swept	1
market-place,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"But	1
pray	1
tell	1
me,	1
before	1
we	1
go	1
farther,	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
assisting."	1
	1
The	1
man	1
hesitated	1
for	1
an	1
instant.	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
John	1
Robinson,"	1
he	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
sidelong	1
glance.	1
	1
"No,	1
no;	1
the	1
real	1
name,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
sweetly.	1
"It	1
is	1
always	1
awkward	1
doing	1
business	1
with	1
an	1
alias."	1
	1
A	1
flush	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
white	1
cheeks	1
of	1
the	1
stranger.	1
"Well	1
then,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"my	1
real	1
name	1
is	1
James	1
Ryder."	1
	1
"Precisely	1
so.	1
Head	1
attendant	1
at	1
the	1
Hotel	1
Cosmopolitan.	1
Pray	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
everything	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
wish	1
to	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
stood	1
glancing	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us	1
with	1
half-frightened,	1
half-hopeful	1
eyes,	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
sure	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
a	1
windfall	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
catastrophe.	1
Then	1
he	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
we	1
were	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
sitting-room	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
Nothing	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
during	1
our	1
drive,	1
but	1
the	1
high,	1
thin	1
breathing	1
of	1
our	1
new	1
companion,	1
and	1
the	1
claspings	1
and	1
unclaspings	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
nervous	1
tension	1
within	1
him.	1
	1
"Here	1
we	1
are!"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
cheerily	1
as	1
we	1
filed	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
"The	1
fire	1
looks	1
very	1
seasonable	1
in	1
this	1
weather.	1
You	1
look	1
cold,	1
Mr.	1
Ryder.	1
Pray	1
take	1
the	1
basket-chair.	1
I	1
will	1
just	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
slippers	1
before	1
we	1
settle	1
this	1
little	1
matter	1
of	1
yours.	1
Now,	1
then!	1
You	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
those	1
geese?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
"Or	1
rather,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
of	1
that	1
goose.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
bird,	1
I	1
imagine	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
were	1
interested--white,	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
bar	1
across	1
the	1
tail."	1
	1
Ryder	1
quivered	1
with	1
emotion.	1
"Oh,	1
sir,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
it	1
went	1
to?"	1
	1
"It	1
came	1
here."	1
	1
"Here?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
a	1
most	1
remarkable	1
bird	1
it	1
proved.	1
I	1
don't	1
wonder	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
take	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
it.	1
It	1
laid	1
an	1
egg	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
dead--the	1
bonniest,	1
brightest	1
little	1
blue	1
egg	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
seen.	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
museum."	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
staggered	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
clutched	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand.	1
Holmes	1
unlocked	1
his	1
strong-box	1
and	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
blue	1
carbuncle,	1
which	1
shone	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
star,	1
with	1
a	1
cold,	1
brilliant,	1
many-pointed	1
radiance.	1
Ryder	1
stood	1
glaring	1
with	1
a	1
drawn	1
face,	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
to	1
claim	1
or	1
to	1
disown	1
it.	1
	1
"The	1
game's	1
up,	1
Ryder,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
quietly.	1
"Hold	1
up,	1
man,	1
or	1
you'll	1
be	1
into	1
the	1
fire!	1
Give	1
him	1
an	1
arm	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
chair,	1
Watson.	1
He's	1
not	1
got	1
blood	1
enough	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
for	1
felony	1
with	1
impunity.	1
Give	1
him	1
a	1
dash	1
of	1
brandy.	1
So!	1
Now	1
he	1
looks	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
human.	1
What	1
a	1
shrimp	1
it	1
is,	1
to	1
be	1
sure!"	1
	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
staggered	1
and	1
nearly	1
fallen,	1
but	1
the	1
brandy	1
brought	1
a	1
tinge	1
of	1
colour	1
into	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
staring	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
at	1
his	1
accuser.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
almost	1
every	1
link	1
in	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
proofs	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
possibly	1
need,	1
so	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
which	1
you	1
need	1
tell	1
me.	1
Still,	1
that	1
little	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
cleared	1
up	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
case	1
complete.	1
You	1
had	1
heard,	1
Ryder,	1
of	1
this	1
blue	1
stone	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
of	1
Morcar's?"	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
Catherine	1
Cusack	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
crackling	1
voice.	1
	1
"I	1
see--her	1
ladyship's	1
waiting-maid.	1
Well,	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
sudden	1
wealth	1
so	1
easily	1
acquired	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
better	1
men	1
before	1
you;	1
but	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
scrupulous	1
in	1
the	1
means	1
you	1
used.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
Ryder,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
villain	1
in	1
you.	1
You	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
Horner,	1
the	1
plumber,	1
had	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
some	1
such	1
matter	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
suspicion	1
would	1
rest	1
the	1
more	1
readily	1
upon	1
him.	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
do,	1
then?	1
You	1
made	1
some	1
small	1
job	1
in	1
my	1
lady's	1
room--you	1
and	1
your	1
confederate	1
Cusack--and	1
you	1
managed	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
sent	1
for.	1
Then,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
left,	1
you	1
rifled	1
the	1
jewel-case,	1
raised	1
the	1
alarm,	1
and	1
had	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
man	1
arrested.	1
You	1
then--"	1
	1
Ryder	1
threw	1
himself	1
down	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
clutched	1
at	1
my	1
companion's	1
knees.	1
"For	1
God's	1
sake,	1
have	1
mercy!"	1
he	1
shrieked.	1
"Think	1
of	1
my	1
father!	1
Of	1
my	1
mother!	1
It	1
would	1
break	1
their	1
hearts.	1
I	1
never	1
went	1
wrong	1
before!	1
I	1
never	1
will	1
again.	1
I	1
swear	1
it.	1
I'll	1
swear	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
Bible.	1
Oh,	1
don't	1
bring	1
it	1
into	1
court!	1
For	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
don't!"	1
	1
"Get	1
back	1
into	1
your	1
chair!"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
sternly.	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
cringe	1
and	1
crawl	1
now,	1
but	1
you	1
thought	1
little	1
enough	1
of	1
this	1
poor	1
Horner	1
in	1
the	1
dock	1
for	1
a	1
crime	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
fly,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
country,	1
sir.	1
Then	1
the	1
charge	1
against	1
him	1
will	1
break	1
down."	1
	1
"Hum!	1
We	1
will	1
talk	1
about	1
that.	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
a	1
true	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
act.	1
How	1
came	1
the	1
stone	1
into	1
the	1
goose,	1
and	1
how	1
came	1
the	1
goose	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
market?	1
Tell	1
us	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
there	1
lies	1
your	1
only	1
hope	1
of	1
safety."	1
	1
Ryder	1
passed	1
his	1
tongue	1
over	1
his	1
parched	1
lips.	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
happened,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"When	1
Horner	1
had	1
been	1
arrested,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
stone	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
at	1
what	1
moment	1
the	1
police	1
might	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
search	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
room.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
place	1
about	1
the	1
hotel	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
safe.	1
I	1
went	1
out,	1
as	1
if	1
on	1
some	1
commission,	1
and	1
I	1
made	1
for	1
my	1
sister's	1
house.	1
She	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Oakshott,	1
and	1
lived	1
in	1
Brixton	1
Road,	1
where	1
she	1
fattened	1
fowls	1
for	1
the	1
market.	1
All	1
the	1
way	1
there	1
every	1
man	1
I	1
met	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
policeman	1
or	1
a	1
detective;	1
and,	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cold	1
night,	1
the	1
sweat	1
was	1
pouring	1
down	1
my	1
face	1
before	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Brixton	1
Road.	1
My	1
sister	1
asked	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
why	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
pale;	1
but	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
upset	1
by	1
the	1
jewel	1
robbery	1
at	1
the	1
hotel.	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
yard	1
and	1
smoked	1
a	1
pipe	1
and	1
wondered	1
what	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
a	1
friend	1
once	1
called	1
Maudsley,	1
who	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bad,	1
and	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
serving	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
Pentonville.	1
One	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
me,	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
thieves,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
could	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
stole.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
things	1
about	1
him;	1
so	1
I	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
right	1
on	1
to	1
Kilburn,	1
where	1
he	1
lived,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
into	1
my	1
confidence.	1
He	1
would	1
show	1
me	1
how	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
stone	1
into	1
money.	1
But	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
safety?	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
agonies	1
I	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
in	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
hotel.	1
I	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
be	1
seized	1
and	1
searched,	1
and	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
stone	1
in	1
my	1
waistcoat	1
pocket.	1
I	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
geese	1
which	1
were	1
waddling	1
about	1
round	1
my	1
feet,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
an	1
idea	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
head	1
which	1
showed	1
me	1
how	1
I	1
could	1
beat	1
the	1
best	1
detective	1
that	1
ever	1
lived.	1
	1
"My	1
sister	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
some	1
weeks	1
before	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
pick	1
of	1
her	1
geese	1
for	1
a	1
Christmas	1
present,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
her	1
word.	1
I	1
would	1
take	1
my	1
goose	1
now,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
would	1
carry	1
my	1
stone	1
to	1
Kilburn.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
shed	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
behind	1
this	1
I	1
drove	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
birds--a	1
fine	1
big	1
one,	1
white,	1
with	1
a	1
barred	1
tail.	1
I	1
caught	1
it,	1
and	1
prying	1
its	1
bill	1
open,	1
I	1
thrust	1
the	1
stone	1
down	1
its	1
throat	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
my	1
finger	1
could	1
reach.	1
The	1
bird	1
gave	1
a	1
gulp,	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
stone	1
pass	1
along	1
its	1
gullet	1
and	1
down	1
into	1
its	1
crop.	1
But	1
the	1
creature	1
flapped	1
and	1
struggled,	1
and	1
out	1
came	1
my	1
sister	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
As	1
I	1
turned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
brute	1
broke	1
loose	1
and	1
fluttered	1
off	1
among	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
"'Whatever	1
were	1
you	1
doing	1
with	1
that	1
bird,	1
Jem?'	1
says	1
she.	1
	1
"'Well,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'you	1
said	1
you'd	1
give	1
me	1
one	1
for	1
Christmas,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
feeling	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
fattest.'	1
	1
"'Oh,'	1
says	1
she,	1
'we've	1
set	1
yours	1
aside	1
for	1
you--Jem's	1
bird,	1
we	1
call	1
it.	1
It's	1
the	1
big	1
white	1
one	1
over	1
yonder.	1
There's	1
twenty-six	1
of	1
them,	1
which	1
makes	1
one	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
two	1
dozen	1
for	1
the	1
market.'	1
	1
"'Thank	1
you,	1
Maggie,'	1
says	1
I;	1
'but	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
you,	1
I'd	1
rather	1
have	1
that	1
one	1
I	1
was	1
handling	1
just	1
now.'	1
	1
"'The	1
other	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
three	1
pound	1
heavier,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'and	1
we	1
fattened	1
it	1
expressly	1
for	1
you.'	1
	1
"'Never	1
mind.	1
I'll	1
have	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
I'll	1
take	1
it	1
now,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
like,'	1
said	1
she,	1
a	1
little	1
huffed.	1
'Which	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want,	1
then?'	1
	1
"'That	1
white	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
barred	1
tail,	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
flock.'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
very	1
well.	1
Kill	1
it	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
with	1
you.'	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
did	1
what	1
she	1
said,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
I	1
carried	1
the	1
bird	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Kilburn.	1
I	1
told	1
my	1
pal	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
done,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
thing	1
like	1
that	1
to.	1
He	1
laughed	1
until	1
he	1
choked,	1
and	1
we	1
got	1
a	1
knife	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
goose.	1
My	1
heart	1
turned	1
to	1
water,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
stone,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
some	1
terrible	1
mistake	1
had	1
occurred.	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
bird,	1
rushed	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
sister's,	1
and	1
hurried	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
yard.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
bird	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
there.	1
	1
"'Where	1
are	1
they	1
all,	1
Maggie?'	1
I	1
cried.	1
	1
"'Gone	1
to	1
the	1
dealer's,	1
Jem.'	1
	1
"'Which	1
dealer's?'	1
	1
"'Breckinridge,	1
of	1
Covent	1
Garden.'	1
	1
"'But	1
was	1
there	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
barred	1
tail?'	1
I	1
asked,	1
'the	1
same	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
chose?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
Jem;	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
barred-tailed	1
ones,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
tell	1
them	1
apart.'	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
ran	1
off	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
my	1
feet	1
would	1
carry	1
me	1
to	1
this	1
man	1
Breckinridge;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
sold	1
the	1
lot	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
word	1
would	1
he	1
tell	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
gone.	1
You	1
heard	1
him	1
yourselves	1
to-night.	1
Well,	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
answered	1
me	1
like	1
that.	1
My	1
sister	1
thinks	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
mad.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
myself.	1
And	1
now--and	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
a	1
branded	1
thief,	1
without	1
ever	1
having	1
touched	1
the	1
wealth	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
sold	1
my	1
character.	1
God	1
help	1
me!	1
God	1
help	1
me!"	1
He	1
burst	1
into	1
convulsive	1
sobbing,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
his	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
measured	1
tapping	1
of	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
finger-tips	1
upon	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
Then	1
my	1
friend	1
rose	1
and	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Get	1
out!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"What,	1
sir!	1
Oh,	1
Heaven	1
bless	1
you!"	1
	1
"No	1
more	1
words.	1
Get	1
out!"	1
	1
And	1
no	1
more	1
words	1
were	1
needed.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
rush,	1
a	1
clatter	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
the	1
bang	1
of	1
a	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
crisp	1
rattle	1
of	1
running	1
footfalls	1
from	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
"After	1
all,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
reaching	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
his	1
clay	1
pipe,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
retained	1
by	1
the	1
police	1
to	1
supply	1
their	1
deficiencies.	1
If	1
Horner	1
were	1
in	1
danger	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
another	1
thing;	1
but	1
this	1
fellow	1
will	1
not	1
appear	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
case	1
must	1
collapse.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
commuting	1
a	1
felony,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
saving	1
a	1
soul.	1
This	1
fellow	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
wrong	1
again;	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
terribly	1
frightened.	1
Send	1
him	1
to	1
gaol	1
now,	1
and	1
you	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
gaol-bird	1
for	1
life.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
forgiveness.	1
Chance	1
has	1
put	1
in	1
our	1
way	1
a	1
most	1
singular	1
and	1
whimsical	1
problem,	1
and	1
its	1
solution	1
is	1
its	1
own	1
reward.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
bell,	1
Doctor,	1
we	1
will	1
begin	1
another	1
investigation,	1
in	1
which,	1
also	1
a	1
bird	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
feature."	1
	1
	1
	1
VIII.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
SPECKLED	1
BAND	1
	1
On	1
glancing	1
over	1
my	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
seventy	1
odd	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
eight	1
years	1
studied	1
the	1
methods	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
find	1
many	1
tragic,	1
some	1
comic,	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
merely	1
strange,	1
but	1
none	1
commonplace;	1
for,	1
working	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
rather	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
his	1
art	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
acquirement	1
of	1
wealth,	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
associate	1
himself	1
with	1
any	1
investigation	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
tend	1
towards	1
the	1
unusual,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
fantastic.	1
Of	1
all	1
these	1
varied	1
cases,	1
however,	1
I	1
cannot	1
recall	1
any	1
which	1
presented	1
more	1
singular	1
features	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
well-known	1
Surrey	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Roylotts	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran.	1
The	1
events	1
in	1
question	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
association	1
with	1
Holmes,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
sharing	1
rooms	1
as	1
bachelors	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
placed	1
them	1
upon	1
record	1
before,	1
but	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
secrecy	1
was	1
made	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
been	1
freed	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
month	1
by	1
the	1
untimely	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
pledge	1
was	1
given.	1
It	1
is	1
perhaps	1
as	1
well	1
that	1
the	1
facts	1
should	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
light,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
reasons	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
widespread	1
rumours	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott	1
which	1
tend	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
matter	1
even	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
early	1
in	1
April	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
'83	1
that	1
I	1
woke	1
one	1
morning	1
to	1
find	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
standing,	1
fully	1
dressed,	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
my	1
bed.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
late	1
riser,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
clock	1
on	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
showed	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
quarter-past	1
seven,	1
I	1
blinked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
surprise,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
resentment,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
myself	1
regular	1
in	1
my	1
habits.	1
	1
"Very	1
sorry	1
to	1
knock	1
you	1
up,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
it's	1
the	1
common	1
lot	1
this	1
morning.	1
Mrs.	1
Hudson	1
has	1
been	1
knocked	1
up,	1
she	1
retorted	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
on	1
you."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
then--a	1
fire?"	1
	1
"No;	1
a	1
client.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
has	1
arrived	1
in	1
a	1
considerable	1
state	1
of	1
excitement,	1
who	1
insists	1
upon	1
seeing	1
me.	1
She	1
is	1
waiting	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
sitting-room.	1
Now,	1
when	1
young	1
ladies	1
wander	1
about	1
the	1
metropolis	1
at	1
this	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
knock	1
sleepy	1
people	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
beds,	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
pressing	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
communicate.	1
Should	1
it	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
interesting	1
case,	1
you	1
would,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
wish	1
to	1
follow	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
outset.	1
I	1
thought,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
call	1
you	1
and	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
chance."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
miss	1
it	1
for	1
anything."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
keener	1
pleasure	1
than	1
in	1
following	1
Holmes	1
in	1
his	1
professional	1
investigations,	1
and	1
in	1
admiring	1
the	1
rapid	1
deductions,	1
as	1
swift	1
as	1
intuitions,	1
and	1
yet	1
always	1
founded	1
on	1
a	1
logical	1
basis	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
unravelled	1
the	1
problems	1
which	1
were	1
submitted	1
to	1
him.	1
I	1
rapidly	1
threw	1
on	1
my	1
clothes	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
to	1
accompany	1
my	1
friend	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sitting-room.	1
A	1
lady	1
dressed	1
in	1
black	1
and	1
heavily	1
veiled,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
rose	1
as	1
we	1
entered.	1
	1
"Good-morning,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
cheerily.	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
intimate	1
friend	1
and	1
associate,	1
Dr.	1
Watson,	1
before	1
whom	1
you	1
can	1
speak	1
as	1
freely	1
as	1
before	1
myself.	1
Ha!	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Hudson	1
has	1
had	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
fire.	1
Pray	1
draw	1
up	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
order	1
you	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
hot	1
coffee,	1
for	1
I	1
observe	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
shivering."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
cold	1
which	1
makes	1
me	1
shiver,"	1
said	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
changing	1
her	1
seat	1
as	1
requested.	1
	1
"What,	1
then?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
fear,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
It	1
is	1
terror."	1
She	1
raised	1
her	1
veil	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,	1
and	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
indeed	1
in	1
a	1
pitiable	1
state	1
of	1
agitation,	1
her	1
face	1
all	1
drawn	1
and	1
grey,	1
with	1
restless	1
frightened	1
eyes,	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
some	1
hunted	1
animal.	1
Her	1
features	1
and	1
figure	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
thirty,	1
but	1
her	1
hair	1
was	1
shot	1
with	1
premature	1
grey,	1
and	1
her	1
expression	1
was	1
weary	1
and	1
haggard.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
ran	1
her	1
over	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
quick,	1
all-comprehensive	1
glances.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
not	1
fear,"	1
said	1
he	1
soothingly,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
patting	1
her	1
forearm.	1
"We	1
shall	1
soon	1
set	1
matters	1
right,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt.	1
You	1
have	1
come	1
in	1
by	1
train	1
this	1
morning,	1
I	1
see."	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
me,	1
then?"	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
observe	1
the	1
second	1
half	1
of	1
a	1
return	1
ticket	1
in	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
your	1
left	1
glove.	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
started	1
early,	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
drive	1
in	1
a	1
dog-cart,	1
along	1
heavy	1
roads,	1
before	1
you	1
reached	1
the	1
station."	1
	1
The	1
lady	1
gave	1
a	1
violent	1
start	1
and	1
stared	1
in	1
bewilderment	1
at	1
my	1
companion.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
mystery,	1
my	1
dear	1
madam,"	1
said	1
he,	1
smiling.	1
"The	1
left	1
arm	1
of	1
your	1
jacket	1
is	1
spattered	1
with	1
mud	1
in	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
seven	1
places.	1
The	1
marks	1
are	1
perfectly	1
fresh.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
vehicle	1
save	1
a	1
dog-cart	1
which	1
throws	1
up	1
mud	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
and	1
then	1
only	1
when	1
you	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
left-hand	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
driver."	1
	1
"Whatever	1
your	1
reasons	1
may	1
be,	1
you	1
are	1
perfectly	1
correct,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
started	1
from	1
home	1
before	1
six,	1
reached	1
Leatherhead	1
at	1
twenty	1
past,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
train	1
to	1
Waterloo.	1
Sir,	1
I	1
can	1
stand	1
this	1
strain	1
no	1
longer;	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
mad	1
if	1
it	1
continues.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
turn	1
to--none,	1
save	1
only	1
one,	1
who	1
cares	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
he,	1
poor	1
fellow,	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
little	1
aid.	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes;	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Farintosh,	1
whom	1
you	1
helped	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
her	1
sore	1
need.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
your	1
address.	1
Oh,	1
sir,	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
help	1
me,	1
too,	1
and	1
at	1
least	1
throw	1
a	1
little	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
dense	1
darkness	1
which	1
surrounds	1
me?	1
At	1
present	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
reward	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
services,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
month	1
or	1
six	1
weeks	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
married,	1
with	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
income,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me	1
ungrateful."	1
	1
Holmes	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
desk	1
and,	1
unlocking	1
it,	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
case-book,	1
which	1
he	1
consulted.	1
	1
"Farintosh,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Ah	1
yes,	1
I	1
recall	1
the	1
case;	1
it	1
was	1
concerned	1
with	1
an	1
opal	1
tiara.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
before	1
your	1
time,	1
Watson.	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say,	1
madam,	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
devote	1
the	1
same	1
care	1
to	1
your	1
case	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
your	1
friend.	1
As	1
to	1
reward,	1
my	1
profession	1
is	1
its	1
own	1
reward;	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
defray	1
whatever	1
expenses	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
put	1
to,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
suits	1
you	1
best.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
lay	1
before	1
us	1
everything	1
that	1
may	1
help	1
us	1
in	1
forming	1
an	1
opinion	1
upon	1
the	1
matter."	1
	1
"Alas!"	1
replied	1
our	1
visitor,	1
"the	1
very	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
situation	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
my	1
fears	1
are	1
so	1
vague,	1
and	1
my	1
suspicions	1
depend	1
so	1
entirely	1
upon	1
small	1
points,	1
which	1
might	1
seem	1
trivial	1
to	1
another,	1
that	1
even	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
of	1
all	1
others	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
help	1
and	1
advice	1
looks	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
tell	1
him	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
fancies	1
of	1
a	1
nervous	1
woman.	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
say	1
so,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
read	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
soothing	1
answers	1
and	1
averted	1
eyes.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
heard,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
manifold	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
heart.	1
You	1
may	1
advise	1
me	1
how	1
to	1
walk	1
amid	1
the	1
dangers	1
which	1
encompass	1
me."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
all	1
attention,	1
madam."	1
	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Helen	1
Stoner,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
living	1
with	1
my	1
stepfather,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
survivor	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
oldest	1
Saxon	1
families	1
in	1
England,	1
the	1
Roylotts	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran,	1
on	1
the	1
western	1
border	1
of	1
Surrey."	1
	1
Holmes	1
nodded	1
his	1
head.	1
"The	1
name	1
is	1
familiar	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"The	1
family	1
was	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
among	1
the	1
richest	1
in	1
England,	1
and	1
the	1
estates	1
extended	1
over	1
the	1
borders	1
into	1
Berkshire	1
in	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
Hampshire	1
in	1
the	1
west.	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
century,	1
however,	1
four	1
successive	1
heirs	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
dissolute	1
and	1
wasteful	1
disposition,	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
ruin	1
was	1
eventually	1
completed	1
by	1
a	1
gambler	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Regency.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
left	1
save	1
a	1
few	1
acres	1
of	1
ground,	1
and	1
the	1
two-hundred-year-old	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
itself	1
crushed	1
under	1
a	1
heavy	1
mortgage.	1
The	1
last	1
squire	1
dragged	1
out	1
his	1
existence	1
there,	1
living	1
the	1
horrible	1
life	1
of	1
an	1
aristocratic	1
pauper;	1
but	1
his	1
only	1
son,	1
my	1
stepfather,	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
adapt	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
conditions,	1
obtained	1
an	1
advance	1
from	1
a	1
relative,	1
which	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
medical	1
degree	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
Calcutta,	1
where,	1
by	1
his	1
professional	1
skill	1
and	1
his	1
force	1
of	1
character,	1
he	1
established	1
a	1
large	1
practice.	1
In	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
anger,	1
however,	1
caused	1
by	1
some	1
robberies	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
perpetrated	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
beat	1
his	1
native	1
butler	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
narrowly	1
escaped	1
a	1
capital	1
sentence.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
he	1
suffered	1
a	1
long	1
term	1
of	1
imprisonment	1
and	1
afterwards	1
returned	1
to	1
England	1
a	1
morose	1
and	1
disappointed	1
man.	1
	1
"When	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
was	1
in	1
India	1
he	1
married	1
my	1
mother,	1
Mrs.	1
Stoner,	1
the	1
young	1
widow	1
of	1
Major-General	1
Stoner,	1
of	1
the	1
Bengal	1
Artillery.	1
My	1
sister	1
Julia	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
twins,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
only	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
mother's	1
re-marriage.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
considerable	1
sum	1
of	1
money--not	1
less	1
than	1
1000	1
pounds	1
a	1
year--and	1
this	1
she	1
bequeathed	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
entirely	1
while	1
we	1
resided	1
with	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
provision	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
annual	1
sum	1
should	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
our	1
marriage.	1
Shortly	1
after	1
our	1
return	1
to	1
England	1
my	1
mother	1
died--she	1
was	1
killed	1
eight	1
years	1
ago	1
in	1
a	1
railway	1
accident	1
near	1
Crewe.	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
then	1
abandoned	1
his	1
attempts	1
to	1
establish	1
himself	1
in	1
practice	1
in	1
London	1
and	1
took	1
us	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
ancestral	1
house	1
at	1
Stoke	1
Moran.	1
The	1
money	1
which	1
my	1
mother	1
had	1
left	1
was	1
enough	1
for	1
all	1
our	1
wants,	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
obstacle	1
to	1
our	1
happiness.	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
terrible	1
change	1
came	1
over	1
our	1
stepfather	1
about	1
this	1
time.	1
Instead	1
of	1
making	1
friends	1
and	1
exchanging	1
visits	1
with	1
our	1
neighbours,	1
who	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
been	1
overjoyed	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
Roylott	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
family	1
seat,	1
he	1
shut	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
seldom	1
came	1
out	1
save	1
to	1
indulge	1
in	1
ferocious	1
quarrels	1
with	1
whoever	1
might	1
cross	1
his	1
path.	1
Violence	1
of	1
temper	1
approaching	1
to	1
mania	1
has	1
been	1
hereditary	1
in	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
stepfather's	1
case	1
it	1
had,	1
I	1
believe,	1
been	1
intensified	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
residence	1
in	1
the	1
tropics.	1
A	1
series	1
of	1
disgraceful	1
brawls	1
took	1
place,	1
two	1
of	1
which	1
ended	1
in	1
the	1
police-court,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
became	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
the	1
folks	1
would	1
fly	1
at	1
his	1
approach,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
immense	1
strength,	1
and	1
absolutely	1
uncontrollable	1
in	1
his	1
anger.	1
	1
"Last	1
week	1
he	1
hurled	1
the	1
local	1
blacksmith	1
over	1
a	1
parapet	1
into	1
a	1
stream,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
paying	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
gather	1
together	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
avert	1
another	1
public	1
exposure.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
friends	1
at	1
all	1
save	1
the	1
wandering	1
gipsies,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
these	1
vagabonds	1
leave	1
to	1
encamp	1
upon	1
the	1
few	1
acres	1
of	1
bramble-covered	1
land	1
which	1
represent	1
the	1
family	1
estate,	1
and	1
would	1
accept	1
in	1
return	1
the	1
hospitality	1
of	1
their	1
tents,	1
wandering	1
away	1
with	1
them	1
sometimes	1
for	1
weeks	1
on	1
end.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
passion	1
also	1
for	1
Indian	1
animals,	1
which	1
are	1
sent	1
over	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
correspondent,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
a	1
cheetah	1
and	1
a	1
baboon,	1
which	1
wander	1
freely	1
over	1
his	1
grounds	1
and	1
are	1
feared	1
by	1
the	1
villagers	1
almost	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
their	1
master.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
imagine	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
my	1
poor	1
sister	1
Julia	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
our	1
lives.	1
No	1
servant	1
would	1
stay	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
we	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
She	1
was	1
but	1
thirty	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
death,	1
and	1
yet	1
her	1
hair	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
whiten,	1
even	1
as	1
mine	1
has."	1
	1
"Your	1
sister	1
is	1
dead,	1
then?"	1
	1
"She	1
died	1
just	1
two	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
her	1
death	1
that	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you.	1
You	1
can	1
understand	1
that,	1
living	1
the	1
life	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
described,	1
we	1
were	1
little	1
likely	1
to	1
see	1
anyone	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
age	1
and	1
position.	1
We	1
had,	1
however,	1
an	1
aunt,	1
my	1
mother's	1
maiden	1
sister,	1
Miss	1
Honoria	1
Westphail,	1
who	1
lives	1
near	1
Harrow,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
occasionally	1
allowed	1
to	1
pay	1
short	1
visits	1
at	1
this	1
lady's	1
house.	1
Julia	1
went	1
there	1
at	1
Christmas	1
two	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
met	1
there	1
a	1
half-pay	1
major	1
of	1
marines,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
became	1
engaged.	1
My	1
stepfather	1
learned	1
of	1
the	1
engagement	1
when	1
my	1
sister	1
returned	1
and	1
offered	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
marriage;	1
but	1
within	1
a	1
fortnight	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
wedding,	1
the	1
terrible	1
event	1
occurred	1
which	1
has	1
deprived	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
only	1
companion."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
in	1
a	1
cushion,	1
but	1
he	1
half	1
opened	1
his	1
lids	1
now	1
and	1
glanced	1
across	1
at	1
his	1
visitor.	1
	1
"Pray	1
be	1
precise	1
as	1
to	1
details,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
easy	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
so,	1
for	1
every	1
event	1
of	1
that	1
dreadful	1
time	1
is	1
seared	1
into	1
my	1
memory.	1
The	1
manor-house	1
is,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said,	1
very	1
old,	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
wing	1
is	1
now	1
inhabited.	1
The	1
bedrooms	1
in	1
this	1
wing	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor,	1
the	1
sitting-rooms	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
central	1
block	1
of	1
the	1
buildings.	1
Of	1
these	1
bedrooms	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's,	1
the	1
second	1
my	1
sister's,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
my	1
own.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
communication	1
between	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
open	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
corridor.	1
Do	1
I	1
make	1
myself	1
plain?"	1
	1
"Perfectly	1
so."	1
	1
"The	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
rooms	1
open	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
lawn.	1
That	1
fatal	1
night	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
early,	1
though	1
we	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
retired	1
to	1
rest,	1
for	1
my	1
sister	1
was	1
troubled	1
by	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
strong	1
Indian	1
cigars	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
to	1
smoke.	1
She	1
left	1
her	1
room,	1
therefore,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
mine,	1
where	1
she	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
chatting	1
about	1
her	1
approaching	1
wedding.	1
At	1
eleven	1
o'clock	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
leave	1
me,	1
but	1
she	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
looked	1
back.	1
	1
"'Tell	1
me,	1
Helen,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'have	1
you	1
ever	1
heard	1
anyone	1
whistle	1
in	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
the	1
night?'	1
	1
"'Never,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'I	1
suppose	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
whistle,	1
yourself,	1
in	1
your	1
sleep?'	1
	1
"'Certainly	1
not.	1
But	1
why?'	1
	1
"'Because	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
nights	1
I	1
have	1
always,	1
about	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
heard	1
a	1
low,	1
clear	1
whistle.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
light	1
sleeper,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
awakened	1
me.	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
where	1
it	1
came	1
from--perhaps	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room,	1
perhaps	1
from	1
the	1
lawn.	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
just	1
ask	1
you	1
whether	1
you	1
had	1
heard	1
it.'	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
have	1
not.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
those	1
wretched	1
gipsies	1
in	1
the	1
plantation.'	1
	1
"'Very	1
likely.	1
And	1
yet	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
lawn,	1
I	1
wonder	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
it	1
also.'	1
	1
"'Ah,	1
but	1
I	1
sleep	1
more	1
heavily	1
than	1
you.'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
great	1
consequence,	1
at	1
any	1
rate.'	1
She	1
smiled	1
back	1
at	1
me,	1
closed	1
my	1
door,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
later	1
I	1
heard	1
her	1
key	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
lock."	1
	1
"Indeed,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Was	1
it	1
your	1
custom	1
always	1
to	1
lock	1
yourselves	1
in	1
at	1
night?"	1
	1
"Always."	1
	1
"And	1
why?"	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
mentioned	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
kept	1
a	1
cheetah	1
and	1
a	1
baboon.	1
We	1
had	1
no	1
feeling	1
of	1
security	1
unless	1
our	1
doors	1
were	1
locked."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
Pray	1
proceed	1
with	1
your	1
statement."	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
that	1
night.	1
A	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
impending	1
misfortune	1
impressed	1
me.	1
My	1
sister	1
and	1
I,	1
you	1
will	1
recollect,	1
were	1
twins,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
subtle	1
are	1
the	1
links	1
which	1
bind	1
two	1
souls	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
closely	1
allied.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
wild	1
night.	1
The	1
wind	1
was	1
howling	1
outside,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
beating	1
and	1
splashing	1
against	1
the	1
windows.	1
Suddenly,	1
amid	1
all	1
the	1
hubbub	1
of	1
the	1
gale,	1
there	1
burst	1
forth	1
the	1
wild	1
scream	1
of	1
a	1
terrified	1
woman.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
sister's	1
voice.	1
I	1
sprang	1
from	1
my	1
bed,	1
wrapped	1
a	1
shawl	1
round	1
me,	1
and	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
corridor.	1
As	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
door	1
I	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
low	1
whistle,	1
such	1
as	1
my	1
sister	1
described,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
later	1
a	1
clanging	1
sound,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
metal	1
had	1
fallen.	1
As	1
I	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
passage,	1
my	1
sister's	1
door	1
was	1
unlocked,	1
and	1
revolved	1
slowly	1
upon	1
its	1
hinges.	1
I	1
stared	1
at	1
it	1
horror-stricken,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
issue	1
from	1
it.	1
By	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
corridor-lamp	1
I	1
saw	1
my	1
sister	1
appear	1
at	1
the	1
opening,	1
her	1
face	1
blanched	1
with	1
terror,	1
her	1
hands	1
groping	1
for	1
help,	1
her	1
whole	1
figure	1
swaying	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
drunkard.	1
I	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
threw	1
my	1
arms	1
round	1
her,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
her	1
knees	1
seemed	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
and	1
she	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
She	1
writhed	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
terrible	1
pain,	1
and	1
her	1
limbs	1
were	1
dreadfully	1
convulsed.	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
recognised	1
me,	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
she	1
suddenly	1
shrieked	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget,	1
'Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
Helen!	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
band!	1
The	1
speckled	1
band!'	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
else	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
she	1
stabbed	1
with	1
her	1
finger	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
doctor's	1
room,	1
but	1
a	1
fresh	1
convulsion	1
seized	1
her	1
and	1
choked	1
her	1
words.	1
I	1
rushed	1
out,	1
calling	1
loudly	1
for	1
my	1
stepfather,	1
and	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
hastening	1
from	1
his	1
room	1
in	1
his	1
dressing-gown.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
my	1
sister's	1
side	1
she	1
was	1
unconscious,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
poured	1
brandy	1
down	1
her	1
throat	1
and	1
sent	1
for	1
medical	1
aid	1
from	1
the	1
village,	1
all	1
efforts	1
were	1
in	1
vain,	1
for	1
she	1
slowly	1
sank	1
and	1
died	1
without	1
having	1
recovered	1
her	1
consciousness.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
dreadful	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
sister."	1
	1
"One	1
moment,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"are	1
you	1
sure	1
about	1
this	1
whistle	1
and	1
metallic	1
sound?	1
Could	1
you	1
swear	1
to	1
it?"	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
county	1
coroner	1
asked	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
inquiry.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
strong	1
impression	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
yet,	1
among	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
gale	1
and	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
house,	1
I	1
may	1
possibly	1
have	1
been	1
deceived."	1
	1
"Was	1
your	1
sister	1
dressed?"	1
	1
"No,	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
night-dress.	1
In	1
her	1
right	1
hand	1
was	1
found	1
the	1
charred	1
stump	1
of	1
a	1
match,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
left	1
a	1
match-box."	1
	1
"Showing	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
struck	1
a	1
light	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
when	1
the	1
alarm	1
took	1
place.	1
That	1
is	1
important.	1
And	1
what	1
conclusions	1
did	1
the	1
coroner	1
come	1
to?"	1
	1
"He	1
investigated	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
great	1
care,	1
for	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's	1
conduct	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
notorious	1
in	1
the	1
county,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
cause	1
of	1
death.	1
My	1
evidence	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
had	1
been	1
fastened	1
upon	1
the	1
inner	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
blocked	1
by	1
old-fashioned	1
shutters	1
with	1
broad	1
iron	1
bars,	1
which	1
were	1
secured	1
every	1
night.	1
The	1
walls	1
were	1
carefully	1
sounded,	1
and	1
were	1
shown	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
solid	1
all	1
round,	1
and	1
the	1
flooring	1
was	1
also	1
thoroughly	1
examined,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
result.	1
The	1
chimney	1
is	1
wide,	1
but	1
is	1
barred	1
up	1
by	1
four	1
large	1
staples.	1
It	1
is	1
certain,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
my	1
sister	1
was	1
quite	1
alone	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
her	1
end.	1
Besides,	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
marks	1
of	1
any	1
violence	1
upon	1
her."	1
	1
"How	1
about	1
poison?"	1
	1
"The	1
doctors	1
examined	1
her	1
for	1
it,	1
but	1
without	1
success."	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
lady	1
died	1
of,	1
then?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
that	1
she	1
died	1
of	1
pure	1
fear	1
and	1
nervous	1
shock,	1
though	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
frightened	1
her	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine."	1
	1
"Were	1
there	1
gipsies	1
in	1
the	1
plantation	1
at	1
the	1
time?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
are	1
nearly	1
always	1
some	1
there."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
gather	1
from	1
this	1
allusion	1
to	1
a	1
band--a	1
speckled	1
band?"	1
	1
"Sometimes	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
wild	1
talk	1
of	1
delirium,	1
sometimes	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
referred	1
to	1
some	1
band	1
of	1
people,	1
perhaps	1
to	1
these	1
very	1
gipsies	1
in	1
the	1
plantation.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
the	1
spotted	1
handkerchiefs	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
wear	1
over	1
their	1
heads	1
might	1
have	1
suggested	1
the	1
strange	1
adjective	1
which	1
she	1
used."	1
	1
Holmes	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
satisfied.	1
	1
"These	1
are	1
very	1
deep	1
waters,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"pray	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
your	1
narrative."	1
	1
"Two	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
since	1
then,	1
and	1
my	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
until	1
lately	1
lonelier	1
than	1
ever.	1
A	1
month	1
ago,	1
however,	1
a	1
dear	1
friend,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
for	1
many	1
years,	1
has	1
done	1
me	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
ask	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
marriage.	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
Armitage--Percy	1
Armitage--the	1
second	1
son	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Armitage,	1
of	1
Crane	1
Water,	1
near	1
Reading.	1
My	1
stepfather	1
has	1
offered	1
no	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
match,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
spring.	1
Two	1
days	1
ago	1
some	1
repairs	1
were	1
started	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
building,	1
and	1
my	1
bedroom	1
wall	1
has	1
been	1
pierced,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
move	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
sister	1
died,	1
and	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
bed	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
slept.	1
Imagine,	1
then,	1
my	1
thrill	1
of	1
terror	1
when	1
last	1
night,	1
as	1
I	1
lay	1
awake,	1
thinking	1
over	1
her	1
terrible	1
fate,	1
I	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
low	1
whistle	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
herald	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
death.	1
I	1
sprang	1
up	1
and	1
lit	1
the	1
lamp,	1
but	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
I	1
was	1
too	1
shaken	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
again,	1
however,	1
so	1
I	1
dressed,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
daylight	1
I	1
slipped	1
down,	1
got	1
a	1
dog-cart	1
at	1
the	1
Crown	1
Inn,	1
which	1
is	1
opposite,	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
Leatherhead,	1
from	1
whence	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
on	1
this	1
morning	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
object	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
and	1
asking	1
your	1
advice."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
done	1
wisely,"	1
said	1
my	1
friend.	1
"But	1
have	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
all?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
all."	1
	1
"Miss	1
Roylott,	1
you	1
have	1
not.	1
You	1
are	1
screening	1
your	1
stepfather."	1
	1
"Why,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
	1
For	1
answer	1
Holmes	1
pushed	1
back	1
the	1
frill	1
of	1
black	1
lace	1
which	1
fringed	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
lay	1
upon	1
our	1
visitor's	1
knee.	1
Five	1
little	1
livid	1
spots,	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
four	1
fingers	1
and	1
a	1
thumb,	1
were	1
printed	1
upon	1
the	1
white	1
wrist.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
cruelly	1
used,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
The	1
lady	1
coloured	1
deeply	1
and	1
covered	1
over	1
her	1
injured	1
wrist.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
hard	1
man,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"and	1
perhaps	1
he	1
hardly	1
knows	1
his	1
own	1
strength."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
during	1
which	1
Holmes	1
leaned	1
his	1
chin	1
upon	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
stared	1
into	1
the	1
crackling	1
fire.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
deep	1
business,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"There	1
are	1
a	1
thousand	1
details	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
before	1
I	1
decide	1
upon	1
our	1
course	1
of	1
action.	1
Yet	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
lose.	1
If	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Stoke	1
Moran	1
to-day,	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
see	1
over	1
these	1
rooms	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
your	1
stepfather?"	1
	1
"As	1
it	1
happens,	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
coming	1
into	1
town	1
to-day	1
upon	1
some	1
most	1
important	1
business.	1
It	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
away	1
all	1
day,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
to	1
disturb	1
you.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
housekeeper	1
now,	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
old	1
and	1
foolish,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
easily	1
get	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way."	1
	1
"Excellent.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
averse	1
to	1
this	1
trip,	1
Watson?"	1
	1
"By	1
no	1
means."	1
	1
"Then	1
we	1
shall	1
both	1
come.	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
yourself?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
town.	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
return	1
by	1
the	1
twelve	1
o'clock	1
train,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
your	1
coming."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
may	1
expect	1
us	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
I	1
have	1
myself	1
some	1
small	1
business	1
matters	1
to	1
attend	1
to.	1
Will	1
you	1
not	1
wait	1
and	1
breakfast?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
must	1
go.	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
lightened	1
already	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
confided	1
my	1
trouble	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
shall	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
seeing	1
you	1
again	1
this	1
afternoon."	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
thick	1
black	1
veil	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
glided	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
Watson?"	1
asked	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
dark	1
and	1
sinister	1
business."	1
	1
"Dark	1
enough	1
and	1
sinister	1
enough."	1
	1
"Yet	1
if	1
the	1
lady	1
is	1
correct	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
flooring	1
and	1
walls	1
are	1
sound,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
door,	1
window,	1
and	1
chimney	1
are	1
impassable,	1
then	1
her	1
sister	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
undoubtedly	1
alone	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
her	1
mysterious	1
end."	1
	1
"What	1
becomes,	1
then,	1
of	1
these	1
nocturnal	1
whistles,	1
and	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
peculiar	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
woman?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
think."	1
	1
"When	1
you	1
combine	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
whistles	1
at	1
night,	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
gipsies	1
who	1
are	1
on	1
intimate	1
terms	1
with	1
this	1
old	1
doctor,	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
has	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
preventing	1
his	1
stepdaughter's	1
marriage,	1
the	1
dying	1
allusion	1
to	1
a	1
band,	1
and,	1
finally,	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Miss	1
Helen	1
Stoner	1
heard	1
a	1
metallic	1
clang,	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
caused	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
metal	1
bars	1
that	1
secured	1
the	1
shutters	1
falling	1
back	1
into	1
its	1
place,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
good	1
ground	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
mystery	1
may	1
be	1
cleared	1
along	1
those	1
lines."	1
	1
"But	1
what,	1
then,	1
did	1
the	1
gipsies	1
do?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine."	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
many	1
objections	1
to	1
any	1
such	1
theory."	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
do	1
I.	1
It	1
is	1
precisely	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Stoke	1
Moran	1
this	1
day.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
objections	1
are	1
fatal,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
explained	1
away.	1
But	1
what	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
devil!"	1
	1
The	1
ejaculation	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
from	1
my	1
companion	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
our	1
door	1
had	1
been	1
suddenly	1
dashed	1
open,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
huge	1
man	1
had	1
framed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
aperture.	1
His	1
costume	1
was	1
a	1
peculiar	1
mixture	1
of	1
the	1
professional	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
agricultural,	1
having	1
a	1
black	1
top-hat,	1
a	1
long	1
frock-coat,	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
high	1
gaiters,	1
with	1
a	1
hunting-crop	1
swinging	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
So	1
tall	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
his	1
hat	1
actually	1
brushed	1
the	1
cross	1
bar	1
of	1
the	1
doorway,	1
and	1
his	1
breadth	1
seemed	1
to	1
span	1
it	1
across	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
A	1
large	1
face,	1
seared	1
with	1
a	1
thousand	1
wrinkles,	1
burned	1
yellow	1
with	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
marked	1
with	1
every	1
evil	1
passion,	1
was	1
turned	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us,	1
while	1
his	1
deep-set,	1
bile-shot	1
eyes,	1
and	1
his	1
high,	1
thin,	1
fleshless	1
nose,	1
gave	1
him	1
somewhat	1
the	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
fierce	1
old	1
bird	1
of	1
prey.	1
	1
"Which	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
Holmes?"	1
asked	1
this	1
apparition.	1
	1
"My	1
name,	1
sir;	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
me,"	1
said	1
my	1
companion	1
quietly.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott,	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran."	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
Doctor,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
blandly.	1
"Pray	1
take	1
a	1
seat."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
My	1
stepdaughter	1
has	1
been	1
here.	1
I	1
have	1
traced	1
her.	1
What	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
you?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
cold	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"What	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
you?"	1
screamed	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
furiously.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
crocuses	1
promise	1
well,"	1
continued	1
my	1
companion	1
imperturbably.	1
	1
"Ha!	1
You	1
put	1
me	1
off,	1
do	1
you?"	1
said	1
our	1
new	1
visitor,	1
taking	1
a	1
step	1
forward	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
hunting-crop.	1
"I	1
know	1
you,	1
you	1
scoundrel!	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you	1
before.	1
You	1
are	1
Holmes,	1
the	1
meddler."	1
	1
My	1
friend	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Holmes,	1
the	1
busybody!"	1
	1
His	1
smile	1
broadened.	1
	1
"Holmes,	1
the	1
Scotland	1
Yard	1
Jack-in-office!"	1
	1
Holmes	1
chuckled	1
heartily.	1
"Your	1
conversation	1
is	1
most	1
entertaining,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"When	1
you	1
go	1
out	1
close	1
the	1
door,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
decided	1
draught."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
go	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
my	1
say.	1
Don't	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
my	1
affairs.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
has	1
been	1
here.	1
I	1
traced	1
her!	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
dangerous	1
man	1
to	1
fall	1
foul	1
of!	1
See	1
here."	1
He	1
stepped	1
swiftly	1
forward,	1
seized	1
the	1
poker,	1
and	1
bent	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
curve	1
with	1
his	1
huge	1
brown	1
hands.	1
	1
"See	1
that	1
you	1
keep	1
yourself	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
grip,"	1
he	1
snarled,	1
and	1
hurling	1
the	1
twisted	1
poker	1
into	1
the	1
fireplace	1
he	1
strode	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"He	1
seems	1
a	1
very	1
amiable	1
person,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
bulky,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
remained	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
shown	1
him	1
that	1
my	1
grip	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
more	1
feeble	1
than	1
his	1
own."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
steel	1
poker	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
effort,	1
straightened	1
it	1
out	1
again.	1
	1
"Fancy	1
his	1
having	1
the	1
insolence	1
to	1
confound	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
official	1
detective	1
force!	1
This	1
incident	1
gives	1
zest	1
to	1
our	1
investigation,	1
however,	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
trust	1
that	1
our	1
little	1
friend	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
from	1
her	1
imprudence	1
in	1
allowing	1
this	1
brute	1
to	1
trace	1
her.	1
And	1
now,	1
Watson,	1
we	1
shall	1
order	1
breakfast,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
I	1
shall	1
walk	1
down	1
to	1
Doctors'	1
Commons,	1
where	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
data	1
which	1
may	1
help	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
matter."	1
	1
	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
one	1
o'clock	1
when	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
returned	1
from	1
his	1
excursion.	1
He	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
blue	1
paper,	1
scrawled	1
over	1
with	1
notes	1
and	1
figures.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
deceased	1
wife,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"To	1
determine	1
its	1
exact	1
meaning	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
the	1
present	1
prices	1
of	1
the	1
investments	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
concerned.	1
The	1
total	1
income,	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
wife's	1
death	1
was	1
little	1
short	1
of	1
1100	1
pounds,	1
is	1
now,	1
through	1
the	1
fall	1
in	1
agricultural	1
prices,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
750	1
pounds.	1
Each	1
daughter	1
can	1
claim	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
250	1
pounds,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
marriage.	1
It	1
is	1
evident,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
if	1
both	1
girls	1
had	1
married,	1
this	1
beauty	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
mere	1
pittance,	1
while	1
even	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
cripple	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
extent.	1
My	1
morning's	1
work	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
wasted,	1
since	1
it	1
has	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
very	1
strongest	1
motives	1
for	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
And	1
now,	1
Watson,	1
this	1
is	1
too	1
serious	1
for	1
dawdling,	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
aware	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
interesting	1
ourselves	1
in	1
his	1
affairs;	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
ready,	1
we	1
shall	1
call	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
drive	1
to	1
Waterloo.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
slip	1
your	1
revolver	1
into	1
your	1
pocket.	1
An	1
Eley's	1
No.	1
2	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
argument	1
with	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
can	1
twist	1
steel	1
pokers	1
into	1
knots.	1
That	1
and	1
a	1
tooth-brush	1
are,	1
I	1
think,	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
need."	1
	1
At	1
Waterloo	1
we	1
were	1
fortunate	1
in	1
catching	1
a	1
train	1
for	1
Leatherhead,	1
where	1
we	1
hired	1
a	1
trap	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
inn	1
and	1
drove	1
for	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
miles	1
through	1
the	1
lovely	1
Surrey	1
lanes.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
perfect	1
day,	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
sun	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
fleecy	1
clouds	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
The	1
trees	1
and	1
wayside	1
hedges	1
were	1
just	1
throwing	1
out	1
their	1
first	1
green	1
shoots,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
pleasant	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
moist	1
earth.	1
To	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
contrast	1
between	1
the	1
sweet	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
spring	1
and	1
this	1
sinister	1
quest	1
upon	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
engaged.	1
My	1
companion	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
trap,	1
his	1
arms	1
folded,	1
his	1
hat	1
pulled	1
down	1
over	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
his	1
chin	1
sunk	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
thought.	1
Suddenly,	1
however,	1
he	1
started,	1
tapped	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
pointed	1
over	1
the	1
meadows.	1
	1
"Look	1
there!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
A	1
heavily	1
timbered	1
park	1
stretched	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
gentle	1
slope,	1
thickening	1
into	1
a	1
grove	1
at	1
the	1
highest	1
point.	1
From	1
amid	1
the	1
branches	1
there	1
jutted	1
out	1
the	1
grey	1
gables	1
and	1
high	1
roof-tree	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
old	1
mansion.	1
	1
"Stoke	1
Moran?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
that	1
be	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
driver.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
some	1
building	1
going	1
on	1
there,"	1
said	1
Holmes;	1
"that	1
is	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
going."	1
	1
"There's	1
the	1
village,"	1
said	1
the	1
driver,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
roofs	1
some	1
distance	1
to	1
the	1
left;	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
you'll	1
find	1
it	1
shorter	1
to	1
get	1
over	1
this	1
stile,	1
and	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
foot-path	1
over	1
the	1
fields.	1
There	1
it	1
is,	1
where	1
the	1
lady	1
is	1
walking."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
lady,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
is	1
Miss	1
Stoner,"	1
observed	1
Holmes,	1
shading	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
suggest."	1
	1
We	1
got	1
off,	1
paid	1
our	1
fare,	1
and	1
the	1
trap	1
rattled	1
back	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
Leatherhead.	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
it	1
as	1
well,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
climbed	1
the	1
stile,	1
"that	1
this	1
fellow	1
should	1
think	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
here	1
as	1
architects,	1
or	1
on	1
some	1
definite	1
business.	1
It	1
may	1
stop	1
his	1
gossip.	1
Good-afternoon,	1
Miss	1
Stoner.	1
You	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
our	1
word."	1
	1
Our	1
client	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
had	1
hurried	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
which	1
spoke	1
her	1
joy.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
waiting	1
so	1
eagerly	1
for	1
you,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
us	1
warmly.	1
"All	1
has	1
turned	1
out	1
splendidly.	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
town,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
unlikely	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
back	1
before	1
evening."	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
doctor's	1
acquaintance,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
he	1
sketched	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
turned	1
white	1
to	1
the	1
lips	1
as	1
she	1
listened.	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"he	1
has	1
followed	1
me,	1
then."	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
appears."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
so	1
cunning	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
safe	1
from	1
him.	1
What	1
will	1
he	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
returns?"	1
	1
"He	1
must	1
guard	1
himself,	1
for	1
he	1
may	1
find	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
someone	1
more	1
cunning	1
than	1
himself	1
upon	1
his	1
track.	1
You	1
must	1
lock	1
yourself	1
up	1
from	1
him	1
to-night.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
violent,	1
we	1
shall	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
to	1
your	1
aunt's	1
at	1
Harrow.	1
Now,	1
we	1
must	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
use	1
of	1
our	1
time,	1
so	1
kindly	1
take	1
us	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
rooms	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
examine."	1
	1
The	1
building	1
was	1
of	1
grey,	1
lichen-blotched	1
stone,	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
central	1
portion	1
and	1
two	1
curving	1
wings,	1
like	1
the	1
claws	1
of	1
a	1
crab,	1
thrown	1
out	1
on	1
each	1
side.	1
In	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
wings	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
broken	1
and	1
blocked	1
with	1
wooden	1
boards,	1
while	1
the	1
roof	1
was	1
partly	1
caved	1
in,	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
ruin.	1
The	1
central	1
portion	1
was	1
in	1
little	1
better	1
repair,	1
but	1
the	1
right-hand	1
block	1
was	1
comparatively	1
modern,	1
and	1
the	1
blinds	1
in	1
the	1
windows,	1
with	1
the	1
blue	1
smoke	1
curling	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
chimneys,	1
showed	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
where	1
the	1
family	1
resided.	1
Some	1
scaffolding	1
had	1
been	1
erected	1
against	1
the	1
end	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
stone-work	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
into,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
any	1
workmen	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
our	1
visit.	1
Holmes	1
walked	1
slowly	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
ill-trimmed	1
lawn	1
and	1
examined	1
with	1
deep	1
attention	1
the	1
outsides	1
of	1
the	1
windows.	1
	1
"This,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
sleep,	1
the	1
centre	1
one	1
to	1
your	1
sister's,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
building	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's	1
chamber?"	1
	1
"Exactly	1
so.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
sleeping	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
one."	1
	1
"Pending	1
the	1
alterations,	1
as	1
I	1
understand.	1
By	1
the	1
way,	1
there	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
very	1
pressing	1
need	1
for	1
repairs	1
at	1
that	1
end	1
wall."	1
	1
"There	1
were	1
none.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
excuse	1
to	1
move	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
room."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
that	1
is	1
suggestive.	1
Now,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
narrow	1
wing	1
runs	1
the	1
corridor	1
from	1
which	1
these	1
three	1
rooms	1
open.	1
There	1
are	1
windows	1
in	1
it,	1
of	1
course?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
very	1
small	1
ones.	1
Too	1
narrow	1
for	1
anyone	1
to	1
pass	1
through."	1
	1
"As	1
you	1
both	1
locked	1
your	1
doors	1
at	1
night,	1
your	1
rooms	1
were	1
unapproachable	1
from	1
that	1
side.	1
Now,	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
kindness	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
your	1
room	1
and	1
bar	1
your	1
shutters?"	1
	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
Holmes,	1
after	1
a	1
careful	1
examination	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
window,	1
endeavoured	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
to	1
force	1
the	1
shutter	1
open,	1
but	1
without	1
success.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
slit	1
through	1
which	1
a	1
knife	1
could	1
be	1
passed	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
bar.	1
Then	1
with	1
his	1
lens	1
he	1
tested	1
the	1
hinges,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
solid	1
iron,	1
built	1
firmly	1
into	1
the	1
massive	1
masonry.	1
"Hum!"	1
said	1
he,	1
scratching	1
his	1
chin	1
in	1
some	1
perplexity,	1
"my	1
theory	1
certainly	1
presents	1
some	1
difficulties.	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
pass	1
these	1
shutters	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
bolted.	1
Well,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
inside	1
throws	1
any	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
matter."	1
	1
A	1
small	1
side	1
door	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
whitewashed	1
corridor	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
three	1
bedrooms	1
opened.	1
Holmes	1
refused	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
third	1
chamber,	1
so	1
we	1
passed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
second,	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
was	1
now	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
met	1
with	1
her	1
fate.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
homely	1
little	1
room,	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
ceiling	1
and	1
a	1
gaping	1
fireplace,	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
old	1
country-houses.	1
A	1
brown	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
stood	1
in	1
one	1
corner,	1
a	1
narrow	1
white-counterpaned	1
bed	1
in	1
another,	1
and	1
a	1
dressing-table	1
on	1
the	1
left-hand	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
These	1
articles,	1
with	1
two	1
small	1
wicker-work	1
chairs,	1
made	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
save	1
for	1
a	1
square	1
of	1
Wilton	1
carpet	1
in	1
the	1
centre.	1
The	1
boards	1
round	1
and	1
the	1
panelling	1
of	1
the	1
walls	1
were	1
of	1
brown,	1
worm-eaten	1
oak,	1
so	1
old	1
and	1
discoloured	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
dated	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
Holmes	1
drew	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chairs	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
and	1
sat	1
silent,	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
travelled	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
and	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
taking	1
in	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
apartment.	1
	1
"Where	1
does	1
that	1
bell	1
communicate	1
with?"	1
he	1
asked	1
at	1
last	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
thick	1
bell-rope	1
which	1
hung	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
bed,	1
the	1
tassel	1
actually	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
"It	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
housekeeper's	1
room."	1
	1
"It	1
looks	1
newer	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
things?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
put	1
there	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
years	1
ago."	1
	1
"Your	1
sister	1
asked	1
for	1
it,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
using	1
it.	1
We	1
used	1
always	1
to	1
get	1
what	1
we	1
wanted	1
for	1
ourselves."	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
it	1
seemed	1
unnecessary	1
to	1
put	1
so	1
nice	1
a	1
bell-pull	1
there.	1
You	1
will	1
excuse	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
while	1
I	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
floor."	1
He	1
threw	1
himself	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
lens	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
crawled	1
swiftly	1
backward	1
and	1
forward,	1
examining	1
minutely	1
the	1
cracks	1
between	1
the	1
boards.	1
Then	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
wood-work	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
chamber	1
was	1
panelled.	1
Finally	1
he	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
staring	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
running	1
his	1
eye	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
wall.	1
Finally	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
bell-rope	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
brisk	1
tug.	1
	1
"Why,	1
it's	1
a	1
dummy,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Won't	1
it	1
ring?"	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
wire.	1
This	1
is	1
very	1
interesting.	1
You	1
can	1
see	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
fastened	1
to	1
a	1
hook	1
just	1
above	1
where	1
the	1
little	1
opening	1
for	1
the	1
ventilator	1
is."	1
	1
"How	1
very	1
absurd!	1
I	1
never	1
noticed	1
that	1
before."	1
	1
"Very	1
strange!"	1
muttered	1
Holmes,	1
pulling	1
at	1
the	1
rope.	1
"There	1
are	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
very	1
singular	1
points	1
about	1
this	1
room.	1
For	1
example,	1
what	1
a	1
fool	1
a	1
builder	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
open	1
a	1
ventilator	1
into	1
another	1
room,	1
when,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
trouble,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
communicated	1
with	1
the	1
outside	1
air!"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
also	1
quite	1
modern,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady.	1
	1
"Done	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
bell-rope?"	1
remarked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
little	1
changes	1
carried	1
out	1
about	1
that	1
time."	1
	1
"They	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
character--dummy	1
bell-ropes,	1
and	1
ventilators	1
which	1
do	1
not	1
ventilate.	1
With	1
your	1
permission,	1
Miss	1
Stoner,	1
we	1
shall	1
now	1
carry	1
our	1
researches	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
apartment."	1
	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott's	1
chamber	1
was	1
larger	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
step-daughter,	1
but	1
was	1
as	1
plainly	1
furnished.	1
A	1
camp-bed,	1
a	1
small	1
wooden	1
shelf	1
full	1
of	1
books,	1
mostly	1
of	1
a	1
technical	1
character,	1
an	1
armchair	1
beside	1
the	1
bed,	1
a	1
plain	1
wooden	1
chair	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
a	1
round	1
table,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
iron	1
safe	1
were	1
the	1
principal	1
things	1
which	1
met	1
the	1
eye.	1
Holmes	1
walked	1
slowly	1
round	1
and	1
examined	1
each	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
keenest	1
interest.	1
	1
"What's	1
in	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
tapping	1
the	1
safe.	1
	1
"My	1
stepfather's	1
business	1
papers."	1
	1
"Oh!	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
inside,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Only	1
once,	1
some	1
years	1
ago.	1
I	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
papers."	1
	1
"There	1
isn't	1
a	1
cat	1
in	1
it,	1
for	1
example?"	1
	1
"No.	1
What	1
a	1
strange	1
idea!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
look	1
at	1
this!"	1
He	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
small	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"No;	1
we	1
don't	1
keep	1
a	1
cat.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
cheetah	1
and	1
a	1
baboon."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course!	1
Well,	1
a	1
cheetah	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
big	1
cat,	1
and	1
yet	1
a	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk	1
does	1
not	1
go	1
very	1
far	1
in	1
satisfying	1
its	1
wants,	1
I	1
daresay.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
point	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
determine."	1
He	1
squatted	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
wooden	1
chair	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
That	1
is	1
quite	1
settled,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
lens	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"Hullo!	1
Here	1
is	1
something	1
interesting!"	1
	1
The	1
object	1
which	1
had	1
caught	1
his	1
eye	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
dog	1
lash	1
hung	1
on	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
bed.	1
The	1
lash,	1
however,	1
was	1
curled	1
upon	1
itself	1
and	1
tied	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
loop	1
of	1
whipcord.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
that,	1
Watson?"	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
common	1
enough	1
lash.	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
tied."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
common,	1
is	1
it?	1
Ah,	1
me!	1
it's	1
a	1
wicked	1
world,	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
clever	1
man	1
turns	1
his	1
brains	1
to	1
crime	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
enough	1
now,	1
Miss	1
Stoner,	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
permission	1
we	1
shall	1
walk	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
lawn."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
my	1
friend's	1
face	1
so	1
grim	1
or	1
his	1
brow	1
so	1
dark	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
when	1
we	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
this	1
investigation.	1
We	1
had	1
walked	1
several	1
times	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
lawn,	1
neither	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
nor	1
myself	1
liking	1
to	1
break	1
in	1
upon	1
his	1
thoughts	1
before	1
he	1
roused	1
himself	1
from	1
his	1
reverie.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
essential,	1
Miss	1
Stoner,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
you	1
should	1
absolutely	1
follow	1
my	1
advice	1
in	1
every	1
respect."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
most	1
certainly	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
"The	1
matter	1
is	1
too	1
serious	1
for	1
any	1
hesitation.	1
Your	1
life	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
your	1
compliance."	1
	1
"I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
your	1
hands."	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
both	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
your	1
room."	1
	1
Both	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
and	1
I	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
astonishment.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so.	1
Let	1
me	1
explain.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
village	1
inn	1
over	1
there?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
Crown."	1
	1
"Very	1
good.	1
Your	1
windows	1
would	1
be	1
visible	1
from	1
there?"	1
	1
"Certainly."	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
confine	1
yourself	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
on	1
pretence	1
of	1
a	1
headache,	1
when	1
your	1
stepfather	1
comes	1
back.	1
Then	1
when	1
you	1
hear	1
him	1
retire	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
you	1
must	1
open	1
the	1
shutters	1
of	1
your	1
window,	1
undo	1
the	1
hasp,	1
put	1
your	1
lamp	1
there	1
as	1
a	1
signal	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
then	1
withdraw	1
quietly	1
with	1
everything	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
want	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
which	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
occupy.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
repairs,	1
you	1
could	1
manage	1
there	1
for	1
one	1
night."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
easily."	1
	1
"The	1
rest	1
you	1
will	1
leave	1
in	1
our	1
hands."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
do?"	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
your	1
room,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
investigate	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
noise	1
which	1
has	1
disturbed	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
believe,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
made	1
up	1
your	1
mind,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Stoner,	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
upon	1
my	1
companion's	1
sleeve.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
have."	1
	1
"Then,	1
for	1
pity's	1
sake,	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
sister's	1
death."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
prefer	1
to	1
have	1
clearer	1
proofs	1
before	1
I	1
speak."	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
tell	1
me	1
whether	1
my	1
own	1
thought	1
is	1
correct,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
died	1
from	1
some	1
sudden	1
fright."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
so.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
probably	1
some	1
more	1
tangible	1
cause.	1
And	1
now,	1
Miss	1
Stoner,	1
we	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
for	1
if	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
returned	1
and	1
saw	1
us	1
our	1
journey	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
vain.	1
Good-bye,	1
and	1
be	1
brave,	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you,	1
you	1
may	1
rest	1
assured	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
drive	1
away	1
the	1
dangers	1
that	1
threaten	1
you."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
engaging	1
a	1
bedroom	1
and	1
sitting-room	1
at	1
the	1
Crown	1
Inn.	1
They	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
floor,	1
and	1
from	1
our	1
window	1
we	1
could	1
command	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
gate,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
inhabited	1
wing	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran	1
Manor	1
House.	1
At	1
dusk	1
we	1
saw	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott	1
drive	1
past,	1
his	1
huge	1
form	1
looming	1
up	1
beside	1
the	1
little	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
lad	1
who	1
drove	1
him.	1
The	1
boy	1
had	1
some	1
slight	1
difficulty	1
in	1
undoing	1
the	1
heavy	1
iron	1
gates,	1
and	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
hoarse	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
doctor's	1
voice	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
fury	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
clinched	1
fists	1
at	1
him.	1
The	1
trap	1
drove	1
on,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
sudden	1
light	1
spring	1
up	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
as	1
the	1
lamp	1
was	1
lit	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sitting-rooms.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
gathering	1
darkness,	1
"I	1
have	1
really	1
some	1
scruples	1
as	1
to	1
taking	1
you	1
to-night.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
distinct	1
element	1
of	1
danger."	1
	1
"Can	1
I	1
be	1
of	1
assistance?"	1
	1
"Your	1
presence	1
might	1
be	1
invaluable."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
kind	1
of	1
you."	1
	1
"You	1
speak	1
of	1
danger.	1
You	1
have	1
evidently	1
seen	1
more	1
in	1
these	1
rooms	1
than	1
was	1
visible	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
fancy	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
deduced	1
a	1
little	1
more.	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
you	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
did."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
nothing	1
remarkable	1
save	1
the	1
bell-rope,	1
and	1
what	1
purpose	1
that	1
could	1
answer	1
I	1
confess	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
imagine."	1
	1
"You	1
saw	1
the	1
ventilator,	1
too?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
unusual	1
thing	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
small	1
opening	1
between	1
two	1
rooms.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
a	1
rat	1
could	1
hardly	1
pass	1
through."	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
find	1
a	1
ventilator	1
before	1
ever	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Stoke	1
Moran."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Holmes!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
did.	1
You	1
remember	1
in	1
her	1
statement	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
could	1
smell	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's	1
cigar.	1
Now,	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
suggested	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
communication	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
rooms.	1
It	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
a	1
small	1
one,	1
or	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
remarked	1
upon	1
at	1
the	1
coroner's	1
inquiry.	1
I	1
deduced	1
a	1
ventilator."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
harm	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
that?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
there	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
curious	1
coincidence	1
of	1
dates.	1
A	1
ventilator	1
is	1
made,	1
a	1
cord	1
is	1
hung,	1
and	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
sleeps	1
in	1
the	1
bed	1
dies.	1
Does	1
not	1
that	1
strike	1
you?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
as	1
yet	1
see	1
any	1
connection."	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
observe	1
anything	1
very	1
peculiar	1
about	1
that	1
bed?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
clamped	1
to	1
the	1
floor.	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
a	1
bed	1
fastened	1
like	1
that	1
before?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have."	1
	1
"The	1
lady	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
her	1
bed.	1
It	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
relative	1
position	1
to	1
the	1
ventilator	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rope--or	1
so	1
we	1
may	1
call	1
it,	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
clearly	1
never	1
meant	1
for	1
a	1
bell-pull."	1
	1
"Holmes,"	1
I	1
cried,	1
"I	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
dimly	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
hinting	1
at.	1
We	1
are	1
only	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
prevent	1
some	1
subtle	1
and	1
horrible	1
crime."	1
	1
"Subtle	1
enough	1
and	1
horrible	1
enough.	1
When	1
a	1
doctor	1
does	1
go	1
wrong	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
criminals.	1
He	1
has	1
nerve	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
knowledge.	1
Palmer	1
and	1
Pritchard	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
their	1
profession.	1
This	1
man	1
strikes	1
even	1
deeper,	1
but	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
strike	1
deeper	1
still.	1
But	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
horrors	1
enough	1
before	1
the	1
night	1
is	1
over;	1
for	1
goodness'	1
sake	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
a	1
quiet	1
pipe	1
and	1
turn	1
our	1
minds	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
to	1
something	1
more	1
cheerful."	1
	1
	1
About	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
the	1
light	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
was	1
extinguished,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
dark	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Manor	1
House.	1
Two	1
hours	1
passed	1
slowly	1
away,	1
and	1
then,	1
suddenly,	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
eleven,	1
a	1
single	1
bright	1
light	1
shone	1
out	1
right	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
our	1
signal,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
springing	1
to	1
his	1
feet;	1
"it	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
middle	1
window."	1
	1
As	1
we	1
passed	1
out	1
he	1
exchanged	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
with	1
the	1
landlord,	1
explaining	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
a	1
late	1
visit	1
to	1
an	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
there.	1
A	1
moment	1
later	1
we	1
were	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
dark	1
road,	1
a	1
chill	1
wind	1
blowing	1
in	1
our	1
faces,	1
and	1
one	1
yellow	1
light	1
twinkling	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
to	1
guide	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
sombre	1
errand.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
little	1
difficulty	1
in	1
entering	1
the	1
grounds,	1
for	1
unrepaired	1
breaches	1
gaped	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
park	1
wall.	1
Making	1
our	1
way	1
among	1
the	1
trees,	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
lawn,	1
crossed	1
it,	1
and	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
enter	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
when	1
out	1
from	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
laurel	1
bushes	1
there	1
darted	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
hideous	1
and	1
distorted	1
child,	1
who	1
threw	1
itself	1
upon	1
the	1
grass	1
with	1
writhing	1
limbs	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
swiftly	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"My	1
God!"	1
I	1
whispered;	1
"did	1
you	1
see	1
it?"	1
	1
Holmes	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
as	1
startled	1
as	1
I.	1
His	1
hand	1
closed	1
like	1
a	1
vice	1
upon	1
my	1
wrist	1
in	1
his	1
agitation.	1
Then	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
low	1
laugh	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
my	1
ear.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
nice	1
household,"	1
he	1
murmured.	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
baboon."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
strange	1
pets	1
which	1
the	1
doctor	1
affected.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
cheetah,	1
too;	1
perhaps	1
we	1
might	1
find	1
it	1
upon	1
our	1
shoulders	1
at	1
any	1
moment.	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
easier	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
when,	1
after	1
following	1
Holmes'	1
example	1
and	1
slipping	1
off	1
my	1
shoes,	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
inside	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
My	1
companion	1
noiselessly	1
closed	1
the	1
shutters,	1
moved	1
the	1
lamp	1
onto	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
round	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
was	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
daytime.	1
Then	1
creeping	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
trumpet	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
he	1
whispered	1
into	1
my	1
ear	1
again	1
so	1
gently	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
distinguish	1
the	1
words:	1
	1
"The	1
least	1
sound	1
would	1
be	1
fatal	1
to	1
our	1
plans."	1
	1
I	1
nodded	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
heard.	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
sit	1
without	1
light.	1
He	1
would	1
see	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
ventilator."	1
	1
I	1
nodded	1
again.	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
go	1
asleep;	1
your	1
very	1
life	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it.	1
Have	1
your	1
pistol	1
ready	1
in	1
case	1
we	1
should	1
need	1
it.	1
I	1
will	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
chair."	1
	1
I	1
took	1
out	1
my	1
revolver	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
Holmes	1
had	1
brought	1
up	1
a	1
long	1
thin	1
cane,	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
placed	1
upon	1
the	1
bed	1
beside	1
him.	1
By	1
it	1
he	1
laid	1
the	1
box	1
of	1
matches	1
and	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
a	1
candle.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
down	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
darkness.	1
	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
ever	1
forget	1
that	1
dreadful	1
vigil?	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
a	1
sound,	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
drawing	1
of	1
a	1
breath,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
my	1
companion	1
sat	1
open-eyed,	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
of	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
nervous	1
tension	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
myself.	1
The	1
shutters	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
least	1
ray	1
of	1
light,	1
and	1
we	1
waited	1
in	1
absolute	1
darkness.	1
	1
From	1
outside	1
came	1
the	1
occasional	1
cry	1
of	1
a	1
night-bird,	1
and	1
once	1
at	1
our	1
very	1
window	1
a	1
long	1
drawn	1
catlike	1
whine,	1
which	1
told	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
cheetah	1
was	1
indeed	1
at	1
liberty.	1
Far	1
away	1
we	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
deep	1
tones	1
of	1
the	1
parish	1
clock,	1
which	1
boomed	1
out	1
every	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour.	1
How	1
long	1
they	1
seemed,	1
those	1
quarters!	1
Twelve	1
struck,	1
and	1
one	1
and	1
two	1
and	1
three,	1
and	1
still	1
we	1
sat	1
waiting	1
silently	1
for	1
whatever	1
might	1
befall.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
momentary	1
gleam	1
of	1
a	1
light	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
ventilator,	1
which	1
vanished	1
immediately,	1
but	1
was	1
succeeded	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
smell	1
of	1
burning	1
oil	1
and	1
heated	1
metal.	1
Someone	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
had	1
lit	1
a	1
dark-lantern.	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
gentle	1
sound	1
of	1
movement,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
was	1
silent	1
once	1
more,	1
though	1
the	1
smell	1
grew	1
stronger.	1
For	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
I	1
sat	1
with	1
straining	1
ears.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
another	1
sound	1
became	1
audible--a	1
very	1
gentle,	1
soothing	1
sound,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
jet	1
of	1
steam	1
escaping	1
continually	1
from	1
a	1
kettle.	1
The	1
instant	1
that	1
we	1
heard	1
it,	1
Holmes	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
bed,	1
struck	1
a	1
match,	1
and	1
lashed	1
furiously	1
with	1
his	1
cane	1
at	1
the	1
bell-pull.	1
	1
"You	1
see	1
it,	1
Watson?"	1
he	1
yelled.	1
"You	1
see	1
it?"	1
	1
But	1
I	1
saw	1
nothing.	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Holmes	1
struck	1
the	1
light	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
low,	1
clear	1
whistle,	1
but	1
the	1
sudden	1
glare	1
flashing	1
into	1
my	1
weary	1
eyes	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
which	1
my	1
friend	1
lashed	1
so	1
savagely.	1
I	1
could,	1
however,	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
deadly	1
pale	1
and	1
filled	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
loathing.	1
He	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
strike	1
and	1
was	1
gazing	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
ventilator	1
when	1
suddenly	1
there	1
broke	1
from	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
cry	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
listened.	1
It	1
swelled	1
up	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
a	1
hoarse	1
yell	1
of	1
pain	1
and	1
fear	1
and	1
anger	1
all	1
mingled	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
dreadful	1
shriek.	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
away	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
distant	1
parsonage,	1
that	1
cry	1
raised	1
the	1
sleepers	1
from	1
their	1
beds.	1
It	1
struck	1
cold	1
to	1
our	1
hearts,	1
and	1
I	1
stood	1
gazing	1
at	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
me,	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
echoes	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
died	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
silence	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
rose.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
mean?"	1
I	1
gasped.	1
	1
"It	1
means	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over,"	1
Holmes	1
answered.	1
"And	1
perhaps,	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
best.	1
Take	1
your	1
pistol,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
enter	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's	1
room."	1
	1
With	1
a	1
grave	1
face	1
he	1
lit	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
down	1
the	1
corridor.	1
Twice	1
he	1
struck	1
at	1
the	1
chamber	1
door	1
without	1
any	1
reply	1
from	1
within.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
handle	1
and	1
entered,	1
I	1
at	1
his	1
heels,	1
with	1
the	1
cocked	1
pistol	1
in	1
my	1
hand.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
singular	1
sight	1
which	1
met	1
our	1
eyes.	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
stood	1
a	1
dark-lantern	1
with	1
the	1
shutter	1
half	1
open,	1
throwing	1
a	1
brilliant	1
beam	1
of	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
iron	1
safe,	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
ajar.	1
Beside	1
this	1
table,	1
on	1
the	1
wooden	1
chair,	1
sat	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
grey	1
dressing-gown,	1
his	1
bare	1
ankles	1
protruding	1
beneath,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
thrust	1
into	1
red	1
heelless	1
Turkish	1
slippers.	1
Across	1
his	1
lap	1
lay	1
the	1
short	1
stock	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
lash	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
noticed	1
during	1
the	1
day.	1
His	1
chin	1
was	1
cocked	1
upward	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful,	1
rigid	1
stare	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
Round	1
his	1
brow	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
peculiar	1
yellow	1
band,	1
with	1
brownish	1
speckles,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
tightly	1
round	1
his	1
head.	1
As	1
we	1
entered	1
he	1
made	1
neither	1
sound	1
nor	1
motion.	1
	1
"The	1
band!	1
the	1
speckled	1
band!"	1
whispered	1
Holmes.	1
	1
I	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
forward.	1
In	1
an	1
instant	1
his	1
strange	1
headgear	1
began	1
to	1
move,	1
and	1
there	1
reared	1
itself	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
hair	1
the	1
squat	1
diamond-shaped	1
head	1
and	1
puffed	1
neck	1
of	1
a	1
loathsome	1
serpent.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
swamp	1
adder!"	1
cried	1
Holmes;	1
"the	1
deadliest	1
snake	1
in	1
India.	1
He	1
has	1
died	1
within	1
ten	1
seconds	1
of	1
being	1
bitten.	1
Violence	1
does,	1
in	1
truth,	1
recoil	1
upon	1
the	1
violent,	1
and	1
the	1
schemer	1
falls	1
into	1
the	1
pit	1
which	1
he	1
digs	1
for	1
another.	1
Let	1
us	1
thrust	1
this	1
creature	1
back	1
into	1
its	1
den,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
then	1
remove	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
to	1
some	1
place	1
of	1
shelter	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
county	1
police	1
know	1
what	1
has	1
happened."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
drew	1
the	1
dog-whip	1
swiftly	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
man's	1
lap,	1
and	1
throwing	1
the	1
noose	1
round	1
the	1
reptile's	1
neck	1
he	1
drew	1
it	1
from	1
its	1
horrid	1
perch	1
and,	1
carrying	1
it	1
at	1
arm's	1
length,	1
threw	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
iron	1
safe,	1
which	1
he	1
closed	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
Such	1
are	1
the	1
true	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott,	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
necessary	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
prolong	1
a	1
narrative	1
which	1
has	1
already	1
run	1
to	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
length	1
by	1
telling	1
how	1
we	1
broke	1
the	1
sad	1
news	1
to	1
the	1
terrified	1
girl,	1
how	1
we	1
conveyed	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
train	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
good	1
aunt	1
at	1
Harrow,	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
slow	1
process	1
of	1
official	1
inquiry	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
met	1
his	1
fate	1
while	1
indiscreetly	1
playing	1
with	1
a	1
dangerous	1
pet.	1
The	1
little	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
yet	1
to	1
learn	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
told	1
me	1
by	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
travelled	1
back	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
"I	1
had,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"come	1
to	1
an	1
entirely	1
erroneous	1
conclusion	1
which	1
shows,	1
my	1
dear	1
Watson,	1
how	1
dangerous	1
it	1
always	1
is	1
to	1
reason	1
from	1
insufficient	1
data.	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
gipsies,	1
and	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
'band,'	1
which	1
was	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
poor	1
girl,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
appearance	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
hurried	1
glimpse	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
her	1
match,	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
upon	1
an	1
entirely	1
wrong	1
scent.	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
claim	1
the	1
merit	1
that	1
I	1
instantly	1
reconsidered	1
my	1
position	1
when,	1
however,	1
it	1
became	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
whatever	1
danger	1
threatened	1
an	1
occupant	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
either	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
or	1
the	1
door.	1
My	1
attention	1
was	1
speedily	1
drawn,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
remarked	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
this	1
ventilator,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
bell-rope	1
which	1
hung	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bed.	1
The	1
discovery	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
dummy,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
bed	1
was	1
clamped	1
to	1
the	1
floor,	1
instantly	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
suspicion	1
that	1
the	1
rope	1
was	1
there	1
as	1
a	1
bridge	1
for	1
something	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
bed.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
snake	1
instantly	1
occurred	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
coupled	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
knowledge	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
creatures	1
from	1
India,	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
probably	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
track.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
using	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
poison	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
be	1
discovered	1
by	1
any	1
chemical	1
test	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
would	1
occur	1
to	1
a	1
clever	1
and	1
ruthless	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
an	1
Eastern	1
training.	1
The	1
rapidity	1
with	1
which	1
such	1
a	1
poison	1
would	1
take	1
effect	1
would	1
also,	1
from	1
his	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
be	1
an	1
advantage.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
sharp-eyed	1
coroner,	1
indeed,	1
who	1
could	1
distinguish	1
the	1
two	1
little	1
dark	1
punctures	1
which	1
would	1
show	1
where	1
the	1
poison	1
fangs	1
had	1
done	1
their	1
work.	1
Then	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
whistle.	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
must	1
recall	1
the	1
snake	1
before	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
revealed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
victim.	1
He	1
had	1
trained	1
it,	1
probably	1
by	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
milk	1
which	1
we	1
saw,	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
summoned.	1
He	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
through	1
this	1
ventilator	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
best,	1
with	1
the	1
certainty	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
crawl	1
down	1
the	1
rope	1
and	1
land	1
on	1
the	1
bed.	1
It	1
might	1
or	1
might	1
not	1
bite	1
the	1
occupant,	1
perhaps	1
she	1
might	1
escape	1
every	1
night	1
for	1
a	1
week,	1
but	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
she	1
must	1
fall	1
a	1
victim.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
these	1
conclusions	1
before	1
ever	1
I	1
had	1
entered	1
his	1
room.	1
An	1
inspection	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
showed	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
standing	1
on	1
it,	1
which	1
of	1
course	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
reach	1
the	1
ventilator.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
safe,	1
the	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
the	1
loop	1
of	1
whipcord	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
finally	1
dispel	1
any	1
doubts	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
remained.	1
The	1
metallic	1
clang	1
heard	1
by	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
was	1
obviously	1
caused	1
by	1
her	1
stepfather	1
hastily	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
safe	1
upon	1
its	1
terrible	1
occupant.	1
Having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
steps	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
proof.	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
creature	1
hiss	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
also,	1
and	1
I	1
instantly	1
lit	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
attacked	1
it."	1
	1
"With	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
driving	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
ventilator."	1
	1
"And	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
causing	1
it	1
to	1
turn	1
upon	1
its	1
master	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
blows	1
of	1
my	1
cane	1
came	1
home	1
and	1
roused	1
its	1
snakish	1
temper,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
flew	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
it	1
saw.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
doubt	1
indirectly	1
responsible	1
for	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott's	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
weigh	1
very	1
heavily	1
upon	1
my	1
conscience."	1
	1
	1
	1
IX.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
ENGINEER'S	1
THUMB	1
	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
problems	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
submitted	1
to	1
my	1
friend,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
for	1
solution	1
during	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
our	1
intimacy,	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
two	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
introducing	1
to	1
his	1
notice--that	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Hatherley's	1
thumb,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Warburton's	1
madness.	1
Of	1
these	1
the	1
latter	1
may	1
have	1
afforded	1
a	1
finer	1
field	1
for	1
an	1
acute	1
and	1
original	1
observer,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
in	1
its	1
inception	1
and	1
so	1
dramatic	1
in	1
its	1
details	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
placed	1
upon	1
record,	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
gave	1
my	1
friend	1
fewer	1
openings	1
for	1
those	1
deductive	1
methods	1
of	1
reasoning	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
achieved	1
such	1
remarkable	1
results.	1
The	1
story	1
has,	1
I	1
believe,	1
been	1
told	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
newspapers,	1
but,	1
like	1
all	1
such	1
narratives,	1
its	1
effect	1
is	1
much	1
less	1
striking	1
when	1
set	1
forth	1
en	1
bloc	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
half-column	1
of	1
print	1
than	1
when	1
the	1
facts	1
slowly	1
evolve	1
before	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
mystery	1
clears	1
gradually	1
away	1
as	1
each	1
new	1
discovery	1
furnishes	1
a	1
step	1
which	1
leads	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
complete	1
truth.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
circumstances	1
made	1
a	1
deep	1
impression	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
has	1
hardly	1
served	1
to	1
weaken	1
the	1
effect.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
'89,	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
my	1
marriage,	1
that	1
the	1
events	1
occurred	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
summarise.	1
I	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
civil	1
practice	1
and	1
had	1
finally	1
abandoned	1
Holmes	1
in	1
his	1
Baker	1
Street	1
rooms,	1
although	1
I	1
continually	1
visited	1
him	1
and	1
occasionally	1
even	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
forgo	1
his	1
Bohemian	1
habits	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
us.	1
My	1
practice	1
had	1
steadily	1
increased,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
no	1
very	1
great	1
distance	1
from	1
Paddington	1
Station,	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
few	1
patients	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
officials.	1
One	1
of	1
these,	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
cured	1
of	1
a	1
painful	1
and	1
lingering	1
disease,	1
was	1
never	1
weary	1
of	1
advertising	1
my	1
virtues	1
and	1
of	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
on	1
every	1
sufferer	1
over	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
any	1
influence.	1
	1
One	1
morning,	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
seven	1
o'clock,	1
I	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
maid	1
tapping	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
two	1
men	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Paddington	1
and	1
were	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
consulting-room.	1
I	1
dressed	1
hurriedly,	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
railway	1
cases	1
were	1
seldom	1
trivial,	1
and	1
hastened	1
downstairs.	1
As	1
I	1
descended,	1
my	1
old	1
ally,	1
the	1
guard,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
tightly	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
"I've	1
got	1
him	1
here,"	1
he	1
whispered,	1
jerking	1
his	1
thumb	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder;	1
"he's	1
all	1
right."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
then?"	1
I	1
asked,	1
for	1
his	1
manner	1
suggested	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
strange	1
creature	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
caged	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
room.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
new	1
patient,"	1
he	1
whispered.	1
"I	1
thought	1
I'd	1
bring	1
him	1
round	1
myself;	1
then	1
he	1
couldn't	1
slip	1
away.	1
There	1
he	1
is,	1
all	1
safe	1
and	1
sound.	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
now,	1
Doctor;	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
dooties,	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
you."	1
And	1
off	1
he	1
went,	1
this	1
trusty	1
tout,	1
without	1
even	1
giving	1
me	1
time	1
to	1
thank	1
him.	1
	1
I	1
entered	1
my	1
consulting-room	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
gentleman	1
seated	1
by	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
was	1
quietly	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
heather	1
tweed	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
cloth	1
cap	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
down	1
upon	1
my	1
books.	1
Round	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
wrapped,	1
which	1
was	1
mottled	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
bloodstains.	1
He	1
was	1
young,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five-and-twenty,	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
with	1
a	1
strong,	1
masculine	1
face;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
pale	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
suffering	1
from	1
some	1
strong	1
agitation,	1
which	1
it	1
took	1
all	1
his	1
strength	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
control.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
knock	1
you	1
up	1
so	1
early,	1
Doctor,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
accident	1
during	1
the	1
night.	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
by	1
train	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
on	1
inquiring	1
at	1
Paddington	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
I	1
might	1
find	1
a	1
doctor,	1
a	1
worthy	1
fellow	1
very	1
kindly	1
escorted	1
me	1
here.	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
maid	1
a	1
card,	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
left	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
side-table."	1
	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
it.	1
"Mr.	1
Victor	1
Hatherley,	1
hydraulic	1
engineer,	1
16A,	1
Victoria	1
Street	1
(3rd	1
floor)."	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
name,	1
style,	1
and	1
abode	1
of	1
my	1
morning	1
visitor.	1
"I	1
regret	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
you	1
waiting,"	1
said	1
I,	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
my	1
library-chair.	1
"You	1
are	1
fresh	1
from	1
a	1
night	1
journey,	1
I	1
understand,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
itself	1
a	1
monotonous	1
occupation."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
night	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
monotonous,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
laughed.	1
He	1
laughed	1
very	1
heartily,	1
with	1
a	1
high,	1
ringing	1
note,	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
sides.	1
All	1
my	1
medical	1
instincts	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
that	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Stop	1
it!"	1
I	1
cried;	1
"pull	1
yourself	1
together!"	1
and	1
I	1
poured	1
out	1
some	1
water	1
from	1
a	1
caraffe.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
useless,	1
however.	1
He	1
was	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
hysterical	1
outbursts	1
which	1
come	1
upon	1
a	1
strong	1
nature	1
when	1
some	1
great	1
crisis	1
is	1
over	1
and	1
gone.	1
Presently	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
once	1
more,	1
very	1
weary	1
and	1
pale-looking.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
myself,"	1
he	1
gasped.	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
Drink	1
this."	1
I	1
dashed	1
some	1
brandy	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
colour	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
bloodless	1
cheeks.	1
	1
"That's	1
better!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"And	1
now,	1
Doctor,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
kindly	1
attend	1
to	1
my	1
thumb,	1
or	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
my	1
thumb	1
used	1
to	1
be."	1
	1
He	1
unwound	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
It	1
gave	1
even	1
my	1
hardened	1
nerves	1
a	1
shudder	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
There	1
were	1
four	1
protruding	1
fingers	1
and	1
a	1
horrid	1
red,	1
spongy	1
surface	1
where	1
the	1
thumb	1
should	1
have	1
been.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
hacked	1
or	1
torn	1
right	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
roots.	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
I	1
cried,	1
"this	1
is	1
a	1
terrible	1
injury.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
bled	1
considerably."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
did.	1
I	1
fainted	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
done,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
When	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
bleeding,	1
so	1
I	1
tied	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
very	1
tightly	1
round	1
the	1
wrist	1
and	1
braced	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
twig."	1
	1
"Excellent!	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
surgeon."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
hydraulics,	1
you	1
see,	1
and	1
came	1
within	1
my	1
own	1
province."	1
	1
"This	1
has	1
been	1
done,"	1
said	1
I,	1
examining	1
the	1
wound,	1
"by	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
and	1
sharp	1
instrument."	1
	1
"A	1
thing	1
like	1
a	1
cleaver,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"An	1
accident,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
	1
"By	1
no	1
means."	1
	1
"What!	1
a	1
murderous	1
attack?"	1
	1
"Very	1
murderous	1
indeed."	1
	1
"You	1
horrify	1
me."	1
	1
I	1
sponged	1
the	1
wound,	1
cleaned	1
it,	1
dressed	1
it,	1
and	1
finally	1
covered	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
cotton	1
wadding	1
and	1
carbolised	1
bandages.	1
He	1
lay	1
back	1
without	1
wincing,	1
though	1
he	1
bit	1
his	1
lip	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
that?"	1
I	1
asked	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
finished.	1
	1
"Capital!	1
Between	1
your	1
brandy	1
and	1
your	1
bandage,	1
I	1
feel	1
a	1
new	1
man.	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
weak,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
go	1
through."	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
It	1
is	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
your	1
nerves."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
not	1
now.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
my	1
tale	1
to	1
the	1
police;	1
but,	1
between	1
ourselves,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
convincing	1
evidence	1
of	1
this	1
wound	1
of	1
mine,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
they	1
believed	1
my	1
statement,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
extraordinary	1
one,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
proof	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
back	1
it	1
up;	1
and,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
believe	1
me,	1
the	1
clues	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
them	1
are	1
so	1
vague	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
whether	1
justice	1
will	1
be	1
done."	1
	1
"Ha!"	1
cried	1
I,	1
"if	1
it	1
is	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
a	1
problem	1
which	1
you	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
solved,	1
I	1
should	1
strongly	1
recommend	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
friend,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
before	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
official	1
police."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
that	1
fellow,"	1
answered	1
my	1
visitor,	1
"and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
matter	1
up,	1
though	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
must	1
use	1
the	1
official	1
police	1
as	1
well.	1
Would	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
an	1
introduction	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
"I'll	1
do	1
better.	1
I'll	1
take	1
you	1
round	1
to	1
him	1
myself."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
immensely	1
obliged	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"We'll	1
call	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
go	1
together.	1
We	1
shall	1
just	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
breakfast	1
with	1
him.	1
Do	1
you	1
feel	1
equal	1
to	1
it?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
feel	1
easy	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
my	1
story."	1
	1
"Then	1
my	1
servant	1
will	1
call	1
a	1
cab,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
an	1
instant."	1
I	1
rushed	1
upstairs,	1
explained	1
the	1
matter	1
shortly	1
to	1
my	1
wife,	1
and	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
was	1
inside	1
a	1
hansom,	1
driving	1
with	1
my	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was,	1
as	1
I	1
expected,	1
lounging	1
about	1
his	1
sitting-room	1
in	1
his	1
dressing-gown,	1
reading	1
the	1
agony	1
column	1
of	1
The	1
Times	1
and	1
smoking	1
his	1
before-breakfast	1
pipe,	1
which	1
was	1
composed	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
plugs	1
and	1
dottles	1
left	1
from	1
his	1
smokes	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
all	1
carefully	1
dried	1
and	1
collected	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
mantelpiece.	1
He	1
received	1
us	1
in	1
his	1
quietly	1
genial	1
fashion,	1
ordered	1
fresh	1
rashers	1
and	1
eggs,	1
and	1
joined	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
hearty	1
meal.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
concluded	1
he	1
settled	1
our	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa,	1
placed	1
a	1
pillow	1
beneath	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
laid	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
brandy	1
and	1
water	1
within	1
his	1
reach.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
experience	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
common	1
one,	1
Mr.	1
Hatherley,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Pray,	1
lie	1
down	1
there	1
and	1
make	1
yourself	1
absolutely	1
at	1
home.	1
Tell	1
us	1
what	1
you	1
can,	1
but	1
stop	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
tired	1
and	1
keep	1
up	1
your	1
strength	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
stimulant."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
my	1
patient,	1
"but	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
another	1
man	1
since	1
the	1
doctor	1
bandaged	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
your	1
breakfast	1
has	1
completed	1
the	1
cure.	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
up	1
as	1
little	1
of	1
your	1
valuable	1
time	1
as	1
possible,	1
so	1
I	1
shall	1
start	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
my	1
peculiar	1
experiences."	1
	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
big	1
armchair	1
with	1
the	1
weary,	1
heavy-lidded	1
expression	1
which	1
veiled	1
his	1
keen	1
and	1
eager	1
nature,	1
while	1
I	1
sat	1
opposite	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
the	1
strange	1
story	1
which	1
our	1
visitor	1
detailed	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
know,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
orphan	1
and	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
residing	1
alone	1
in	1
lodgings	1
in	1
London.	1
By	1
profession	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
engineer,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
considerable	1
experience	1
of	1
my	1
work	1
during	1
the	1
seven	1
years	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
apprenticed	1
to	1
Venner	1
&	1
Matheson,	1
the	1
well-known	1
firm,	1
of	1
Greenwich.	1
Two	1
years	1
ago,	1
having	1
served	1
my	1
time,	1
and	1
having	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
a	1
fair	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
through	1
my	1
poor	1
father's	1
death,	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
start	1
in	1
business	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
took	1
professional	1
chambers	1
in	1
Victoria	1
Street.	1
	1
"I	1
suppose	1
that	1
everyone	1
finds	1
his	1
first	1
independent	1
start	1
in	1
business	1
a	1
dreary	1
experience.	1
To	1
me	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
exceptionally	1
so.	1
During	1
two	1
years	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
three	1
consultations	1
and	1
one	1
small	1
job,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
absolutely	1
all	1
that	1
my	1
profession	1
has	1
brought	1
me.	1
My	1
gross	1
takings	1
amount	1
to	1
27	1
pounds	1
10s.	1
Every	1
day,	1
from	1
nine	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
until	1
four	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
I	1
waited	1
in	1
my	1
little	1
den,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
my	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
sink,	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
any	1
practice	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
"Yesterday,	1
however,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
leaving	1
the	1
office,	1
my	1
clerk	1
entered	1
to	1
say	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
waiting	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
upon	1
business.	1
He	1
brought	1
up	1
a	1
card,	1
too,	1
with	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
'Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark'	1
engraved	1
upon	1
it.	1
Close	1
at	1
his	1
heels	1
came	1
the	1
colonel	1
himself,	1
a	1
man	1
rather	1
over	1
the	1
middle	1
size,	1
but	1
of	1
an	1
exceeding	1
thinness.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen	1
so	1
thin	1
a	1
man.	1
His	1
whole	1
face	1
sharpened	1
away	1
into	1
nose	1
and	1
chin,	1
and	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
cheeks	1
was	1
drawn	1
quite	1
tense	1
over	1
his	1
outstanding	1
bones.	1
Yet	1
this	1
emaciation	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
natural	1
habit,	1
and	1
due	1
to	1
no	1
disease,	1
for	1
his	1
eye	1
was	1
bright,	1
his	1
step	1
brisk,	1
and	1
his	1
bearing	1
assured.	1
He	1
was	1
plainly	1
but	1
neatly	1
dressed,	1
and	1
his	1
age,	1
I	1
should	1
judge,	1
would	1
be	1
nearer	1
forty	1
than	1
thirty.	1
	1
"'Mr.	1
Hatherley?'	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
German	1
accent.	1
'You	1
have	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Hatherley,	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
proficient	1
in	1
his	1
profession	1
but	1
is	1
also	1
discreet	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
preserving	1
a	1
secret.'	1
	1
"I	1
bowed,	1
feeling	1
as	1
flattered	1
as	1
any	1
young	1
man	1
would	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
address.	1
'May	1
I	1
ask	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
who	1
gave	1
me	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
character?'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
moment.	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
source	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
both	1
an	1
orphan	1
and	1
a	1
bachelor	1
and	1
are	1
residing	1
alone	1
in	1
London.'	1
	1
"'That	1
is	1
quite	1
correct,'	1
I	1
answered;	1
'but	1
you	1
will	1
excuse	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
how	1
all	1
this	1
bears	1
upon	1
my	1
professional	1
qualifications.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
professional	1
matter	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
me?'	1
	1
"'Undoubtedly	1
so.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
that	1
all	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
really	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
professional	1
commission	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
absolute	1
secrecy	1
is	1
quite	1
essential--absolute	1
secrecy,	1
you	1
understand,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
we	1
may	1
expect	1
that	1
more	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
alone	1
than	1
from	1
one	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
his	1
family.'	1
	1
"'If	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
secret,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'you	1
may	1
absolutely	1
depend	1
upon	1
my	1
doing	1
so.'	1
	1
"He	1
looked	1
very	1
hard	1
at	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
spoke,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
so	1
suspicious	1
and	1
questioning	1
an	1
eye.	1
	1
"'Do	1
you	1
promise,	1
then?'	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
last.	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
I	1
promise.'	1
	1
"'Absolute	1
and	1
complete	1
silence	1
before,	1
during,	1
and	1
after?	1
No	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
matter	1
at	1
all,	1
either	1
in	1
word	1
or	1
writing?'	1
	1
"'I	1
have	1
already	1
given	1
you	1
my	1
word.'	1
	1
"'Very	1
good.'	1
He	1
suddenly	1
sprang	1
up,	1
and	1
darting	1
like	1
lightning	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
flung	1
open	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
passage	1
outside	1
was	1
empty.	1
	1
"'That's	1
all	1
right,'	1
said	1
he,	1
coming	1
back.	1
'I	1
know	1
that	1
clerks	1
are	1
sometimes	1
curious	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
master's	1
affairs.	1
Now	1
we	1
can	1
talk	1
in	1
safety.'	1
He	1
drew	1
up	1
his	1
chair	1
very	1
close	1
to	1
mine	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
stare	1
at	1
me	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
questioning	1
and	1
thoughtful	1
look.	1
	1
"A	1
feeling	1
of	1
repulsion,	1
and	1
of	1
something	1
akin	1
to	1
fear	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
rise	1
within	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
antics	1
of	1
this	1
fleshless	1
man.	1
Even	1
my	1
dread	1
of	1
losing	1
a	1
client	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
me	1
from	1
showing	1
my	1
impatience.	1
	1
"'I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
state	1
your	1
business,	1
sir,'	1
said	1
I;	1
'my	1
time	1
is	1
of	1
value.'	1
Heaven	1
forgive	1
me	1
for	1
that	1
last	1
sentence,	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
came	1
to	1
my	1
lips.	1
	1
"'How	1
would	1
fifty	1
guineas	1
for	1
a	1
night's	1
work	1
suit	1
you?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Most	1
admirably.'	1
	1
"'I	1
say	1
a	1
night's	1
work,	1
but	1
an	1
hour's	1
would	1
be	1
nearer	1
the	1
mark.	1
I	1
simply	1
want	1
your	1
opinion	1
about	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
stamping	1
machine	1
which	1
has	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
gear.	1
If	1
you	1
show	1
us	1
what	1
is	1
wrong	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
set	1
it	1
right	1
ourselves.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
commission	1
as	1
that?'	1
	1
"'The	1
work	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
pay	1
munificent.'	1
	1
"'Precisely	1
so.	1
We	1
shall	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to-night	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
train.'	1
	1
"'Where	1
to?'	1
	1
"'To	1
Eyford,	1
in	1
Berkshire.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
place	1
near	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Oxfordshire,	1
and	1
within	1
seven	1
miles	1
of	1
Reading.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
train	1
from	1
Paddington	1
which	1
would	1
bring	1
you	1
there	1
at	1
about	1
11:15.'	1
	1
"'Very	1
good.'	1
	1
"'I	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
to	1
meet	1
you.'	1
	1
"'There	1
is	1
a	1
drive,	1
then?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
our	1
little	1
place	1
is	1
quite	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
seven	1
miles	1
from	1
Eyford	1
Station.'	1
	1
"'Then	1
we	1
can	1
hardly	1
get	1
there	1
before	1
midnight.	1
I	1
suppose	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
a	1
train	1
back.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
compelled	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
night.'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
we	1
could	1
easily	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
shake-down.'	1
	1
"'That	1
is	1
very	1
awkward.	1
Could	1
I	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
some	1
more	1
convenient	1
hour?'	1
	1
"'We	1
have	1
judged	1
it	1
best	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
come	1
late.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
recompense	1
you	1
for	1
any	1
inconvenience	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
paying	1
to	1
you,	1
a	1
young	1
and	1
unknown	1
man,	1
a	1
fee	1
which	1
would	1
buy	1
an	1
opinion	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
heads	1
of	1
your	1
profession.	1
Still,	1
of	1
course,	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
business,	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
do	1
so.'	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
fifty	1
guineas,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
very	1
useful	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
me.	1
'Not	1
at	1
all,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
to	1
accommodate	1
myself	1
to	1
your	1
wishes.	1
I	1
should	1
like,	1
however,	1
to	1
understand	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
clearly	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
do.'	1
	1
"'Quite	1
so.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
natural	1
that	1
the	1
pledge	1
of	1
secrecy	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
exacted	1
from	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
aroused	1
your	1
curiosity.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
commit	1
you	1
to	1
anything	1
without	1
your	1
having	1
it	1
all	1
laid	1
before	1
you.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
absolutely	1
safe	1
from	1
eavesdroppers?'	1
	1
"'Entirely.'	1
	1
"'Then	1
the	1
matter	1
stands	1
thus.	1
You	1
are	1
probably	1
aware	1
that	1
fuller's-earth	1
is	1
a	1
valuable	1
product,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
found	1
in	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
places	1
in	1
England?'	1
	1
"'I	1
have	1
heard	1
so.'	1
	1
"'Some	1
little	1
time	1
ago	1
I	1
bought	1
a	1
small	1
place--a	1
very	1
small	1
place--within	1
ten	1
miles	1
of	1
Reading.	1
I	1
was	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deposit	1
of	1
fuller's-earth	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
fields.	1
On	1
examining	1
it,	1
however,	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
this	1
deposit	1
was	1
a	1
comparatively	1
small	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
formed	1
a	1
link	1
between	1
two	1
very	1
much	1
larger	1
ones	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left--both	1
of	1
them,	1
however,	1
in	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
my	1
neighbours.	1
These	1
good	1
people	1
were	1
absolutely	1
ignorant	1
that	1
their	1
land	1
contained	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
valuable	1
as	1
a	1
gold-mine.	1
Naturally,	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
my	1
interest	1
to	1
buy	1
their	1
land	1
before	1
they	1
discovered	1
its	1
true	1
value,	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
capital	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
this.	1
I	1
took	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
into	1
the	1
secret,	1
however,	1
and	1
they	1
suggested	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
quietly	1
and	1
secretly	1
work	1
our	1
own	1
little	1
deposit	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
should	1
earn	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
would	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
buy	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
fields.	1
This	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
doing	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
help	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
operations	1
we	1
erected	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
press.	1
This	1
press,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
explained,	1
has	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
order,	1
and	1
we	1
wish	1
your	1
advice	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
We	1
guard	1
our	1
secret	1
very	1
jealously,	1
however,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
once	1
became	1
known	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
hydraulic	1
engineers	1
coming	1
to	1
our	1
little	1
house,	1
it	1
would	1
soon	1
rouse	1
inquiry,	1
and	1
then,	1
if	1
the	1
facts	1
came	1
out,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
good-bye	1
to	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
getting	1
these	1
fields	1
and	1
carrying	1
out	1
our	1
plans.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
you	1
promise	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Eyford	1
to-night.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
plain?'	1
	1
"'I	1
quite	1
follow	1
you,'	1
said	1
I.	1
'The	1
only	1
point	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
understand	1
was	1
what	1
use	1
you	1
could	1
make	1
of	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
press	1
in	1
excavating	1
fuller's-earth,	1
which,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
is	1
dug	1
out	1
like	1
gravel	1
from	1
a	1
pit.'	1
	1
"'Ah!'	1
said	1
he	1
carelessly,	1
'we	1
have	1
our	1
own	1
process.	1
We	1
compress	1
the	1
earth	1
into	1
bricks,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
remove	1
them	1
without	1
revealing	1
what	1
they	1
are.	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
detail.	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
you	1
fully	1
into	1
my	1
confidence	1
now,	1
Mr.	1
Hatherley,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
shown	1
you	1
how	1
I	1
trust	1
you.'	1
He	1
rose	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
'I	1
shall	1
expect	1
you,	1
then,	1
at	1
Eyford	1
at	1
11:15.'	1
	1
"'I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
be	1
there.'	1
	1
"'And	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
a	1
soul.'	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
last	1
long,	1
questioning	1
gaze,	1
and	1
then,	1
pressing	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
dank	1
grasp,	1
he	1
hurried	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Well,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
in	1
cool	1
blood	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
astonished,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
both	1
think,	1
at	1
this	1
sudden	1
commission	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
intrusted	1
to	1
me.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
of	1
course,	1
I	1
was	1
glad,	1
for	1
the	1
fee	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
tenfold	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
asked	1
had	1
I	1
set	1
a	1
price	1
upon	1
my	1
own	1
services,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
this	1
order	1
might	1
lead	1
to	1
other	1
ones.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
my	1
patron	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
his	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's-earth	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
my	1
coming	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
his	1
extreme	1
anxiety	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
tell	1
anyone	1
of	1
my	1
errand.	1
However,	1
I	1
threw	1
all	1
fears	1
to	1
the	1
winds,	1
ate	1
a	1
hearty	1
supper,	1
drove	1
to	1
Paddington,	1
and	1
started	1
off,	1
having	1
obeyed	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
the	1
injunction	1
as	1
to	1
holding	1
my	1
tongue.	1
	1
"At	1
Reading	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
change	1
not	1
only	1
my	1
carriage	1
but	1
my	1
station.	1
However,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
train	1
to	1
Eyford,	1
and	1
I	1
reached	1
the	1
little	1
dim-lit	1
station	1
after	1
eleven	1
o'clock.	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
passenger	1
who	1
got	1
out	1
there,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
upon	1
the	1
platform	1
save	1
a	1
single	1
sleepy	1
porter	1
with	1
a	1
lantern.	1
As	1
I	1
passed	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
wicket	1
gate,	1
however,	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
Without	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
grasped	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
hurried	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
carriage,	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
standing	1
open.	1
He	1
drew	1
up	1
the	1
windows	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
tapped	1
on	1
the	1
wood-work,	1
and	1
away	1
we	1
went	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
horse	1
could	1
go."	1
	1
"One	1
horse?"	1
interjected	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
only	1
one."	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
observe	1
the	1
colour?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
side-lights	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
stepping	1
into	1
the	1
carriage.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
chestnut."	1
	1
"Tired-looking	1
or	1
fresh?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
fresh	1
and	1
glossy."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
interrupted	1
you.	1
Pray	1
continue	1
your	1
most	1
interesting	1
statement."	1
	1
"Away	1
we	1
went	1
then,	1
and	1
we	1
drove	1
for	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
hour.	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
seven	1
miles,	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
from	1
the	1
rate	1
that	1
we	1
seemed	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
we	1
took,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
nearer	1
twelve.	1
He	1
sat	1
at	1
my	1
side	1
in	1
silence	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
aware,	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
when	1
I	1
glanced	1
in	1
his	1
direction,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
great	1
intensity.	1
The	1
country	1
roads	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
very	1
good	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
for	1
we	1
lurched	1
and	1
jolted	1
terribly.	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
to	1
see	1
something	1
of	1
where	1
we	1
were,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
frosted	1
glass,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
nothing	1
save	1
the	1
occasional	1
bright	1
blur	1
of	1
a	1
passing	1
light.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
hazarded	1
some	1
remark	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
the	1
journey,	1
but	1
the	1
colonel	1
answered	1
only	1
in	1
monosyllables,	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
soon	1
flagged.	1
At	1
last,	1
however,	1
the	1
bumping	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
exchanged	1
for	1
the	1
crisp	1
smoothness	1
of	1
a	1
gravel-drive,	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stand.	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
sprang	1
out,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
followed	1
after	1
him,	1
pulled	1
me	1
swiftly	1
into	1
a	1
porch	1
which	1
gaped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us.	1
We	1
stepped,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
right	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
failed	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
most	1
fleeting	1
glance	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
instant	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
threshold	1
the	1
door	1
slammed	1
heavily	1
behind	1
us,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
faintly	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
drove	1
away.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
pitch	1
dark	1
inside	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
colonel	1
fumbled	1
about	1
looking	1
for	1
matches	1
and	1
muttering	1
under	1
his	1
breath.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
door	1
opened	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
and	1
a	1
long,	1
golden	1
bar	1
of	1
light	1
shot	1
out	1
in	1
our	1
direction.	1
It	1
grew	1
broader,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
appeared	1
with	1
a	1
lamp	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
above	1
her	1
head,	1
pushing	1
her	1
face	1
forward	1
and	1
peering	1
at	1
us.	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
pretty,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
gloss	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
light	1
shone	1
upon	1
her	1
dark	1
dress	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
rich	1
material.	1
She	1
spoke	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
in	1
a	1
foreign	1
tongue	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
as	1
though	1
asking	1
a	1
question,	1
and	1
when	1
my	1
companion	1
answered	1
in	1
a	1
gruff	1
monosyllable	1
she	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
start	1
that	1
the	1
lamp	1
nearly	1
fell	1
from	1
her	1
hand.	1
Colonel	1
Stark	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
whispered	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
ear,	1
and	1
then,	1
pushing	1
her	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
whence	1
she	1
had	1
come,	1
he	1
walked	1
towards	1
me	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
lamp	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"'Perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
kindness	1
to	1
wait	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,'	1
said	1
he,	1
throwing	1
open	1
another	1
door.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
quiet,	1
little,	1
plainly	1
furnished	1
room,	1
with	1
a	1
round	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
centre,	1
on	1
which	1
several	1
German	1
books	1
were	1
scattered.	1
Colonel	1
Stark	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
lamp	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
harmonium	1
beside	1
the	1
door.	1
'I	1
shall	1
not	1
keep	1
you	1
waiting	1
an	1
instant,'	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"I	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
books	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
ignorance	1
of	1
German	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
treatises	1
on	1
science,	1
the	1
others	1
being	1
volumes	1
of	1
poetry.	1
Then	1
I	1
walked	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
hoping	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
catch	1
some	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
country-side,	1
but	1
an	1
oak	1
shutter,	1
heavily	1
barred,	1
was	1
folded	1
across	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
wonderfully	1
silent	1
house.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
clock	1
ticking	1
loudly	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
but	1
otherwise	1
everything	1
was	1
deadly	1
still.	1
A	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
uneasiness	1
began	1
to	1
steal	1
over	1
me.	1
Who	1
were	1
these	1
German	1
people,	1
and	1
what	1
were	1
they	1
doing	1
living	1
in	1
this	1
strange,	1
out-of-the-way	1
place?	1
And	1
where	1
was	1
the	1
place?	1
I	1
was	1
ten	1
miles	1
or	1
so	1
from	1
Eyford,	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
knew,	1
but	1
whether	1
north,	1
south,	1
east,	1
or	1
west	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea.	1
For	1
that	1
matter,	1
Reading,	1
and	1
possibly	1
other	1
large	1
towns,	1
were	1
within	1
that	1
radius,	1
so	1
the	1
place	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
secluded,	1
after	1
all.	1
Yet	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
certain,	1
from	1
the	1
absolute	1
stillness,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
I	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
humming	1
a	1
tune	1
under	1
my	1
breath	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
my	1
spirits	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
earning	1
my	1
fifty-guinea	1
fee.	1
	1
"Suddenly,	1
without	1
any	1
preliminary	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
utter	1
stillness,	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
my	1
room	1
swung	1
slowly	1
open.	1
The	1
woman	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
aperture,	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
behind	1
her,	1
the	1
yellow	1
light	1
from	1
my	1
lamp	1
beating	1
upon	1
her	1
eager	1
and	1
beautiful	1
face.	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sick	1
with	1
fear,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
sent	1
a	1
chill	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
heart.	1
She	1
held	1
up	1
one	1
shaking	1
finger	1
to	1
warn	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
silent,	1
and	1
she	1
shot	1
a	1
few	1
whispered	1
words	1
of	1
broken	1
English	1
at	1
me,	1
her	1
eyes	1
glancing	1
back,	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
frightened	1
horse,	1
into	1
the	1
gloom	1
behind	1
her.	1
	1
"'I	1
would	1
go,'	1
said	1
she,	1
trying	1
hard,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
speak	1
calmly;	1
'I	1
would	1
go.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
here.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
do.'	1
	1
"'But,	1
madam,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
done	1
what	1
I	1
came	1
for.	1
I	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
leave	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
machine.'	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
your	1
while	1
to	1
wait,'	1
she	1
went	1
on.	1
'You	1
can	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
door;	1
no	1
one	1
hinders.'	1
And	1
then,	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
smiled	1
and	1
shook	1
my	1
head,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
threw	1
aside	1
her	1
constraint	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
step	1
forward,	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
wrung	1
together.	1
'For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Heaven!'	1
she	1
whispered,	1
'get	1
away	1
from	1
here	1
before	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late!'	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
somewhat	1
headstrong	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
ready	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
an	1
affair	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
obstacle	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
fifty-guinea	1
fee,	1
of	1
my	1
wearisome	1
journey,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
night	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
before	1
me.	1
Was	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
nothing?	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
slink	1
away	1
without	1
having	1
carried	1
out	1
my	1
commission,	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
payment	1
which	1
was	1
my	1
due?	1
This	1
woman	1
might,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
knew,	1
be	1
a	1
monomaniac.	1
With	1
a	1
stout	1
bearing,	1
therefore,	1
though	1
her	1
manner	1
had	1
shaken	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
cared	1
to	1
confess,	1
I	1
still	1
shook	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
declared	1
my	1
intention	1
of	1
remaining	1
where	1
I	1
was.	1
She	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
renew	1
her	1
entreaties	1
when	1
a	1
door	1
slammed	1
overhead,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
several	1
footsteps	1
was	1
heard	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs.	1
She	1
listened	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
threw	1
up	1
her	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
despairing	1
gesture,	1
and	1
vanished	1
as	1
suddenly	1
and	1
as	1
noiselessly	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
come.	1
	1
"The	1
newcomers	1
were	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
thick	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
chinchilla	1
beard	1
growing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
creases	1
of	1
his	1
double	1
chin,	1
who	1
was	1
introduced	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Ferguson.	1
	1
"'This	1
is	1
my	1
secretary	1
and	1
manager,'	1
said	1
the	1
colonel.	1
'By	1
the	1
way,	1
I	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
I	1
left	1
this	1
door	1
shut	1
just	1
now.	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
felt	1
the	1
draught.'	1
	1
"'On	1
the	1
contrary,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'I	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
myself	1
because	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
close.'	1
	1
"He	1
shot	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
suspicious	1
looks	1
at	1
me.	1
'Perhaps	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
proceed	1
to	1
business,	1
then,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'Mr.	1
Ferguson	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
machine.'	1
	1
"'I	1
had	1
better	1
put	1
my	1
hat	1
on,	1
I	1
suppose.'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
no,	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house.'	1
	1
"'What,	1
you	1
dig	1
fuller's-earth	1
in	1
the	1
house?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
no.	1
This	1
is	1
only	1
where	1
we	1
compress	1
it.	1
But	1
never	1
mind	1
that.	1
All	1
we	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
machine	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
wrong	1
with	1
it.'	1
	1
"We	1
went	1
upstairs	1
together,	1
the	1
colonel	1
first	1
with	1
the	1
lamp,	1
the	1
fat	1
manager	1
and	1
I	1
behind	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
house,	1
with	1
corridors,	1
passages,	1
narrow	1
winding	1
staircases,	1
and	1
little	1
low	1
doors,	1
the	1
thresholds	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
hollowed	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
generations	1
who	1
had	1
crossed	1
them.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
carpets	1
and	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
any	1
furniture	1
above	1
the	1
ground	1
floor,	1
while	1
the	1
plaster	1
was	1
peeling	1
off	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
the	1
damp	1
was	1
breaking	1
through	1
in	1
green,	1
unhealthy	1
blotches.	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
as	1
unconcerned	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
possible,	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
forgotten	1
the	1
warnings	1
of	1
the	1
lady,	1
even	1
though	1
I	1
disregarded	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
kept	1
a	1
keen	1
eye	1
upon	1
my	1
two	1
companions.	1
Ferguson	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
morose	1
and	1
silent	1
man,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
fellow-countryman.	1
	1
"Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
stopped	1
at	1
last	1
before	1
a	1
low	1
door,	1
which	1
he	1
unlocked.	1
Within	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
square	1
room,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
could	1
hardly	1
get	1
at	1
one	1
time.	1
Ferguson	1
remained	1
outside,	1
and	1
the	1
colonel	1
ushered	1
me	1
in.	1
	1
"'We	1
are	1
now,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'actually	1
within	1
the	1
hydraulic	1
press,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
particularly	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
for	1
us	1
if	1
anyone	1
were	1
to	1
turn	1
it	1
on.	1
The	1
ceiling	1
of	1
this	1
small	1
chamber	1
is	1
really	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
descending	1
piston,	1
and	1
it	1
comes	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
many	1
tons	1
upon	1
this	1
metal	1
floor.	1
There	1
are	1
small	1
lateral	1
columns	1
of	1
water	1
outside	1
which	1
receive	1
the	1
force,	1
and	1
which	1
transmit	1
and	1
multiply	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
is	1
familiar	1
to	1
you.	1
The	1
machine	1
goes	1
readily	1
enough,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
stiffness	1
in	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
lost	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
its	1
force.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
look	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
us	1
how	1
we	1
can	1
set	1
it	1
right.'	1
	1
"I	1
took	1
the	1
lamp	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
examined	1
the	1
machine	1
very	1
thoroughly.	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
gigantic	1
one,	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
exercising	1
enormous	1
pressure.	1
When	1
I	1
passed	1
outside,	1
however,	1
and	1
pressed	1
down	1
the	1
levers	1
which	1
controlled	1
it,	1
I	1
knew	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
the	1
whishing	1
sound	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
slight	1
leakage,	1
which	1
allowed	1
a	1
regurgitation	1
of	1
water	1
through	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
cylinders.	1
An	1
examination	1
showed	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
india-rubber	1
bands	1
which	1
was	1
round	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
driving-rod	1
had	1
shrunk	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
quite	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
socket	1
along	1
which	1
it	1
worked.	1
This	1
was	1
clearly	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
I	1
pointed	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
my	1
companions,	1
who	1
followed	1
my	1
remarks	1
very	1
carefully	1
and	1
asked	1
several	1
practical	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
they	1
should	1
proceed	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
right.	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
them,	1
I	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
chamber	1
of	1
the	1
machine	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
to	1
satisfy	1
my	1
own	1
curiosity.	1
It	1
was	1
obvious	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's-earth	1
was	1
the	1
merest	1
fabrication,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
absurd	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
so	1
powerful	1
an	1
engine	1
could	1
be	1
designed	1
for	1
so	1
inadequate	1
a	1
purpose.	1
The	1
walls	1
were	1
of	1
wood,	1
but	1
the	1
floor	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
iron	1
trough,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
examine	1
it	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
crust	1
of	1
metallic	1
deposit	1
all	1
over	1
it.	1
I	1
had	1
stooped	1
and	1
was	1
scraping	1
at	1
this	1
to	1
see	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
muttered	1
exclamation	1
in	1
German	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
cadaverous	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
me.	1
	1
"'What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
there?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
felt	1
angry	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
tricked	1
by	1
so	1
elaborate	1
a	1
story	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
me.	1
'I	1
was	1
admiring	1
your	1
fuller's-earth,'	1
said	1
I;	1
'I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
advise	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
machine	1
if	1
I	1
knew	1
what	1
the	1
exact	1
purpose	1
was	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
used.'	1
	1
"The	1
instant	1
that	1
I	1
uttered	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
regretted	1
the	1
rashness	1
of	1
my	1
speech.	1
His	1
face	1
set	1
hard,	1
and	1
a	1
baleful	1
light	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
grey	1
eyes.	1
	1
"'Very	1
well,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'you	1
shall	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
machine.'	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
backward,	1
slammed	1
the	1
little	1
door,	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
lock.	1
I	1
rushed	1
towards	1
it	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
handle,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
secure,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
my	1
kicks	1
and	1
shoves.	1
'Hullo!'	1
I	1
yelled.	1
'Hullo!	1
Colonel!	1
Let	1
me	1
out!'	1
	1
"And	1
then	1
suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
sound	1
which	1
sent	1
my	1
heart	1
into	1
my	1
mouth.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
clank	1
of	1
the	1
levers	1
and	1
the	1
swish	1
of	1
the	1
leaking	1
cylinder.	1
He	1
had	1
set	1
the	1
engine	1
at	1
work.	1
The	1
lamp	1
still	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
placed	1
it	1
when	1
examining	1
the	1
trough.	1
By	1
its	1
light	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
black	1
ceiling	1
was	1
coming	1
down	1
upon	1
me,	1
slowly,	1
jerkily,	1
but,	1
as	1
none	1
knew	1
better	1
than	1
myself,	1
with	1
a	1
force	1
which	1
must	1
within	1
a	1
minute	1
grind	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
shapeless	1
pulp.	1
I	1
threw	1
myself,	1
screaming,	1
against	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
dragged	1
with	1
my	1
nails	1
at	1
the	1
lock.	1
I	1
implored	1
the	1
colonel	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
out,	1
but	1
the	1
remorseless	1
clanking	1
of	1
the	1
levers	1
drowned	1
my	1
cries.	1
The	1
ceiling	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
foot	1
or	1
two	1
above	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
hand	1
upraised	1
I	1
could	1
feel	1
its	1
hard,	1
rough	1
surface.	1
Then	1
it	1
flashed	1
through	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
my	1
death	1
would	1
depend	1
very	1
much	1
upon	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
met	1
it.	1
If	1
I	1
lay	1
on	1
my	1
face	1
the	1
weight	1
would	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
spine,	1
and	1
I	1
shuddered	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
dreadful	1
snap.	1
Easier	1
the	1
other	1
way,	1
perhaps;	1
and	1
yet,	1
had	1
I	1
the	1
nerve	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
look	1
up	1
at	1
that	1
deadly	1
black	1
shadow	1
wavering	1
down	1
upon	1
me?	1
Already	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
stand	1
erect,	1
when	1
my	1
eye	1
caught	1
something	1
which	1
brought	1
a	1
gush	1
of	1
hope	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
ceiling	1
were	1
of	1
iron,	1
the	1
walls	1
were	1
of	1
wood.	1
As	1
I	1
gave	1
a	1
last	1
hurried	1
glance	1
around,	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
thin	1
line	1
of	1
yellow	1
light	1
between	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
boards,	1
which	1
broadened	1
and	1
broadened	1
as	1
a	1
small	1
panel	1
was	1
pushed	1
backward.	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
door	1
which	1
led	1
away	1
from	1
death.	1
The	1
next	1
instant	1
I	1
threw	1
myself	1
through,	1
and	1
lay	1
half-fainting	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
The	1
panel	1
had	1
closed	1
again	1
behind	1
me,	1
but	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
afterwards	1
the	1
clang	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
slabs	1
of	1
metal,	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
narrow	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
escape.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
recalled	1
to	1
myself	1
by	1
a	1
frantic	1
plucking	1
at	1
my	1
wrist,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
stone	1
floor	1
of	1
a	1
narrow	1
corridor,	1
while	1
a	1
woman	1
bent	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
tugged	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
left	1
hand,	1
while	1
she	1
held	1
a	1
candle	1
in	1
her	1
right.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
good	1
friend	1
whose	1
warning	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
foolishly	1
rejected.	1
	1
"'Come!	1
come!'	1
she	1
cried	1
breathlessly.	1
'They	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
They	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
there.	1
Oh,	1
do	1
not	1
waste	1
the	1
so-precious	1
time,	1
but	1
come!'	1
	1
"This	1
time,	1
at	1
least,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
scorn	1
her	1
advice.	1
I	1
staggered	1
to	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
her	1
along	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
down	1
a	1
winding	1
stair.	1
The	1
latter	1
led	1
to	1
another	1
broad	1
passage,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
reached	1
it	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
running	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
of	1
two	1
voices,	1
one	1
answering	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
the	1
floor	1
on	1
which	1
	1
we	1
were	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
beneath.	1
My	1
guide	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
like	1
one	1
	1
who	1
is	1
at	1
her	1
wit's	1
end.	1
Then	1
she	1
threw	1
open	1
a	1
door	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
bedroom,	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
shining	1
brightly.	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
your	1
only	1
chance,'	1
said	1
she.	1
'It	1
is	1
high,	1
but	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
jump	1
it.'	1
	1
"As	1
she	1
spoke	1
a	1
light	1
sprang	1
into	1
view	1
at	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
lean	1
figure	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
rushing	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
lantern	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
weapon	1
like	1
a	1
butcher's	1
cleaver	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
rushed	1
across	1
the	1
bedroom,	1
flung	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
looked	1
out.	1
How	1
quiet	1
and	1
sweet	1
and	1
wholesome	1
the	1
garden	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight,	1
and	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
feet	1
down.	1
I	1
clambered	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
sill,	1
but	1
I	1
hesitated	1
to	1
jump	1
until	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
passed	1
between	1
my	1
saviour	1
and	1
the	1
ruffian	1
who	1
pursued	1
me.	1
If	1
she	1
were	1
ill-used,	1
then	1
at	1
any	1
risks	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
assistance.	1
The	1
thought	1
had	1
hardly	1
flashed	1
through	1
my	1
mind	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
pushing	1
his	1
way	1
past	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
threw	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
back.	1
	1
"'Fritz!	1
Fritz!'	1
she	1
cried	1
in	1
English,	1
'remember	1
your	1
promise	1
after	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
You	1
said	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
again.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
silent!	1
Oh,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
silent!'	1
	1
"'You	1
are	1
mad,	1
Elise!'	1
he	1
shouted,	1
struggling	1
to	1
break	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
'You	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
us.	1
He	1
has	1
seen	1
too	1
much.	1
Let	1
me	1
pass,	1
I	1
say!'	1
He	1
dashed	1
her	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
and,	1
rushing	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
cut	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
heavy	1
weapon.	1
I	1
had	1
let	1
myself	1
go,	1
and	1
was	1
hanging	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
sill,	1
when	1
his	1
blow	1
fell.	1
I	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
dull	1
pain,	1
my	1
grip	1
loosened,	1
and	1
I	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
below.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
shaken	1
but	1
not	1
hurt	1
by	1
the	1
fall;	1
so	1
I	1
picked	1
myself	1
up	1
and	1
rushed	1
off	1
among	1
the	1
bushes	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
run,	1
for	1
I	1
understood	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
out	1
of	1
danger	1
yet.	1
Suddenly,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
ran,	1
a	1
deadly	1
dizziness	1
and	1
sickness	1
came	1
over	1
me.	1
I	1
glanced	1
down	1
at	1
my	1
hand,	1
which	1
was	1
throbbing	1
painfully,	1
and	1
then,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
saw	1
that	1
my	1
thumb	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
was	1
pouring	1
from	1
my	1
wound.	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
tie	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
round	1
it,	1
but	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sudden	1
buzzing	1
in	1
my	1
ears,	1
and	1
next	1
moment	1
I	1
fell	1
in	1
a	1
dead	1
faint	1
among	1
the	1
rose-bushes.	1
	1
"How	1
long	1
I	1
remained	1
unconscious	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time,	1
for	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
sunk,	1
and	1
a	1
bright	1
morning	1
was	1
breaking	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
myself.	1
My	1
clothes	1
were	1
all	1
sodden	1
with	1
dew,	1
and	1
my	1
coat-sleeve	1
was	1
drenched	1
with	1
blood	1
from	1
my	1
wounded	1
thumb.	1
The	1
smarting	1
of	1
it	1
recalled	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
my	1
night's	1
adventure,	1
and	1
I	1
sprang	1
to	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
hardly	1
yet	1
be	1
safe	1
from	1
my	1
pursuers.	1
But	1
to	1
my	1
astonishment,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
me,	1
neither	1
house	1
nor	1
garden	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
lying	1
in	1
an	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
hedge	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
highroad,	1
and	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
down	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
building,	1
which	1
proved,	1
upon	1
my	1
approaching	1
it,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
station	1
at	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
arrived	1
upon	1
the	1
previous	1
night.	1
Were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
ugly	1
wound	1
upon	1
my	1
hand,	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
during	1
those	1
dreadful	1
hours	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
evil	1
dream.	1
	1
"Half	1
dazed,	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
station	1
and	1
asked	1
about	1
the	1
morning	1
train.	1
There	1
would	1
be	1
one	1
to	1
Reading	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
an	1
hour.	1
The	1
same	1
porter	1
was	1
on	1
duty,	1
I	1
found,	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
when	1
I	1
arrived.	1
I	1
inquired	1
of	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark.	1
The	1
name	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
him.	1
Had	1
he	1
observed	1
a	1
carriage	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
waiting	1
for	1
me?	1
No,	1
he	1
had	1
not.	1
Was	1
there	1
a	1
police-station	1
anywhere	1
near?	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
about	1
three	1
miles	1
off.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
go,	1
weak	1
and	1
ill	1
as	1
I	1
was.	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
wait	1
until	1
I	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
town	1
before	1
telling	1
my	1
story	1
to	1
the	1
police.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
past	1
six	1
when	1
I	1
arrived,	1
so	1
I	1
went	1
first	1
to	1
have	1
my	1
wound	1
dressed,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
along	1
here.	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
case	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
exactly	1
what	1
you	1
advise."	1
	1
We	1
both	1
sat	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
after	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
narrative.	1
Then	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
pulled	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
shelf	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ponderous	1
commonplace	1
books	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
cuttings.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
an	1
advertisement	1
which	1
will	1
interest	1
you,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
appeared	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
ago.	1
Listen	1
to	1
this:	1
'Lost,	1
on	1
the	1
9th	1
inst.,	1
Mr.	1
Jeremiah	1
Hayling,	1
aged	1
twenty-six,	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
engineer.	1
Left	1
his	1
lodgings	1
at	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night,	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
heard	1
of	1
since.	1
Was	1
dressed	1
in,'	1
etc.,	1
etc.	1
Ha!	1
That	1
represents	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
colonel	1
needed	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
machine	1
overhauled,	1
I	1
fancy."	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
cried	1
my	1
patient.	1
"Then	1
that	1
explains	1
what	1
the	1
girl	1
said."	1
	1
"Undoubtedly.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
colonel	1
was	1
a	1
cool	1
and	1
desperate	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
absolutely	1
determined	1
that	1
nothing	1
should	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
game,	1
like	1
those	1
out-and-out	1
pirates	1
who	1
will	1
leave	1
no	1
survivor	1
from	1
a	1
captured	1
ship.	1
Well,	1
every	1
moment	1
now	1
is	1
precious,	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
feel	1
equal	1
to	1
it	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Scotland	1
Yard	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
a	1
preliminary	1
to	1
starting	1
for	1
Eyford."	1
	1
Some	1
three	1
hours	1
or	1
so	1
afterwards	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
together,	1
bound	1
from	1
Reading	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
Berkshire	1
village.	1
There	1
were	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
the	1
hydraulic	1
engineer,	1
Inspector	1
Bradstreet,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard,	1
a	1
plain-clothes	1
man,	1
and	1
myself.	1
Bradstreet	1
had	1
spread	1
an	1
ordnance	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
county	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
was	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
compasses	1
drawing	1
a	1
circle	1
with	1
Eyford	1
for	1
its	1
centre.	1
	1
"There	1
you	1
are,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"That	1
circle	1
is	1
drawn	1
at	1
a	1
radius	1
of	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
village.	1
The	1
place	1
we	1
want	1
must	1
be	1
somewhere	1
near	1
that	1
line.	1
You	1
said	1
ten	1
miles,	1
I	1
think,	1
sir."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
an	1
hour's	1
good	1
drive."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
you	1
back	1
all	1
that	1
way	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
unconscious?"	1
	1
"They	1
must	1
have	1
done	1
so.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
confused	1
memory,	1
too,	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
lifted	1
and	1
conveyed	1
somewhere."	1
	1
"What	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"is	1
why	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
spared	1
you	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
you	1
lying	1
fainting	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
villain	1
was	1
softened	1
by	1
the	1
woman's	1
entreaties."	1
	1
"I	1
hardly	1
think	1
that	1
likely.	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
more	1
inexorable	1
face	1
in	1
my	1
life."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
clear	1
up	1
all	1
that,"	1
said	1
Bradstreet.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
drawn	1
my	1
circle,	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
I	1
knew	1
at	1
what	1
point	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
folk	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
could	1
lay	1
my	1
finger	1
on	1
it,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
quietly.	1
	1
"Really,	1
now!"	1
cried	1
the	1
inspector,	1
"you	1
have	1
formed	1
your	1
opinion!	1
Come,	1
now,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
who	1
agrees	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
south,	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
more	1
deserted	1
there."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
say	1
east,"	1
said	1
my	1
patient.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
for	1
west,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
plain-clothes	1
man.	1
"There	1
are	1
several	1
quiet	1
little	1
villages	1
up	1
there."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
am	1
for	1
north,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"because	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
hills	1
there,	1
and	1
our	1
friend	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
carriage	1
go	1
up	1
any."	1
	1
"Come,"	1
cried	1
the	1
inspector,	1
laughing;	1
"it's	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
diversity	1
of	1
opinion.	1
We	1
have	1
boxed	1
the	1
compass	1
among	1
us.	1
Who	1
do	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
casting	1
vote	1
to?"	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
all	1
wrong."	1
	1
"But	1
we	1
can't	1
all	1
be."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
you	1
can.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
point."	1
He	1
placed	1
his	1
finger	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
circle.	1
"This	1
is	1
where	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
them."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
twelve-mile	1
drive?"	1
gasped	1
Hatherley.	1
	1
"Six	1
out	1
and	1
six	1
back.	1
Nothing	1
simpler.	1
You	1
say	1
yourself	1
that	1
the	1
horse	1
was	1
fresh	1
and	1
glossy	1
when	1
you	1
got	1
in.	1
How	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
gone	1
twelve	1
miles	1
over	1
heavy	1
roads?"	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
likely	1
ruse	1
enough,"	1
observed	1
Bradstreet	1
thoughtfully.	1
"Of	1
course	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
this	1
gang."	1
	1
"None	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"They	1
are	1
coiners	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale,	1
and	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
machine	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
amalgam	1
which	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
silver."	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
known	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
that	1
a	1
clever	1
gang	1
was	1
at	1
work,"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector.	1
"They	1
have	1
been	1
turning	1
out	1
half-crowns	1
by	1
the	1
thousand.	1
We	1
even	1
traced	1
them	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Reading,	1
but	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
farther,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
covered	1
their	1
traces	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
old	1
hands.	1
But	1
now,	1
thanks	1
to	1
this	1
lucky	1
chance,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
them	1
right	1
enough."	1
	1
But	1
the	1
inspector	1
was	1
mistaken,	1
for	1
those	1
criminals	1
were	1
not	1
destined	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
justice.	1
As	1
we	1
rolled	1
into	1
Eyford	1
Station	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
gigantic	1
column	1
of	1
smoke	1
which	1
streamed	1
up	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
small	1
clump	1
of	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
and	1
hung	1
like	1
an	1
immense	1
ostrich	1
feather	1
over	1
the	1
landscape.	1
	1
"A	1
house	1
on	1
fire?"	1
asked	1
Bradstreet	1
as	1
the	1
train	1
steamed	1
off	1
again	1
on	1
its	1
way.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir!"	1
said	1
the	1
station-master.	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
it	1
break	1
out?"	1
	1
"I	1
hear	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
during	1
the	1
night,	1
sir,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
got	1
worse,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
blaze."	1
	1
"Whose	1
house	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Dr.	1
Becher's."	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,"	1
broke	1
in	1
the	1
engineer,	1
"is	1
Dr.	1
Becher	1
a	1
German,	1
very	1
thin,	1
with	1
a	1
long,	1
sharp	1
nose?"	1
	1
The	1
station-master	1
laughed	1
heartily.	1
"No,	1
sir,	1
Dr.	1
Becher	1
is	1
an	1
Englishman,	1
and	1
there	1
isn't	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
parish	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
better-lined	1
waistcoat.	1
But	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
gentleman	1
staying	1
with	1
him,	1
a	1
patient,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
and	1
he	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
little	1
good	1
Berkshire	1
beef	1
would	1
do	1
him	1
no	1
harm."	1
	1
The	1
station-master	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
his	1
speech	1
before	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
hastening	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
The	1
road	1
topped	1
a	1
low	1
hill,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
widespread	1
whitewashed	1
building	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us,	1
spouting	1
fire	1
at	1
every	1
chink	1
and	1
window,	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
in	1
front	1
three	1
fire-engines	1
were	1
vainly	1
striving	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
flames	1
under.	1
	1
"That's	1
it!"	1
cried	1
Hatherley,	1
in	1
intense	1
excitement.	1
"There	1
is	1
the	1
gravel-drive,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
rose-bushes	1
where	1
I	1
lay.	1
That	1
second	1
window	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
I	1
jumped	1
from."	1
	1
"Well,	1
at	1
least,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"you	1
have	1
had	1
your	1
revenge	1
upon	1
them.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
your	1
oil-lamp	1
which,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
crushed	1
in	1
the	1
press,	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
wooden	1
walls,	1
though	1
no	1
doubt	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
excited	1
in	1
the	1
chase	1
after	1
you	1
to	1
observe	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
Now	1
keep	1
your	1
eyes	1
open	1
in	1
this	1
crowd	1
for	1
your	1
friends	1
of	1
last	1
night,	1
though	1
I	1
very	1
much	1
fear	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
hundred	1
miles	1
off	1
by	1
now."	1
	1
And	1
Holmes'	1
fears	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
realised,	1
for	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
this	1
no	1
word	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
heard	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
woman,	1
the	1
sinister	1
German,	1
or	1
the	1
morose	1
Englishman.	1
Early	1
that	1
morning	1
a	1
peasant	1
had	1
met	1
a	1
cart	1
containing	1
several	1
people	1
and	1
some	1
very	1
bulky	1
boxes	1
driving	1
rapidly	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Reading,	1
but	1
there	1
all	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
fugitives	1
disappeared,	1
and	1
even	1
Holmes'	1
ingenuity	1
failed	1
ever	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
least	1
clue	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
whereabouts.	1
	1
The	1
firemen	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
perturbed	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
arrangements	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
within,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
by	1
discovering	1
a	1
newly	1
severed	1
human	1
thumb	1
upon	1
a	1
window-sill	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
floor.	1
About	1
sunset,	1
however,	1
their	1
efforts	1
were	1
at	1
last	1
successful,	1
and	1
they	1
subdued	1
the	1
flames,	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
the	1
roof	1
had	1
fallen	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
such	1
absolute	1
ruin	1
that,	1
save	1
some	1
twisted	1
cylinders	1
and	1
iron	1
piping,	1
not	1
a	1
trace	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
machinery	1
which	1
had	1
cost	1
our	1
unfortunate	1
acquaintance	1
so	1
dearly.	1
Large	1
masses	1
of	1
nickel	1
and	1
of	1
tin	1
were	1
discovered	1
stored	1
in	1
an	1
out-house,	1
but	1
no	1
coins	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
explained	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
those	1
bulky	1
boxes	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
referred	1
to.	1
	1
How	1
our	1
hydraulic	1
engineer	1
had	1
been	1
conveyed	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
recovered	1
his	1
senses	1
might	1
have	1
remained	1
forever	1
a	1
mystery	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
soft	1
mould,	1
which	1
told	1
us	1
a	1
very	1
plain	1
tale.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
carried	1
down	1
by	1
two	1
persons,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
remarkably	1
small	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
unusually	1
large	1
ones.	1
On	1
the	1
whole,	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
silent	1
Englishman,	1
being	1
less	1
bold	1
or	1
less	1
murderous	1
than	1
his	1
companion,	1
had	1
assisted	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
unconscious	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
danger.	1
	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
our	1
engineer	1
ruefully	1
as	1
we	1
took	1
our	1
seats	1
to	1
return	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
London,	1
"it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
pretty	1
business	1
for	1
me!	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
thumb	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
a	1
fifty-guinea	1
fee,	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
gained?"	1
	1
"Experience,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"Indirectly	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
value,	1
you	1
know;	1
you	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
words	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
excellent	1
company	1
for	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
your	1
existence."	1
	1
	1
	1
X.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
NOBLE	1
BACHELOR	1
	1
The	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
marriage,	1
and	1
its	1
curious	1
termination,	1
have	1
long	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
interest	1
in	1
those	1
exalted	1
circles	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
bridegroom	1
moves.	1
Fresh	1
scandals	1
have	1
eclipsed	1
it,	1
and	1
their	1
more	1
piquant	1
details	1
have	1
drawn	1
the	1
gossips	1
away	1
from	1
this	1
four-year-old	1
drama.	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
believe,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
full	1
facts	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
public,	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
friend	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
a	1
considerable	1
share	1
in	1
clearing	1
the	1
matter	1
up,	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
no	1
memoir	1
of	1
him	1
would	1
be	1
complete	1
without	1
some	1
little	1
sketch	1
of	1
this	1
remarkable	1
episode.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
before	1
my	1
own	1
marriage,	1
during	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
sharing	1
rooms	1
with	1
Holmes	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
home	1
from	1
an	1
afternoon	1
stroll	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
letter	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
waiting	1
for	1
him.	1
I	1
had	1
remained	1
indoors	1
all	1
day,	1
for	1
the	1
weather	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
sudden	1
turn	1
to	1
rain,	1
with	1
high	1
autumnal	1
winds,	1
and	1
the	1
Jezail	1
bullet	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
brought	1
back	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
limbs	1
as	1
a	1
relic	1
of	1
my	1
Afghan	1
campaign	1
throbbed	1
with	1
dull	1
persistence.	1
With	1
my	1
body	1
in	1
one	1
easy-chair	1
and	1
my	1
legs	1
upon	1
another,	1
I	1
had	1
surrounded	1
myself	1
with	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
newspapers	1
until	1
at	1
last,	1
saturated	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
I	1
tossed	1
them	1
all	1
aside	1
and	1
lay	1
listless,	1
watching	1
the	1
huge	1
crest	1
and	1
monogram	1
upon	1
the	1
envelope	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
wondering	1
lazily	1
who	1
my	1
friend's	1
noble	1
correspondent	1
could	1
be.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
fashionable	1
epistle,"	1
I	1
remarked	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
"Your	1
morning	1
letters,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
right,	1
were	1
from	1
a	1
fish-monger	1
and	1
a	1
tide-waiter."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
correspondence	1
has	1
certainly	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
variety,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
smiling,	1
"and	1
the	1
humbler	1
are	1
usually	1
the	1
more	1
interesting.	1
This	1
looks	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
unwelcome	1
social	1
summonses	1
which	1
call	1
upon	1
a	1
man	1
either	1
to	1
be	1
bored	1
or	1
to	1
lie."	1
	1
He	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
and	1
glanced	1
over	1
the	1
contents.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
come,	1
it	1
may	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
of	1
interest,	1
after	1
all."	1
	1
"Not	1
social,	1
then?"	1
	1
"No,	1
distinctly	1
professional."	1
	1
"And	1
from	1
a	1
noble	1
client?"	1
	1
"One	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
in	1
England."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
assure	1
you,	1
Watson,	1
without	1
affectation,	1
that	1
the	1
status	1
of	1
my	1
client	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
less	1
moment	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
case.	1
It	1
is	1
just	1
possible,	1
however,	1
that	1
that	1
also	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
wanting	1
in	1
this	1
new	1
investigation.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
reading	1
the	1
papers	1
diligently	1
of	1
late,	1
have	1
you	1
not?"	1
	1
"It	1
looks	1
like	1
it,"	1
said	1
I	1
ruefully,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
huge	1
bundle	1
in	1
the	1
corner.	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
fortunate,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
perhaps	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
post	1
me	1
up.	1
I	1
read	1
nothing	1
except	1
the	1
criminal	1
news	1
and	1
the	1
agony	1
column.	1
The	1
latter	1
is	1
always	1
instructive.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
followed	1
recent	1
events	1
so	1
closely	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
read	1
about	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
and	1
his	1
wedding?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
with	1
the	1
deepest	1
interest."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
well.	1
The	1
letter	1
which	1
I	1
hold	1
in	1
my	1
hand	1
is	1
from	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon.	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
in	1
return	1
you	1
must	1
turn	1
over	1
these	1
papers	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
whatever	1
bears	1
upon	1
the	1
matter.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
says:	1
	1
"'MY	1
DEAR	1
MR.	1
SHERLOCK	1
HOLMES:--Lord	1
Backwater	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
place	1
implicit	1
reliance	1
upon	1
your	1
judgment	1
and	1
discretion.	1
I	1
have	1
determined,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
painful	1
event	1
which	1
has	1
occurred	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
my	1
wedding.	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard,	1
is	1
acting	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
but	1
he	1
assures	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
sees	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
your	1
co-operation,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
even	1
thinks	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
assistance.	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
at	1
four	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
and,	1
should	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
other	1
engagement	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
postpone	1
it,	1
as	1
this	1
matter	1
is	1
of	1
paramount	1
importance.	1
Yours	1
faithfully,	1
ST.	1
SIMON.'	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
dated	1
from	1
Grosvenor	1
Mansions,	1
written	1
with	1
a	1
quill	1
pen,	1
and	1
the	1
noble	1
lord	1
has	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
smear	1
of	1
ink	1
upon	1
the	1
outer	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
little	1
finger,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes	1
as	1
he	1
folded	1
up	1
the	1
epistle.	1
	1
"He	1
says	1
four	1
o'clock.	1
It	1
is	1
three	1
now.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
an	1
hour."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
time,	1
with	1
your	1
assistance,	1
to	1
get	1
clear	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
Turn	1
over	1

while	1
I	1
take	1
a	1
glance	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
our	1
client	1
is."	1
He	1
picked	1
a	1
red-covered	1
volume	1
from	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
books	1
of	1
reference	1
beside	1
the	1
mantelpiece.	1
"Here	1
he	1
is,"	1
said	1
he,	1
sitting	1
down	1
and	1
flattening	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
his	1
knee.	1

He's	1
forty-one	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
which	1
is	1
mature	1
for	1
marriage.	1
Was	1
Under-Secretary	1
for	1
the	1
colonies	1
in	1
a	1
late	1
administration.	1
The	1
Duke,	1
his	1
father,	1
was	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
Secretary	1
for	1
Foreign	1
Affairs.	1
They	1
inherit	1
Plantagenet	1
blood	1
by	1
direct	1
descent,	1
and	1
Tudor	1
on	1
the	1
distaff	1
side.	1
Ha!	1
Well,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
very	1
instructive	1
in	1
all	1
this.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
turn	1
to	1
you	1
Watson,	1
for	1
something	1
more	1
solid."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
difficulty	1
in	1
finding	1
what	1
I	1
want,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"for	1
the	1
facts	1
are	1
quite	1
recent,	1
and	1
the	1
matter	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
remarkable.	1
I	1
feared	1
to	1
refer	1
them	1
to	1
you,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
an	1
inquiry	1
on	1
hand	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
disliked	1
the	1
intrusion	1
of	1
other	1
matters."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
mean	1
the	1
little	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
Grosvenor	1
Square	1
furniture	1
van.	1
That	1
is	1
quite	1
cleared	1
up	1
now--though,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
Pray	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
your	1
newspaper	1
selections."	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
notice	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
find.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
personal	1
column	1
of	1
the	1
Morning	1
Post,	1
and	1
dates,	1
as	1
you	1
see,	1
some	1
weeks	1
back:	1
'A	1
marriage	1
has	1
been	1
arranged,'	1
it	1
says,	1
'and	1
will,	1
if	1
rumour	1
is	1
correct,	1
very	1
shortly	1
take	1
place,	1
between	1
Lord	1
Robert	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
second	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Balmoral,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Hatty	1
Doran,	1
the	1
only	1
daughter	1
of	1
Aloysius	1
Doran.	1
Esq.,	1
of	1
San	1
Francisco,	1
Cal.,	1
U.S.A.'	1
That	1
is	1
all."	1
	1
"Terse	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
point,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes,	1
stretching	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
legs	1
towards	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
a	1
paragraph	1
amplifying	1
this	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
papers	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
week.	1
Ah,	1
here	1
it	1
is:	1
'There	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
a	1
call	1
for	1
protection	1
in	1
the	1
marriage	1
market,	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
free-trade	1
principle	1
appears	1
to	1
tell	1
heavily	1
against	1
our	1
home	1
product.	1
One	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
noble	1
houses	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
is	1
passing	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
fair	1
cousins	1
from	1
across	1
the	1
Atlantic.	1
An	1
important	1
addition	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
week	1
to	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
prizes	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
these	1
charming	1
invaders.	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
who	1
has	1
shown	1
himself	1
for	1
over	1
twenty	1
years	1
proof	1
against	1
the	1
little	1
god's	1
arrows,	1
has	1
now	1
definitely	1
announced	1
his	1
approaching	1
marriage	1
with	1
Miss	1
Hatty	1
Doran,	1
the	1
fascinating	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
California	1
millionaire.	1
Miss	1
Doran,	1
whose	1
graceful	1
figure	1
and	1
striking	1
face	1
attracted	1
much	1
attention	1
at	1
the	1
Westbury	1
House	1
festivities,	1
is	1
an	1
only	1
child,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
currently	1
reported	1
that	1
her	1
dowry	1
will	1
run	1
to	1
considerably	1
over	1
the	1
six	1
figures,	1
with	1
expectancies	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
open	1
secret	1
that	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Balmoral	1
has	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
sell	1
his	1
pictures	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
years,	1
and	1
as	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
has	1
no	1
property	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
save	1
the	1
small	1
estate	1
of	1
Birchmoor,	1
it	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
the	1
Californian	1
heiress	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
gainer	1
by	1
an	1
alliance	1
which	1
will	1
enable	1
her	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
easy	1
and	1
common	1
transition	1
from	1
a	1
Republican	1
lady	1
to	1
a	1
British	1
peeress.'"	1
	1
"Anything	1
else?"	1
asked	1
Holmes,	1
yawning.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes;	1
plenty.	1
Then	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
note	1
in	1
the	1
Morning	1
Post	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
marriage	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
absolutely	1
quiet	1
one,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
St.	1
George's,	1
Hanover	1
Square,	1
that	1
only	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
intimate	1
friends	1
would	1
be	1
invited,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
party	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
furnished	1
house	1
at	1
Lancaster	1
Gate	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Aloysius	1
Doran.	1
Two	1
days	1
later--that	1
is,	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
last--there	1
is	1
a	1
curt	1
announcement	1
that	1
the	1
wedding	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
honeymoon	1
would	1
be	1
passed	1
at	1
Lord	1
Backwater's	1
place,	1
near	1
Petersfield.	1
Those	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
notices	1
which	1
appeared	1
before	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
the	1
bride."	1
	1
"Before	1
the	1
what?"	1
asked	1
Holmes	1
with	1
a	1
start.	1
	1
"The	1
vanishing	1
of	1
the	1
lady."	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
she	1
vanish,	1
then?"	1
	1
"At	1
the	1
wedding	1
breakfast."	1
	1
"Indeed.	1
This	1
is	1
more	1
interesting	1
than	1
it	1
promised	1
to	1
be;	1
quite	1
dramatic,	1
in	1
fact."	1
	1
"Yes;	1
it	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common."	1
	1
"They	1
often	1
vanish	1
before	1
the	1
ceremony,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
during	1
the	1
honeymoon;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
anything	1
quite	1
so	1
prompt	1
as	1
this.	1
Pray	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
the	1
details."	1
	1
"I	1
warn	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
incomplete."	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
make	1
them	1
less	1
so."	1
	1
"Such	1
as	1
they	1
are,	1
they	1
are	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
article	1
of	1
a	1
morning	1
paper	1
of	1
yesterday,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
to	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
headed,	1
'Singular	1
Occurrence	1
at	1
a	1
Fashionable	1
Wedding':	1
	1
"'The	1
family	1
of	1
Lord	1
Robert	1
St.	1
Simon	1
has	1
been	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
greatest	1
consternation	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
and	1
painful	1
episodes	1
which	1
have	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
his	1
wedding.	1
The	1
ceremony,	1
as	1
shortly	1
announced	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
of	1
yesterday,	1
occurred	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
morning;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
strange	1
rumours	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
persistently	1
floating	1
about.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
attempts	1
of	1
the	1
friends	1
to	1
hush	1
the	1
matter	1
up,	1
so	1
much	1
public	1
attention	1
has	1
now	1
been	1
drawn	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
no	1
good	1
purpose	1
can	1
be	1
served	1
by	1
affecting	1
to	1
disregard	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
subject	1
for	1
conversation.	1
	1
"'The	1
ceremony,	1
which	1
was	1
performed	1
at	1
St.	1
George's,	1
Hanover	1
Square,	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
quiet	1
one,	1
no	1
one	1
being	1
present	1
save	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
bride,	1
Mr.	1
Aloysius	1
Doran,	1
the	1
Duchess	1
of	1
Balmoral,	1
Lord	1
Backwater,	1
Lord	1
Eustace	1
and	1
Lady	1
Clara	1
St.	1
Simon	1
(the	1
younger	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom),	1
and	1
Lady	1
Alicia	1
Whittington.	1
The	1
whole	1
party	1
proceeded	1
afterwards	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Aloysius	1
Doran,	1
at	1
Lancaster	1
Gate,	1
where	1
breakfast	1
had	1
been	1
prepared.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
some	1
little	1
trouble	1
was	1
caused	1
by	1
a	1
woman,	1
whose	1
name	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
ascertained,	1
who	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
after	1
the	1
bridal	1
party,	1
alleging	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
claim	1
upon	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
after	1
a	1
painful	1
and	1
prolonged	1
scene	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
ejected	1
by	1
the	1
butler	1
and	1
the	1
footman.	1
The	1
bride,	1
who	1
had	1
fortunately	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
before	1
this	1
unpleasant	1
interruption,	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
breakfast	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
when	1
she	1
complained	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
indisposition	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
her	1
room.	1
Her	1
prolonged	1
absence	1
having	1
caused	1
some	1
comment,	1
her	1
father	1
followed	1
her,	1
but	1
learned	1
from	1
her	1
maid	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
chamber	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
caught	1
up	1
an	1
ulster	1
and	1
bonnet,	1
and	1
hurried	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
passage.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
footmen	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
lady	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
thus	1
apparelled,	1
but	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
credit	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
mistress,	1
believing	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
company.	1
On	1
ascertaining	1
that	1
his	1
daughter	1
had	1
disappeared,	1
Mr.	1
Aloysius	1
Doran,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
instantly	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
police,	1
and	1
very	1
energetic	1
inquiries	1
are	1
being	1
made,	1
which	1
will	1
probably	1
result	1
in	1
a	1
speedy	1
clearing	1
up	1
of	1
this	1
very	1
singular	1
business.	1
Up	1
to	1
a	1
late	1
hour	1
last	1
night,	1
however,	1
nothing	1
had	1
transpired	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
whereabouts	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
lady.	1
There	1
are	1
rumours	1
of	1
foul	1
play	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
police	1
have	1
caused	1
the	1
arrest	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
original	1
disturbance,	1
in	1
the	1
belief	1
that,	1
from	1
jealousy	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
motive,	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
strange	1
disappearance	1
of	1
the	1
bride.'"	1
	1
"And	1
is	1
that	1
all?"	1
	1
"Only	1
one	1
little	1
item	1
in	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
papers,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
suggestive	1
one."	1
	1
"And	1
it	1
is--"	1
	1
"That	1
Miss	1
Flora	1
Millar,	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
disturbance,	1
has	1
actually	1
been	1
arrested.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
formerly	1
a	1
danseuse	1
at	1
the	1
Allegro,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
known	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
for	1
some	1
years.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
further	1
particulars,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
case	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
now--so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
press."	1
	1
"And	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
interesting	1
case	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
be.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
missed	1
it	1
for	1
worlds.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
ring	1
at	1
the	1
bell,	1
Watson,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
clock	1
makes	1
it	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
four,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
noble	1
client.	1
Do	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
going,	1
Watson,	1
for	1
I	1
very	1
much	1
prefer	1
having	1
a	1
witness,	1
if	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
check	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
memory."	1
	1
"Lord	1
Robert	1
St.	1
Simon,"	1
announced	1
our	1
page-boy,	1
throwing	1
open	1
the	1
door.	1
A	1
gentleman	1
entered,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant,	1
cultured	1
face,	1
high-nosed	1
and	1
pale,	1
with	1
something	1
perhaps	1
of	1
petulance	1
about	1
the	1
mouth,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
steady,	1
well-opened	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
pleasant	1
lot	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
to	1
command	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
obeyed.	1
His	1
manner	1
was	1
brisk,	1
and	1
yet	1
his	1
general	1
appearance	1
gave	1
an	1
undue	1
impression	1
of	1
age,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
slight	1
forward	1
stoop	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
bend	1
of	1
the	1
knees	1
as	1
he	1
walked.	1
His	1
hair,	1
too,	1
as	1
he	1
swept	1
off	1
his	1
very	1
curly-brimmed	1
hat,	1
was	1
grizzled	1
round	1
the	1
edges	1
and	1
thin	1
upon	1
the	1
top.	1
As	1
to	1
his	1
dress,	1
it	1
was	1
careful	1
to	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
foppishness,	1
with	1
high	1
collar,	1
black	1
frock-coat,	1
white	1
waistcoat,	1
yellow	1
gloves,	1
patent-leather	1
shoes,	1
and	1
light-coloured	1
gaiters.	1
He	1
advanced	1
slowly	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
left	1
to	1
right,	1
and	1
swinging	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
the	1
cord	1
which	1
held	1
his	1
golden	1
eyeglasses.	1
	1
"Good-day,	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
rising	1
and	1
bowing.	1
"Pray	1
take	1
the	1
basket-chair.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
colleague,	1
Dr.	1
Watson.	1
Draw	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
talk	1
this	1
matter	1
over."	1
	1
"A	1
most	1
painful	1
matter	1
to	1
me,	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
most	1
readily	1
imagine,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
quick.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
managed	1
several	1
delicate	1
cases	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
sir,	1
though	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
hardly	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
class	1
of	1
society."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
descending."	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
pardon."	1
	1
"My	1
last	1
client	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
was	1
a	1
king."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
really!	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea.	1
And	1
which	1
king?"	1
	1
"The	1
King	1
of	1
Scandinavia."	1
	1
"What!	1
Had	1
he	1
lost	1
his	1
wife?"	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
suavely,	1
"that	1
I	1
extend	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
my	1
other	1
clients	1
the	1
same	1
secrecy	1
which	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
yours."	1
	1
"Of	1
course!	1
Very	1
right!	1
very	1
right!	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
beg	1
pardon.	1
As	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
case,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
any	1
information	1
which	1
may	1
assist	1
you	1
in	1
forming	1
an	1
opinion."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
learned	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
prints,	1
nothing	1
more.	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
correct--this	1
article,	1
for	1
example,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
the	1
bride."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
glanced	1
over	1
it.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
correct,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
goes."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
needs	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
supplementing	1
before	1
anyone	1
could	1
offer	1
an	1
opinion.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
arrive	1
at	1
my	1
facts	1
most	1
directly	1
by	1
questioning	1
you."	1
	1
"Pray	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
you	1
first	1
meet	1
Miss	1
Hatty	1
Doran?"	1
	1
"In	1
San	1
Francisco,	1
a	1
year	1
ago."	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
travelling	1
in	1
the	1
States?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
become	1
engaged	1
then?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
friendly	1
footing?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
amused	1
by	1
her	1
society,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
amused."	1
	1
"Her	1
father	1
is	1
very	1
rich?"	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
richest	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
Pacific	1
slope."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
he	1
make	1
his	1
money?"	1
	1
"In	1
mining.	1
He	1
had	1
nothing	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
ago.	1
Then	1
he	1
struck	1
gold,	1
invested	1
it,	1
and	1
came	1
up	1
by	1
leaps	1
and	1
bounds."	1
	1
"Now,	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
impression	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady's--your	1
wife's	1
character?"	1
	1
The	1
nobleman	1
swung	1
his	1
glasses	1
a	1
little	1
faster	1
and	1
stared	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
"You	1
see,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"my	1
wife	1
was	1
twenty	1
before	1
her	1
father	1
became	1
a	1
rich	1
man.	1
During	1
that	1
time	1
she	1
ran	1
free	1
in	1
a	1
mining	1
camp	1
and	1
wandered	1
through	1
woods	1
or	1
mountains,	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
education	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
Nature	1
rather	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
schoolmaster.	1
She	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
in	1
England	1
a	1
tomboy,	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
nature,	1
wild	1
and	1
free,	1
unfettered	1
by	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
traditions.	1
She	1
is	1
impetuous--volcanic,	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say.	1
She	1
is	1
swift	1
in	1
making	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
and	1
fearless	1
in	1
carrying	1
out	1
her	1
resolutions.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
the	1
name	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
bear"--he	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
stately	1
cough--"had	1
not	1
I	1
thought	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
bottom	1
a	1
noble	1
woman.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
heroic	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
that	1
anything	1
dishonourable	1
would	1
be	1
repugnant	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
her	1
photograph?"	1
	1
"I	1
brought	1
this	1
with	1
me."	1
He	1
opened	1
a	1
locket	1
and	1
showed	1
us	1
the	1
full	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
lovely	1
woman.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
photograph	1
but	1
an	1
ivory	1
miniature,	1
and	1
the	1
artist	1
had	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
full	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
lustrous	1
black	1
hair,	1
the	1
large	1
dark	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
exquisite	1
mouth.	1
Holmes	1
gazed	1
long	1
and	1
earnestly	1
at	1
it.	1
Then	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
locket	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon.	1
	1
"The	1
young	1
lady	1
came	1
to	1
London,	1
then,	1
and	1
you	1
renewed	1
your	1
acquaintance?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
her	1
father	1
brought	1
her	1
over	1
for	1
this	1
last	1
London	1
season.	1
I	1
met	1
her	1
several	1
times,	1
became	1
engaged	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
have	1
now	1
married	1
her."	1
	1
"She	1
brought,	1
I	1
understand,	1
a	1
considerable	1
dowry?"	1
	1
"A	1
fair	1
dowry.	1
Not	1
more	1
than	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
my	1
family."	1
	1
"And	1
this,	1
of	1
course,	1
remains	1
to	1
you,	1
since	1
the	1
marriage	1
is	1
a	1
fait	1
accompli?"	1
	1
"I	1
really	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
inquiries	1
on	1
the	1
subject."	1
	1
"Very	1
naturally	1
not.	1
Did	1
you	1
see	1
Miss	1
Doran	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
wedding?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Was	1
she	1
in	1
good	1
spirits?"	1
	1
"Never	1
better.	1
She	1
kept	1
talking	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
do	1
in	1
our	1
future	1
lives."	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
That	1
is	1
very	1
interesting.	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
wedding?"	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
as	1
bright	1
as	1
possible--at	1
least	1
until	1
after	1
the	1
ceremony."	1
	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
observe	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
saw	1
then	1
the	1
first	1
signs	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
that	1
her	1
temper	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
sharp.	1
The	1
incident	1
however,	1
was	1
too	1
trivial	1
to	1
relate	1
and	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
possible	1
bearing	1
upon	1
the	1
case."	1
	1
"Pray	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
it,	1
for	1
all	1
that."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
childish.	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
bouquet	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
vestry.	1
She	1
was	1
passing	1
the	1
front	1
pew	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
pew.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
moment's	1
delay,	1
but	1
the	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
pew	1
handed	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
again,	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
the	1
fall.	1
Yet	1
when	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
she	1
answered	1
me	1
abruptly;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
home,	1
she	1
seemed	1
absurdly	1
agitated	1
over	1
this	1
trifling	1
cause."	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
pew.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
public	1
were	1
present,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
exclude	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
church	1
is	1
open."	1
	1
"This	1
gentleman	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
wife's	1
friends?"	1
	1
"No,	1
no;	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
a	1
gentleman	1
by	1
courtesy,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
common-looking	1
person.	1
I	1
hardly	1
noticed	1
his	1
appearance.	1
But	1
really	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
wandering	1
rather	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
point."	1
	1
"Lady	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
then,	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
wedding	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
cheerful	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
it.	1
What	1
did	1
she	1
do	1
on	1
re-entering	1
her	1
father's	1
house?"	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
maid."	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
her	1
maid?"	1
	1
"Alice	1
is	1
her	1
name.	1
She	1
is	1
an	1
American	1
and	1
came	1
from	1
California	1
with	1
her."	1
	1
"A	1
confidential	1
servant?"	1
	1
"A	1
little	1
too	1
much	1
so.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
her	1
mistress	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
take	1
great	1
liberties.	1
Still,	1
of	1
course,	1
in	1
America	1
they	1
look	1
upon	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
way."	1
	1
"How	1
long	1
did	1
she	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
Alice?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
a	1
few	1
minutes.	1
I	1
had	1
something	1
else	1
to	1
think	1
of."	1
	1
"You	1
did	1
not	1
overhear	1
what	1
they	1
said?"	1
	1
"Lady	1
St.	1
Simon	1
said	1
something	1
about	1
'jumping	1
a	1
claim.'	1
She	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
use	1
slang	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
what	1
she	1
meant."	1
	1
"American	1
slang	1
is	1
very	1
expressive	1
sometimes.	1
And	1
what	1
did	1
your	1
wife	1
do	1
when	1
she	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
maid?"	1
	1
"She	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast-room."	1
	1
"On	1
your	1
arm?"	1
	1
"No,	1
alone.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
independent	1
in	1
little	1
matters	1
like	1
that.	1
Then,	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
for	1
ten	1
minutes	1
or	1
so,	1
she	1
rose	1
hurriedly,	1
muttered	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
apology,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
never	1
came	1
back."	1
	1
"But	1
this	1
maid,	1
Alice,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
deposes	1
that	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room,	1
covered	1
her	1
bride's	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
ulster,	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
bonnet,	1
and	1
went	1
out."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
afterwards	1
seen	1
walking	1
into	1
Hyde	1
Park	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
Flora	1
Millar,	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
custody,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
a	1
disturbance	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Doran's	1
house	1
that	1
morning."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
a	1
few	1
particulars	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
young	1
lady,	1
and	1
your	1
relations	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
eyebrows.	1
"We	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
a	1
friendly	1
footing	1
for	1
some	1
years--I	1
may	1
say	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
friendly	1
footing.	1
She	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
Allegro.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
treated	1
her	1
ungenerously,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
just	1
cause	1
of	1
complaint	1
against	1
me,	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
women	1
are,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
Flora	1
was	1
a	1
dear	1
little	1
thing,	1
but	1
exceedingly	1
hot-headed	1
and	1
devotedly	1
attached	1
to	1
me.	1
She	1
wrote	1
me	1
dreadful	1
letters	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
married,	1
and,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
marriage	1
celebrated	1
so	1
quietly	1
was	1
that	1
I	1
feared	1
lest	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
scandal	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
She	1
came	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Doran's	1
door	1
just	1
after	1
we	1
returned,	1
and	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
push	1
her	1
way	1
in,	1
uttering	1
very	1
abusive	1
expressions	1
towards	1
my	1
wife,	1
and	1
even	1
threatening	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
foreseen	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
two	1
police	1
fellows	1
there	1
in	1
private	1
clothes,	1
who	1
soon	1
pushed	1
her	1
out	1
again.	1
She	1
was	1
quiet	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
row."	1
	1
"Did	1
your	1
wife	1
hear	1
all	1
this?"	1
	1
"No,	1
thank	1
goodness,	1
she	1
did	1
not."	1
	1
"And	1
she	1
was	1
seen	1
walking	1
with	1
this	1
very	1
woman	1
afterwards?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard,	1
looks	1
upon	1
as	1
so	1
serious.	1
It	1
is	1
thought	1
that	1
Flora	1
decoyed	1
my	1
wife	1
out	1
and	1
laid	1
some	1
terrible	1
trap	1
for	1
her."	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
possible	1
supposition."	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
so,	1
too?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
probable	1
one.	1
But	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
yourself	1
look	1
upon	1
this	1
as	1
likely?"	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
Flora	1
would	1
hurt	1
a	1
fly."	1
	1
"Still,	1
jealousy	1
is	1
a	1
strange	1
transformer	1
of	1
characters.	1
Pray	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
theory	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
took	1
place?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
seek	1
a	1
theory,	1
not	1
to	1
propound	1
one.	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
facts.	1
Since	1
you	1
ask	1
me,	1
however,	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
this	1
affair,	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
so	1
immense	1
a	1
social	1
stride,	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
causing	1
some	1
little	1
nervous	1
disturbance	1
in	1
my	1
wife."	1
	1
"In	1
short,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
suddenly	1
deranged?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
when	1
I	1
consider	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
turned	1
her	1
back--I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
upon	1
me,	1
but	1
upon	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
many	1
have	1
aspired	1
to	1
without	1
success--I	1
can	1
hardly	1
explain	1
it	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
fashion."	1
	1
"Well,	1
certainly	1
that	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
conceivable	1
hypothesis,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
smiling.	1
"And	1
now,	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
nearly	1
all	1
my	1
data.	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
whether	1
you	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
the	1
breakfast-table	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window?"	1
	1
"We	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
the	1
Park."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
Then	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
need	1
to	1
detain	1
you	1
longer.	1
I	1
shall	1
communicate	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
"Should	1
you	1
be	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
solve	1
this	1
problem,"	1
said	1
our	1
client,	1
rising.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
solved	1
it."	1
	1
"Eh?	1
What	1
was	1
that?"	1
	1
"I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
solved	1
it."	1
	1
"Where,	1
then,	1
is	1
my	1
wife?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
detail	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
speedily	1
supply."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
take	1
wiser	1
heads	1
than	1
yours	1
or	1
mine,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
and	1
bowing	1
in	1
a	1
stately,	1
old-fashioned	1
manner	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
to	1
honour	1
my	1
head	1
by	1
putting	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
his	1
own,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
whisky	1
and	1
soda	1
and	1
a	1
cigar	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
cross-questioning.	1
I	1
had	1
formed	1
my	1
conclusions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
our	1
client	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Holmes!"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
notes	1
of	1
several	1
similar	1
cases,	1
though	1
none,	1
as	1
I	1
remarked	1
before,	1
which	1
were	1
quite	1
as	1
prompt.	1
My	1
whole	1
examination	1
served	1
to	1
turn	1
my	1
conjecture	1
into	1
a	1
certainty.	1
Circumstantial	1
evidence	1
is	1
occasionally	1
very	1
convincing,	1
as	1
when	1
you	1
find	1
a	1
trout	1
in	1
the	1
milk,	1
to	1
quote	1
Thoreau's	1
example."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
heard."	1
	1
"Without,	1
however,	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
pre-existing	1
cases	1
which	1
serves	1
me	1
so	1
well.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
parallel	1
instance	1
in	1
Aberdeen	1
some	1
years	1
back,	1
and	1
something	1
on	1
very	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
lines	1
at	1
Munich	1
the	1
year	1
after	1
the	1
Franco-Prussian	1
War.	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
cases--but,	1
hullo,	1
here	1
is	1
Lestrade!	1
Good-afternoon,	1
Lestrade!	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
an	1
extra	1
tumbler	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
cigars	1
in	1
the	1
box."	1
	1
The	1
official	1
detective	1
was	1
attired	1
in	1
a	1
pea-jacket	1
and	1
cravat,	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
decidedly	1
nautical	1
appearance,	1
and	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
black	1
canvas	1
bag	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
With	1
a	1
short	1
greeting	1
he	1
seated	1
himself	1
and	1
lit	1
the	1
cigar	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
offered	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"What's	1
up,	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Holmes	1
with	1
a	1
twinkle	1
in	1
his	1
eye.	1
"You	1
look	1
dissatisfied."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
feel	1
dissatisfied.	1
It	1
is	1
this	1
infernal	1
St.	1
Simon	1
marriage	1
case.	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
neither	1
head	1
nor	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
business."	1
	1
"Really!	1
You	1
surprise	1
me."	1
	1
"Who	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
mixed	1
affair?	1
Every	1
clue	1
seems	1
to	1
slip	1
through	1
my	1
fingers.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
work	1
upon	1
it	1
all	1
day."	1
	1
"And	1
very	1
wet	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
laying	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
pea-jacket.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
dragging	1
the	1
Serpentine."	1
	1
"In	1
heaven's	1
name,	1
what	1
for?"	1
	1
"In	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Lady	1
St.	1
Simon."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
laughed	1
heartily.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
dragged	1
the	1
basin	1
of	1
Trafalgar	1
Square	1
fountain?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Why?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
	1
"Because	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
finding	1
this	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
other."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
shot	1
an	1
angry	1
glance	1
at	1
my	1
companion.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it,"	1
he	1
snarled.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
just	1
heard	1
the	1
facts,	1
but	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
made	1
up."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
indeed!	1
Then	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
Serpentine	1
plays	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
very	1
unlikely."	1
	1
"Then	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
kindly	1
explain	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
found	1
this	1
in	1
it?"	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
bag	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
and	1
tumbled	1
onto	1
the	1
floor	1
a	1
wedding-dress	1
of	1
watered	1
silk,	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
white	1
satin	1
shoes	1
and	1
a	1
bride's	1
wreath	1
and	1
veil,	1
all	1
discoloured	1
and	1
soaked	1
in	1
water.	1
"There,"	1
said	1
he,	1
putting	1
a	1
new	1
wedding-ring	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
pile.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
nut	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
crack,	1
Master	1
Holmes."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
my	1
friend,	1
blowing	1
blue	1
rings	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
"You	1
dragged	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Serpentine?"	1
	1
"No.	1
They	1
were	1
found	1
floating	1
near	1
the	1
margin	1
by	1
a	1
park-keeper.	1
They	1
have	1
been	1
identified	1
as	1
her	1
clothes,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
clothes	1
were	1
there	1
the	1
body	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
far	1
off."	1
	1
"By	1
the	1
same	1
brilliant	1
reasoning,	1
every	1
man's	1
body	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
his	1
wardrobe.	1
And	1
pray	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
hope	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
through	1
this?"	1
	1
"At	1
some	1
evidence	1
implicating	1
Flora	1
Millar	1
in	1
the	1
disappearance."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
difficult."	1
	1
"Are	1
you,	1
indeed,	1
now?"	1
cried	1
Lestrade	1
with	1
some	1
bitterness.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
practical	1
with	1
your	1
deductions	1
and	1
your	1
inferences.	1
You	1
have	1
made	1
two	1
blunders	1
in	1
as	1
many	1
minutes.	1
This	1
dress	1
does	1
implicate	1
Miss	1
Flora	1
Millar."	1
	1
"And	1
how?"	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
dress	1
is	1
a	1
pocket.	1
In	1
the	1
pocket	1
is	1
a	1
card-case.	1
In	1
the	1
card-case	1
is	1
a	1
note.	1
And	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
note."	1
He	1
slapped	1
it	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
"Listen	1
to	1
this:	1
'You	1
will	1
see	1
me	1
when	1
all	1
is	1
ready.	1
Come	1
at	1
once.	1
F.H.M.'	1
Now	1
my	1
theory	1
all	1
along	1
has	1
been	1
that	1
Lady	1
St.	1
Simon	1
was	1
decoyed	1
away	1
by	1
Flora	1
Millar,	1
and	1
that	1
she,	1
with	1
confederates,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
was	1
responsible	1
for	1
her	1
disappearance.	1
Here,	1
signed	1
with	1
her	1
initials,	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
note	1
which	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
quietly	1
slipped	1
into	1
her	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
which	1
lured	1
her	1
within	1
their	1
reach."	1
	1
"Very	1
good,	1
Lestrade,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"You	1
really	1
are	1
very	1
fine	1
indeed.	1
Let	1
me	1
see	1
it."	1
He	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
paper	1
in	1
a	1
listless	1
way,	1
but	1
his	1
attention	1
instantly	1
became	1
riveted,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
cry	1
of	1
satisfaction.	1
"This	1
is	1
indeed	1
important,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Ha!	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
so?"	1
	1
"Extremely	1
so.	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
warmly."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
triumph	1
and	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
look.	1
"Why,"	1
he	1
shrieked,	1
"you're	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
wrong	1
side!"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
right	1
side."	1
	1
"The	1
right	1
side?	1
You're	1
mad!	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
note	1
written	1
in	1
pencil	1
over	1
here."	1
	1
"And	1
over	1
here	1
is	1
what	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
fragment	1
of	1
a	1
hotel	1
bill,	1
which	1
interests	1
me	1
deeply."	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
in	1
it.	1
I	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
before,"	1
said	1
Lestrade.	1
"'Oct.	1
4th,	1
rooms	1
8s.,	1
breakfast	1
2s.	1
6d.,	1
cocktail	1
1s.,	1
lunch	1
2s.	1
6d.,	1
glass	1
sherry,	1
8d.'	1
I	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
that."	1
	1
"Very	1
likely	1
not.	1
It	1
is	1
most	1
important,	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
note,	1
it	1
is	1
important	1
also,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
initials	1
are,	1
so	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
again."	1
	1
"I've	1
wasted	1
time	1
enough,"	1
said	1
Lestrade,	1
rising.	1
"I	1
believe	1
in	1
hard	1
work	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
spinning	1
fine	1
theories.	1
Good-day,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
which	1
gets	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
first."	1
He	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
garments,	1
thrust	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
bag,	1
and	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Just	1
one	1
hint	1
to	1
you,	1
Lestrade,"	1
drawled	1
Holmes	1
before	1
his	1
rival	1
vanished;	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
true	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
Lady	1
St.	1
Simon	1
is	1
a	1
myth.	1
There	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
there	1
never	1
has	1
been,	1
any	1
such	1
person."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
looked	1
sadly	1
at	1
my	1
companion.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me,	1
tapped	1
his	1
forehead	1
three	1
times,	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
solemnly,	1
and	1
hurried	1
away.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him	1
when	1
Holmes	1
rose	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
overcoat.	1
"There	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
fellow	1
says	1
about	1
outdoor	1
work,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"so	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
papers	1
for	1
a	1
little."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
after	1
five	1
o'clock	1
when	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
left	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
lonely,	1
for	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
there	1
arrived	1
a	1
confectioner's	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
flat	1
box.	1
This	1
he	1
unpacked	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
a	1
youth	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
presently,	1
to	1
my	1
very	1
great	1
astonishment,	1
a	1
quite	1
epicurean	1
little	1
cold	1
supper	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
out	1
upon	1
our	1
humble	1
lodging-house	1
mahogany.	1
There	1
were	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
brace	1
of	1
cold	1
woodcock,	1
a	1
pheasant,	1
a	1
pâté	1
de	1
foie	1
gras	1
pie	1
with	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
ancient	1
and	1
cobwebby	1
bottles.	1
Having	1
laid	1
out	1
all	1
these	1
luxuries,	1
my	1
two	1
visitors	1
vanished	1
away,	1
like	1
the	1
genii	1
of	1
the	1
Arabian	1
Nights,	1
with	1
no	1
explanation	1
save	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
for	1
and	1
were	1
ordered	1
to	1
this	1
address.	1
	1
Just	1
before	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
stepped	1
briskly	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
His	1
features	1
were	1
gravely	1
set,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
eye	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
disappointed	1
in	1
his	1
conclusions.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
supper,	1
then,"	1
he	1
said,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
"You	1
seem	1
to	1
expect	1
company.	1
They	1
have	1
laid	1
for	1
five."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
fancy	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
some	1
company	1
dropping	1
in,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
am	1
surprised	1
that	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
has	1
not	1
already	1
arrived.	1
Ha!	1
I	1
fancy	1
that	1
I	1
hear	1
his	1
step	1
now	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
our	1
visitor	1
of	1
the	1
afternoon	1
who	1
came	1
bustling	1
in,	1
dangling	1
his	1
glasses	1
more	1
vigorously	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
perturbed	1
expression	1
upon	1
his	1
aristocratic	1
features.	1
	1
"My	1
messenger	1
reached	1
you,	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
the	1
contents	1
startled	1
me	1
beyond	1
measure.	1
Have	1
you	1
good	1
authority	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
say?"	1
	1
"The	1
best	1
possible."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
passed	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"What	1
will	1
the	1
Duke	1
say,"	1
he	1
murmured,	1
"when	1
he	1
hears	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
has	1
been	1
subjected	1
to	1
such	1
humiliation?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
purest	1
accident.	1
I	1
cannot	1
allow	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
humiliation."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you	1
look	1
on	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
another	1
standpoint."	1
	1
"I	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
anyone	1
is	1
to	1
blame.	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
lady	1
could	1
have	1
acted	1
otherwise,	1
though	1
her	1
abrupt	1
method	1
of	1
doing	1
it	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
to	1
be	1
regretted.	1
Having	1
no	1
mother,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
advise	1
her	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
crisis."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
slight,	1
sir,	1
a	1
public	1
slight,"	1
said	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
tapping	1
his	1
fingers	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
make	1
allowance	1
for	1
this	1
poor	1
girl,	1
placed	1
in	1
so	1
unprecedented	1
a	1
position."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
allowance.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
angry	1
indeed,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
shamefully	1
used."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
ring,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
are	1
steps	1
on	1
the	1
landing.	1
If	1
I	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
lenient	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
an	1
advocate	1
here	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
successful."	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
ushered	1
in	1
a	1
lady	1
and	1
gentleman.	1
"Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,"	1
said	1
he	1
"allow	1
me	1
to	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Francis	1
Hay	1
Moulton.	1
The	1
lady,	1
I	1
think,	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
met."	1
	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
newcomers	1
our	1
client	1
had	1
sprung	1
from	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
stood	1
very	1
erect,	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
cast	1
down	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
thrust	1
into	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
his	1
frock-coat,	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
offended	1
dignity.	1
The	1
lady	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
quick	1
step	1
forward	1
and	1
had	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
still	1
refused	1
to	1
raise	1
his	1
eyes.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
his	1
resolution,	1
perhaps,	1
for	1
her	1
pleading	1
face	1
was	1
one	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
resist.	1
	1
"You're	1
angry,	1
Robert,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
guess	1
you	1
have	1
every	1
cause	1
to	1
be."	1
	1
"Pray	1
make	1
no	1
apology	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
bitterly.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
treated	1
you	1
real	1
bad	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
you	1
before	1
I	1
went;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
rattled,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
Frank	1
here	1
again	1
I	1
just	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
doing	1
or	1
saying.	1
I	1
only	1
wonder	1
I	1
didn't	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
do	1
a	1
faint	1
right	1
there	1
before	1
the	1
altar."	1
	1
"Perhaps,	1
Mrs.	1
Moulton,	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
me	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room	1
while	1
you	1
explain	1
this	1
matter?"	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
opinion,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
strange	1
gentleman,	1
"we've	1
had	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
much	1
secrecy	1
over	1
this	1
business	1
already.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
all	1
Europe	1
and	1
America	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
it."	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
wiry,	1
sunburnt	1
man,	1
clean-shaven,	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
face	1
and	1
alert	1
manner.	1
	1
"Then	1
I'll	1
tell	1
our	1
story	1
right	1
away,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady.	1
"Frank	1
here	1
and	1
I	1
met	1
in	1
'84,	1
in	1
McQuire's	1
camp,	1
near	1
the	1
Rockies,	1
where	1
pa	1
was	1
working	1
a	1
claim.	1
We	1
were	1
engaged	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
Frank	1
and	1
I;	1
but	1
then	1
one	1
day	1
father	1
struck	1
a	1
rich	1
pocket	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
pile,	1
while	1
poor	1
Frank	1
here	1
had	1
a	1
claim	1
that	1
petered	1
out	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
nothing.	1
The	1
richer	1
pa	1
grew	1
the	1
poorer	1
was	1
Frank;	1
so	1
at	1
last	1
pa	1
wouldn't	1
hear	1
of	1
our	1
engagement	1
lasting	1
any	1
longer,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
me	1
away	1
to	1
'Frisco.	1
Frank	1
wouldn't	1
throw	1
up	1
his	1
hand,	1
though;	1
so	1
he	1
followed	1
me	1
there,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
without	1
pa	1
knowing	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
mad	1
to	1
know,	1
so	1
we	1
just	1
fixed	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
for	1
ourselves.	1
Frank	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
pile,	1
too,	1
and	1
never	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
claim	1
me	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
pa.	1
So	1
then	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
pledged	1
myself	1
not	1
to	1
marry	1
anyone	1
else	1
while	1
he	1
lived.	1
'Why	1
shouldn't	1
we	1
be	1
married	1
right	1
away,	1
then,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
feel	1
sure	1
of	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
claim	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
husband	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
back?'	1
Well,	1
we	1
talked	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
fixed	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
so	1
nicely,	1
with	1
a	1
clergyman	1
all	1
ready	1
in	1
waiting,	1
that	1
we	1
just	1
did	1
it	1
right	1
there;	1
and	1
then	1
Frank	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
seek	1
his	1
fortune,	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
pa.	1
	1
"The	1
next	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
Frank	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Montana,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
prospecting	1
in	1
Arizona,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
New	1
Mexico.	1
After	1
that	1
came	1
a	1
long	1
newspaper	1
story	1
about	1
how	1
a	1
miners'	1
camp	1
had	1
been	1
attacked	1
by	1
Apache	1
Indians,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
my	1
Frank's	1
name	1
among	1
the	1
killed.	1
I	1
fainted	1
dead	1
away,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
sick	1
for	1
months	1
after.	1
Pa	1
thought	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
decline	1
and	1
took	1
me	1
to	1
half	1
the	1
doctors	1
in	1
'Frisco.	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
news	1
came	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
more,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
doubted	1
that	1
Frank	1
was	1
really	1
dead.	1
Then	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
came	1
to	1
'Frisco,	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
London,	1
and	1
a	1
marriage	1
was	1
arranged,	1
and	1
pa	1
was	1
very	1
pleased,	1
but	1
I	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
on	1
this	1
earth	1
would	1
ever	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
Frank.	1
	1
"Still,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
married	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
of	1
course	1
I'd	1
have	1
done	1
my	1
duty	1
by	1
him.	1
We	1
can't	1
command	1
our	1
love,	1
but	1
we	1
can	1
our	1
actions.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
with	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
wife	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
be.	1
But	1
you	1
may	1
imagine	1
what	1
I	1
felt	1
when,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
rails,	1
I	1
glanced	1
back	1
and	1
saw	1
Frank	1
standing	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
pew.	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
ghost	1
at	1
first;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
again	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
still,	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
question	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
whether	1
I	1
were	1
glad	1
or	1
sorry	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
I	1
wonder	1
I	1
didn't	1
drop.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
turning	1
round,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
clergyman	1
were	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
buzz	1
of	1
a	1
bee	1
in	1
my	1
ear.	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
Should	1
I	1
stop	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
scene	1
in	1
the	1
church?	1
I	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
again,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
thinking,	1
for	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
finger	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
still.	1
Then	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
scribble	1
on	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
writing	1
me	1
a	1
note.	1
As	1
I	1
passed	1
his	1
pew	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
out	1
I	1
dropped	1
my	1
bouquet	1
over	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
slipped	1
the	1
note	1
into	1
my	1
hand	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
me	1
the	1
flowers.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
line	1
asking	1
me	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
never	1
doubted	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
my	1
first	1
duty	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
do	1
just	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
direct.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
got	1
back	1
I	1
told	1
my	1
maid,	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
in	1
California,	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
his	1
friend.	1
I	1
ordered	1
her	1
to	1
say	1
nothing,	1
but	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
packed	1
and	1
my	1
ulster	1
ready.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
dreadful	1
hard	1
before	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
great	1
people.	1
I	1
just	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
explain	1
afterwards.	1
I	1
hadn't	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
ten	1
minutes	1
before	1
I	1
saw	1
Frank	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
He	1
beckoned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
walking	1
into	1
the	1
Park.	1
I	1
slipped	1
out,	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
things,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
Some	1
woman	1
came	1
talking	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
about	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
to	1
me--seemed	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
I	1
heard	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
secret	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
before	1
marriage	1
also--but	1
I	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
soon	1
overtook	1
Frank.	1
We	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
cab	1
together,	1
and	1
away	1
we	1
drove	1
to	1
some	1
lodgings	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
in	1
Gordon	1
Square,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
my	1
true	1
wedding	1
after	1
all	1
those	1
years	1
of	1
waiting.	1
Frank	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
prisoner	1
among	1
the	1
Apaches,	1
had	1
escaped,	1
came	1
on	1
to	1
'Frisco,	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
dead	1
and	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
England,	1
followed	1
me	1
there,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
me	1
at	1
last	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
morning	1
of	1
my	1
second	1
wedding."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
paper,"	1
explained	1
the	1
American.	1
"It	1
gave	1
the	1
name	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
but	1
not	1
where	1
the	1
lady	1
lived."	1
	1
"Then	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
do,	1
and	1
Frank	1
was	1
all	1
for	1
openness,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
vanish	1
away	1
and	1
never	1
see	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
again--just	1
sending	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
pa,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
alive.	1
It	1
was	1
awful	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
lords	1
and	1
ladies	1
sitting	1
round	1
that	1
breakfast-table	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
back.	1
So	1
Frank	1
took	1
my	1
wedding-clothes	1
and	1
things	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
traced,	1
and	1
dropped	1
them	1
away	1
somewhere	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
find	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
likely	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
to	1
Paris	1
to-morrow,	1
only	1
that	1
this	1
good	1
gentleman,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
came	1
round	1
to	1
us	1
this	1
evening,	1
though	1
how	1
he	1
found	1
us	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
think,	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
us	1
very	1
clearly	1
and	1
kindly	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
Frank	1
was	1
right,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
putting	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
secret.	1
Then	1
he	1
offered	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
alone,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
came	1
right	1
away	1
round	1
to	1
his	1
rooms	1
at	1
once.	1
Now,	1
Robert,	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
pain,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
very	1
meanly	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
had	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
relaxed	1
his	1
rigid	1
attitude,	1
but	1
had	1
listened	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
brow	1
and	1
a	1
compressed	1
lip	1
to	1
this	1
long	1
narrative.	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
custom	1
to	1
discuss	1
my	1
most	1
intimate	1
personal	1
affairs	1
in	1
this	1
public	1
manner."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
won't	1
forgive	1
me?	1
You	1
won't	1
shake	1
hands	1
before	1
I	1
go?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
certainly,	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
you	1
any	1
pleasure."	1
He	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
coldly	1
grasped	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
extended	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
hoped,"	1
suggested	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
joined	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
supper."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
you	1
ask	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
much,"	1
responded	1
his	1
Lordship.	1
"I	1
may	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
acquiesce	1
in	1
these	1
recent	1
developments,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
make	1
merry	1
over	1
them.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
with	1
your	1
permission	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
wish	1
you	1
all	1
a	1
very	1
good-night."	1
He	1
included	1
us	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
sweeping	1
bow	1
and	1
stalked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
you	1
at	1
least	1
will	1
honour	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
company,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
"It	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
joy	1
to	1
meet	1
an	1
American,	1
Mr.	1
Moulton,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
a	1
monarch	1
and	1
the	1
blundering	1
of	1
a	1
minister	1
in	1
far-gone	1
years	1
will	1
not	1
prevent	1
our	1
children	1
from	1
being	1
some	1
day	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
world-wide	1
country	1
under	1
a	1
flag	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
quartering	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
Jack	1
with	1
the	1
Stars	1
and	1
Stripes."	1
	1
"The	1
case	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
interesting	1
one,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes	1
when	1
our	1
visitors	1
had	1
left	1
us,	1
"because	1
it	1
serves	1
to	1
show	1
very	1
clearly	1
how	1
simple	1
the	1
explanation	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
an	1
affair	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
inexplicable.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
events	1
as	1
narrated	1
by	1
this	1
lady,	1
and	1
nothing	1
stranger	1
than	1
the	1
result	1
when	1
viewed,	1
for	1
instance,	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard."	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
not	1
yourself	1
at	1
fault	1
at	1
all,	1
then?"	1
	1
"From	1
the	1
first,	1
two	1
facts	1
were	1
very	1
obvious	1
to	1
me,	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
willing	1
to	1
undergo	1
the	1
wedding	1
ceremony,	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
repented	1
of	1
it	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
of	1
returning	1
home.	1
Obviously	1
something	1
had	1
occurred	1
during	1
the	1
morning,	1
then,	1
to	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
mind.	1
What	1
could	1
that	1
something	1
be?	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
anyone	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
out,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom.	1
Had	1
she	1
seen	1
someone,	1
then?	1
If	1
she	1
had,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
someone	1
from	1
America	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
allowed	1
anyone	1
to	1
acquire	1
so	1
deep	1
an	1
influence	1
over	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
would	1
induce	1
her	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
plans	1
so	1
completely.	1
You	1
see	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
arrived,	1
by	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
exclusion,	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
American.	1
Then	1
who	1
could	1
this	1
American	1
be,	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
possess	1
so	1
much	1
influence	1
over	1
her?	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
lover;	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
husband.	1
Her	1
young	1
womanhood	1
had,	1
I	1
knew,	1
been	1
spent	1
in	1
rough	1
scenes	1
and	1
under	1
strange	1
conditions.	1
So	1
far	1
I	1
had	1
got	1
before	1
I	1
ever	1
heard	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon's	1
narrative.	1
When	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
pew,	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
bride's	1
manner,	1
of	1
so	1
transparent	1
a	1
device	1
for	1
obtaining	1
a	1
note	1
as	1
the	1
dropping	1
of	1
a	1
bouquet,	1
of	1
her	1
resort	1
to	1
her	1
confidential	1
maid,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
very	1
significant	1
allusion	1
to	1
claim-jumping--which	1
in	1
miners'	1
parlance	1
means	1
taking	1
possession	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
another	1
person	1
has	1
a	1
prior	1
claim	1
to--the	1
whole	1
situation	1
became	1
absolutely	1
clear.	1
She	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
either	1
a	1
lover	1
or	1
was	1
a	1
previous	1
husband--the	1
chances	1
being	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
latter."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
them?"	1
	1
"It	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
difficult,	1
but	1
friend	1
Lestrade	1
held	1
information	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know.	1
The	1
initials	1
were,	1
of	1
course,	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
importance,	1
but	1
more	1
valuable	1
still	1
was	1
it	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
within	1
a	1
week	1
he	1
had	1
settled	1
his	1
bill	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
select	1
London	1
hotels."	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
deduce	1
the	1
select?"	1
	1
"By	1
the	1
select	1
prices.	1
Eight	1
shillings	1
for	1
a	1
bed	1
and	1
eightpence	1
for	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
sherry	1
pointed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
expensive	1
hotels.	1
There	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
in	1
London	1
which	1
charge	1
at	1
that	1
rate.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
one	1
which	1
I	1
visited	1
in	1
Northumberland	1
Avenue,	1
I	1
learned	1
by	1
an	1
inspection	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
that	1
Francis	1
H.	1
Moulton,	1
an	1
American	1
gentleman,	1
had	1
left	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
and	1
on	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
entries	1
against	1
him,	1
I	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
very	1
items	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
duplicate	1
bill.	1
His	1
letters	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
forwarded	1
to	1
226	1
Gordon	1
Square;	1
so	1
thither	1
I	1
travelled,	1
and	1
being	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
loving	1
couple	1
at	1
home,	1
I	1
ventured	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
some	1
paternal	1
advice	1
and	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
their	1
position	1
a	1
little	1
clearer	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
public	1
and	1
to	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
in	1
particular.	1
I	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
here,	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
see,	1
I	1
made	1
him	1
keep	1
the	1
appointment."	1
	1
"But	1
with	1
no	1
very	1
good	1
result,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
"His	1
conduct	1
was	1
certainly	1
not	1
very	1
gracious."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
smiling,	1
"perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
gracious	1
either,	1
if,	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
wooing	1
and	1
wedding,	1
you	1
found	1
yourself	1
deprived	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
of	1
wife	1
and	1
of	1
fortune.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
judge	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
very	1
mercifully	1
and	1
thank	1
our	1
stars	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
never	1
likely	1
to	1
find	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position.	1
Draw	1
your	1
chair	1
up	1
and	1
hand	1
me	1
my	1
violin,	1
for	1
the	1
only	1
problem	1
we	1
have	1
still	1
to	1
solve	1
is	1
how	1
to	1
while	1
away	1
these	1
bleak	1
autumnal	1
evenings."	1
	1
	1
	1
XI.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
BERYL	1
CORONET	1
	1
"Holmes,"	1
said	1
I	1
as	1
I	1
stood	1
one	1
morning	1
in	1
our	1
bow-window	1
looking	1
down	1
the	1
street,	1
"here	1
is	1
a	1
madman	1
coming	1
along.	1
It	1
seems	1
rather	1
sad	1
that	1
his	1
relatives	1
should	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
alone."	1
	1
My	1
friend	1
rose	1
lazily	1
from	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
pockets	1
of	1
his	1
dressing-gown,	1
looking	1
over	1
my	1
shoulder.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bright,	1
crisp	1
February	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
snow	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
still	1
lay	1
deep	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
shimmering	1
brightly	1
in	1
the	1
wintry	1
sun.	1
Down	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
Baker	1
Street	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
ploughed	1
into	1
a	1
brown	1
crumbly	1
band	1
by	1
the	1
traffic,	1
but	1
at	1
either	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
heaped-up	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
foot-paths	1
it	1
still	1
lay	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
when	1
it	1
fell.	1
The	1
grey	1
pavement	1
had	1
been	1
cleaned	1
and	1
scraped,	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
dangerously	1
slippery,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
fewer	1
passengers	1
than	1
usual.	1
Indeed,	1
from	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Metropolitan	1
Station	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
coming	1
save	1
the	1
single	1
gentleman	1
whose	1
eccentric	1
conduct	1
had	1
drawn	1
my	1
attention.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
about	1
fifty,	1
tall,	1
portly,	1
and	1
imposing,	1
with	1
a	1
massive,	1
strongly	1
marked	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
commanding	1
figure.	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
sombre	1
yet	1
rich	1
style,	1
in	1
black	1
frock-coat,	1
shining	1
hat,	1
neat	1
brown	1
gaiters,	1
and	1
well-cut	1
pearl-grey	1
trousers.	1
Yet	1
his	1
actions	1
were	1
in	1
absurd	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
his	1
dress	1
and	1
features,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
hard,	1
with	1
occasional	1
little	1
springs,	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
weary	1
man	1
gives	1
who	1
is	1
little	1
accustomed	1
to	1
set	1
any	1
tax	1
upon	1
his	1
legs.	1
As	1
he	1
ran	1
he	1
jerked	1
his	1
hands	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
waggled	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
writhed	1
his	1
face	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
contortions.	1
	1
"What	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
"He	1
is	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
houses."	1
	1
"I	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
coming	1
here,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
"Here?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
I	1
rather	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
consult	1
me	1
professionally.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
recognise	1
the	1
symptoms.	1
Ha!	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
you?"	1
As	1
he	1
spoke,	1
the	1
man,	1
puffing	1
and	1
blowing,	1
rushed	1
at	1
our	1
door	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
our	1
bell	1
until	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
resounded	1
with	1
the	1
clanging.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
moments	1
later	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
our	1
room,	1
still	1
puffing,	1
still	1
gesticulating,	1
but	1
with	1
so	1
fixed	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
despair	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
our	1
smiles	1
were	1
turned	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
horror	1
and	1
pity.	1
For	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
words	1
out,	1
but	1
swayed	1
his	1
body	1
and	1
plucked	1
at	1
his	1
hair	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
driven	1
to	1
the	1
extreme	1
limits	1
of	1
his	1
reason.	1
Then,	1
suddenly	1
springing	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
he	1
beat	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
we	1
both	1
rushed	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
tore	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
pushed	1
him	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
easy-chair	1
and,	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him,	1
patted	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
chatted	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
easy,	1
soothing	1
tones	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
employ.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
your	1
story,	1
have	1
you	1
not?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
are	1
fatigued	1
with	1
your	1
haste.	1
Pray	1
wait	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
recovered	1
yourself,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
most	1
happy	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
any	1
little	1
problem	1
which	1
you	1
may	1
submit	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
man	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
more	1
with	1
a	1
heaving	1
chest,	1
fighting	1
against	1
his	1
emotion.	1
Then	1
he	1
passed	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
over	1
his	1
brow,	1
set	1
his	1
lips	1
tight,	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
towards	1
us.	1
	1
"No	1
doubt	1
you	1
think	1
me	1
mad?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
great	1
trouble,"	1
responded	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"God	1
knows	1
I	1
have!--a	1
trouble	1
which	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
unseat	1
my	1
reason,	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
so	1
terrible	1
is	1
it.	1
Public	1
disgrace	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
faced,	1
although	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
character	1
has	1
never	1
yet	1
borne	1
a	1
stain.	1
Private	1
affliction	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
every	1
man;	1
but	1
the	1
two	1
coming	1
together,	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
frightful	1
a	1
form,	1
have	1
been	1
enough	1
to	1
shake	1
my	1
very	1
soul.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
I	1
alone.	1
The	1
very	1
noblest	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
may	1
suffer	1
unless	1
some	1
way	1
be	1
found	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
horrible	1
affair."	1
	1
"Pray	1
compose	1
yourself,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"and	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
clear	1
account	1
of	1
who	1
you	1
are	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
has	1
befallen	1
you."	1
	1
"My	1
name,"	1
answered	1
our	1
visitor,	1
"is	1
probably	1
familiar	1
to	1
your	1
ears.	1
I	1
am	1
Alexander	1
Holder,	1
of	1
the	1
banking	1
firm	1
of	1
Holder	1
&	1
Stevenson,	1
of	1
Threadneedle	1
Street."	1
	1
The	1
name	1
was	1
indeed	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
senior	1
partner	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
largest	1
private	1
banking	1
concern	1
in	1
the	1
City	1
of	1
London.	1
What	1
could	1
have	1
happened,	1
then,	1
to	1
bring	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
citizens	1
of	1
London	1
to	1
this	1
most	1
pitiable	1
pass?	1
We	1
waited,	1
all	1
curiosity,	1
until	1
with	1
another	1
effort	1
he	1
braced	1
himself	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
story.	1
	1
"I	1
feel	1
that	1
time	1
is	1
of	1
value,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"that	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
hastened	1
here	1
when	1
the	1
police	1
inspector	1
suggested	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
secure	1
your	1
co-operation.	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street	1
by	1
the	1
Underground	1
and	1
hurried	1
from	1
there	1
on	1
foot,	1
for	1
the	1
cabs	1
go	1
slowly	1
through	1
this	1
snow.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
breath,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
takes	1
very	1
little	1
exercise.	1
I	1
feel	1
better	1
now,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
the	1
facts	1
before	1
you	1
as	1
shortly	1
and	1
yet	1
as	1
clearly	1
as	1
I	1
can.	1
	1
"It	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
successful	1
banking	1
business	1
as	1
much	1
depends	1
upon	1
our	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
remunerative	1
investments	1
for	1
our	1
funds	1
as	1
upon	1
our	1
increasing	1
our	1
connection	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
our	1
depositors.	1
One	1
of	1
our	1
most	1
lucrative	1
means	1
of	1
laying	1
out	1
money	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
loans,	1
where	1
the	1
security	1
is	1
unimpeachable.	1
We	1
have	1
done	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
years,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
noble	1
families	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
advanced	1
large	1
sums	1
upon	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
their	1
pictures,	1
libraries,	1
or	1
plate.	1
	1
"Yesterday	1
morning	1
I	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
my	1
office	1
at	1
the	1
bank	1
when	1
a	1
card	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
clerks.	1
I	1
started	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
name,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
none	1
other	1
than--well,	1
perhaps	1
even	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
name	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
household	1
word	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
earth--one	1
of	1
the	1
highest,	1
noblest,	1
most	1
exalted	1
names	1
in	1
England.	1
I	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
the	1
honour	1
and	1
attempted,	1
when	1
he	1
entered,	1
to	1
say	1
so,	1
but	1
he	1
plunged	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
business	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
wishes	1
to	1
hurry	1
quickly	1
through	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
task.	1
	1
"'Mr.	1
Holder,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'I	1
have	1
been	1
informed	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
advancing	1
money.'	1
	1
"'The	1
firm	1
does	1
so	1
when	1
the	1
security	1
is	1
good.'	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
absolutely	1
essential	1
to	1
me,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
50,000	1
pounds	1
at	1
once.	1
I	1
could,	1
of	1
course,	1
borrow	1
so	1
trifling	1
a	1
sum	1
ten	1
times	1
over	1
from	1
my	1
friends,	1
but	1
I	1
much	1
prefer	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
business	1
and	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
that	1
business	1
myself.	1
In	1
my	1
position	1
you	1
can	1
readily	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
unwise	1
to	1
place	1
one's	1
self	1
under	1
obligations.'	1
	1
"'For	1
how	1
long,	1
may	1
I	1
ask,	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
this	1
sum?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Next	1
Monday	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
large	1
sum	1
due	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
then	1
most	1
certainly	1
repay	1
what	1
you	1
advance,	1
with	1
whatever	1
interest	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
charge.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
essential	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
money	1
should	1
be	1
paid	1
at	1
once.'	1
	1
"'I	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
advance	1
it	1
without	1
further	1
parley	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
private	1
purse,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
strain	1
would	1
be	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
could	1
bear.	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
firm,	1
then	1
in	1
justice	1
to	1
my	1
partner	1
I	1
must	1
insist	1
that,	1
even	1
in	1
your	1
case,	1
every	1
businesslike	1
precaution	1
should	1
be	1
taken.'	1
	1
"'I	1
should	1
much	1
prefer	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
so,'	1
said	1
he,	1
raising	1
up	1
a	1
square,	1
black	1
morocco	1
case	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
beside	1
his	1
chair.	1
'You	1
have	1
doubtless	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
Beryl	1
Coronet?'	1
	1
"'One	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
public	1
possessions	1
of	1
the	1
empire,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Precisely.'	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
there,	1
imbedded	1
in	1
soft,	1
flesh-coloured	1
velvet,	1
lay	1
the	1
magnificent	1
piece	1
of	1
jewellery	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
named.	1
'There	1
are	1
thirty-nine	1
enormous	1
beryls,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'and	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
chasing	1
is	1
incalculable.	1
The	1
lowest	1
estimate	1
would	1
put	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
the	1
coronet	1
at	1
double	1
the	1
sum	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
asked.	1
I	1
am	1
prepared	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
my	1
security.'	1
	1
"I	1
took	1
the	1
precious	1
case	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
some	1
perplexity	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
illustrious	1
client.	1
	1
"'You	1
doubt	1
its	1
value?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Not	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
only	1
doubt--'	1
	1
"'The	1
propriety	1
of	1
my	1
leaving	1
it.	1
You	1
may	1
set	1
your	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
about	1
that.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
in	1
four	1
days	1
to	1
reclaim	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pure	1
matter	1
of	1
form.	1
Is	1
the	1
security	1
sufficient?'	1
	1
"'Ample.'	1
	1
"'You	1
understand,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
you	1
a	1
strong	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
confidence	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
you,	1
founded	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you.	1
I	1
rely	1
upon	1
you	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
discreet	1
and	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
all	1
gossip	1
upon	1
the	1
matter	1
but,	1
above	1
all,	1
to	1
preserve	1
this	1
coronet	1
with	1
every	1
possible	1
precaution	1
because	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
public	1
scandal	1
would	1
be	1
caused	1
if	1
any	1
harm	1
were	1
to	1
befall	1
it.	1
Any	1
injury	1
to	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
almost	1
as	1
serious	1
as	1
its	1
complete	1
loss,	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
beryls	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
match	1
these,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
replace	1
them.	1
I	1
leave	1
it	1
with	1
you,	1
however,	1
with	1
every	1
confidence,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
person	1
on	1
Monday	1
morning.'	1
	1
"Seeing	1
that	1
my	1
client	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
leave,	1
I	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
but,	1
calling	1
for	1
my	1
cashier,	1
I	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
pay	1
over	1
fifty	1
1000	1
pound	1
notes.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
alone	1
once	1
more,	1
however,	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
case	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
think	1
with	1
some	1
misgivings	1
of	1
the	1
immense	1
responsibility	1
which	1
it	1
entailed	1
upon	1
me.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
national	1
possession,	1
a	1
horrible	1
scandal	1
would	1
ensue	1
if	1
any	1
misfortune	1
should	1
occur	1
to	1
it.	1
I	1
already	1
regretted	1
having	1
ever	1
consented	1
to	1
take	1
charge	1
of	1
it.	1
However,	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
alter	1
the	1
matter	1
now,	1
so	1
I	1
locked	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
private	1
safe	1
and	1
turned	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
work.	1
	1
"When	1
evening	1
came	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
imprudence	1
to	1
leave	1
so	1
precious	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
behind	1
me.	1
Bankers'	1
safes	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
before	1
now,	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
not	1
mine	1
be?	1
If	1
so,	1
how	1
terrible	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
myself!	1
I	1
determined,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
few	1
days	1
I	1
would	1
always	1
carry	1
the	1
case	1
backward	1
and	1
forward	1
with	1
me,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
never	1
be	1
really	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
reach.	1
With	1
this	1
intention,	1
I	1
called	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
drove	1
out	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
at	1
Streatham,	1
carrying	1
the	1
jewel	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
breathe	1
freely	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
taken	1
it	1
upstairs	1
and	1
locked	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
bureau	1
of	1
my	1
dressing-room.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
a	1
word	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
household,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
for	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
thoroughly	1
understand	1
the	1
situation.	1
My	1
groom	1
and	1
my	1
page	1
sleep	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
set	1
aside	1
altogether.	1
I	1
have	1
three	1
maid-servants	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
and	1
whose	1
absolute	1
reliability	1
is	1
quite	1
above	1
suspicion.	1
Another,	1
Lucy	1
Parr,	1
the	1
second	1
waiting-maid,	1
has	1
only	1
been	1
in	1
my	1
service	1
a	1
few	1
months.	1
She	1
came	1
with	1
an	1
excellent	1
character,	1
however,	1
and	1
has	1
always	1
given	1
me	1
satisfaction.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
girl	1
and	1
has	1
attracted	1
admirers	1
who	1
have	1
occasionally	1
hung	1
about	1
the	1
place.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
drawback	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
we	1
believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
thoroughly	1
good	1
girl	1
in	1
every	1
way.	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
servants.	1
My	1
family	1
itself	1
is	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
me	1
long	1
to	1
describe	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
widower	1
and	1
have	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
Arthur.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
disappointment	1
to	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes--a	1
grievous	1
disappointment.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
to	1
blame.	1
People	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoiled	1
him.	1
Very	1
likely	1
I	1
have.	1
When	1
my	1
dear	1
wife	1
died	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
love.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
smile	1
fade	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
from	1
his	1
face.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
denied	1
him	1
a	1
wish.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
sterner,	1
but	1
I	1
meant	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
best.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
naturally	1
my	1
intention	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
succeed	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
business,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
business	1
turn.	1
He	1
was	1
wild,	1
wayward,	1
and,	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
trust	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
handling	1
of	1
large	1
sums	1
of	1
money.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
young	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
an	1
aristocratic	1
club,	1
and	1
there,	1
having	1
charming	1
manners,	1
he	1
was	1
soon	1
the	1
intimate	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
with	1
long	1
purses	1
and	1
expensive	1
habits.	1
He	1
learned	1
to	1
play	1
heavily	1
at	1
cards	1
and	1
to	1
squander	1
money	1
on	1
the	1
turf,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
implore	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
advance	1
upon	1
his	1
allowance,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
settle	1
his	1
debts	1
of	1
honour.	1
He	1
tried	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
to	1
break	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
dangerous	1
company	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
keeping,	1
but	1
each	1
time	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
friend,	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell,	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
"And,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
wonder	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
should	1
gain	1
an	1
influence	1
over	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
frequently	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
resist	1
the	1
fascination	1
of	1
his	1
manner.	1
He	1
is	1
older	1
than	1
Arthur,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
his	1
finger-tips,	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
everywhere,	1
seen	1
everything,	1
a	1
brilliant	1
talker,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
personal	1
beauty.	1
Yet	1
when	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
cold	1
blood,	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
glamour	1
of	1
his	1
presence,	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
from	1
his	1
cynical	1
speech	1
and	1
the	1
look	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
deeply	1
distrusted.	1
So	1
I	1
think,	1
and	1
so,	1
too,	1
thinks	1
my	1
little	1
Mary,	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
woman's	1
quick	1
insight	1
into	1
character.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
she	1
to	1
be	1
described.	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
niece;	1
but	1
when	1
my	1
brother	1
died	1
five	1
years	1
ago	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
adopted	1
her,	1
and	1
have	1
looked	1
upon	1
her	1
ever	1
since	1
as	1
my	1
daughter.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
sunbeam	1
in	1
my	1
house--sweet,	1
loving,	1
beautiful,	1
a	1
wonderful	1
manager	1
and	1
housekeeper,	1
yet	1
as	1
tender	1
and	1
quiet	1
and	1
gentle	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
could	1
be.	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
right	1
hand.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
without	1
her.	1
In	1
only	1
one	1
matter	1
has	1
she	1
ever	1
gone	1
against	1
my	1
wishes.	1
Twice	1
my	1
boy	1
has	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
marry	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
loves	1
her	1
devotedly,	1
but	1
each	1
time	1
she	1
has	1
refused	1
him.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
if	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
drawn	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
right	1
path	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
she,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
marriage	1
might	1
have	1
changed	1
his	1
whole	1
life;	1
but	1
now,	1
alas!	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late--forever	1
too	1
late!	1
	1
"Now,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
live	1
under	1
my	1
roof,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
continue	1
with	1
my	1
miserable	1
story.	1
	1
"When	1
we	1
were	1
taking	1
coffee	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
that	1
night	1
after	1
dinner,	1
I	1
told	1
Arthur	1
and	1
Mary	1
my	1
experience,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
precious	1
treasure	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
under	1
our	1
roof,	1
suppressing	1
only	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
client.	1
Lucy	1
Parr,	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
coffee,	1
had,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
left	1
the	1
room;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
swear	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed.	1
Mary	1
and	1
Arthur	1
were	1
much	1
interested	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
famous	1
coronet,	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
it.	1
	1
"'Where	1
have	1
you	1
put	1
it?'	1
asked	1
Arthur.	1
	1
"'In	1
my	1
own	1
bureau.'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
goodness	1
the	1
house	1
won't	1
be	1
burgled	1
during	1
the	1
night.'	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
locked	1
up,'	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
any	1
old	1
key	1
will	1
fit	1
that	1
bureau.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
youngster	1
I	1
have	1
opened	1
it	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
box-room	1
cupboard.'	1
	1
"He	1
often	1
had	1
a	1
wild	1
way	1
of	1
talking,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
little	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
He	1
followed	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
room,	1
however,	1
that	1
night	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
grave	1
face.	1
	1
"'Look	1
here,	1
dad,'	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
cast	1
down,	1
'can	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
200	1
pounds?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
cannot!'	1
I	1
answered	1
sharply.	1
'I	1
have	1
been	1
far	1
too	1
generous	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
money	1
matters.'	1
	1
"'You	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
kind,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'but	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
this	1
money,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
show	1
my	1
face	1
inside	1
the	1
club	1
again.'	1
	1
"'And	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing,	1
too!'	1
I	1
cried.	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
but	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
me	1
leave	1
it	1
a	1
dishonoured	1
man,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
disgrace.	1
I	1
must	1
raise	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
some	1
way,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it,	1
then	1
I	1
must	1
try	1
other	1
means.'	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
very	1
angry,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
demand	1
during	1
the	1
month.	1
'You	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
farthing	1
from	1
me,'	1
I	1
cried,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
another	1
word.	1
	1
"When	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
I	1
unlocked	1
my	1
bureau,	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
my	1
treasure	1
was	1
safe,	1
and	1
locked	1
it	1
again.	1
Then	1
I	1
started	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
secure--a	1
duty	1
which	1
I	1
usually	1
leave	1
to	1
Mary	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
well	1
to	1
perform	1
myself	1
that	1
night.	1
As	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
I	1
saw	1
Mary	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
which	1
she	1
closed	1
and	1
fastened	1
as	1
I	1
approached.	1
	1
"'Tell	1
me,	1
dad,'	1
said	1
she,	1
looking,	1
I	1
thought,	1
a	1
little	1
disturbed,	1
'did	1
you	1
give	1
Lucy,	1
the	1
maid,	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to-night?'	1
	1
"'Certainly	1
not.'	1
	1
"'She	1
came	1
in	1
just	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
door.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
only	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
gate	1
to	1
see	1
someone,	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
hardly	1
safe	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
stopped.'	1
	1
"'You	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
or	1
I	1
will	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
it.	1
Are	1
you	1
sure	1
that	1
everything	1
is	1
fastened?'	1
	1
"'Quite	1
sure,	1
dad.'	1
	1
"'Then,	1
good-night.'	1
I	1
kissed	1
her	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
bedroom	1
again,	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
soon	1
asleep.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
everything,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
any	1
bearing	1
upon	1
the	1
case,	1
but	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
question	1
me	1
upon	1
any	1
point	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
clear."	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
your	1
statement	1
is	1
singularly	1
lucid."	1
	1
"I	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
now	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
so.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
sleeper,	1
and	1
the	1
anxiety	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
tended,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
even	1
less	1
so	1
than	1
usual.	1
About	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
then,	1
I	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
some	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
had	1
ceased	1
ere	1
I	1
was	1
wide	1
awake,	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
left	1
an	1
impression	1
behind	1
it	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
window	1
had	1
gently	1
closed	1
somewhere.	1
I	1
lay	1
listening	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
ears.	1
Suddenly,	1
to	1
my	1
horror,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
distinct	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps	1
moving	1
softly	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
I	1
slipped	1
out	1
of	1
bed,	1
all	1
palpitating	1
with	1
fear,	1
and	1
peeped	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
my	1
dressing-room	1
door.	1
	1
"'Arthur!'	1
I	1
screamed,	1
'you	1
villain!	1
you	1
thief!	1
How	1
dare	1
you	1
touch	1
that	1
coronet?'	1
	1
"The	1
gas	1
was	1
half	1
up,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
it,	1
and	1
my	1
unhappy	1
boy,	1
dressed	1
only	1
in	1
his	1
shirt	1
and	1
trousers,	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1
light,	1
holding	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
wrenching	1
at	1
it,	1
or	1
bending	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
strength.	1
At	1
my	1
cry	1
he	1
dropped	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
grasp	1
and	1
turned	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
death.	1
I	1
snatched	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
examined	1
it.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
corners,	1
with	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
beryls	1
in	1
it,	1
was	1
missing.	1
	1
"'You	1
blackguard!'	1
I	1
shouted,	1
beside	1
myself	1
with	1
rage.	1
'You	1
have	1
destroyed	1
it!	1
You	1
have	1
dishonoured	1
me	1
forever!	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
jewels	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
stolen?'	1
	1
"'Stolen!'	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
thief!'	1
I	1
roared,	1
shaking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"'There	1
are	1
none	1
missing.	1
There	1
cannot	1
be	1
any	1
missing,'	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"'There	1
are	1
three	1
missing.	1
And	1
you	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
are.	1
Must	1
I	1
call	1
you	1
a	1
liar	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
thief?	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
see	1
you	1
trying	1
to	1
tear	1
off	1
another	1
piece?'	1
	1
"'You	1
have	1
called	1
me	1
names	1
enough,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'I	1
will	1
not	1
stand	1
it	1
any	1
longer.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
say	1
another	1
word	1
about	1
this	1
business,	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
chosen	1
to	1
insult	1
me.	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
your	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
make	1
my	1
own	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
world.'	1
	1
"'You	1
shall	1
leave	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
police!'	1
I	1
cried	1
half-mad	1
with	1
grief	1
and	1
rage.	1
'I	1
shall	1
have	1
this	1
matter	1
probed	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.'	1
	1
"'You	1
shall	1
learn	1
nothing	1
from	1
me,'	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
passion	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
nature.	1
'If	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
police,	1
let	1
the	1
police	1
find	1
what	1
they	1
can.'	1
	1
"By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
was	1
astir,	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
raised	1
my	1
voice	1
in	1
my	1
anger.	1
Mary	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
rush	1
into	1
my	1
room,	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
coronet	1
and	1
of	1
Arthur's	1
face,	1
she	1
read	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
scream,	1
fell	1
down	1
senseless	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
I	1
sent	1
the	1
house-maid	1
for	1
the	1
police	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
investigation	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
at	1
once.	1
When	1
the	1
inspector	1
and	1
a	1
constable	1
entered	1
the	1
house,	1
Arthur,	1
who	1
had	1
stood	1
sullenly	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
folded,	1
asked	1
me	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1
charge	1
him	1
with	1
theft.	1
I	1
answered	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
private	1
matter,	1
but	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
public	1
one,	1
since	1
the	1
ruined	1
coronet	1
was	1
national	1
property.	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
should	1
have	1
its	1
way	1
in	1
everything.	1
	1
"'At	1
least,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'you	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
me	1
arrested	1
at	1
once.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
your	1
advantage	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
mine	1
if	1
I	1
might	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
five	1
minutes.'	1
	1
"'That	1
you	1
may	1
get	1
away,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
conceal	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
stolen,'	1
said	1
I.	1
And	1
then,	1
realising	1
the	1
dreadful	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
placed,	1
I	1
implored	1
him	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
my	1
honour	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
far	1
greater	1
than	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
stake;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
threatened	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
scandal	1
which	1
would	1
convulse	1
the	1
nation.	1
He	1
might	1
avert	1
it	1
all	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
but	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
the	1
three	1
missing	1
stones.	1
	1
"'You	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
face	1
the	1
matter,'	1
said	1
I;	1
'you	1
have	1
been	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
act,	1
and	1
no	1
confession	1
could	1
make	1
your	1
guilt	1
more	1
heinous.	1
If	1
you	1
but	1
make	1
such	1
reparation	1
as	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
power,	1
by	1
telling	1
us	1
where	1
the	1
beryls	1
are,	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
and	1
forgotten.'	1
	1
"'Keep	1
your	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
ask	1
for	1
it,'	1
he	1
answered,	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sneer.	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
hardened	1
for	1
any	1
words	1
of	1
mine	1
to	1
influence	1
him.	1
There	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
way	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
inspector	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
into	1
custody.	1
A	1
search	1
was	1
made	1
at	1
once	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
person	1
but	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
have	1
concealed	1
the	1
gems;	1
but	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
be	1
found,	1
nor	1
would	1
the	1
wretched	1
boy	1
open	1
his	1
mouth	1
for	1
all	1
our	1
persuasions	1
and	1
our	1
threats.	1
This	1
morning	1
he	1
was	1
removed	1
to	1
a	1
cell,	1
and	1
I,	1
after	1
going	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
police	1
formalities,	1
have	1
hurried	1
round	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
implore	1
you	1
to	1
use	1
your	1
skill	1
in	1
unravelling	1
the	1
matter.	1
The	1
police	1
have	1
openly	1
confessed	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
at	1
present	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
any	1
expense	1
which	1
you	1
think	1
necessary.	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
offered	1
a	1
reward	1
of	1
1000	1
pounds.	1
My	1
God,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do!	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
honour,	1
my	1
gems,	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
in	1
one	1
night.	1
Oh,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do!"	1
	1
He	1
put	1
a	1
hand	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
rocked	1
himself	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
droning	1
to	1
himself	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
whose	1
grief	1
has	1
got	1
beyond	1
words.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
few	1
minutes,	1
with	1
his	1
brows	1
knitted	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
receive	1
much	1
company?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"None	1
save	1
my	1
partner	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
an	1
occasional	1
friend	1
of	1
Arthur's.	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
has	1
been	1
several	1
times	1
lately.	1
No	1
one	1
else,	1
I	1
think."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
go	1
out	1
much	1
in	1
society?"	1
	1
"Arthur	1
does.	1
Mary	1
and	1
I	1
stay	1
at	1
home.	1
We	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
care	1
for	1
it."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
unusual	1
in	1
a	1
young	1
girl."	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
quiet	1
nature.	1
Besides,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
young.	1
She	1
is	1
four-and-twenty."	1
	1
"This	1
matter,	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
shock	1
to	1
her	1
also."	1
	1
"Terrible!	1
She	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
affected	1
than	1
I."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
neither	1
of	1
you	1
any	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
son's	1
guilt?"	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
we	1
have	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
with	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hands."	1
	1
"I	1
hardly	1
consider	1
that	1
a	1
conclusive	1
proof.	1
Was	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
coronet	1
at	1
all	1
injured?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
twisted."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
not	1
think,	1
then,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
straighten	1
it?"	1
	1
"God	1
bless	1
you!	1
You	1
are	1
doing	1
what	1
you	1
can	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
me.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
heavy	1
a	1
task.	1
What	1
was	1
he	1
doing	1
there	1
at	1
all?	1
If	1
his	1
purpose	1
were	1
innocent,	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
say	1
so?"	1
	1
"Precisely.	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
guilty,	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
invent	1
a	1
lie?	1
His	1
silence	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
cut	1
both	1
ways.	1
There	1
are	1
several	1
singular	1
points	1
about	1
the	1
case.	1
What	1
did	1
the	1
police	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
noise	1
which	1
awoke	1
you	1
from	1
your	1
sleep?"	1
	1
"They	1
considered	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
caused	1
by	1
Arthur's	1
closing	1
his	1
bedroom	1
door."	1
	1
"A	1
likely	1
story!	1
As	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
bent	1
on	1
felony	1
would	1
slam	1
his	1
door	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
wake	1
a	1
household.	1
What	1
did	1
they	1
say,	1
then,	1
of	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
these	1
gems?"	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
still	1
sounding	1
the	1
planking	1
and	1
probing	1
the	1
furniture	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
them."	1
	1
"Have	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
looking	1
outside	1
the	1
house?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
have	1
shown	1
extraordinary	1
energy.	1
The	1
whole	1
garden	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
minutely	1
examined."	1
	1
"Now,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"is	1
it	1
not	1
obvious	1
to	1
you	1
now	1
that	1
this	1
matter	1
really	1
strikes	1
very	1
much	1
deeper	1
than	1
either	1
you	1
or	1
the	1
police	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
inclined	1
to	1
think?	1
It	1
appeared	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
simple	1
case;	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
seems	1
exceedingly	1
complex.	1
Consider	1
what	1
is	1
involved	1
by	1
your	1
theory.	1
You	1
suppose	1
that	1
your	1
son	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
bed,	1
went,	1
at	1
great	1
risk,	1
to	1
your	1
dressing-room,	1
opened	1
your	1
bureau,	1
took	1
out	1
your	1
coronet,	1
broke	1
off	1
by	1
main	1
force	1
a	1
small	1
portion	1
of	1
it,	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
place,	1
concealed	1
three	1
gems	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thirty-nine,	1
with	1
such	1
skill	1
that	1
nobody	1
can	1
find	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
thirty-six	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
exposed	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
discovered.	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
now,	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
theory	1
tenable?"	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
other	1
is	1
there?"	1
cried	1
the	1
banker	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair.	1
"If	1
his	1
motives	1
were	1
innocent,	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
not	1
explain	1
them?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
our	1
task	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
out,"	1
replied	1
Holmes;	1
"so	1
now,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,	1
we	1
will	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Streatham	1
together,	1
and	1
devote	1
an	1
hour	1
to	1
glancing	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
closely	1
into	1
details."	1
	1
My	1
friend	1
insisted	1
upon	1
my	1
accompanying	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
expedition,	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
eager	1
enough	1
to	1
do,	1
for	1
my	1
curiosity	1
and	1
sympathy	1
were	1
deeply	1
stirred	1
by	1
the	1
story	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
listened.	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
the	1
banker's	1
son	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
obvious	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
to	1
his	1
unhappy	1
father,	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
had	1
such	1
faith	1
in	1
Holmes'	1
judgment	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
grounds	1
for	1
hope	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
accepted	1
explanation.	1
He	1
hardly	1
spoke	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
whole	1
way	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
southern	1
suburb,	1
but	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
chin	1
upon	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
his	1
hat	1
drawn	1
over	1
his	1
eyes,	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
thought.	1
Our	1
client	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
fresh	1
heart	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
glimpse	1
of	1
hope	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
presented	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
even	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
desultory	1
chat	1
with	1
me	1
over	1
his	1
business	1
affairs.	1
A	1
short	1
railway	1
journey	1
and	1
a	1
shorter	1
walk	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
Fairbank,	1
the	1
modest	1
residence	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
financier.	1
	1
Fairbank	1
was	1
a	1
good-sized	1
square	1
house	1
of	1
white	1
stone,	1
standing	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
road.	1
A	1
double	1
carriage-sweep,	1
with	1
a	1
snow-clad	1
lawn,	1
stretched	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
to	1
two	1
large	1
iron	1
gates	1
which	1
closed	1
the	1
entrance.	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
wooden	1
thicket,	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
narrow	1
path	1
between	1
two	1
neat	1
hedges	1
stretching	1
from	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door,	1
and	1
forming	1
the	1
tradesmen's	1
entrance.	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
ran	1
a	1
lane	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
stables,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
itself	1
within	1
the	1
grounds	1
at	1
all,	1
being	1
a	1
public,	1
though	1
little	1
used,	1
thoroughfare.	1
Holmes	1
left	1
us	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
walked	1
slowly	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
house,	1
across	1
the	1
front,	1
down	1
the	1
tradesmen's	1
path,	1
and	1
so	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
garden	1
behind	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
lane.	1
So	1
long	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Holder	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dining-room	1
and	1
waited	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
until	1
he	1
should	1
return.	1
We	1
were	1
sitting	1
there	1
in	1
silence	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
came	1
in.	1
She	1
was	1
rather	1
above	1
the	1
middle	1
height,	1
slim,	1
with	1
dark	1
hair	1
and	1
eyes,	1
which	1
seemed	1
the	1
darker	1
against	1
the	1
absolute	1
pallor	1
of	1
her	1
skin.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen	1
such	1
deadly	1
paleness	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
face.	1
Her	1
lips,	1
too,	1
were	1
bloodless,	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
flushed	1
with	1
crying.	1
As	1
she	1
swept	1
silently	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
impressed	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
greater	1
sense	1
of	1
grief	1
than	1
the	1
banker	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
striking	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
evidently	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
strong	1
character,	1
with	1
immense	1
capacity	1
for	1
self-restraint.	1
Disregarding	1
my	1
presence,	1
she	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
passed	1
her	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
sweet	1
womanly	1
caress.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
given	1
orders	1
that	1
Arthur	1
should	1
be	1
liberated,	1
have	1
you	1
not,	1
dad?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
my	1
girl,	1
the	1
matter	1
must	1
be	1
probed	1
to	1
the	1
bottom."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
innocent.	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
woman's	1
instincts	1
are.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
having	1
acted	1
so	1
harshly."	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
he	1
silent,	1
then,	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
innocent?"	1
	1
"Who	1
knows?	1
Perhaps	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
angry	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
suspect	1
him."	1
	1
"How	1
could	1
I	1
help	1
suspecting	1
him,	1
when	1
I	1
actually	1
saw	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hand?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
do,	1
do	1
take	1
my	1
word	1
for	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
innocent.	1
Let	1
the	1
matter	1
drop	1
and	1
say	1
no	1
more.	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
dreadful	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
Arthur	1
in	1
prison!"	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
never	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
until	1
the	1
gems	1
are	1
found--never,	1
Mary!	1
Your	1
affection	1
for	1
Arthur	1
blinds	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
awful	1
consequences	1
to	1
me.	1
Far	1
from	1
hushing	1
the	1
thing	1
up,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
a	1
gentleman	1
down	1
from	1
London	1
to	1
inquire	1
more	1
deeply	1
into	1
it."	1
	1
"This	1
gentleman?"	1
she	1
asked,	1
facing	1
round	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
"No,	1
his	1
friend.	1
He	1
wished	1
us	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
alone.	1
He	1
is	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
stable	1
lane	1
now."	1
	1
"The	1
stable	1
lane?"	1
She	1
raised	1
her	1
dark	1
eyebrows.	1
"What	1
can	1
he	1
hope	1
to	1
find	1
there?	1
Ah!	1
this,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
is	1
he.	1
I	1
trust,	1
sir,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
succeed	1
in	1
proving,	1
what	1
I	1
feel	1
sure	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
my	1
cousin	1
Arthur	1
is	1
innocent	1
of	1
this	1
crime."	1
	1
"I	1
fully	1
share	1
your	1
opinion,	1
and	1
I	1
trust,	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
prove	1
it,"	1
returned	1
Holmes,	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
mat	1
to	1
knock	1
the	1
snow	1
from	1
his	1
shoes.	1
"I	1
believe	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
addressing	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Holder.	1
Might	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
a	1
question	1
or	1
two?"	1
	1
"Pray	1
do,	1
sir,	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
help	1
to	1
clear	1
this	1
horrible	1
affair	1
up."	1
	1
"You	1
heard	1
nothing	1
yourself	1
last	1
night?"	1
	1
"Nothing,	1
until	1
my	1
uncle	1
here	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
loudly.	1
I	1
heard	1
that,	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
down."	1
	1
"You	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
doors	1
the	1
night	1
before.	1
Did	1
you	1
fasten	1
all	1
the	1
windows?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Were	1
they	1
all	1
fastened	1
this	1
morning?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
maid	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
sweetheart?	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
remarked	1
to	1
your	1
uncle	1
last	1
night	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
girl	1
who	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
and	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
heard	1
uncle's	1
remarks	1
about	1
the	1
coronet."	1
	1
"I	1
see.	1
You	1
infer	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
sweetheart,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
may	1
have	1
planned	1
the	1
robbery."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
vague	1
theories,"	1
cried	1
the	1
banker	1
impatiently,	1
"when	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
Arthur	1
with	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hands?"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
little,	1
Mr.	1
Holder.	1
We	1
must	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
that.	1
About	1
this	1
girl,	1
Miss	1
Holder.	1
You	1
saw	1
her	1
return	1
by	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
fastened	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
I	1
met	1
her	1
slipping	1
in.	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
man,	1
too,	1
in	1
the	1
gloom."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
him?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
green-grocer	1
who	1
brings	1
our	1
vegetables	1
round.	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
Francis	1
Prosper."	1
	1
"He	1
stood,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
door--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
farther	1
up	1
the	1
path	1
than	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
door?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
did."	1
	1
"And	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
wooden	1
leg?"	1
	1
Something	1
like	1
fear	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
young	1
lady's	1
expressive	1
black	1
eyes.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
magician,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that?"	1
She	1
smiled,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answering	1
smile	1
in	1
Holmes'	1
thin,	1
eager	1
face.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
now	1
to	1
go	1
upstairs,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
shall	1
probably	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
again.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
take	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
lower	1
windows	1
before	1
I	1
go	1
up."	1
	1
He	1
walked	1
swiftly	1
round	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
pausing	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
large	1
one	1
which	1
looked	1
from	1
the	1
hall	1
onto	1
the	1
stable	1
lane.	1
This	1
he	1
opened	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
careful	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
sill	1
with	1
his	1
powerful	1
magnifying	1
lens.	1
"Now	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
upstairs,"	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
last.	1
	1
The	1
banker's	1
dressing-room	1
was	1
a	1
plainly	1
furnished	1
little	1
chamber,	1
with	1
a	1
grey	1
carpet,	1
a	1
large	1
bureau,	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
mirror.	1
Holmes	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bureau	1
first	1
and	1
looked	1
hard	1
at	1
the	1
lock.	1
	1
"Which	1
key	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
open	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"That	1
which	1
my	1
son	1
himself	1
indicated--that	1
of	1
the	1
cupboard	1
of	1
the	1
lumber-room."	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
it	1
here?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
dressing-table."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
bureau.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
noiseless	1
lock,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
wake	1
you.	1
This	1
case,	1
I	1
presume,	1
contains	1
the	1
coronet.	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
it."	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
the	1
diadem	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
magnificent	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
jeweller's	1
art,	1
and	1
the	1
thirty-six	1
stones	1
were	1
the	1
finest	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen.	1
At	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
coronet	1
was	1
a	1
cracked	1
edge,	1
where	1
a	1
corner	1
holding	1
three	1
gems	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
away.	1
	1
"Now,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"here	1
is	1
the	1
corner	1
which	1
corresponds	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
unfortunately	1
lost.	1
Might	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
break	1
it	1
off."	1
	1
The	1
banker	1
recoiled	1
in	1
horror.	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
trying,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
will."	1
Holmes	1
suddenly	1
bent	1
his	1
strength	1
upon	1
it,	1
but	1
without	1
result.	1
"I	1
feel	1
it	1
give	1
a	1
little,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"but,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
exceptionally	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
fingers,	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
me	1
all	1
my	1
time	1
to	1
break	1
it.	1
An	1
ordinary	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
it.	1
Now,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
break	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Holder?	1
There	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
noise	1
like	1
a	1
pistol	1
shot.	1
Do	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
happened	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
of	1
your	1
bed	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
it?"	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
dark	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
grow	1
lighter	1
as	1
we	1
go.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Miss	1
Holder?"	1
	1
"I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
still	1
share	1
my	1
uncle's	1
perplexity."	1
	1
"Your	1
son	1
had	1
no	1
shoes	1
or	1
slippers	1
on	1
when	1
you	1
saw	1
him?"	1
	1
"He	1
had	1
nothing	1
on	1
save	1
only	1
his	1
trousers	1
and	1
shirt."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
We	1
have	1
certainly	1
been	1
favoured	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
luck	1
during	1
this	1
inquiry,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
entirely	1
our	1
own	1
fault	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
clearing	1
the	1
matter	1
up.	1
With	1
your	1
permission,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
continue	1
my	1
investigations	1
outside."	1
	1
He	1
went	1
alone,	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
request,	1
for	1
he	1
explained	1
that	1
any	1
unnecessary	1
footmarks	1
might	1
make	1
his	1
task	1
more	1
difficult.	1
For	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
work,	1
returning	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
heavy	1
with	1
snow	1
and	1
his	1
features	1
as	1
inscrutable	1
as	1
ever.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
now	1
all	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
see,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"I	1
can	1
serve	1
you	1
best	1
by	1
returning	1
to	1
my	1
rooms."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
gems,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
Where	1
are	1
they?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
tell."	1
	1
The	1
banker	1
wrung	1
his	1
hands.	1
"I	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
them	1
again!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"And	1
my	1
son?	1
You	1
give	1
me	1
hopes?"	1
	1
"My	1
opinion	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
altered."	1
	1
"Then,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
what	1
was	1
this	1
dark	1
business	1
which	1
was	1
acted	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
last	1
night?"	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
can	1
call	1
upon	1
me	1
at	1
my	1
Baker	1
Street	1
rooms	1
to-morrow	1
morning	1
between	1
nine	1
and	1
ten	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
clearer.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
carte	1
blanche	1
to	1
act	1
for	1
you,	1
provided	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
get	1
back	1
the	1
gems,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
place	1
no	1
limit	1
on	1
the	1
sum	1
I	1
may	1
draw."	1
	1
"I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
fortune	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
back."	1
	1
"Very	1
good.	1
I	1
shall	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
between	1
this	1
and	1
then.	1
Good-bye;	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
come	1
over	1
here	1
again	1
before	1
evening."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
obvious	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
companion's	1
mind	1
was	1
now	1
made	1
up	1
about	1
the	1
case,	1
although	1
what	1
his	1
conclusions	1
were	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
even	1
dimly	1
imagine.	1
Several	1
times	1
during	1
our	1
homeward	1
journey	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
sound	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
point,	1
but	1
he	1
always	1
glided	1
away	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
topic,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
I	1
gave	1
it	1
over	1
in	1
despair.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
three	1
when	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
our	1
rooms	1
once	1
more.	1
He	1
hurried	1
to	1
his	1
chamber	1
and	1
was	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
dressed	1
as	1
a	1
common	1
loafer.	1
With	1
his	1
collar	1
turned	1
up,	1
his	1
shiny,	1
seedy	1
coat,	1
his	1
red	1
cravat,	1
and	1
his	1
worn	1
boots,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
perfect	1
sample	1
of	1
the	1
class.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
do,"	1
said	1
he,	1
glancing	1
into	1
the	1
glass	1
above	1
the	1
fireplace.	1
"I	1
only	1
wish	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
Watson,	1
but	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
it	1
won't	1
do.	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
trail	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
or	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
following	1
a	1
will-o'-the-wisp,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
know	1
which	1
it	1
is.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours."	1
He	1
cut	1
a	1
slice	1
of	1
beef	1
from	1
the	1
joint	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
sandwiched	1
it	1
between	1
two	1
rounds	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
thrusting	1
this	1
rude	1
meal	1
into	1
his	1
pocket	1
he	1
started	1
off	1
upon	1
his	1
expedition.	1
	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
my	1
tea	1
when	1
he	1
returned,	1
evidently	1
in	1
excellent	1
spirits,	1
swinging	1
an	1
old	1
elastic-sided	1
boot	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
He	1
chucked	1
it	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
and	1
helped	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea.	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
looked	1
in	1
as	1
I	1
passed,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
right	1
on."	1
	1
"Where	1
to?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
West	1
End.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
I	1
get	1
back.	1
Don't	1
wait	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
case	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
late."	1
	1
"How	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
so	1
so.	1
Nothing	1
to	1
complain	1
of.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
out	1
to	1
Streatham	1
since	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
last,	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
call	1
at	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
sweet	1
little	1
problem,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
missed	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
deal.	1
However,	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
sit	1
gossiping	1
here,	1
but	1
must	1
get	1
these	1
disreputable	1
clothes	1
off	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
highly	1
respectable	1
self."	1
	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
stronger	1
reasons	1
for	1
satisfaction	1
than	1
his	1
words	1
alone	1
would	1
imply.	1
His	1
eyes	1
twinkled,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
even	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
colour	1
upon	1
his	1
sallow	1
cheeks.	1
He	1
hastened	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
slam	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
door,	1
which	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
off	1
once	1
more	1
upon	1
his	1
congenial	1
hunt.	1
	1
I	1
waited	1
until	1
midnight,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
his	1
return,	1
so	1
I	1
retired	1
to	1
my	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
uncommon	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
away	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
on	1
end	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
hot	1
upon	1
a	1
scent,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
lateness	1
caused	1
me	1
no	1
surprise.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
at	1
what	1
hour	1
he	1
came	1
in,	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
breakfast	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
paper	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
trim	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
beginning	1
without	1
you,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
our	1
client	1
has	1
rather	1
an	1
early	1
appointment	1
this	1
morning."	1
	1
"Why,	1
it	1
is	1
after	1
nine	1
now,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
he.	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
ring."	1
	1
It	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
our	1
friend	1
the	1
financier.	1
I	1
was	1
shocked	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
him,	1
for	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
naturally	1
of	1
a	1
broad	1
and	1
massive	1
mould,	1
was	1
now	1
pinched	1
and	1
fallen	1
in,	1
while	1
his	1
hair	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
shade	1
whiter.	1
He	1
entered	1
with	1
a	1
weariness	1
and	1
lethargy	1
which	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
painful	1
than	1
his	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
before,	1
and	1
he	1
dropped	1
heavily	1
into	1
the	1
armchair	1
which	1
I	1
pushed	1
forward	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
severely	1
tried,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Only	1
two	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
prosperous	1
man,	1
without	1
a	1
care	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Now	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
to	1
a	1
lonely	1
and	1
dishonoured	1
age.	1
One	1
sorrow	1
comes	1
close	1
upon	1
the	1
heels	1
of	1
another.	1
My	1
niece,	1
Mary,	1
has	1
deserted	1
me."	1
	1
"Deserted	1
you?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
Her	1
bed	1
this	1
morning	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
slept	1
in,	1
her	1
room	1
was	1
empty,	1
and	1
a	1
note	1
for	1
me	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
hall	1
table.	1
I	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
last	1
night,	1
in	1
sorrow	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
anger,	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
married	1
my	1
boy	1
all	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
well	1
with	1
him.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
thoughtless	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
so.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
that	1
remark	1
that	1
she	1
refers	1
in	1
this	1
note:	1
	1
"'MY	1
DEAREST	1
UNCLE:--I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
trouble	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
acted	1
differently	1
this	1
terrible	1
misfortune	1
might	1
never	1
have	1
occurred.	1
I	1
cannot,	1
with	1
this	1
thought	1
in	1
my	1
mind,	1
ever	1
again	1
be	1
happy	1
under	1
your	1
roof,	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
forever.	1
Do	1
not	1
worry	1
about	1
my	1
future,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
provided	1
for;	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
do	1
not	1
search	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
fruitless	1
labour	1
and	1
an	1
ill-service	1
to	1
me.	1
In	1
life	1
or	1
in	1
death,	1
I	1
am	1
ever	1
your	1
loving,--MARY.'	1
	1
"What	1
could	1
she	1
mean	1
by	1
that	1
note,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
points	1
to	1
suicide?"	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
It	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
solution.	1
I	1
trust,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
nearing	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
troubles."	1
	1
"Ha!	1
You	1
say	1
so!	1
You	1
have	1
heard	1
something,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes;	1
you	1
have	1
learned	1
something!	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
gems?"	1
	1
"You	1
would	1
not	1
think	1
1000	1
pounds	1
apiece	1
an	1
excessive	1
sum	1
for	1
them?"	1
	1
"I	1
would	1
pay	1
ten."	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
unnecessary.	1
Three	1
thousand	1
will	1
cover	1
the	1
matter.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
reward,	1
I	1
fancy.	1
Have	1
you	1
your	1
check-book?	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
pen.	1
Better	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
for	1
4000	1
pounds."	1
	1
With	1
a	1
dazed	1
face	1
the	1
banker	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
required	1
check.	1
Holmes	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
his	1
desk,	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
triangular	1
piece	1
of	1
gold	1
with	1
three	1
gems	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
shriek	1
of	1
joy	1
our	1
client	1
clutched	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
it!"	1
he	1
gasped.	1
"I	1
am	1
saved!	1
I	1
am	1
saved!"	1
	1
The	1
reaction	1
of	1
joy	1
was	1
as	1
passionate	1
as	1
his	1
grief	1
had	1
been,	1
and	1
he	1
hugged	1
his	1
recovered	1
gems	1
to	1
his	1
bosom.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
other	1
thing	1
you	1
owe,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
rather	1
sternly.	1
	1
"Owe!"	1
He	1
caught	1
up	1
a	1
pen.	1
"Name	1
the	1
sum,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
it."	1
	1
"No,	1
the	1
debt	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
me.	1
You	1
owe	1
a	1
very	1
humble	1
apology	1
to	1
that	1
noble	1
lad,	1
your	1
son,	1
who	1
has	1
carried	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
proud	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
own	1
son	1
do,	1
should	1
I	1
ever	1
chance	1
to	1
have	1
one."	1
	1
"Then	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Arthur	1
who	1
took	1
them?"	1
	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
I	1
repeat	1
to-day,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
sure	1
of	1
it!	1
Then	1
let	1
us	1
hurry	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
known."	1
	1
"He	1
knows	1
it	1
already.	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
cleared	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
story,	1
I	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
to	1
add	1
the	1
very	1
few	1
details	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
quite	1
clear	1
to	1
me.	1
Your	1
news	1
of	1
this	1
morning,	1
however,	1
may	1
open	1
his	1
lips."	1
	1
"For	1
heaven's	1
sake,	1
tell	1
me,	1
then,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
mystery!"	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
steps	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
reached	1
it.	1
And	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
first,	1
that	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
hardest	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
hear:	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
understanding	1
between	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
and	1
your	1
niece	1
Mary.	1
They	1
have	1
now	1
fled	1
together."	1
	1
"My	1
Mary?	1
Impossible!"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
unfortunately	1
more	1
than	1
possible;	1
it	1
is	1
certain.	1
Neither	1
you	1
nor	1
your	1
son	1
knew	1
the	1
true	1
character	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
when	1
you	1
admitted	1
him	1
into	1
your	1
family	1
circle.	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
dangerous	1
men	1
in	1
England--a	1
ruined	1
gambler,	1
an	1
absolutely	1
desperate	1
villain,	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
heart	1
or	1
conscience.	1
Your	1
niece	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
such	1
men.	1
When	1
he	1
breathed	1
his	1
vows	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
a	1
hundred	1
before	1
her,	1
she	1
flattered	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
alone	1
had	1
touched	1
his	1
heart.	1
The	1
devil	1
knows	1
best	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
she	1
became	1
his	1
tool	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
nearly	1
every	1
evening."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not,	1
believe	1
it!"	1
cried	1
the	1
banker	1
with	1
an	1
ashen	1
face.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,	1
then,	1
what	1
occurred	1
in	1
your	1
house	1
last	1
night.	1
Your	1
niece,	1
when	1
you	1
had,	1
as	1
she	1
thought,	1
gone	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
slipped	1
down	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
lover	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
which	1
leads	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
lane.	1
His	1
footmarks	1
had	1
pressed	1
right	1
through	1
the	1
snow,	1
so	1
long	1
had	1
he	1
stood	1
there.	1
She	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
coronet.	1
His	1
wicked	1
lust	1
for	1
gold	1
kindled	1
at	1
the	1
news,	1
and	1
he	1
bent	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
will.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
you,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
women	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
a	1
lover	1
extinguishes	1
all	1
other	1
loves,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
one.	1
She	1
had	1
hardly	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
instructions	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
you	1
coming	1
downstairs,	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
closed	1
the	1
window	1
rapidly	1
and	1
told	1
you	1
about	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants'	1
escapade	1
with	1
her	1
wooden-legged	1
lover,	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
perfectly	1
true.	1
	1
"Your	1
boy,	1
Arthur,	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
after	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
you	1
but	1
he	1
slept	1
badly	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
uneasiness	1
about	1
his	1
club	1
debts.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
soft	1
tread	1
pass	1
his	1
door,	1
so	1
he	1
rose	1
and,	1
looking	1
out,	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
cousin	1
walking	1
very	1
stealthily	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
until	1
she	1
disappeared	1
into	1
your	1
dressing-room.	1
Petrified	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
the	1
lad	1
slipped	1
on	1
some	1
clothes	1
and	1
waited	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
this	1
strange	1
affair.	1
Presently	1
she	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
again,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
passage-lamp	1
your	1
son	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
carried	1
the	1
precious	1
coronet	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
She	1
passed	1
down	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
he,	1
thrilling	1
with	1
horror,	1
ran	1
along	1
and	1
slipped	1
behind	1
the	1
curtain	1
near	1
your	1
door,	1
whence	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
what	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
beneath.	1
He	1
saw	1
her	1
stealthily	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
hand	1
out	1
the	1
coronet	1
to	1
someone	1
in	1
the	1
gloom,	1
and	1
then	1
closing	1
it	1
once	1
more	1
hurry	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
room,	1
passing	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
hid	1
behind	1
the	1
curtain.	1
	1
"As	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
action	1
without	1
a	1
horrible	1
exposure	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
whom	1
he	1
loved.	1
But	1
the	1
instant	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
gone	1
he	1
realised	1
how	1
crushing	1
a	1
misfortune	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
how	1
all-important	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
right.	1
He	1
rushed	1
down,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
in	1
his	1
bare	1
feet,	1
opened	1
the	1
window,	1
sprang	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
snow,	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
lane,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
dark	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight.	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
away,	1
but	1
Arthur	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
struggle	1
between	1
them,	1
your	1
lad	1
tugging	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
coronet,	1
and	1
his	1
opponent	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
In	1
the	1
scuffle,	1
your	1
son	1
struck	1
Sir	1
George	1
and	1
cut	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
eye.	1
Then	1
something	1
suddenly	1
snapped,	1
and	1
your	1
son,	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hands,	1
rushed	1
back,	1
closed	1
the	1
window,	1
ascended	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
coronet	1
had	1
been	1
twisted	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
and	1
was	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
straighten	1
it	1
when	1
you	1
appeared	1
upon	1
the	1
scene."	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible?"	1
gasped	1
the	1
banker.	1
	1
"You	1
then	1
roused	1
his	1
anger	1
by	1
calling	1
him	1
names	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
deserved	1
your	1
warmest	1
thanks.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
explain	1
the	1
true	1
state	1
of	1
affairs	1
without	1
betraying	1
one	1
who	1
certainly	1
deserved	1
little	1
enough	1
consideration	1
at	1
his	1
hands.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
more	1
chivalrous	1
view,	1
however,	1
and	1
preserved	1
her	1
secret."	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
she	1
shrieked	1
and	1
fainted	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
coronet,"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Holder.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
what	1
a	1
blind	1
fool	1
I	1
have	1
been!	1
And	1
his	1
asking	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
for	1
five	1
minutes!	1
The	1
dear	1
fellow	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
missing	1
piece	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
struggle.	1
How	1
cruelly	1
I	1
have	1
misjudged	1
him!"	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
house,"	1
continued	1
Holmes,	1
"I	1
at	1
once	1
went	1
very	1
carefully	1
round	1
it	1
to	1
observe	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
traces	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
which	1
might	1
help	1
me.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
none	1
had	1
fallen	1
since	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
strong	1
frost	1
to	1
preserve	1
impressions.	1
I	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
tradesmen's	1
path,	1
but	1
found	1
it	1
all	1
trampled	1
down	1
and	1
indistinguishable.	1
Just	1
beyond	1
it,	1
however,	1
at	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door,	1
a	1
woman	1
had	1
stood	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
a	1
man,	1
whose	1
round	1
impressions	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
wooden	1
leg.	1
I	1
could	1
even	1
tell	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
disturbed,	1
for	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
run	1
back	1
swiftly	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
as	1
was	1
shown	1
by	1
the	1
deep	1
toe	1
and	1
light	1
heel	1
marks,	1
while	1
Wooden-leg	1
had	1
waited	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
gone	1
away.	1
I	1
thought	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
maid	1
and	1
her	1
sweetheart,	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
had	1
already	1
spoken	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
inquiry	1
showed	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
I	1
passed	1
round	1
the	1
garden	1
without	1
seeing	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
random	1
tracks,	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
police;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
lane	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
and	1
complex	1
story	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
a	1
double	1
line	1
of	1
tracks	1
of	1
a	1
booted	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
second	1
double	1
line	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
with	1
delight	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
naked	1
feet.	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
convinced	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
your	1
son.	1
The	1
first	1
had	1
walked	1
both	1
ways,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
run	1
swiftly,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
tread	1
was	1
marked	1
in	1
places	1
over	1
the	1
depression	1
of	1
the	1
boot,	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
after	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
followed	1
them	1
up	1
and	1
found	1
they	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
window,	1
where	1
Boots	1
had	1
worn	1
all	1
the	1
snow	1
away	1
while	1
waiting.	1
Then	1
I	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
or	1
more	1
down	1
the	1
lane.	1
I	1
saw	1
where	1
Boots	1
had	1
faced	1
round,	1
where	1
the	1
snow	1
was	1
cut	1
up	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
struggle,	1
and,	1
finally,	1
where	1
a	1
few	1
drops	1
of	1
blood	1
had	1
fallen,	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken.	1
Boots	1
had	1
then	1
run	1
down	1
the	1
lane,	1
and	1
another	1
little	1
smudge	1
of	1
blood	1
showed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
hurt.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
highroad	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end,	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
pavement	1
had	1
been	1
cleared,	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
that	1
clue.	1
	1
"On	1
entering	1
the	1
house,	1
however,	1
I	1
examined,	1
as	1
you	1
remember,	1
the	1
sill	1
and	1
framework	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
window	1
with	1
my	1
lens,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
at	1
once	1
see	1
that	1
someone	1
had	1
passed	1
out.	1
I	1
could	1
distinguish	1
the	1
outline	1
of	1
an	1
instep	1
where	1
the	1
wet	1
foot	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
in	1
coming	1
in.	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
A	1
man	1
had	1
waited	1
outside	1
the	1
window;	1
someone	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
gems;	1
the	1
deed	1
had	1
been	1
overseen	1
by	1
your	1
son;	1
he	1
had	1
pursued	1
the	1
thief;	1
had	1
struggled	1
with	1
him;	1
they	1
had	1
each	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
coronet,	1
their	1
united	1
strength	1
causing	1
injuries	1
which	1
neither	1
alone	1
could	1
have	1
effected.	1
He	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
prize,	1
but	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
fragment	1
in	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
his	1
opponent.	1
So	1
far	1
I	1
was	1
clear.	1
The	1
question	1
now	1
was,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
it	1
brought	1
him	1
the	1
coronet?	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
maxim	1
of	1
mine	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
excluded	1
the	1
impossible,	1
whatever	1
remains,	1
however	1
improbable,	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
truth.	1
Now,	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
you	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
it	1
down,	1
so	1
there	1
only	1
remained	1
your	1
niece	1
and	1
the	1
maids.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
maids,	1
why	1
should	1
your	1
son	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
accused	1
in	1
their	1
place?	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
possible	1
reason.	1
As	1
he	1
loved	1
his	1
cousin,	1
however,	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
explanation	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
retain	1
her	1
secret--the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
secret	1
was	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
one.	1
When	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
at	1
that	1
window,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
fainted	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
coronet	1
again,	1
my	1
conjecture	1
became	1
a	1
certainty.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
who	1
was	1
her	1
confederate?	1
A	1
lover	1
evidently,	1
for	1
who	1
else	1
could	1
outweigh	1
the	1
love	1
and	1
gratitude	1
which	1
she	1
must	1
feel	1
to	1
you?	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
you	1
went	1
out	1
little,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
circle	1
of	1
friends	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
limited	1
one.	1
But	1
among	1
them	1
was	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell.	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
before	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
evil	1
reputation	1
among	1
women.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
he	1
who	1
wore	1
those	1
boots	1
and	1
retained	1
the	1
missing	1
gems.	1
Even	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Arthur	1
had	1
discovered	1
him,	1
he	1
might	1
still	1
flatter	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
safe,	1
for	1
the	1
lad	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
without	1
compromising	1
his	1
own	1
family.	1
	1
"Well,	1
your	1
own	1
good	1
sense	1
will	1
suggest	1
what	1
measures	1
I	1
took	1
next.	1
I	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
loafer	1
to	1
Sir	1
George's	1
house,	1
managed	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
his	1
valet,	1
learned	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
cut	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
and,	1
finally,	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
six	1
shillings,	1
made	1
all	1
sure	1
by	1
buying	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
his	1
cast-off	1
shoes.	1
With	1
these	1
I	1
journeyed	1
down	1
to	1
Streatham	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
exactly	1
fitted	1
the	1
tracks."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
an	1
ill-dressed	1
vagabond	1
in	1
the	1
lane	1
yesterday	1
evening,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Holder.	1
	1
"Precisely.	1
It	1
was	1
I.	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
man,	1
so	1
I	1
came	1
home	1
and	1
changed	1
my	1
clothes.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
delicate	1
part	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
play	1
then,	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
prosecution	1
must	1
be	1
avoided	1
to	1
avert	1
scandal,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
so	1
astute	1
a	1
villain	1
would	1
see	1
that	1
our	1
hands	1
were	1
tied	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
went	1
and	1
saw	1
him.	1
At	1
first,	1
of	1
course,	1
he	1
denied	1
everything.	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
every	1
particular	1
that	1
had	1
occurred,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
bluster	1
and	1
took	1
down	1
a	1
life-preserver	1
from	1
the	1
wall.	1
I	1
knew	1
my	1
man,	1
however,	1
and	1
I	1
clapped	1
a	1
pistol	1
to	1
his	1
head	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
strike.	1
Then	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
reasonable.	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
price	1
for	1
the	1
stones	1
he	1
held--1000	1
pounds	1
apiece.	1
That	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
first	1
signs	1
of	1
grief	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shown.	1
'Why,	1
dash	1
it	1
all!'	1
said	1
he,	1
'I've	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
at	1
six	1
hundred	1
for	1
the	1
three!'	1
I	1
soon	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
address	1
of	1
the	1
receiver	1
who	1
had	1
them,	1
on	1
promising	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
prosecution.	1
Off	1
I	1
set	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
after	1
much	1
chaffering	1
I	1
got	1
our	1
stones	1
at	1
1000	1
pounds	1
apiece.	1
Then	1
I	1
looked	1
in	1
upon	1
your	1
son,	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
right,	1
and	1
eventually	1
got	1
to	1
my	1
bed	1
about	1
two	1
o'clock,	1
after	1
what	1
I	1
may	1
call	1
a	1
really	1
hard	1
day's	1
work."	1
	1
"A	1
day	1
which	1
has	1
saved	1
England	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
public	1
scandal,"	1
said	1
the	1
banker,	1
rising.	1
"Sir,	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
words	1
to	1
thank	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me	1
ungrateful	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done.	1
Your	1
skill	1
has	1
indeed	1
exceeded	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
must	1
fly	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
boy	1
to	1
apologise	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
him.	1
As	1
to	1
what	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
poor	1
Mary,	1
it	1
goes	1
to	1
my	1
very	1
heart.	1
Not	1
even	1
your	1
skill	1
can	1
inform	1
me	1
where	1
she	1
is	1
now."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
safely	1
say,"	1
returned	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
she	1
is	1
wherever	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
is.	1
It	1
is	1
equally	1
certain,	1
too,	1
that	1
whatever	1
her	1
sins	1
are,	1
they	1
will	1
soon	1
receive	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
sufficient	1
punishment."	1
	1

THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
COPPER	1
BEECHES	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
loves	1
art	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake,"	1
remarked	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
tossing	1
aside	1
the	1
advertisement	1
sheet	1
of	1
the	1
Daily	1
Telegraph,	1
"it	1
is	1
frequently	1
in	1
its	1
least	1
important	1
and	1
lowliest	1
manifestations	1
that	1
the	1
keenest	1
pleasure	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
derived.	1
It	1
is	1
pleasant	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
observe,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
far	1
grasped	1
this	1
truth	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
little	1
records	1
of	1
our	1
cases	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
draw	1
up,	1
and,	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
say,	1
occasionally	1
to	1
embellish,	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
prominence	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
many	1
causes	1
célèbres	1
and	1
sensational	1
trials	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
figured	1
but	1
rather	1
to	1
those	1
incidents	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
trivial	1
in	1
themselves,	1
but	1
which	1
have	1
given	1
room	1
for	1
those	1
faculties	1
of	1
deduction	1
and	1
of	1
logical	1
synthesis	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
special	1
province."	1
	1
"And	1
yet,"	1
said	1
I,	1
smiling,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
quite	1
hold	1
myself	1
absolved	1
from	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
sensationalism	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
urged	1
against	1
my	1
records."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
erred,	1
perhaps,"	1
he	1
observed,	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
glowing	1
cinder	1
with	1
the	1
tongs	1
and	1
lighting	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
long	1
cherry-wood	1
pipe	1
which	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
replace	1
his	1
clay	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
disputatious	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
meditative	1
mood--"you	1
have	1
erred	1
perhaps	1
in	1
attempting	1
to	1
put	1
colour	1
and	1
life	1
into	1
each	1
of	1
your	1
statements	1
instead	1
of	1
confining	1
yourself	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
placing	1
upon	1
record	1
that	1
severe	1
reasoning	1
from	1
cause	1
to	1
effect	1
which	1
is	1
really	1
the	1
only	1
notable	1
feature	1
about	1
the	1
thing."	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
you	1
full	1
justice	1
in	1
the	1
matter,"	1
I	1
remarked	1
with	1
some	1
coldness,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
repelled	1
by	1
the	1
egotism	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
observed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
strong	1
factor	1
in	1
my	1
friend's	1
singular	1
character.	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
selfishness	1
or	1
conceit,"	1
said	1
he,	1
answering,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont,	1
my	1
thoughts	1
rather	1
than	1
my	1
words.	1
"If	1
I	1
claim	1
full	1
justice	1
for	1
my	1
art,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
impersonal	1
thing--a	1
thing	1
beyond	1
myself.	1
Crime	1
is	1
common.	1
Logic	1
is	1
rare.	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
logic	1
rather	1
than	1
upon	1
the	1
crime	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
dwell.	1
You	1
have	1
degraded	1
what	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
lectures	1
into	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
tales."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cold	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
spring,	1
and	1
we	1
sat	1
after	1
breakfast	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
cheery	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
room	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
A	1
thick	1
fog	1
rolled	1
down	1
between	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
dun-coloured	1
houses,	1
and	1
the	1
opposing	1
windows	1
loomed	1
like	1
dark,	1
shapeless	1
blurs	1
through	1
the	1
heavy	1
yellow	1
wreaths.	1
Our	1
gas	1
was	1
lit	1
and	1
shone	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
cloth	1
and	1
glimmer	1
of	1
china	1
and	1
metal,	1
for	1
the	1
table	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
cleared	1
yet.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
silent	1
all	1
the	1
morning,	1
dipping	1
continuously	1
into	1
the	1
advertisement	1
columns	1
of	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
papers	1
until	1
at	1
last,	1
having	1
apparently	1
given	1
up	1
his	1
search,	1
he	1
had	1
emerged	1
in	1
no	1
very	1
sweet	1
temper	1
to	1
lecture	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
literary	1
shortcomings.	1
	1
"At	1
the	1
same	1
time,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sat	1
puffing	1
at	1
his	1
long	1
pipe	1
and	1
gazing	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
"you	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
open	1
to	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
sensationalism,	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
cases	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
interest	1
yourself	1
in,	1
a	1
fair	1
proportion	1
do	1
not	1
treat	1
of	1
crime,	1
in	1
its	1
legal	1
sense,	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
small	1
matter	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia,	1
the	1
singular	1
experience	1
of	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland,	1
the	1
problem	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
twisted	1
lip,	1
and	1
the	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
noble	1
bachelor,	1
were	1
all	1
matters	1
which	1
are	1
outside	1
the	1
pale	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
But	1
in	1
avoiding	1
the	1
sensational,	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
bordered	1
on	1
the	1
trivial."	1
	1
"The	1
end	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
so,"	1
I	1
answered,	1
"but	1
the	1
methods	1
I	1
hold	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
novel	1
and	1
of	1
interest."	1
	1
"Pshaw,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
what	1
do	1
the	1
public,	1
the	1
great	1
unobservant	1
public,	1
who	1
could	1
hardly	1
tell	1
a	1
weaver	1
by	1
his	1
tooth	1
or	1
a	1
compositor	1
by	1
his	1
left	1
thumb,	1
care	1
about	1
the	1
finer	1
shades	1
of	1
analysis	1
and	1
deduction!	1
But,	1
indeed,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
trivial,	1
I	1
cannot	1
blame	1
you,	1
for	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
cases	1
are	1
past.	1
Man,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
criminal	1
man,	1
has	1
lost	1
all	1
enterprise	1
and	1
originality.	1
As	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
little	1
practice,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
degenerating	1
into	1
an	1
agency	1
for	1
recovering	1
lost	1
lead	1
pencils	1
and	1
giving	1
advice	1
to	1
young	1
ladies	1
from	1
boarding-schools.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
touched	1
bottom	1
at	1
last,	1
however.	1
This	1
note	1
I	1
had	1
this	1
morning	1
marks	1
my	1
zero-point,	1
I	1
fancy.	1
Read	1
it!"	1
He	1
tossed	1
a	1
crumpled	1
letter	1
across	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
dated	1
from	1
Montague	1
Place	1
upon	1
the	1
preceding	1
evening,	1
and	1
ran	1
thus:	1
	1
"DEAR	1
MR.	1
HOLMES:--I	1
am	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
or	1
should	1
not	1
accept	1
a	1
situation	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
offered	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
governess.	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
at	1
half-past	1
ten	1
to-morrow	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
inconvenience	1
you.	1
Yours	1
faithfully,	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
"VIOLET	1
HUNTER."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
young	1
lady?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Not	1
I."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
half-past	1
ten	1
now."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
is	1
her	1
ring."	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
more	1
interest	1
than	1
you	1
think.	1
You	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
blue	1
carbuncle,	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mere	1
whim	1
at	1
first,	1
developed	1
into	1
a	1
serious	1
investigation.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
also."	1
	1
"Well,	1
let	1
us	1
hope	1
so.	1
But	1
our	1
doubts	1
will	1
very	1
soon	1
be	1
solved,	1
for	1
here,	1
unless	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken,	1
is	1
the	1
person	1
in	1
question."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
was	1
plainly	1
but	1
neatly	1
dressed,	1
with	1
a	1
bright,	1
quick	1
face,	1
freckled	1
like	1
a	1
plover's	1
egg,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
brisk	1
manner	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
her	1
own	1
way	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
troubling	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
my	1
companion	1
rose	1
to	1
greet	1
her,	1
"but	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
experience,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
parents	1
or	1
relations	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
from	1
whom	1
I	1
could	1
ask	1
advice,	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do."	1
	1
"Pray	1
take	1
a	1
seat,	1
Miss	1
Hunter.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
serve	1
you."	1
	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
Holmes	1
was	1
favourably	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
manner	1
and	1
speech	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
client.	1
He	1
looked	1
her	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
searching	1
fashion,	1
and	1
then	1
composed	1
himself,	1
with	1
his	1
lids	1
drooping	1
and	1
his	1
finger-tips	1
together,	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her	1
story.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
governess	1
for	1
five	1
years,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"in	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Spence	1
Munro,	1
but	1
two	1
months	1
ago	1
the	1
colonel	1
received	1
an	1
appointment	1
at	1
Halifax,	1
in	1
Nova	1
Scotia,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
children	1
over	1
to	1
America	1
with	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
without	1
a	1
situation.	1
I	1
advertised,	1
and	1
I	1
answered	1
advertisements,	1
but	1
without	1
success.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
little	1
money	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
saved	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
short,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
my	1
wit's	1
end	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
well-known	1
agency	1
for	1
governesses	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
End	1
called	1
Westaway's,	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
about	1
once	1
a	1
week	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
anything	1
had	1
turned	1
up	1
which	1
might	1
suit	1
me.	1
Westaway	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
founder	1
of	1
the	1
business,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
managed	1
by	1
Miss	1
Stoper.	1
She	1
sits	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
little	1
office,	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
are	1
seeking	1
employment	1
wait	1
in	1
an	1
anteroom,	1
and	1
are	1
then	1
shown	1
in	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
when	1
she	1
consults	1
her	1
ledgers	1
and	1
sees	1
whether	1
she	1
has	1
anything	1
which	1
would	1
suit	1
them.	1
	1
"Well,	1
when	1
I	1
called	1
last	1
week	1
I	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
office	1
as	1
usual,	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
Miss	1
Stoper	1
was	1
not	1
alone.	1
A	1
prodigiously	1
stout	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
smiling	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
heavy	1
chin	1
which	1
rolled	1
down	1
in	1
fold	1
upon	1
fold	1
over	1
his	1
throat	1
sat	1
at	1
her	1
elbow	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
glasses	1
on	1
his	1
nose,	1
looking	1
very	1
earnestly	1
at	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
entered.	1
As	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
gave	1
quite	1
a	1
jump	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
turned	1
quickly	1
to	1
Miss	1
Stoper.	1
	1
"'That	1
will	1
do,'	1
said	1
he;	1
'I	1
could	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
anything	1
better.	1
Capital!	1
capital!'	1
He	1
seemed	1
quite	1
enthusiastic	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
hands	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
genial	1
fashion.	1
He	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
comfortable-looking	1
man	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"'You	1
are	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
situation,	1
miss?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
sir.'	1
	1
"'As	1
governess?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
sir.'	1
	1
"'And	1
what	1
salary	1
do	1
you	1
ask?'	1
	1
"'I	1
had	1
4	1
pounds	1
a	1
month	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
place	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Spence	1
Munro.'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
tut,	1
tut!	1
sweating--rank	1
sweating!'	1
he	1
cried,	1
throwing	1
his	1
fat	1
hands	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
boiling	1
passion.	1
'How	1
could	1
anyone	1
offer	1
so	1
pitiful	1
a	1
sum	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
with	1
such	1
attractions	1
and	1
accomplishments?'	1
	1
"'My	1
accomplishments,	1
sir,	1
may	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
you	1
imagine,'	1
said	1
I.	1
'A	1
little	1
French,	1
a	1
little	1
German,	1
music,	1
and	1
drawing--'	1
	1
"'Tut,	1
tut!'	1
he	1
cried.	1
'This	1
is	1
all	1
quite	1
beside	1
the	1
question.	1
The	1
point	1
is,	1
have	1
you	1
or	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
the	1
bearing	1
and	1
deportment	1
of	1
a	1
lady?	1
There	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
nutshell.	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
not,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
fitted	1
for	1
the	1
rearing	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
who	1
may	1
some	1
day	1
play	1
a	1
considerable	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
why,	1
then,	1
how	1
could	1
any	1
gentleman	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
condescend	1
to	1
accept	1
anything	1
under	1
the	1
three	1
figures?	1
Your	1
salary	1
with	1
me,	1
madam,	1
would	1
commence	1
at	1
100	1
pounds	1
a	1
year.'	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
imagine,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
to	1
me,	1
destitute	1
as	1
I	1
was,	1
such	1
an	1
offer	1
seemed	1
almost	1
too	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
true.	1
The	1
gentleman,	1
however,	1
seeing	1
perhaps	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
incredulity	1
upon	1
my	1
face,	1
opened	1
a	1
pocket-book	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
note.	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
also	1
my	1
custom,'	1
said	1
he,	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
pleasant	1
fashion	1
until	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
just	1
two	1
little	1
shining	1
slits	1
amid	1
the	1
white	1
creases	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
'to	1
advance	1
to	1
my	1
young	1
ladies	1
half	1
their	1
salary	1
beforehand,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
meet	1
any	1
little	1
expenses	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
and	1
their	1
wardrobe.'	1
	1
"It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
so	1
fascinating	1
and	1
so	1
thoughtful	1
a	1
man.	1
As	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
debt	1
to	1
my	1
tradesmen,	1
the	1
advance	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
convenience,	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
unnatural	1
about	1
the	1
whole	1
transaction	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
before	1
I	1
quite	1
committed	1
myself.	1
	1
"'May	1
I	1
ask	1
where	1
you	1
live,	1
sir?'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Hampshire.	1
Charming	1
rural	1
place.	1
The	1
Copper	1
Beeches,	1
five	1
miles	1
on	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
Winchester.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
lovely	1
country,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady,	1
and	1
the	1
dearest	1
old	1
country-house.'	1
	1
"'And	1
my	1
duties,	1
sir?	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
would	1
be.'	1
	1
"'One	1
child--one	1
dear	1
little	1
romper	1
just	1
six	1
years	1
old.	1
Oh,	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
killing	1
cockroaches	1
with	1
a	1
slipper!	1
Smack!	1
smack!	1
smack!	1
Three	1
gone	1
before	1
you	1
could	1
wink!'	1
He	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
laughed	1
his	1
eyes	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
again.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
startled	1
at	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
child's	1
amusement,	1
but	1
the	1
father's	1
laughter	1
made	1
me	1
think	1
that	1
perhaps	1
he	1
was	1
joking.	1
	1
"'My	1
sole	1
duties,	1
then,'	1
I	1
asked,	1
'are	1
to	1
take	1
charge	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
child?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
no,	1
not	1
the	1
sole,	1
not	1
the	1
sole,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady,'	1
he	1
cried.	1
'Your	1
duty	1
would	1
be,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
good	1
sense	1
would	1
suggest,	1
to	1
obey	1
any	1
little	1
commands	1
my	1
wife	1
might	1
give,	1
provided	1
always	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
such	1
commands	1
as	1
a	1
lady	1
might	1
with	1
propriety	1
obey.	1
You	1
see	1
no	1
difficulty,	1
heh?'	1
	1
"'I	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
make	1
myself	1
useful.'	1
	1
"'Quite	1
so.	1
In	1
dress	1
now,	1
for	1
example.	1
We	1
are	1
faddy	1
people,	1
you	1
know--faddy	1
but	1
kind-hearted.	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
asked	1
to	1
wear	1
any	1
dress	1
which	1
we	1
might	1
give	1
you,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
our	1
little	1
whim.	1
Heh?'	1
	1
"'No,'	1
said	1
I,	1
considerably	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
"'Or	1
to	1
sit	1
here,	1
or	1
sit	1
there,	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
offensive	1
to	1
you?'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
no.'	1
	1
"'Or	1
to	1
cut	1
your	1
hair	1
quite	1
short	1
before	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
us?'	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
my	1
ears.	1
As	1
you	1
may	1
observe,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
my	1
hair	1
is	1
somewhat	1
luxuriant,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
rather	1
peculiar	1
tint	1
of	1
chestnut.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
considered	1
artistic.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
sacrificing	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
offhand	1
fashion.	1
	1
"'I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible,'	1
said	1
I.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
me	1
eagerly	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
small	1
eyes,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
shadow	1
pass	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
I	1
spoke.	1
	1
"'I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
essential,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
fancy	1
of	1
my	1
wife's,	1
and	1
ladies'	1
fancies,	1
you	1
know,	1
madam,	1
ladies'	1
fancies	1
must	1
be	1
consulted.	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
won't	1
cut	1
your	1
hair?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
sir,	1
I	1
really	1
could	1
not,'	1
I	1
answered	1
firmly.	1
	1
"'Ah,	1
very	1
well;	1
then	1
that	1
quite	1
settles	1
the	1
matter.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity,	1
because	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
you	1
would	1
really	1
have	1
done	1
very	1
nicely.	1
In	1
that	1
case,	1
Miss	1
Stoper,	1
I	1
had	1
best	1
inspect	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
of	1
your	1
young	1
ladies.'	1
	1
"The	1
manageress	1
had	1
sat	1
all	1
this	1
while	1
busy	1
with	1
her	1
papers	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
us,	1
but	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
me	1
now	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
annoyance	1
upon	1
her	1
face	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
suspecting	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
handsome	1
commission	1
through	1
my	1
refusal.	1
	1
"'Do	1
you	1
desire	1
your	1
name	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
upon	1
the	1
books?'	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"'If	1
you	1
please,	1
Miss	1
Stoper.'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
really,	1
it	1
seems	1
rather	1
useless,	1
since	1
you	1
refuse	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
offers	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,'	1
said	1
she	1
sharply.	1
'You	1
can	1
hardly	1
expect	1
us	1
to	1
exert	1
ourselves	1
to	1
find	1
another	1
such	1
opening	1
for	1
you.	1
Good-day	1
to	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Hunter.'	1
She	1
struck	1
a	1
gong	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
shown	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
page.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
lodgings	1
and	1
found	1
little	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
cupboard,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
bills	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
myself	1
whether	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
a	1
very	1
foolish	1
thing.	1
After	1
all,	1
if	1
these	1
people	1
had	1
strange	1
fads	1
and	1
expected	1
obedience	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
matters,	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
ready	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
their	1
eccentricity.	1
Very	1
few	1
governesses	1
in	1
England	1
are	1
getting	1
100	1
pounds	1
a	1
year.	1
Besides,	1
what	1
use	1
was	1
my	1
hair	1
to	1
me?	1
Many	1
people	1
are	1
improved	1
by	1
wearing	1
it	1
short	1
and	1
perhaps	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
number.	1
Next	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
mistake,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
had	1
almost	1
overcome	1
my	1
pride	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
agency	1
and	1
inquire	1
whether	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
still	1
open	1
when	1
I	1
received	1
this	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself.	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
here	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
you:	1

Copper	1
Beeches,	1
near	1
Winchester.	1
"'DEAR	1
MISS	1
HUNTER:--Miss	1
Stoper	1
has	1
very	1
kindly	1
given	1
me	1
your	1
address,	1
and	1
I	1
write	1
from	1
here	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
whether	1
you	1
have	1
reconsidered	1
your	1
decision.	1
My	1
wife	1
is	1
very	1
anxious	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
come,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
much	1
attracted	1
by	1
my	1
description	1
of	1
you.	1
We	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
give	1
30	1
pounds	1
a	1
quarter,	1
or	1
120	1
pounds	1
a	1
year,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
recompense	1
you	1
for	1
any	1
little	1
inconvenience	1
which	1
our	1
fads	1
may	1
cause	1
you.	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
exacting,	1
after	1
all.	1
My	1
wife	1
is	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
shade	1
of	1
electric	1
blue	1
and	1
would	1
like	1
you	1
to	1
wear	1
such	1
a	1
dress	1
indoors	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
You	1
need	1
not,	1
however,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
purchasing	1
one,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
one	1
belonging	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
daughter	1
Alice	1
(now	1
in	1
Philadelphia),	1
which	1
would,	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
fit	1
you	1
very	1
well.	1
Then,	1
as	1
to	1
sitting	1
here	1
or	1
there,	1
or	1
amusing	1
yourself	1
in	1
any	1
manner	1
indicated,	1
that	1
need	1
cause	1
you	1
no	1
inconvenience.	1
As	1
regards	1
your	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
a	1
pity,	1
especially	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
remarking	1
its	1
beauty	1
during	1
our	1
short	1
interview,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
remain	1
firm	1
upon	1
this	1
point,	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
increased	1
salary	1
may	1
recompense	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
loss.	1
Your	1
duties,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
concerned,	1
are	1
very	1
light.	1
Now	1
do	1
try	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
meet	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
dog-cart	1
at	1
Winchester.	1
Let	1
me	1
know	1
your	1
train.	1
Yours	1
faithfully,	1
JEPHRO	1
RUCASTLE.'	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
letter	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
received,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
made	1
up	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
accept	1
it.	1
I	1
thought,	1
however,	1
that	1
before	1
taking	1
the	1
final	1
step	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
submit	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
to	1
your	1
consideration."	1
	1
"Well,	1
Miss	1
Hunter,	1
if	1
your	1
mind	1
is	1
made	1
up,	1
that	1
settles	1
the	1
question,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
advise	1
me	1
to	1
refuse?"	1
	1
"I	1
confess	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
situation	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
mine	1
apply	1
for."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes?"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
data.	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
yourself	1
formed	1
some	1
opinion?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
one	1
possible	1
solution.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
kind,	1
good-natured	1
man.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
is	1
a	1
lunatic,	1
that	1
he	1
desires	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
matter	1
quiet	1
for	1
fear	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
an	1
asylum,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
humours	1
her	1
fancies	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
prevent	1
an	1
outbreak?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
possible	1
solution--in	1
fact,	1
as	1
matters	1
stand,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
probable	1
one.	1
But	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
nice	1
household	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
lady."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
money,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
the	1
money!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
pay	1
is	1
good--too	1
good.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
me	1
uneasy.	1
Why	1
should	1
they	1
give	1
you	1
120	1
pounds	1
a	1
year,	1
when	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
their	1
pick	1
for	1
40	1
pounds?	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
strong	1
reason	1
behind."	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
circumstances	1
you	1
would	1
understand	1
afterwards	1
if	1
I	1
wanted	1
your	1
help.	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
so	1
much	1
stronger	1
if	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
may	1
carry	1
that	1
feeling	1
away	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
little	1
problem	1
promises	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
my	1
way	1
for	1
some	1
months.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
distinctly	1
novel	1
about	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
features.	1
If	1
you	1
should	1
find	1
yourself	1
in	1
doubt	1
or	1
in	1
danger--"	1
	1
"Danger!	1
What	1
danger	1
do	1
you	1
foresee?"	1
	1
Holmes	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
gravely.	1
"It	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
danger	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
define	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"But	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
day	1
or	1
night,	1
a	1
telegram	1
would	1
bring	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
your	1
help."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
enough."	1
She	1
rose	1
briskly	1
from	1
her	1
chair	1
with	1
the	1
anxiety	1
all	1
swept	1
from	1
her	1
face.	1
"I	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Hampshire	1
quite	1
easy	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
now.	1
I	1
shall	1
write	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
at	1
once,	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
poor	1
hair	1
to-night,	1
and	1
start	1
for	1
Winchester	1
to-morrow."	1
With	1
a	1
few	1
grateful	1
words	1
to	1
Holmes	1
she	1
bade	1
us	1
both	1
good-night	1
and	1
bustled	1
off	1
upon	1
her	1
way.	1
	1
"At	1
least,"	1
said	1
I	1
as	1
we	1
heard	1
her	1
quick,	1
firm	1
steps	1
descending	1
the	1
stairs,	1
"she	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
herself."	1
	1
"And	1
she	1
would	1
need	1
to	1
be,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
gravely.	1
"I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
hear	1
from	1
her	1
before	1
many	1
days	1
are	1
past."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
long	1
before	1
my	1
friend's	1
prediction	1
was	1
fulfilled.	1
A	1
fortnight	1
went	1
by,	1
during	1
which	1
I	1
frequently	1
found	1
my	1
thoughts	1
turning	1
in	1
her	1
direction	1
and	1
wondering	1
what	1
strange	1
side-alley	1
of	1
human	1
experience	1
this	1
lonely	1
woman	1
had	1
strayed	1
into.	1
The	1
unusual	1
salary,	1
the	1
curious	1
conditions,	1
the	1
light	1
duties,	1
all	1
pointed	1
to	1
something	1
abnormal,	1
though	1
whether	1
a	1
fad	1
or	1
a	1
plot,	1
or	1
whether	1
the	1
man	1
were	1
a	1
philanthropist	1
or	1
a	1
villain,	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
beyond	1
my	1
powers	1
to	1
determine.	1
As	1
to	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
observed	1
that	1
he	1
sat	1
frequently	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
on	1
end,	1
with	1
knitted	1
brows	1
and	1
an	1
abstracted	1
air,	1
but	1
he	1
swept	1
the	1
matter	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
when	1
I	1
mentioned	1
it.	1
"Data!	1
data!	1
data!"	1
he	1
cried	1
impatiently.	1
"I	1
can't	1
make	1
bricks	1
without	1
clay."	1
And	1
yet	1
he	1
would	1
always	1
wind	1
up	1
by	1
muttering	1
that	1
no	1
sister	1
of	1
his	1
should	1
ever	1
have	1
accepted	1
such	1
a	1
situation.	1
	1
The	1
telegram	1
which	1
we	1
eventually	1
received	1
came	1
late	1
one	1
night	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
turning	1
in	1
and	1
Holmes	1
was	1
settling	1
down	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
all-night	1
chemical	1
researches	1
which	1
he	1
frequently	1
indulged	1
in,	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
leave	1
him	1
stooping	1
over	1
a	1
retort	1
and	1
a	1
test-tube	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
find	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
breakfast	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
yellow	1
envelope,	1
and	1
then,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
message,	1
threw	1
it	1
across	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
"Just	1
look	1
up	1
the	1
trains	1
in	1
Bradshaw,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
chemical	1
studies.	1
	1
The	1
summons	1
was	1
a	1
brief	1
and	1
urgent	1
one.	1
	1
"Please	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
Black	1
Swan	1
Hotel	1
at	1
Winchester	1
at	1
midday	1
to-morrow,"	1
it	1
said.	1
"Do	1
come!	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
my	1
wit's	1
end.	1
	1
HUNTER."	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
come	1
with	1
me?"	1
asked	1
Holmes,	1
glancing	1
up.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
wish	1
to."	1
	1
"Just	1
look	1
it	1
up,	1
then."	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
train	1
at	1
half-past	1
nine,"	1
said	1
I,	1
glancing	1
over	1
my	1
Bradshaw.	1
"It	1
is	1
due	1
at	1
Winchester	1
at	1
11:30."	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
nicely.	1
Then	1
perhaps	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
postpone	1
my	1
analysis	1
of	1
the	1
acetones,	1
as	1
we	1
may	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
our	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
morning."	1
	1
By	1
eleven	1
o'clock	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
well	1
upon	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
English	1
capital.	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
papers	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
down,	1
but	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
Hampshire	1
border	1
he	1
threw	1
them	1
down	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
admire	1
the	1
scenery.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
ideal	1
spring	1
day,	1
a	1
light	1
blue	1
sky,	1
flecked	1
with	1
little	1
fleecy	1
white	1
clouds	1
drifting	1
across	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
The	1
sun	1
was	1
shining	1
very	1
brightly,	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
exhilarating	1
nip	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
which	1
set	1
an	1
edge	1
to	1
a	1
man's	1
energy.	1
All	1
over	1
the	1
countryside,	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
rolling	1
hills	1
around	1
Aldershot,	1
the	1
little	1
red	1
and	1
grey	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
farm-steadings	1
peeped	1
out	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
light	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
foliage.	1
	1
"Are	1
they	1
not	1
fresh	1
and	1
beautiful?"	1
I	1
cried	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
fresh	1
from	1
the	1
fogs	1
of	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
	1
But	1
Holmes	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
gravely.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
curses	1
of	1
a	1
mind	1
with	1
a	1
turn	1
like	1
mine	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
look	1
at	1
everything	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
special	1
subject.	1
You	1
look	1
at	1
these	1
scattered	1
houses,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
impressed	1
by	1
their	1
beauty.	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
thought	1
which	1
comes	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
their	1
isolation	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
impunity	1
with	1
which	1
crime	1
may	1
be	1
committed	1
there."	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
I	1
cried.	1
"Who	1
would	1
associate	1
crime	1
with	1
these	1
dear	1
old	1
homesteads?"	1
	1
"They	1
always	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
horror.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
belief,	1
Watson,	1
founded	1
upon	1
my	1
experience,	1
that	1
the	1
lowest	1
and	1
vilest	1
alleys	1
in	1
London	1
do	1
not	1
present	1
a	1
more	1
dreadful	1
record	1
of	1
sin	1
than	1
does	1
the	1
smiling	1
and	1
beautiful	1
countryside."	1
	1
"You	1
horrify	1
me!"	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
reason	1
is	1
very	1
obvious.	1
The	1
pressure	1
of	1
public	1
opinion	1
can	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
what	1
the	1
law	1
cannot	1
accomplish.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
lane	1
so	1
vile	1
that	1
the	1
scream	1
of	1
a	1
tortured	1
child,	1
or	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
a	1
drunkard's	1
blow,	1
does	1
not	1
beget	1
sympathy	1
and	1
indignation	1
among	1
the	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
whole	1
machinery	1
of	1
justice	1
is	1
ever	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
complaint	1
can	1
set	1
it	1
going,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
step	1
between	1
the	1
crime	1
and	1
the	1
dock.	1
But	1
look	1
at	1
these	1
lonely	1
houses,	1
each	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
fields,	1
filled	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
with	1
poor	1
ignorant	1
folk	1
who	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
Think	1
of	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
hellish	1
cruelty,	1
the	1
hidden	1
wickedness	1
which	1
may	1
go	1
on,	1
year	1
in,	1
year	1
out,	1
in	1
such	1
places,	1
and	1
none	1
the	1
wiser.	1
Had	1
this	1
lady	1
who	1
appeals	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
help	1
gone	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
Winchester,	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
fear	1
for	1
her.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
five	1
miles	1
of	1
country	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
danger.	1
Still,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
personally	1
threatened."	1
	1
"No.	1
If	1
she	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
Winchester	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
she	1
can	1
get	1
away."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
She	1
has	1
her	1
freedom."	1
	1
"What	1
CAN	1
be	1
the	1
matter,	1
then?	1
Can	1
you	1
suggest	1
no	1
explanation?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
devised	1
seven	1
separate	1
explanations,	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
cover	1
the	1
facts	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
them.	1
But	1
which	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
correct	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
determined	1
by	1
the	1
fresh	1
information	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
no	1
doubt	1
find	1
waiting	1
for	1
us.	1
Well,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
cathedral,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
learn	1
all	1
that	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
has	1
to	1
tell."	1
	1
The	1
Black	1
Swan	1
is	1
an	1
inn	1
of	1
repute	1
in	1
the	1
High	1
Street,	1
at	1
no	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
station,	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
waiting	1
for	1
us.	1
She	1
had	1
engaged	1
a	1
sitting-room,	1
and	1
our	1
lunch	1
awaited	1
us	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
delighted	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
come,"	1
she	1
said	1
earnestly.	1
"It	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
kind	1
of	1
you	1
both;	1
but	1
indeed	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do.	1
Your	1
advice	1
will	1
be	1
altogether	1
invaluable	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Pray	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
quick,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
before	1
three.	1
I	1
got	1
his	1
leave	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
town	1
this	1
morning,	1
though	1
he	1
little	1
knew	1
for	1
what	1
purpose."	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
have	1
everything	1
in	1
its	1
due	1
order."	1
Holmes	1
thrust	1
his	1
long	1
thin	1
legs	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
composed	1
himself	1
to	1
listen.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
met,	1
on	1
the	1
whole,	1
with	1
no	1
actual	1
ill-treatment	1
from	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
fair	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
that.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
easy	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
about	1
them."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
you	1
not	1
understand?"	1
	1
"Their	1
reasons	1
for	1
their	1
conduct.	1
But	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
it	1
all	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
occurred.	1
When	1
I	1
came	1
down,	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
met	1
me	1
here	1
and	1
drove	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
dog-cart	1
to	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches.	1
It	1
is,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
beautifully	1
situated,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
beautiful	1
in	1
itself,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
large	1
square	1
block	1
of	1
a	1
house,	1
whitewashed,	1
but	1
all	1
stained	1
and	1
streaked	1
with	1
damp	1
and	1
bad	1
weather.	1
There	1
are	1
grounds	1
round	1
it,	1
woods	1
on	1
three	1
sides,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
a	1
field	1
which	1
slopes	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Southampton	1
highroad,	1
which	1
curves	1
past	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
This	1
ground	1
in	1
front	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
but	1
the	1
woods	1
all	1
round	1
are	1
part	1
of	1
Lord	1
Southerton's	1
preserves.	1
A	1
clump	1
of	1
copper	1
beeches	1
immediately	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
door	1
has	1
given	1
its	1
name	1
to	1
the	1
place.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
driven	1
over	1
by	1
my	1
employer,	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
amiable	1
as	1
ever,	1
and	1
was	1
introduced	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
child.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
truth,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
in	1
the	1
conjecture	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
probable	1
in	1
your	1
rooms	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
is	1
not	1
mad.	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
silent,	1
pale-faced	1
woman,	1
much	1
younger	1
than	1
her	1
husband,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
thirty,	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
while	1
he	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
forty-five.	1
From	1
their	1
conversation	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
married	1
about	1
seven	1
years,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
widower,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
only	1
child	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
wife	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
who	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
Philadelphia.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
private	1
that	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
them	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
aversion	1
to	1
her	1
stepmother.	1
As	1
the	1
daughter	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
less	1
than	1
twenty,	1
I	1
can	1
quite	1
imagine	1
that	1
her	1
position	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
uncomfortable	1
with	1
her	1
father's	1
young	1
wife.	1
	1
"Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
colourless	1
in	1
mind	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
feature.	1
She	1
impressed	1
me	1
neither	1
favourably	1
nor	1
the	1
reverse.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
nonentity.	1
It	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
passionately	1
devoted	1
both	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
little	1
son.	1
Her	1
light	1
grey	1
eyes	1
wandered	1
continually	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
noting	1
every	1
little	1
want	1
and	1
forestalling	1
it	1
if	1
possible.	1
He	1
was	1
kind	1
to	1
her	1
also	1
in	1
his	1
bluff,	1
boisterous	1
fashion,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
happy	1
couple.	1
And	1
yet	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
secret	1
sorrow,	1
this	1
woman.	1
She	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
lost	1
in	1
deep	1
thought,	1
with	1
the	1
saddest	1
look	1
upon	1
her	1
face.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
I	1
have	1
surprised	1
her	1
in	1
tears.	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
sometimes	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
her	1
child	1
which	1
weighed	1
upon	1
her	1
mind,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
met	1
so	1
utterly	1
spoiled	1
and	1
so	1
ill-natured	1
a	1
little	1
creature.	1
He	1
is	1
small	1
for	1
his	1
age,	1
with	1
a	1
head	1
which	1
is	1
quite	1
disproportionately	1
large.	1
His	1
whole	1
life	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
an	1
alternation	1
between	1
savage	1
fits	1
of	1
passion	1
and	1
gloomy	1
intervals	1
of	1
sulking.	1
Giving	1
pain	1
to	1
any	1
creature	1
weaker	1
than	1
himself	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
one	1
idea	1
of	1
amusement,	1
and	1
he	1
shows	1
quite	1
remarkable	1
talent	1
in	1
planning	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
mice,	1
little	1
birds,	1
and	1
insects.	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
creature,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
he	1
has	1
little	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
my	1
story."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
all	1
details,"	1
remarked	1
my	1
friend,	1
"whether	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
relevant	1
or	1
not."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
anything	1
of	1
importance.	1
The	1
one	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
about	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
struck	1
me	1
at	1
once,	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
and	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
servants.	1
There	1
are	1
only	1
two,	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
wife.	1
Toller,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
is	1
a	1
rough,	1
uncouth	1
man,	1
with	1
grizzled	1
hair	1
and	1
whiskers,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
smell	1
of	1
drink.	1
Twice	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
quite	1
drunk,	1
and	1
yet	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
it.	1
His	1
wife	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
tall	1
and	1
strong	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
sour	1
face,	1
as	1
silent	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
and	1
much	1
less	1
amiable.	1
They	1
are	1
a	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
couple,	1
but	1
fortunately	1
I	1
spend	1
most	1
of	1
my	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
room,	1
which	1
are	1
next	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
building.	1
	1
"For	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches	1
my	1
life	1
was	1
very	1
quiet;	1
on	1
the	1
third,	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
came	1
down	1
just	1
after	1
breakfast	1
and	1
whispered	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
yes,'	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
me,	1
'we	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Hunter,	1
for	1
falling	1
in	1
with	1
our	1
whims	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
cut	1
your	1
hair.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
detracted	1
in	1
the	1
tiniest	1
iota	1
from	1
your	1
appearance.	1
We	1
shall	1
now	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
electric-blue	1
dress	1
will	1
become	1
you.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
laid	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
bed	1
in	1
your	1
room,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
we	1
should	1
both	1
be	1
extremely	1
obliged.'	1
	1
"The	1
dress	1
which	1
I	1
found	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
shade	1
of	1
blue.	1
It	1
was	1
of	1
excellent	1
material,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
beige,	1
but	1
it	1
bore	1
unmistakable	1
signs	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
worn	1
before.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
better	1
fit	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
measured	1
for	1
it.	1
Both	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
expressed	1
a	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
seemed	1
quite	1
exaggerated	1
in	1
its	1
vehemence.	1
They	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
room,	1
stretching	1
along	1
the	1
entire	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
with	1
three	1
long	1
windows	1
reaching	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor.	1
A	1
chair	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
central	1
window,	1
with	1
its	1
back	1
turned	1
towards	1
it.	1
In	1
this	1
I	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
sit,	1
and	1
then	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle,	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
the	1
funniest	1
stories	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
listened	1
to.	1
You	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
how	1
comical	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
I	1
laughed	1
until	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
weary.	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle,	1
however,	1
who	1
has	1
evidently	1
no	1
sense	1
of	1
humour,	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
smiled,	1
but	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
in	1
her	1
lap,	1
and	1
a	1
sad,	1
anxious	1
look	1
upon	1
her	1
face.	1
After	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so,	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
suddenly	1
remarked	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
commence	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
change	1
my	1
dress	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
little	1
Edward	1
in	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
"Two	1
days	1
later	1
this	1
same	1
performance	1
was	1
gone	1
through	1
under	1
exactly	1
similar	1
circumstances.	1
Again	1
I	1
changed	1
my	1
dress,	1
again	1
I	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
laughed	1
very	1
heartily	1
at	1
the	1
funny	1
stories	1
of	1
which	1
my	1
employer	1
had	1
an	1
immense	1
répertoire,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
told	1
inimitably.	1
Then	1
he	1
handed	1
me	1
a	1
yellow-backed	1
novel,	1
and	1
moving	1
my	1
chair	1
a	1
little	1
sideways,	1
that	1
my	1
own	1
shadow	1
might	1
not	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
page,	1
he	1
begged	1
me	1
to	1
read	1
aloud	1
to	1
him.	1
I	1
read	1
for	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes,	1
beginning	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
chapter,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
sentence,	1
he	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
cease	1
and	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
dress.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
easily	1
imagine,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
how	1
curious	1
I	1
became	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
performance	1
could	1
possibly	1
be.	1
They	1
were	1
always	1
very	1
careful,	1
I	1
observed,	1
to	1
turn	1
my	1
face	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
window,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
became	1
consumed	1
with	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
behind	1
my	1
back.	1
At	1
first	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
impossible,	1
but	1
I	1
soon	1
devised	1
a	1
means.	1
My	1
hand-mirror	1
had	1
been	1
broken,	1
so	1
a	1
happy	1
thought	1
seized	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
concealed	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
glass	1
in	1
my	1
handkerchief.	1
On	1
the	1
next	1
occasion,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
laughter,	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
eyes,	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
management	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
behind	1
me.	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
disappointed.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing.	1
At	1
least	1
that	1
was	1
my	1
first	1
impression.	1
At	1
the	1
second	1
glance,	1
however,	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
Southampton	1
Road,	1
a	1
small	1
bearded	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
grey	1
suit,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
in	1
my	1
direction.	1
The	1
road	1
is	1
an	1
important	1
highway,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
usually	1
people	1
there.	1
This	1
man,	1
however,	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
railings	1
which	1
bordered	1
our	1
field	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
earnestly	1
up.	1
I	1
lowered	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
searching	1
gaze.	1
She	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
divined	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
mirror	1
in	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
what	1
was	1
behind	1
me.	1
She	1
rose	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
"'Jephro,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'there	1
is	1
an	1
impertinent	1
fellow	1
upon	1
the	1
road	1
there	1
who	1
stares	1
up	1
at	1
Miss	1
Hunter.'	1
	1
"'No	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
Miss	1
Hunter?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
these	1
parts.'	1
	1
"'Dear	1
me!	1
How	1
very	1
impertinent!	1
Kindly	1
turn	1
round	1
and	1
motion	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
away.'	1
	1
"'Surely	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
notice.'	1
	1
"'No,	1
no,	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
him	1
loitering	1
here	1
always.	1
Kindly	1
turn	1
round	1
and	1
wave	1
him	1
away	1
like	1
that.'	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
told,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
drew	1
down	1
the	1
blind.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
week	1
ago,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sat	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
nor	1
have	1
I	1
worn	1
the	1
blue	1
dress,	1
nor	1
seen	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
road."	1
	1
"Pray	1
continue,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Your	1
narrative	1
promises	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
one."	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
rather	1
disconnected,	1
I	1
fear,	1
and	1
there	1
may	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
little	1
relation	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
incidents	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
speak.	1
On	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches,	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
took	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
outhouse	1
which	1
stands	1
near	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door.	1
As	1
we	1
approached	1
it	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
sharp	1
rattling	1
of	1
a	1
chain,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
animal	1
moving	1
about.	1
	1
"'Look	1
in	1
here!'	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle,	1
showing	1
me	1
a	1
slit	1
between	1
two	1
planks.	1
'Is	1
he	1
not	1
a	1
beauty?'	1
	1
"I	1
looked	1
through	1
and	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
two	1
glowing	1
eyes,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
vague	1
figure	1
huddled	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"'Don't	1
be	1
frightened,'	1
said	1
my	1
employer,	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
start	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
given.	1
'It's	1
only	1
Carlo,	1
my	1
mastiff.	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
mine,	1
but	1
really	1
old	1
Toller,	1
my	1
groom,	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
him.	1
We	1
feed	1
him	1
once	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
then,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
as	1
keen	1
as	1
mustard.	1
Toller	1
lets	1
him	1
loose	1
every	1
night,	1
and	1
God	1
help	1
the	1
trespasser	1
whom	1
he	1
lays	1
his	1
fangs	1
upon.	1
For	1
goodness'	1
sake	1
don't	1
you	1
ever	1
on	1
any	1
pretext	1
set	1
your	1
foot	1
over	1
the	1
threshold	1
at	1
night,	1
for	1
it's	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
your	1
life	1
is	1
worth.'	1
	1
"The	1
warning	1
was	1
no	1
idle	1
one,	1
for	1
two	1
nights	1
later	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
bedroom	1
window	1
about	1
two	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
beautiful	1
moonlight	1
night,	1
and	1
the	1
lawn	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
silvered	1
over	1
and	1
almost	1
as	1
bright	1
as	1
day.	1
I	1
was	1
standing,	1
rapt	1
in	1
the	1
peaceful	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
scene,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
moving	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
copper	1
beeches.	1
As	1
it	1
emerged	1
into	1
the	1
moonshine	1
I	1
saw	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
giant	1
dog,	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
a	1
calf,	1
tawny	1
tinted,	1
with	1
hanging	1
jowl,	1
black	1
muzzle,	1
and	1
huge	1
projecting	1
bones.	1
It	1
walked	1
slowly	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
That	1
dreadful	1
sentinel	1
sent	1
a	1
chill	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
any	1
burglar	1
could	1
have	1
done.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
experience	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
I	1
had,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
cut	1
off	1
my	1
hair	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
placed	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
coil	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
my	1
trunk.	1
One	1
evening,	1
after	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
in	1
bed,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
amuse	1
myself	1
by	1
examining	1
the	1
furniture	1
of	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
by	1
rearranging	1
my	1
own	1
little	1
things.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
the	1
two	1
upper	1
ones	1
empty	1
and	1
open,	1
the	1
lower	1
one	1
locked.	1
I	1
had	1
filled	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
with	1
my	1
linen,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
still	1
much	1
to	1
pack	1
away	1
I	1
was	1
naturally	1
annoyed	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
drawer.	1
It	1
struck	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
fastened	1
by	1
a	1
mere	1
oversight,	1
so	1
I	1
took	1
out	1
my	1
bunch	1
of	1
keys	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
The	1
very	1
first	1
key	1
fitted	1
to	1
perfection,	1
and	1
I	1
drew	1
the	1
drawer	1
open.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
guess	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
It	1
was	1
my	1
coil	1
of	1
hair.	1
	1
"I	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
examined	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
peculiar	1
tint,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thickness.	1
But	1
then	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
obtruded	1
itself	1
upon	1
me.	1
How	1
could	1
my	1
hair	1
have	1
been	1
locked	1
in	1
the	1
drawer?	1
With	1
trembling	1
hands	1
I	1
undid	1
my	1
trunk,	1
turned	1
out	1
the	1
contents,	1
and	1
drew	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
my	1
own	1
hair.	1
I	1
laid	1
the	1
two	1
tresses	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
identical.	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
extraordinary?	1
Puzzle	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
what	1
it	1
meant.	1
I	1
returned	1
the	1
strange	1
hair	1
to	1
the	1
drawer,	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
Rucastles	1
as	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
put	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
by	1
opening	1
a	1
drawer	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
locked.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
naturally	1
observant,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
remarked,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
I	1
soon	1
had	1
a	1
pretty	1
good	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
in	1
my	1
head.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
wing,	1
however,	1
which	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
inhabited	1
at	1
all.	1
A	1
door	1
which	1
faced	1
that	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
Tollers	1
opened	1
into	1
this	1
suite,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
invariably	1
locked.	1
One	1
day,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
ascended	1
the	1
stair,	1
I	1
met	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
coming	1
out	1
through	1
this	1
door,	1
his	1
keys	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
round,	1
jovial	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
accustomed.	1
His	1
cheeks	1
were	1
red,	1
his	1
brow	1
was	1
all	1
crinkled	1
with	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
veins	1
stood	1
out	1
at	1
his	1
temples	1
with	1
passion.	1
He	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
hurried	1
past	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
a	1
look.	1
	1
"This	1
aroused	1
my	1
curiosity,	1
so	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
grounds	1
with	1
my	1
charge,	1
I	1
strolled	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
There	1
were	1
four	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
row,	1
three	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
simply	1
dirty,	1
while	1
the	1
fourth	1
was	1
shuttered	1
up.	1
They	1
were	1
evidently	1
all	1
deserted.	1
As	1
I	1
strolled	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
glancing	1
at	1
them	1
occasionally,	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
me,	1
looking	1
as	1
merry	1
and	1
jovial	1
as	1
ever.	1
	1
"'Ah!'	1
said	1
he,	1
'you	1
must	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
rude	1
if	1
I	1
passed	1
you	1
without	1
a	1
word,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady.	1
I	1
was	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
business	1
matters.'	1
	1
"I	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
offended.	1
'By	1
the	1
way,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'you	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
quite	1
a	1
suite	1
of	1
spare	1
rooms	1
up	1
there,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
has	1
the	1
shutters	1
up.'	1
	1
"He	1
looked	1
surprised	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me,	1
a	1
little	1
startled	1
at	1
my	1
remark.	1
	1
"'Photography	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
hobbies,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'I	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
dark	1
room	1
up	1
there.	1
But,	1
dear	1
me!	1
what	1
an	1
observant	1
young	1
lady	1
we	1
have	1
come	1
upon.	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
believed	1
it?	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
ever	1
believed	1
it?'	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
jesting	1
tone,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
jest	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me.	1
I	1
read	1
suspicion	1
there	1
and	1
annoyance,	1
but	1
no	1
jest.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
I	1
understood	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
about	1
that	1
suite	1
of	1
rooms	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
know,	1
I	1
was	1
all	1
on	1
fire	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
mere	1
curiosity,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
share	1
of	1
that.	1
It	1
was	1
more	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
duty--a	1
feeling	1
that	1
some	1
good	1
might	1
come	1
from	1
my	1
penetrating	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
They	1
talk	1
of	1
woman's	1
instinct;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
woman's	1
instinct	1
which	1
gave	1
me	1
that	1
feeling.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
it	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
keenly	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
any	1
chance	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
forbidden	1
door.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
only	1
yesterday	1
that	1
the	1
chance	1
came.	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
that,	1
besides	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle,	1
both	1
Toller	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
these	1
deserted	1
rooms,	1
and	1
I	1
once	1
saw	1
him	1
carrying	1
a	1
large	1
black	1
linen	1
bag	1
with	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
Recently	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
drinking	1
hard,	1
and	1
yesterday	1
evening	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
drunk;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
upstairs	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
door.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
there.	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
were	1
both	1
downstairs,	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
with	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
admirable	1
opportunity.	1
I	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
gently	1
in	1
the	1
lock,	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
slipped	1
through.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
passage	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me,	1
unpapered	1
and	1
uncarpeted,	1
which	1
turned	1
at	1
a	1
right	1
angle	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
end.	1
Round	1
this	1
corner	1
were	1
three	1
doors	1
in	1
a	1
line,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
third	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
open.	1
They	1
each	1
led	1
into	1
an	1
empty	1
room,	1
dusty	1
and	1
cheerless,	1
with	1
two	1
windows	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
so	1
thick	1
with	1
dirt	1
that	1
the	1
evening	1
light	1
glimmered	1
dimly	1
through	1
them.	1
The	1
centre	1
door	1
was	1
closed,	1
and	1
across	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
fastened	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
broad	1
bars	1
of	1
an	1
iron	1
bed,	1
padlocked	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
a	1
ring	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
fastened	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
stout	1
cord.	1
The	1
door	1
itself	1
was	1
locked	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
key	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
This	1
barricaded	1
door	1
corresponded	1
clearly	1
with	1
the	1
shuttered	1
window	1
outside,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
the	1
glimmer	1
from	1
beneath	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
darkness.	1
Evidently	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
skylight	1
which	1
let	1
in	1
light	1
from	1
above.	1
As	1
I	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
sinister	1
door	1
and	1
wondering	1
what	1
secret	1
it	1
might	1
veil,	1
I	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
steps	1
within	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
shadow	1
pass	1
backward	1
and	1
forward	1
against	1
the	1
little	1
slit	1
of	1
dim	1
light	1
which	1
shone	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
door.	1
A	1
mad,	1
unreasoning	1
terror	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
sight,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
My	1
overstrung	1
nerves	1
failed	1
me	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
I	1
turned	1
and	1
ran--ran	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
dreadful	1
hand	1
were	1
behind	1
me	1
clutching	1
at	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
my	1
dress.	1
I	1
rushed	1
down	1
the	1
passage,	1
through	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
straight	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
outside.	1
	1
"'So,'	1
said	1
he,	1
smiling,	1
'it	1
was	1
you,	1
then.	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
door	1
open.'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
frightened!'	1
I	1
panted.	1
	1
"'My	1
dear	1
young	1
lady!	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady!'--you	1
cannot	1
think	1
how	1
caressing	1
and	1
soothing	1
his	1
manner	1
was--'and	1
what	1
has	1
frightened	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady?'	1
	1
"But	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
coaxing.	1
He	1
overdid	1
it.	1
I	1
was	1
keenly	1
on	1
my	1
guard	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
"'I	1
was	1
foolish	1
enough	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
empty	1
wing,'	1
I	1
answered.	1
'But	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
lonely	1
and	1
eerie	1
in	1
this	1
dim	1
light	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
frightened	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
again.	1
Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
still	1
in	1
there!'	1
	1
"'Only	1
that?'	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
keenly.	1
	1
"'Why,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
think?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
lock	1
this	1
door?'	1
	1
"'I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know.'	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
people	1
out	1
who	1
have	1
no	1
business	1
there.	1
Do	1
you	1
see?'	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
manner.	1
	1
"'I	1
am	1
sure	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
known--'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
know	1
now.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
put	1
your	1
foot	1
over	1
that	1
threshold	1
again'--here	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
smile	1
hardened	1
into	1
a	1
grin	1
of	1
rage,	1
and	1
he	1
glared	1
down	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
demon--'I'll	1
throw	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
mastiff.'	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
so	1
terrified	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
did.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
rushed	1
past	1
him	1
into	1
my	1
room.	1
I	1
remember	1
nothing	1
until	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
lying	1
on	1
my	1
bed	1
trembling	1
all	1
over.	1
Then	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
there	1
longer	1
without	1
some	1
advice.	1
I	1
was	1
frightened	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
child.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
horrible	1
to	1
me.	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
bring	1
you	1
down	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well.	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
but	1
my	1
curiosity	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
my	1
fears.	1
My	1
mind	1
was	1
soon	1
made	1
up.	1
I	1
would	1
send	1
you	1
a	1
wire.	1
I	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
hat	1
and	1
cloak,	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
office,	1
which	1
is	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
then	1
returned,	1
feeling	1
very	1
much	1
easier.	1
A	1
horrible	1
doubt	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
as	1
I	1
approached	1
the	1
door	1
lest	1
the	1
dog	1
might	1
be	1
loose,	1
but	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
Toller	1
had	1
drunk	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
insensibility	1
that	1
evening,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
household	1
who	1
had	1
any	1
influence	1
with	1
the	1
savage	1
creature,	1
or	1
who	1
would	1
venture	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
free.	1
I	1
slipped	1
in	1
in	1
safety	1
and	1
lay	1
awake	1
half	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
my	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
seeing	1
you.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
getting	1
leave	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
Winchester	1
this	1
morning,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
back	1
before	1
three	1
o'clock,	1
for	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
are	1
going	1
on	1
a	1
visit,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
evening,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
child.	1
Now	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
adventures,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
all	1
means,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do."	1
	1
Holmes	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
listened	1
spellbound	1
to	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
story.	1
My	1
friend	1
rose	1
now	1
and	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets,	1
and	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
profound	1
gravity	1
upon	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Is	1
Toller	1
still	1
drunk?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes.	1
I	1
heard	1
his	1
wife	1
tell	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
with	1
him."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
well.	1
And	1
the	1
Rucastles	1
go	1
out	1
to-night?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Is	1
there	1
a	1
cellar	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
strong	1
lock?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
wine-cellar."	1
	1
"You	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
acted	1
all	1
through	1
this	1
matter	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
brave	1
and	1
sensible	1
girl,	1
Miss	1
Hunter.	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
perform	1
one	1
more	1
feat?	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
ask	1
it	1
of	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
a	1
quite	1
exceptional	1
woman."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
try.	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches	1
by	1
seven	1
o'clock,	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
I.	1
The	1
Rucastles	1
will	1
be	1
gone	1
by	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
Toller	1
will,	1
we	1
hope,	1
be	1
incapable.	1
There	1
only	1
remains	1
Mrs.	1
Toller,	1
who	1
might	1
give	1
the	1
alarm.	1
If	1
you	1
could	1
send	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
cellar	1
on	1
some	1
errand,	1
and	1
then	1
turn	1
the	1
key	1
upon	1
her,	1
you	1
would	1
facilitate	1
matters	1
immensely."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
it."	1
	1
"Excellent!	1
We	1
shall	1
then	1
look	1
thoroughly	1
into	1
the	1
affair.	1
Of	1
course	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
feasible	1
explanation.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
there	1
to	1
personate	1
someone,	1
and	1
the	1
real	1
person	1
is	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
this	1
chamber.	1
That	1
is	1
obvious.	1
As	1
to	1
who	1
this	1
prisoner	1
is,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
daughter,	1
Miss	1
Alice	1
Rucastle,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
right,	1
who	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
America.	1
You	1
were	1
chosen,	1
doubtless,	1
as	1
resembling	1
her	1
in	1
height,	1
figure,	1
and	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
your	1
hair.	1
Hers	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
off,	1
very	1
possibly	1
in	1
some	1
illness	1
through	1
which	1
she	1
has	1
passed,	1
and	1
so,	1
of	1
course,	1
yours	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
sacrificed	1
also.	1
By	1
a	1
curious	1
chance	1
you	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
tresses.	1
The	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
some	1
friend	1
of	1
hers--possibly	1
her	1
fiancé--and	1
no	1
doubt,	1
as	1
you	1
wore	1
the	1
girl's	1
dress	1
and	1
were	1
so	1
like	1
her,	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
from	1
your	1
laughter,	1
whenever	1
he	1
saw	1
you,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
from	1
your	1
gesture,	1
that	1
Miss	1
Rucastle	1
was	1
perfectly	1
happy,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
desired	1
his	1
attentions.	1
The	1
dog	1
is	1
let	1
loose	1
at	1
night	1
to	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
communicate	1
with	1
her.	1
So	1
much	1
is	1
fairly	1
clear.	1
The	1
most	1
serious	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
child."	1
	1
"What	1
on	1
earth	1
has	1
that	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it?"	1
I	1
ejaculated.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Watson,	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
medical	1
man	1
are	1
continually	1
gaining	1
light	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
tendencies	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
by	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
parents.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
converse	1
is	1
equally	1
valid.	1
I	1
have	1
frequently	1
gained	1
my	1
first	1
real	1
insight	1
into	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
parents	1
by	1
studying	1
their	1
children.	1
This	1
child's	1
disposition	1
is	1
abnormally	1
cruel,	1
merely	1
for	1
cruelty's	1
sake,	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
derives	1
this	1
from	1
his	1
smiling	1
father,	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
suspect,	1
or	1
from	1
his	1
mother,	1
it	1
bodes	1
evil	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
power."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
right,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
cried	1
our	1
client.	1
"A	1
thousand	1
things	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
which	1
make	1
me	1
certain	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
hit	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
let	1
us	1
lose	1
not	1
an	1
instant	1
in	1
bringing	1
help	1
to	1
this	1
poor	1
creature."	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
be	1
circumspect,	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
dealing	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
cunning	1
man.	1
We	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
until	1
seven	1
o'clock.	1
At	1
that	1
hour	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
before	1
we	1
solve	1
the	1
mystery."	1
	1
We	1
were	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
our	1
word,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
seven	1
when	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches,	1
having	1
put	1
up	1
our	1
trap	1
at	1
a	1
wayside	1
public-house.	1
The	1
group	1
of	1
trees,	1
with	1
their	1
dark	1
leaves	1
shining	1
like	1
burnished	1
metal	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
setting	1
sun,	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
house	1
even	1
had	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
not	1
been	1
standing	1
smiling	1
on	1
the	1
door-step.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
managed	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
A	1
loud	1
thudding	1
noise	1
came	1
from	1
somewhere	1
downstairs.	1
"That	1
is	1
Mrs.	1
Toller	1
in	1
the	1
cellar,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Her	1
husband	1
lies	1
snoring	1
on	1
the	1
kitchen	1
rug.	1
Here	1
are	1
his	1
keys,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
duplicates	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle's."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
done	1
well	1
indeed!"	1
cried	1
Holmes	1
with	1
enthusiasm.	1
"Now	1
lead	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
see	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
black	1
business."	1
	1
We	1
passed	1
up	1
the	1
stair,	1
unlocked	1
the	1
door,	1
followed	1
on	1
down	1
a	1
passage,	1
and	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
barricade	1
which	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
had	1
described.	1
Holmes	1
cut	1
the	1
cord	1
and	1
removed	1
the	1
transverse	1
bar.	1
Then	1
he	1
tried	1
the	1
various	1
keys	1
in	1
the	1
lock,	1
but	1
without	1
success.	1
No	1
sound	1
came	1
from	1
within,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
silence	1
Holmes'	1
face	1
clouded	1
over.	1
	1
"I	1
trust	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
too	1
late,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
think,	1
Miss	1
Hunter,	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
in	1
without	1
you.	1
Now,	1
Watson,	1
put	1
your	1
shoulder	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
whether	1
we	1
cannot	1
make	1
our	1
way	1
in."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
rickety	1
door	1
and	1
gave	1
at	1
once	1
before	1
our	1
united	1
strength.	1
Together	1
we	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
empty.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
furniture	1
save	1
a	1
little	1
pallet	1
bed,	1
a	1
small	1
table,	1
and	1
a	1
basketful	1
of	1
linen.	1
The	1
skylight	1
above	1
was	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
prisoner	1
gone.	1
	1
"There	1
has	1
been	1
some	1
villainy	1
here,"	1
said	1
Holmes;	1
"this	1
beauty	1
has	1
guessed	1
Miss	1
Hunter's	1
intentions	1
and	1
has	1
carried	1
his	1
victim	1
off."	1
	1
"But	1
how?"	1
	1
"Through	1
the	1
skylight.	1
We	1
shall	1
soon	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
managed	1
it."	1
He	1
swung	1
himself	1
up	1
onto	1
the	1
roof.	1
"Ah,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"here's	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
light	1
ladder	1
against	1
the	1
eaves.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
he	1
did	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Hunter;	1
"the	1
ladder	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
when	1
the	1
Rucastles	1
went	1
away."	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
done	1
it.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
clever	1
and	1
dangerous	1
man.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
if	1
this	1
were	1
he	1
whose	1
step	1
I	1
hear	1
now	1
upon	1
the	1
stair.	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
your	1
pistol	1
ready."	1
	1
The	1
words	1
were	1
hardly	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
before	1
a	1
man	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
a	1
very	1
fat	1
and	1
burly	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
stick	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
screamed	1
and	1
shrunk	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sprang	1
forward	1
and	1
confronted	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
villain!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"where's	1
your	1
daughter?"	1
	1
The	1
fat	1
man	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
round,	1
and	1
then	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
skylight.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
that,"	1
he	1
shrieked,	1
"you	1
thieves!	1
Spies	1
and	1
thieves!	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
you,	1
have	1
I?	1
You	1
are	1
in	1
my	1
power.	1
I'll	1
serve	1
you!"	1
He	1
turned	1
and	1
clattered	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
go.	1
	1
"He's	1
gone	1
for	1
the	1
dog!"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Hunter.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
my	1
revolver,"	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"Better	1
close	1
the	1
front	1
door,"	1
cried	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
rushed	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
together.	1
We	1
had	1
hardly	1
reached	1
the	1
hall	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
baying	1
of	1
a	1
hound,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
scream	1
of	1
agony,	1
with	1
a	1
horrible	1
worrying	1
sound	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
dreadful	1
to	1
listen	1
to.	1
An	1
elderly	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face	1
and	1
shaking	1
limbs	1
came	1
staggering	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
side	1
door.	1
	1
"My	1
God!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Someone	1
has	1
loosed	1
the	1
dog.	1
It's	1
not	1
been	1
fed	1
for	1
two	1
days.	1
Quick,	1
quick,	1
or	1
it'll	1
be	1
too	1
late!"	1
	1
Holmes	1
and	1
I	1
rushed	1
out	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
with	1
Toller	1
hurrying	1
behind	1
us.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
huge	1
famished	1
brute,	1
its	1
black	1
muzzle	1
buried	1
in	1
Rucastle's	1
throat,	1
while	1
he	1
writhed	1
and	1
screamed	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
Running	1
up,	1
I	1
blew	1
its	1
brains	1
out,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
over	1
with	1
its	1
keen	1
white	1
teeth	1
still	1
meeting	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
creases	1
of	1
his	1
neck.	1
With	1
much	1
labour	1
we	1
separated	1
them	1
and	1
carried	1
him,	1
living	1
but	1
horribly	1
mangled,	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
We	1
laid	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
sofa,	1
and	1
having	1
dispatched	1
the	1
sobered	1
Toller	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
news	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
I	1
did	1
what	1
I	1
could	1
to	1
relieve	1
his	1
pain.	1
We	1
were	1
all	1
assembled	1
round	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
tall,	1
gaunt	1
woman	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Mrs.	1
Toller!"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Hunter.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
miss.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
let	1
me	1
out	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
you.	1
Ah,	1
miss,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
didn't	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
planning,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
pains	1
were	1
wasted."	1
	1
"Ha!"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
looking	1
keenly	1
at	1
her.	1
"It	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Toller	1
knows	1
more	1
about	1
this	1
matter	1
than	1
anyone	1
else."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
I	1
do,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
I	1
know."	1
	1
"Then,	1
pray,	1
sit	1
down,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
it	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
several	1
points	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
dark."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
soon	1
make	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"and	1
I'd	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
before	1
now	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
ha'	1
got	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
cellar.	1
If	1
there's	1
police-court	1
business	1
over	1
this,	1
you'll	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
stood	1
your	1
friend,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
Miss	1
Alice's	1
friend	1
too.	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
never	1
happy	1
at	1
home,	1
Miss	1
Alice	1
wasn't,	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
married	1
again.	1
She	1
was	1
slighted	1
like	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
say	1
in	1
anything,	1
but	1
it	1
never	1
really	1
became	1
bad	1
for	1
her	1
until	1
after	1
she	1
met	1
Mr.	1
Fowler	1
at	1
a	1
friend's	1
house.	1
As	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
learn,	1
Miss	1
Alice	1
had	1
rights	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
by	1
will,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
quiet	1
and	1
patient,	1
she	1
was,	1
that	1
she	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
them	1
but	1
just	1
left	1
everything	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle's	1
hands.	1
He	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
safe	1
with	1
her;	1
but	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
a	1
husband	1
coming	1
forward,	1
who	1
would	1
ask	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
would	1
give	1
him,	1
then	1
her	1
father	1
thought	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
on	1
it.	1
He	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
sign	1
a	1
paper,	1
so	1
that	1
whether	1
she	1
married	1
or	1
not,	1
he	1
could	1
use	1
her	1
money.	1
When	1
she	1
wouldn't	1
do	1
it,	1
he	1
kept	1
on	1
worrying	1
her	1
until	1
she	1
got	1
brain-fever,	1
and	1
for	1
six	1
weeks	1
was	1
at	1
death's	1
door.	1
Then	1
she	1
got	1
better	1
at	1
last,	1
all	1
worn	1
to	1
a	1
shadow,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
hair	1
cut	1
off;	1
but	1
that	1
didn't	1
make	1
no	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
stuck	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
man	1
could	1
be."	1
	1
"Ah,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
makes	1
the	1
matter	1
fairly	1
clear,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
deduce	1
all	1
that	1
remains.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
then,	1
I	1
presume,	1
took	1
to	1
this	1
system	1
of	1
imprisonment?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
"And	1
brought	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
down	1
from	1
London	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
persistence	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Fowler."	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
it,	1
sir."	1
	1
"But	1
Mr.	1
Fowler	1
being	1
a	1
persevering	1
man,	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
seaman	1
should	1
be,	1
blockaded	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
having	1
met	1
you	1
succeeded	1
by	1
certain	1
arguments,	1
metallic	1
or	1
otherwise,	1
in	1
convincing	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
interests	1
were	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
his."	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Fowler	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
kind-spoken,	1
free-handed	1
gentleman,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Toller	1
serenely.	1
	1
"And	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
he	1
managed	1
that	1
your	1
good	1
man	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
drink,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
ladder	1
should	1
be	1
ready	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
your	1
master	1
had	1
gone	1
out."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
it,	1
sir,	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
happened."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
owe	1
you	1
an	1
apology,	1
Mrs.	1
Toller,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"for	1
you	1
have	1
certainly	1
cleared	1
up	1
everything	1
which	1
puzzled	1
us.	1
And	1
here	1
comes	1
the	1
country	1
surgeon	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle,	1
so	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
best	1
escort	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
back	1
to	1
Winchester,	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
our	1
locus	1
standi	1
now	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
questionable	1
one."	1
	1
And	1
thus	1
was	1
solved	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
sinister	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
copper	1
beeches	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
door.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
survived,	1
but	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
broken	1
man,	1
kept	1
alive	1
solely	1
through	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
devoted	1
wife.	1
They	1
still	1
live	1
with	1
their	1
old	1
servants,	1
who	1
probably	1
know	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
Rucastle's	1
past	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
finds	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
them.	1
Mr.	1
Fowler	1
and	1
Miss	1
Rucastle	1
were	1
married,	1
by	1
special	1
license,	1
in	1
Southampton	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
their	1
flight,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
holder	1
of	1
a	1
government	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Mauritius.	1
As	1
to	1
Miss	1
Violet	1
Hunter,	1
my	1
friend	1
Holmes,	1
rather	1
to	1
my	1
disappointment,	1
manifested	1
no	1
further	1
interest	1
in	1
her	1
when	1
once	1
she	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
problems,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
school	1
at	1
Walsall,	1
where	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
met	1
with	1
considerable	1
success.	1

	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
"Well,	1
Prince,	1
so	1
Genoa	1
and	1
Lucca	1
are	1
now	1
just	1
family	1
estates	1
of	1
the	1
Buonapartes.	1
But	1
I	1
warn	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
means	1
war,	1
if	1
you	1
still	1
try	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
infamies	1
and	1
horrors	1
perpetrated	1
by	1
that	1
Antichrist--I	1
really	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
Antichrist--I	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
my	1
friend,	1
no	1
longer	1
my	1
'faithful	1
slave,'	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
yourself!	1
But	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
do?	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
have	1
frightened	1
you--sit	1
down	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
news."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
July,	1
1805,	1
and	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
the	1
well-known	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer,	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
favorite	1
of	1
the	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna.	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
greeted	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
high	1
rank	1
and	1
importance,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
her	1
reception.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
cough	1
for	1
some	1
days.	1
She	1
was,	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
suffering	1
from	1
la	1
grippe;	1
grippe	1
being	1
then	1
a	1
new	1
word	1
in	1
St.	1
Petersburg,	1
used	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
elite.	1
	1
All	1
her	1
invitations	1
without	1
exception,	1
written	1
in	1
French,	1
and	1
delivered	1
by	1
a	1
scarlet-liveried	1
footman	1
that	1
morning,	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do,	1
Count	1
(or	1
Prince),	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
spending	1
an	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
terrible,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
charmed	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
tonight	1
between	1
7	1
and	1
10--Annette	1
Scherer."	1
	1
"Heavens!	1
what	1
a	1
virulent	1
attack!"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
this	1
reception.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
entered,	1
wearing	1
an	1
embroidered	1
court	1
uniform,	1
knee	1
breeches,	1
and	1
shoes,	1
and	1
had	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
serene	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
flat	1
face.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
that	1
refined	1
French	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
grandfathers	1
not	1
only	1
spoke	1
but	1
thought,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
gentle,	1
patronizing	1
intonation	1
natural	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
at	1
court.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
presenting	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
bald,	1
scented,	1
and	1
shining	1
head,	1
and	1
complacently	1
seated	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"First	1
of	1
all,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
are.	1
Set	1
your	1
friend's	1
mind	1
at	1
rest,"	1
said	1
he	1
without	1
altering	1
his	1
tone,	1
beneath	1
the	1
politeness	1
and	1
affected	1
sympathy	1
of	1
which	1
indifference	1
and	1
even	1
irony	1
could	1
be	1
discerned.	1
	1
"Can	1
one	1
be	1
well	1
while	1
suffering	1
morally?	1
Can	1
one	1
be	1
calm	1
in	1
times	1
like	1
these	1
if	1
one	1
has	1
any	1
feeling?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
"You	1
are	1
staying	1
the	1
whole	1
evening,	1
I	1
hope?"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
ambassador's?	1
Today	1
is	1
Wednesday.	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
in	1
an	1
appearance	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"My	1
daughter	1
is	1
coming	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
there."	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
today's	1
fete	1
had	1
been	1
canceled.	1
I	1
confess	1
all	1
these	1
festivities	1
and	1
fireworks	1
are	1
becoming	1
wearisome."	1
	1
"If	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
it,	1
the	1
entertainment	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
off,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
who,	1
like	1
a	1
wound-up	1
clock,	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
said	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
believed.	1
	1
"Don't	1
tease!	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
decided	1
about	1
Novosiltsev's	1
dispatch?	1
You	1
know	1
everything."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
about	1
it?"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
listless	1
tone.	1
"What	1
has	1
been	1
decided?	1
They	1
have	1
decided	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
burnt	1
his	1
boats,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
burn	1
ours."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
always	1
spoke	1
languidly,	1
like	1
an	1
actor	1
repeating	1
a	1
stale	1
part.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
despite	1
her	1
forty	1
years,	1
overflowed	1
with	1
animation	1
and	1
impulsiveness.	1
To	1
be	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
had	1
become	1
her	1
social	1
vocation	1
and,	1
sometimes	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
like	1
it,	1
she	1
became	1
enthusiastic	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
disappoint	1
the	1
expectations	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
her.	1
The	1
subdued	1
smile	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
her	1
faded	1
features,	1
always	1
played	1
round	1
her	1
lips	1
expressed,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
spoiled	1
child,	1
a	1
continual	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
charming	1
defect,	1
which	1
she	1
neither	1
wished,	1
nor	1
could,	1
nor	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary,	1
to	1
correct.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
on	1
political	1
matters	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
burst	1
out:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
Austria.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
things,	1
but	1
Austria	1
never	1
has	1
wished,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wish,	1
for	1
war.	1
She	1
is	1
betraying	1
us!	1
Russia	1
alone	1
must	1
save	1
Europe.	1
Our	1
gracious	1
sovereign	1
recognizes	1
his	1
high	1
vocation	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
it.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
faith	1
in!	1
Our	1
good	1
and	1
wonderful	1
sovereign	1
has	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
noblest	1
role	1
on	1
earth,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
virtuous	1
and	1
noble	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
him.	1
He	1
will	1
fulfill	1
his	1
vocation	1
and	1
crush	1
the	1
hydra	1
of	1
revolution,	1
which	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
this	1
murderer	1
and	1
villain!	1
We	1
alone	1
must	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
one....	1
Whom,	1
I	1
ask	1
you,	1
can	1
we	1
rely	1
on?...	1
England	1
with	1
her	1
commercial	1
spirit	1
will	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
loftiness	1
of	1
soul.	1
She	1
has	1
refused	1
to	1
evacuate	1
Malta.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
find,	1
and	1
still	1
seeks,	1
some	1
secret	1
motive	1
in	1
our	1
actions.	1
What	1
answer	1
did	1
Novosiltsev	1
get?	1
None.	1
The	1
English	1
have	1
not	1
understood	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
self-abnegation	1
of	1
our	1
Emperor	1
who	1
wants	1
nothing	1
for	1
himself,	1
but	1
only	1
desires	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
mankind.	1
And	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
promised?	1
Nothing!	1
And	1
what	1
little	1
they	1
have	1
promised	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
perform!	1
Prussia	1
has	1
always	1
declared	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
is	1
invincible,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
Europe	1
is	1
powerless	1
before	1
him....	1
And	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
Hardenburg	1
says,	1
or	1
Haugwitz	1
either.	1
This	1
famous	1
Prussian	1
neutrality	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
trap.	1
I	1
have	1
faith	1
only	1
in	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
lofty	1
destiny	1
of	1
our	1
adored	1
monarch.	1
He	1
will	1
save	1
Europe!"	1
	1
She	1
suddenly	1
paused,	1
smiling	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
impetuosity.	1
	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"that	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
instead	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
Wintzingerode	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
captured	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia's	1
consent	1
by	1
assault.	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
eloquent.	1
Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea?"	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
moment.	1
A	1
propos,"	1
she	1
added,	1
becoming	1
calm	1
again,	1
"I	1
am	1
expecting	1
two	1
very	1
interesting	1
men	1
tonight,	1
le	1
Vicomte	1
de	1
Mortemart,	1
who	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Montmorencys	1
through	1
the	1
Rohans,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
French	1
families.	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
genuine	1
emigres,	1
the	1
good	1
ones.	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Morio.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
profound	1
thinker?	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Had	1
you	1
heard?"	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
meet	1
them,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"But	1
tell	1
me,"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
studied	1
carelessness	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
visit,	1
"is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
wants	1
Baron	1
Funke	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
first	1
secretary	1
at	1
Vienna?	1
The	1
baron	1
by	1
all	1
accounts	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
creature."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
wished	1
to	1
obtain	1
this	1
post	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
but	1
others	1
were	1
trying	1
through	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
baron.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
almost	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
criticize	1
what	1
the	1
Empress	1
desired	1
or	1
was	1
pleased	1
with.	1
	1
"Baron	1
Funke	1
has	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
by	1
her	1
sister,"	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
mournful	1
tone.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
named	1
the	1
Empress,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
face	1
suddenly	1
assumed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
and	1
sincere	1
devotion	1
and	1
respect	1
mingled	1
with	1
sadness,	1
and	1
this	1
occurred	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
mentioned	1
her	1
illustrious	1
patroness.	1
She	1
added	1
that	1
Her	1
Majesty	1
had	1
deigned	1
to	1
show	1
Baron	1
Funke	1
beaucoup	1
d'estime,	1
and	1
again	1
her	1
face	1
clouded	1
over	1
with	1
sadness.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
indifferent.	1
But,	1
with	1
the	1
womanly	1
and	1
courtierlike	1
quickness	1
and	1
tact	1
habitual	1
to	1
her,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
wished	1
both	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him	1
(for	1
daring	1
to	1
speak	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
Empress)	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
console	1
him,	1
so	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"Now	1
about	1
your	1
family.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
your	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
everyone	1
has	1
been	1
enraptured	1
by	1
her?	1
They	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
amazingly	1
beautiful."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
bowed	1
to	1
signify	1
his	1
respect	1
and	1
gratitude.	1
	1
"I	1
often	1
think,"	1
she	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
smiling	1
amiably	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
political	1
and	1
social	1
topics	1
were	1
ended	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
intimate	1
conversation--"I	1
often	1
think	1
how	1
unfairly	1
sometimes	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
distributed.	1
Why	1
has	1
fate	1
given	1
you	1
two	1
such	1
splendid	1
children?	1
I	1
don't	1
speak	1
of	1
Anatole,	1
your	1
youngest.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
him,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
admitting	1
of	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
and	1
raising	1
her	1
eyebrows.	1
"Two	1
such	1
charming	1
children.	1
And	1
really	1
you	1
appreciate	1
them	1
less	1
than	1
anyone,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
don't	1
deserve	1
to	1
have	1
them."	1
	1
And	1
she	1
smiled	1
her	1
ecstatic	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
help	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"Lavater	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
I	1
lack	1
the	1
bump	1
of	1
paternity."	1
	1
"Don't	1
joke;	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
serious	1
talk	1
with	1
you.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
your	1
younger	1
son?	1
Between	1
ourselves"	1
(and	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
its	1
melancholy	1
expression),	1
"he	1
was	1
mentioned	1
at	1
Her	1
Majesty's	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
pitied...."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
answered	1
nothing,	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
significantly,	1
awaiting	1
a	1
reply.	1
He	1
frowned.	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
me	1
do?"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
did	1
all	1
a	1
father	1
could	1
for	1
their	1
education,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
both	1
turned	1
out	1
fools.	1
Hippolyte	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
quiet	1
fool,	1
but	1
Anatole	1
is	1
an	1
active	1
one.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
difference	1
between	1
them."	1
He	1
said	1
this	1
smiling	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
animated	1
than	1
usual,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
round	1
his	1
mouth	1
very	1
clearly	1
revealed	1
something	1
unexpectedly	1
coarse	1
and	1
unpleasant.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
are	1
children	1
born	1
to	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
you?	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
father	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
I	1
could	1
reproach	1
you	1
with,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
looking	1
up	1
pensively.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
your	1
faithful	1
slave	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
I	1
can	1
confess	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
the	1
bane	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
cross	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
bear.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
myself.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
	1
He	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
expressed	1
his	1
resignation	1
to	1
cruel	1
fate	1
by	1
a	1
gesture.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
meditated.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
marrying	1
your	1
prodigal	1
son	1
Anatole?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"They	1
say	1
old	1
maids	1
have	1
a	1
mania	1
for	1
matchmaking,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
don't	1
feel	1
that	1
weakness	1
in	1
myself	1
as	1
yet,	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
little	1
person	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
unhappy	1
with	1
her	1
father.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
yours,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
Bolkonskaya."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
though,	1
with	1
the	1
quickness	1
of	1
memory	1
and	1
perception	1
befitting	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
indicated	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
this	1
information.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
sad	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
"that	1
Anatole	1
is	1
costing	1
me	1
forty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year?	1
And,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"what	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
five	1
years,	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
like	1
this?"	1
Presently	1
he	1
added:	1
"That's	1
what	1
we	1
fathers	1
have	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with....	1
Is	1
this	1
princess	1
of	1
yours	1
rich?"	1
	1
"Her	1
father	1
is	1
very	1
rich	1
and	1
stingy.	1
He	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
well-known	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
under	1
the	1
late	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
was	1
nicknamed	1
'the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia.'	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
clever	1
but	1
eccentric,	1
and	1
a	1
bore.	1
The	1
poor	1
girl	1
is	1
very	1
unhappy.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
brother;	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
him,	1
he	1
married	1
Lise	1
Meinen	1
lately.	1
He	1
is	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
tonight."	1
	1
"Listen,	1
dear	1
Annette,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
suddenly	1
taking	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
hand	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
drawing	1
it	1
downwards.	1
"Arrange	1
that	1
affair	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
your	1
most	1
devoted	1
slave-slafe	1
with	1
an	1
f,	1
as	1
a	1
village	1
elder	1
of	1
mine	1
writes	1
in	1
his	1
reports.	1
She	1
is	1
rich	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
and	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
want."	1
	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
and	1
easy	1
grace	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
the	1
maid	1
of	1
honor's	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
kissed	1
it,	1
and	1
swung	1
it	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
armchair,	1
looking	1
in	1
another	1
direction.	1
	1
"Attendez,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
reflecting,	1
"I'll	1
speak	1
to	1
Lise,	1
young	1
Bolkonski's	1
wife,	1
this	1
very	1
evening,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
thing	1
can	1
be	1
arranged.	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
your	1
family's	1
behalf	1
that	1
I'll	1
start	1
my	1
apprenticeship	1
as	1
old	1
maid."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room	1
was	1
gradually	1
filling.	1
The	1
highest	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
was	1
assembled	1
there:	1
people	1
differing	1
widely	1
in	1
age	1
and	1
character	1
but	1
alike	1
in	1
the	1
social	1
circle	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
belonged.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
daughter,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene,	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador's	1
entertainment;	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
ball	1
dress	1
and	1
her	1
badge	1
as	1
maid	1
of	1
honor.	1
The	1
youthful	1
little	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
known	1
as	1
la	1
femme	1
la	1
plus	1
seduisante	1
de	1
Petersbourg,	1
*	1
was	1
also	1
there.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
during	1
the	1
previous	1
winter,	1
and	1
being	1
pregnant	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
any	1
large	1
gatherings,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
small	1
receptions.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son,	1
Hippolyte,	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
Mortemart,	1
whom	1
he	1
introduced.	1
The	1
Abbe	1
Morio	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
had	1
also	1
come.	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
most	1
fascinating	1
woman	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
To	1
each	1
new	1
arrival	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
said,	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
my	1
aunt,"	1
or	1
"You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
my	1
aunt?"	1
and	1
very	1
gravely	1
conducted	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
lady,	1
wearing	1
large	1
bows	1
of	1
ribbon	1
in	1
her	1
cap,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
sailing	1
in	1
from	1
another	1
room	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
arrive;	1
and	1
slowly	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
visitor	1
to	1
her	1
aunt,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
mentioned	1
each	1
one's	1
name	1
and	1
then	1
left	1
them.	1
	1
Each	1
visitor	1
performed	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
greeting	1
this	1
old	1
aunt	1
whom	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
knew,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
wanted	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
cared	1
about;	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
observed	1
these	1
greetings	1
with	1
mournful	1
and	1
solemn	1
interest	1
and	1
silent	1
approval.	1
The	1
aunt	1
spoke	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
words,	1
about	1
their	1
health	1
and	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Her	1
Majesty,	1
"who,	1
thank	1
God,	1
was	1
better	1
today."	1
And	1
each	1
visitor,	1
though	1
politeness	1
prevented	1
his	1
showing	1
impatience,	1
left	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
at	1
having	1
performed	1
a	1
vexatious	1
duty	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya	1
had	1
brought	1
some	1
work	1
in	1
a	1
gold-	1
embroidered	1
velvet	1
bag.	1
Her	1
pretty	1
little	1
upper	1
lip,	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
delicate	1
dark	1
down	1
was	1
just	1
perceptible,	1
was	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
her	1
teeth,	1
but	1
it	1
lifted	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
sweetly,	1
and	1
was	1
especially	1
charming	1
when	1
she	1
occasionally	1
drew	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
lower	1
lip.	1
As	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
a	1
thoroughly	1
attractive	1
woman,	1
her	1
defect--the	1
shortness	1
of	1
her	1
upper	1
lip	1
and	1
her	1
half-open	1
mouth--seemed	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
own	1
special	1
and	1
peculiar	1
form	1
of	1
beauty.	1
Everyone	1
brightened	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
pretty	1
young	1
woman,	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
mother,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health,	1
and	1
carrying	1
her	1
burden	1
so	1
lightly.	1
Old	1
men	1
and	1
dull	1
dispirited	1
young	1
ones	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
after	1
being	1
in	1
her	1
company	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
becoming,	1
like	1
her,	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health.	1
All	1
who	1
talked	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
at	1
each	1
word	1
saw	1
her	1
bright	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
constant	1
gleam	1
of	1
her	1
white	1
teeth,	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
amiable	1
mood	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
quick,	1
short,	1
swaying	1
steps,	1
her	1
workbag	1
on	1
her	1
arm,	1
and	1
gaily	1
spreading	1
out	1
her	1
dress	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
near	1
the	1
silver	1
samovar,	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
was	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
around	1
her.	1
"I	1
have	1
brought	1
my	1
work,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
French,	1
displaying	1
her	1
bag	1
and	1
addressing	1
all	1
present.	1
"Mind,	1
Annette,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
played	1
a	1
wicked	1
trick	1
on	1
me,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
hostess.	1
"You	1
wrote	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
small	1
reception,	1
and	1
just	1
see	1
how	1
badly	1
I	1
am	1
dressed."	1
And	1
she	1
spread	1
out	1
her	1
arms	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
short-waisted,	1
lace-trimmed,	1
dainty	1
gray	1
dress,	1
girdled	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
ribbon	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
breast.	1
	1
"Soyez	1
tranquille,	1
Lise,	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
prettier	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,"	1
replied	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"You	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
and	1
still	1
in	1
French,	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
general,	1
"my	1
husband	1
is	1
deserting	1
me?	1
He	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
himself	1
killed.	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
this	1
wretched	1
war	1
is	1
for?"	1
she	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
delightful	1
woman	1
this	1
little	1
princess	1
is!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
arrivals	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
heavily	1
built	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
close-cropped	1
hair,	1
spectacles,	1
the	1
light-colored	1
breeches	1
fashionable	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
ruffle,	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
dress	1
coat.	1
This	1
stout	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
a	1
well-known	1
grandee	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
time	1
who	1
now	1
lay	1
dying	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
entered	1
either	1
the	1
military	1
or	1
civil	1
service,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
appearance	1
in	1
society.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
nod	1
she	1
accorded	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
hierarchy	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
lowest-grade	1
greeting,	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
something	1
too	1
large	1
and	1
unsuited	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
enter.	1
Though	1
he	1
was	1
certainly	1
rather	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
her	1
anxiety	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
clever	1
though	1
shy,	1
but	1
observant	1
and	1
natural,	1
expression	1
which	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
everyone	1
else	1
in	1
that	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
exchanging	1
an	1
alarmed	1
glance	1
with	1
her	1
aunt	1
as	1
she	1
conducted	1
him	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
Pierre	1
murmured	1
something	1
unintelligible,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
something.	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
pleased	1
smile,	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
alarm	1
was	1
justified,	1
for	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
aunt	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
speech	1
about	1
Her	1
Majesty's	1
health.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
dismay	1
detained	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Morio?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
man."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
scheme	1
for	1
perpetual	1
peace,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
hardly	1
feasible."	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
so?"	1
rejoined	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
and	1
get	1
away	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
now	1
committed	1
a	1
reverse	1
act	1
of	1
impoliteness.	1
First	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
lady	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
another	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
away.	1
With	1
his	1
head	1
bent,	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
feet	1
spread	1
apart,	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
his	1
reasons	1
for	1
thinking	1
the	1
abbe's	1
plan	1
chimerical.	1
	1
"We	1
will	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
later,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
And	1
having	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave,	1
she	1
resumed	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
watch,	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
at	1
any	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
conversation	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
flag.	1
As	1
the	1
foreman	1
of	1
a	1
spinning	1
mill,	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
set	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
work,	1
goes	1
round	1
and	1
notices	1
here	1
a	1
spindle	1
that	1
has	1
stopped	1
or	1
there	1
one	1
that	1
creaks	1
or	1
makes	1
more	1
noise	1
than	1
it	1
should,	1
and	1
hastens	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
machine	1
or	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
proper	1
motion,	1
so	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
moved	1
about	1
her	1
drawing	1
room,	1
approaching	1
now	1
a	1
silent,	1
now	1
a	1
too-noisy	1
group,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
slight	1
rearrangement	1
kept	1
the	1
conversational	1
machine	1
in	1
steady,	1
proper,	1
and	1
regular	1
motion.	1
But	1
amid	1
these	1
cares	1
her	1
anxiety	1
about	1
Pierre	1
was	1
evident.	1
She	1
kept	1
an	1
anxious	1
watch	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
group	1
round	1
Mortemart	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
there,	1
and	1
again	1
when	1
he	1
passed	1
to	1
another	1
group	1
whose	1
center	1
was	1
the	1
abbe.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
abroad,	1
and	1
this	1
reception	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
attended	1
in	1
Russia.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
intellectual	1
lights	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
were	1
gathered	1
there	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
a	1
toyshop,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look,	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
any	1
clever	1
conversation	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard.	1
Seeing	1
the	1
self-confident	1
and	1
refined	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
very	1
profound.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Morio.	1
Here	1
the	1
conversation	1
seemed	1
interesting	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
own	1
views,	1
as	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
doing.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
swing.	1
The	1
spindles	1
hummed	1
steadily	1
and	1
ceaselessly	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
With	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
aunt,	1
beside	1
whom	1
sat	1
only	1
one	1
elderly	1
lady,	1
who	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
careworn	1
face	1
was	1
rather	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
this	1
brilliant	1
society,	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
had	1
settled	1
into	1
three	1
groups.	1
One,	1
chiefly	1
masculine,	1
had	1
formed	1
round	1
the	1
abbe.	1
Another,	1
of	1
young	1
people,	1
was	1
grouped	1
round	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
rosy,	1
though	1
rather	1
too	1
plump	1
for	1
her	1
age.	1
The	1
third	1
group	1
was	1
gathered	1
round	1
Mortemart	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
was	1
a	1
nice-looking	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
soft	1
features	1
and	1
polished	1
manners,	1
who	1
evidently	1
considered	1
himself	1
a	1
celebrity	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
politeness	1
modestly	1
placed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
obviously	1
serving	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
treat	1
to	1
her	1
guests.	1
As	1
a	1
clever	1
maitre	1
d'hotel	1
serves	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
specially	1
choice	1
delicacy	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
meat	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
would	1
have	1
cared	1
to	1
eat,	1
so	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
guests,	1
first	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
abbe,	1
as	1
peculiarly	1
choice	1
