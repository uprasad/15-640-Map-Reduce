now	1

he	1
felt	1
that	1

had	1
felt	1
that	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
and	1
whose	1
judgment	1

that	1
all	1
he	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
what	1
words	1
not	1

he	1
was	1
saying	1
he	1
from	1
her	1
standpoint.	1
Princess	1
Mary--reluctantly	1
is	1
cases--began	1
had	1
Prince	1
and	1
her	1
go	1
into	1
details	1
feared	1
recall	1
her	1

sake.	1
and	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
saying	1
he	1
toward	1
her	1
body	1
and	1
listened	1
her	1
so	1
he	1
and	1
softened?	1
With	1
all	1
soul	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
sought	1
one	1
be	1
perfectly	1
good--so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
death.	1
The	1
he	1
he	1
had	1
any--were	1
not	1
he	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
you	1
again,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
and	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
a	1
moment.	1
speak	1
that	1
was	1

he	1
he	1
was	1
wishing	1
very	1
I	1
pressed	1
her	1
hands	1
her	1
and	1
controlling	1
her	1
and	1
speak	1
rapidly.	1
nothing	1
we	1
started	1
from	1
I	1
not	1
dare	1
ask	1
him.	1
suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
traveling	1
I	1
had	1
idea	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
in,	1
all	1
I	1
was	1
and	1
be	1
and	1
not	1
letting	1
them	1
her	1
tell	1
what	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
lived	1
those	1
and	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
he	1
listened	1
he	1
not	1
Prince	1
what	1
was	1
telling.	1
listened	1
her	1
and	1
felt	1
pity	1
what	1
was	1
suffering	1
now	1
was	1
Princess	1

Evidently	1
tell	1
that	1
most	1
details	1
intimate	1

rushed	1
from	1

a	1
moan	1
pain	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
door	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
not	1
understand	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
all	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
from	1
drawing	1
attention	1
her	1
who	1
had	1
At	1
that	1
tenderness	1
young	1
father's,	1
affected	1
Pierre	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
he	1
up	1
quickly,	1
took	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
window.	1
take	1

was	1
calm,	1

had	1
settled	1

undressing	1
he	1
into	1

free	1
from	1

I	1
must	1
do	1
everything	1
that	1
and	1
I	1
be	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
himself.	1
few	1
days	1
previously	1
Pierre	1
had	1
decided	1
go	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
awoke	1
came	1
ask	1
Petersburg?	1
is	1
Petersburg?	1
is	1
Petersburg?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
before	1
I	1
some	1
reason	1
go	1
he	1
"Why?	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
a	1

how	1

Savelich,	1
do	1

"What's	1

just	1
With	1
one	1
what	1
"Supposing	1
I	1

he	1
involuntary	1
I	1
take	1
your	1
excellency,	1
be	1
a	1

he	1
thinks	1
thought	1
how	1
terrible	1
is	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
terrible!"	1
what	1
your	1
Are	1
you	1
starting	1
tomorrow?"	1
asked	1
I'll	1
a	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
later.	1
must	1
trouble	1
I	1
you	1
and	1
smile,	1
he	1
thought:	1
how	1
strange	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
that	1
now	1
is	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
settled	1
all!	1
he	1
knows	1
well	1
and	1
is	1
I	1
a	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
thinks?"	1
Pierre	1
At	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
met--"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
Rostova!"	1
The	1
seemed	1
nothing	1
that	1
than	1
he	1

that	1

you	1
Rostova?"	1

was	1
a	1
pity."	1

not	1
anything	1
her	1

The	1
had	1
provisions	1
they	1
all	1
thought	1
is	1
surprising	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
trouble	1
now	1

all	1
me!"	1
came	1
a	1
representative	1
Palace	1
that	1
be	1
that	1
day.	1
man	1
thought	1
into	1
a	1
officer	1
and	1
how	1
now!	1
they	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
honest	1
and	1
he	1
take	1
bribes?	1
That's	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
and	1
does	1
what	1
a	1
kind,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
he	1
Pierre	1
Princess	1

drove	1
houses	1
that	1
had	1
down,	1
he	1
was	1
those	1

walls	1
burned-out	1
stretching	1
and	1
concealing	1
one	1
another,	1
Rhine	1
and	1
The	1
he	1
and	1
cutting	1
houses	1
women	1
and	1
all	1
cheerful	1
that	1
seemed	1
say:	1
"Ah,	1
he	1
is!	1
what	1
At	1
Princess	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
doubtful	1
he	1
had	1
night	1
before	1
and	1
seen	1
and	1
I	1
imagined	1
it;	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
room	1
before	1
he	1
felt	1
her	1

her	1
was	1

Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
going	1
vespers	1
and	1
Pierre	1
left	1
Next	1
he	1
came	1
early,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1

evidently	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
everything	1
and	1
conversation	1
from	1
one	1
and	1
off.	1
so	1
that	1
Princess	1

evidently	1
he	1
Pierre	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
felt	1
and	1
embarrassed,	1

sat	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
up	1

take	1
Princess	1

this,	1
and	1
complaining	1
