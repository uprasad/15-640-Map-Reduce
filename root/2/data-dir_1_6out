hole	1
of	1
an	1

that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1

	1
28:33	1
And	1
beneath	1
upon	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
it	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
pomegranates	1
of	1
blue,	1
and	1
of	1
purple,	1
and	1
of	1
scarlet,	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
hem	1
thereof;	1
and	1
bells	1
of	1
gold	1
between	1
them	1
round	1
about:	1
28:34	1
A	1
golden	1
bell	1
and	1
a	1
pomegranate,	1
a	1
golden	1
bell	1
and	1
a	1
pomegranate,	1
upon	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

	1
28:35	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
Aaron	1
to	1
minister:	1
and	1
his	1
sound	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
when	1
he	1
goeth	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
out,	1
that	1
he	1
die	1
not.	1
	1
28:36	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
a	1
plate	1
of	1
pure	1
gold,	1
and	1
grave	1
upon	1
it,	1
like	1
the	1
engravings	1
of	1
a	1
signet,	1
HOLINESS	1
TO	1
THE	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:37	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
blue	1
lace,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
mitre;	1
upon	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
mitre	1
it	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
28:38	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
Aaron's	1
forehead,	1
that	1
Aaron	1
may	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
hallow	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
holy	1
gifts;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
always	1
upon	1
his	1
forehead,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:39	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
embroider	1
the	1
coat	1
of	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
the	1
mitre	1
of	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
needlework.	1
	1
28:40	1
And	1
for	1
Aaron's	1
sons	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
coats,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
for	1
them	1
girdles,	1
and	1
bonnets	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
for	1
them,	1
for	1
glory	1
and	1
for	1
beauty.	1
	1
28:41	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother,	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
them,	1
and	1
consecrate	1
them,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
28:42	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
them	1
linen	1
breeches	1
to	1
cover	1
their	1
nakedness;	1
from	1
the	1
loins	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
thighs	1
they	1
shall	1
reach:	1
28:43	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons,	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
or	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
altar	1
to	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place;	1
that	1
they	1
bear	1
not	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
die:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
29:1	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
hallow	1
them,	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1

Take	1
one	1

bullock,	1
and	1
two	1

29:2	1
And	1

and	1
cakes	1
unleavened	1
tempered	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
wafers	1
unleavened	1
anointed	1
with	1
oil:	1
of	1
wheaten	1
flour	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
them.	1
	1
29:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
one	1
basket,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
basket,	1
with	1
the	1
bullock	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
rams.	1
	1
29:4	1
And	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
shalt	1
wash	1
them	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
29:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
garments,	1
and	1
put	1
upon	1
Aaron	1
the	1
coat,	1
and	1
the	1
robe	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1

and	1
the	1
breastplate,	1
and	1
gird	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
the	1
ephod:	1
29:6	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
the	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
holy	1
crown	1
upon	1
the	1
mitre.	1
	1
29:7	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
pour	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
anoint	1
him.	1
	1
29:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
put	1
coats	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
29:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
gird	1
them	1
with	1
girdles,	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
bonnets	1
on	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
shall	1
be	1
theirs	1
for	1
a	1
perpetual	1
statute:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
consecrate	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
29:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cause	1
a	1
bullock	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
put	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bullock.	1
	1
29:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
kill	1
the	1
bullock	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
29:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
with	1
thy	1
finger,	1
and	1
pour	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
beside	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
29:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
covereth	1
the	1
inwards,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
that	1
is	1
above	1
the	1
liver,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
burn	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
29:14	1
But	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
his	1
skin,	1
and	1
his	1
dung,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
burn	1
with	1
fire	1
without	1
the	1
camp:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
29:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
take	1
one	1
ram;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
put	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
ram.	1
	1
29:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
slay	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
his	1
blood,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
29:17	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
the	1
ram	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
wash	1
the	1
inwards	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
legs,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
unto	1
his	1
pieces,	1
and	1
unto	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
29:18	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
burn	1
the	1
whole	1
ram	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:19	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
other	1
ram;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
put	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
ram.	1
	1
29:20	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
kill	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
his	1
blood,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
ear	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
ear	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
thumb	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
toe	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
foot,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
29:21	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
upon	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
his	1

with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
hallowed,	1
and	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
garments	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
29:22	1
Also	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
ram	1
the	1
fat	1
and	1
the	1
rump,	1
and	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
ram	1
of	1
consecration:	1
29:23	1
And	1
one	1
loaf	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
one	1
cake	1
of	1
oiled	1
bread,	1
and	1
one	1

out	1
of	1
the	1
basket	1
of	1
the	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
that	1
is	1

the	1
LORD:	1
29:24	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
sons;	1
and	1
shalt	1
wave	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:25	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
receive	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
burn	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1

before	1
the	1

it	1
is	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:26	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
Aaron's	1
consecration,	1
and	1
wave	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
part.	1
	1
29:27	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sanctify	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
the	1
wave	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
the	1
heave	1
offering,	1
which	1
is	1
waved,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
heaved	1
up,	1
of	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1
consecration,	1
even	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
his	1
sons:	1
29:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
Aaron's	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
heave	1
offering:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
their	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
even	1
their	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:29	1
And	1
the	1
holy	1
garments	1
of	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
sons'	1
after	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
anointed	1
therein,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
consecrated	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
29:30	1
And	1
that	1
son	1
that	1
is	1
priest	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
shall	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
seven	1
days,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
to	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
29:31	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1
consecration,	1
and	1
seethe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
29:32	1
And	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
basket	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
29:33	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
those	1
things	1
wherewith	1
the	1
atonement	1
was	1
made,	1
to	1
consecrate	1
and	1
to	1
sanctify	1
them:	1
but	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
holy.	1
	1
29:34	1
And	1
if	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
consecrations,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
bread,	1
remain	1
unto	1
the	1
morning,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
burn	1
the	1
remainder	1
with	1
fire:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
holy.	1
	1
29:35	1
And	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
seven	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
consecrate	1
them.	1
	1
29:36	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
every	1
day	1
a	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering	1
for	1
atonement:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cleanse	1
the	1
altar,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
it,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
it.	1
	1
29:37	1
Seven	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1

most	1
holy:	1
whatsoever	1
toucheth	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
29:38	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
upon	1
the	1
altar;	1
two	1
lambs	1
of	1
the	1

day	1
by	1
day	1
continually.	1
	1
29:39	1
The	1

lamb	1
thou	1

29:40	1
And	1

lamb	1
a	1

	1
29:41	1
And	1
the	1

lamb	1
thou	1

and	1
according	1

thereof,	1
for	1
a	1

an	1

made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:42	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
continual	1
burnt	1
offering	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
you,	1
to	1
speak	1
there	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
29:43	1
And	1
there	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
shall	1
be	1
sanctified	1
by	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
29:44	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sanctify	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
the	1
altar:	1
I	1
will	1
sanctify	1
also	1
both	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
to	1
minister	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
29:45	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
29:46	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
that	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
I	1

I	1
am	1

	1
30:1	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
an	1
altar	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon:	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
it.	1
	1
30:2	1
A	1
cubit	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
a	1

the	1

	1
30:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
overlay	1
it	1
with	1
pure	1
gold,	1
the	1
top	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1

thereof	1
round	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
thou	1

make	1
unto	1
it	1
a	1

	1
30:4	1
And	1
two	1
golden	1
rings	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
to	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
it,	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
corners	1
thereof,	1
upon	1
the	1
two	1
sides	1
of	1
it	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
places	1
for	1
the	1
staves	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
withal.	1
	1
30:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
the	1
staves	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood,	1
and	1
overlay	1
them	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
vail	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1

before	1
the	1
mercy	1

that	1
is	1
over	1
the	1
testimony,	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
burn	1
thereon	1
sweet	1
incense	1
every	1
morning:	1
when	1
he	1
dresseth	1
the	1
lamps,	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
30:8	1
And	1
when	1
Aaron	1
lighteth	1
the	1
lamps	1
at	1
even,	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
it,	1
a	1
perpetual	1
incense	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
30:9	1
Ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
no	1
strange	1
incense	1
thereon,	1
nor	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
nor	1
meat	1
offering;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
pour	1
drink	1
offering	1
thereon.	1
	1
30:10	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
it	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
year	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
of	1
atonements:	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
shall	1
he	1
make	1
atonement	1
upon	1
it	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
30:12	1
When	1
thou	1
takest	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
after	1
their	1
number,	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
give	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
his	1
soul	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
thou	1
numberest	1
them;	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
plague	1
among	1
them,	1
when	1
thou	1
numberest	1
them.	1
	1
30:13	1
This	1
they	1
shall	1
give,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
numbered,	1
half	1
a	1
shekel	1
after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
(a	1
shekel	1
is	1
twenty	1
gerahs:)	1
an	1
half	1
shekel	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:14	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
numbered,	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
above,	1
shall	1
give	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:15	1
The	1
rich	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
more,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
shekel,	1
when	1
they	1
give	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
atonement	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
shalt	1
appoint	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
memorial	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
30:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
30:18	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
make	1
a	1
laver	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
his	1
foot	1
also	1
of	1
brass,	1
to	1
wash	1
withal:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
it	1
between	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
water	1
therein.	1
	1
30:19	1
For	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
wash	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
their	1
feet	1
thereat:	1
30:20	1
When	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
they	1
shall	1
wash	1
with	1
water,	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
not;	1
or	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
to	1
minister,	1
to	1
burn	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
30:21	1
So	1
they	1
shall	1
wash	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
their	1
feet,	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
not:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
to	1
them,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
30:22	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
30:23	1
Take	1
thou	1
also	1
unto	1
thee	1
principal	1
spices,	1
of	1
pure	1
myrrh	1
five	1
hundred	1
shekels,	1
and	1
of	1
sweet	1
cinnamon	1
half	1
so	1
much,	1
even	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
shekels,	1
and	1
of	1
sweet	1
calamus	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
shekels,	1
30:24	1
And	1
of	1
cassia	1
five	1
hundred	1
shekels,	1
after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
of	1
oil	1
olive	1
an	1
hin:	1
30:25	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
it	1
an	1
oil	1
of	1
holy	1
ointment,	1
an	1
ointment	1
compound	1
after	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
apothecary:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
anointing	1
oil.	1
	1
30:26	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
therewith,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
30:27	1
And	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
the	1
candlestick	1
and	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
incense,	1
30:28	1
And	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
burnt	1
offering	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
the	1
laver	1
and	1
his	1
foot.	1
	1
30:29	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sanctify	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
most	1
holy:	1
whatsoever	1
toucheth	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
30:30	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
consecrate	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
30:31	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
anointing	1
oil	1
unto	1
me	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
30:32	1
Upon	1
man's	1
flesh	1
shall	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
poured,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
any	1
other	1
like	1
it,	1
after	1
the	1
composition	1
of	1
it:	1
it	1
is	1
holy,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
30:33	1
Whosoever	1
compoundeth	1
any	1
like	1
it,	1
or	1
whosoever	1
putteth	1
any	1
of	1
it	1
upon	1
a	1
stranger,	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
30:34	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Take	1
unto	1
thee	1
sweet	1
spices,	1
stacte,	1
and	1
onycha,	1
and	1
galbanum;	1
these	1
sweet	1
spices	1
with	1
pure	1
frankincense:	1
of	1
each	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
like	1
weight:	1
30:35	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
perfume,	1
a	1
confection	1
after	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
apothecary,	1
tempered	1
together,	1
pure	1
and	1
holy:	1
30:36	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beat	1
some	1
of	1
it	1
very	1
small,	1
and	1
put	1
of	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
testimony	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
thee:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
30:37	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
perfume	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
to	1
yourselves	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
composition	1
thereof:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
holy	1
for	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:38	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
make	1
like	1
unto	1
that,	1
to	1
smell	1
thereto,	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
31:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
31:2	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
by	1
name	1
Bezaleel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uri,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hur,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah:	1
31:3	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
in	1
understanding,	1
and	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
workmanship,	1
31:4	1
To	1
devise	1
cunning	1
works,	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
in	1
silver,	1
and	1
in	1

31:5	1
And	1
in	1

of	1
stones,	1
to	1
set	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1

of	1
timber,	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
workmanship.	1
	1
31:6	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
with	1
him	1
Aholiab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahisamach,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Dan:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
wise	1
hearted	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
wisdom,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
make	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee;	1

minister	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office,	1
31:11	1
And	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
sweet	1
incense	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee	1
shall	1
they	1
do.	1
	1
31:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
31:13	1
Speak	1
thou	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Verily	1
my	1
sabbaths	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
doth	1
sanctify	1
you.	1
	1
31:14	1
Ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
sabbath	1
therefore;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
you:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
defileth	1
it	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
any	1
work	1
therein,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
31:15	1
Six	1
days	1
may	1
work	1
be	1
done;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest,	1
holy	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
any	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
31:16	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
sabbath	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations,	1
for	1
a	1
perpetual	1
covenant.	1
	1
31:17	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
in	1
six	1
days	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
rested,	1
and	1
was	1
refreshed.	1
	1
31:18	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
communing	1
with	1
him	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
testimony,	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
written	1
with	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
32:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
that	1
Moses	1
delayed	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mount,	1
the	1
people	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Up,	1
make	1
us	1
gods,	1
which	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
us;	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
Moses,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
we	1
wot	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
32:2	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Break	1
off	1
the	1
golden	1
earrings,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
your	1
wives,	1
of	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
daughters,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
32:3	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
brake	1
off	1
the	1
golden	1
earrings	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
Aaron.	1
	1
32:4	1
And	1
he	1
received	1
them	1
at	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
fashioned	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
graving	1
tool,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
molten	1
calf:	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
These	1
be	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
32:5	1
And	1
when	1
Aaron	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
before	1
it;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
made	1
proclamation,	1
and	1
said,	1
To	1
morrow	1
is	1
a	1
feast	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
brought	1
peace	1
offerings;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
play.	1
	1
32:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go,	1
get	1
thee	1
down;	1
for	1
thy	1
people,	1
which	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
have	1
corrupted	1
themselves:	1
32:8	1
They	1
have	1
turned	1
aside	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
molten	1
calf,	1
and	1
have	1
worshipped	1
it,	1
and	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
thereunto,	1
and	1
said,	1
These	1
be	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
which	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
32:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
people,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people:	1
32:10	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
me	1
alone,	1
that	1
my	1
wrath	1
may	1
wax	1
hot	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
consume	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
nation.	1
	1
32:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
besought	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
why	1
doth	1
thy	1
wrath	1
wax	1
hot	1
against	1
thy	1
people,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
great	1
power,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand?	1
32:12	1
Wherefore	1
should	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
speak,	1
and	1
say,	1
For	1
mischief	1
did	1
he	1
bring	1
them	1
out,	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
to	1
consume	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
Turn	1
from	1
thy	1
fierce	1
wrath,	1
and	1
repent	1
of	1
this	1
evil	1
against	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
32:13	1
Remember	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Israel,	1
thy	1
servants,	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
swarest	1
by	1
thine	1
own	1
self,	1
and	1
saidst	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
your	1
seed	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
your	1
seed,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
inherit	1
it	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
32:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
32:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
turned,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
the	1
tables	1
were	1
written	1
on	1
both	1
their	1
sides;	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
were	1
they	1
written.	1
	1
32:16	1
And	1
the	1
tables	1
were	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
the	1
writing	1
of	1
God,	1
graven	1
upon	1
the	1
tables.	1
	1
32:17	1
And	1
when	1
Joshua	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
they	1
shouted,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
war	1
in	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
32:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
shout	1
for	1
mastery,	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
cry	1
for	1
being	1
overcome:	1
but	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sing	1
do	1
I	1
hear.	1
	1
32:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
camp,	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
calf,	1
and	1
the	1
dancing:	1
and	1
Moses'	1
anger	1
waxed	1
hot,	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
the	1
tables	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
brake	1
them	1
beneath	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
32:20	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
calf	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
ground	1
it	1
to	1
powder,	1
and	1
strawed	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
drink	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
32:21	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
What	1
did	1
this	1
people	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
sin	1
upon	1
them?	1
	1
32:22	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
wax	1
hot:	1
thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
mischief.	1
	1
32:23	1
For	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Make	1
us	1
gods,	1
which	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
us:	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
Moses,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
we	1
wot	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
32:24	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
hath	1
any	1
gold,	1
let	1
them	1
break	1
it	1
off.	1
So	1
they	1
gave	1
it	1
me:	1
then	1
I	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
this	1
calf.	1
	1
32:25	1
And	1
when	1
Moses	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
naked;	1
(for	1
Aaron	1
had	1
made	1
them	1
naked	1
unto	1
their	1
shame	1
among	1
their	1
enemies:)	1
32:26	1
Then	1
Moses	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
LORD's	1
side?	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
32:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Put	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sword	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
from	1
gate	1
to	1
gate	1
throughout	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
slay	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
companion,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
32:28	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Levi	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses:	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
day	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
32:29	1
For	1
Moses	1
had	1
said,	1
Consecrate	1
yourselves	1
today	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
every	1
man	1
upon	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
brother;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
bestow	1
upon	1
you	1
a	1
blessing	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
32:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
have	1
sinned	1
a	1
great	1
sin:	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
peradventure	1
I	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
your	1
sin.	1
	1
32:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
Oh,	1
this	1
people	1
have	1
sinned	1
a	1
great	1
sin,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
gods	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
32:32	1
Yet	1
now,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
forgive	1
their	1
sin--;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
blot	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
book	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
written.	1
	1
32:33	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Whosoever	1
hath	1
sinned	1
against	1
me,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
blot	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
book.	1
	1
32:34	1
Therefore	1
now	1
go,	1
lead	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thee:	1
behold,	1
mine	1
Angel	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
thee:	1
nevertheless	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
visit	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
their	1
sin	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
32:35	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
plagued	1
the	1
people,	1
because	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
calf,	1
which	1
Aaron	1
made.	1
	1
33:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Depart,	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
hence,	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
saying,	1
Unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it:	1
33:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
an	1
angel	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzite,	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusite:	1
33:3	1
Unto	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people:	1
lest	1
I	1
consume	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
33:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
these	1
evil	1
tidings,	1
they	1
mourned:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
did	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
his	1
ornaments.	1
	1
33:5	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Ye	1
are	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people:	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
consume	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
now	1
put	1
off	1
thy	1
ornaments	1
from	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
33:6	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
stripped	1
themselves	1
of	1
their	1
ornaments	1
by	1
the	1
mount	1
Horeb.	1
	1
33:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
pitched	1
it	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
afar	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
Tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
which	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
which	1
was	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
33:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Moses	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
stood	1
every	1
man	1
at	1
his	1
tent	1
door,	1
and	1
looked	1
after	1
Moses,	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
33:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Moses	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
the	1
cloudy	1
pillar	1
descended,	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
talked	1
with	1
Moses.	1
	1
33:10	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
the	1
cloudy	1
pillar	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
door:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
worshipped,	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
tent	1
door.	1
	1
33:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
his	1
friend.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
camp:	1
but	1
his	1
servant	1
Joshua,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
departed	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
33:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
See,	1
thou	1
sayest	1
unto	1
me,	1
Bring	1
up	1
this	1
people:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
whom	1
thou	1
wilt	1
send	1
with	1
me.	1
Yet	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
also	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
33:13	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
shew	1
me	1
now	1
thy	1
way,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight:	1
and	1
consider	1
that	1
this	1
nation	1
is	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
33:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
My	1
presence	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
rest.	1
	1
33:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thy	1
presence	1
go	1
not	1
with	1
me,	1
carry	1
us	1
not	1
up	1
hence.	1
	1
33:16	1
For	1
wherein	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
here	1
that	1
I	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
goest	1
with	1
us?	1
so	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
separated,	1
I	1
and	1
thy	1
people,	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
33:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
also	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
by	1
name.	1
	1
33:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
shew	1
me	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
33:19	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
all	1
my	1
goodness	1
pass	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
proclaim	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
gracious,	1
and	1
will	1
shew	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
mercy.	1
	1
33:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
see	1
me,	1
and	1
live.	1
	1
33:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
place	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stand	1
upon	1
a	1
rock:	1
33:22	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
my	1
glory	1
passeth	1
by,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
clift	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
will	1
cover	1
thee	1
with	1
my	1
hand	1
while	1
I	1
pass	1
by:	1
33:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
mine	1
hand,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
my	1
back	1
parts:	1
but	1
my	1
face	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
34:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Hew	1
thee	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
first:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
upon	1
these	1
tables	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
tables,	1
which	1
thou	1
brakest.	1
	1
34:2	1
And	1
be	1
ready	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
present	1
thyself	1
there	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
34:3	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
with	1
thee,	1
neither	1
let	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
seen	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
mount;	1
neither	1
let	1
the	1
flocks	1
nor	1
herds	1
feed	1
before	1
that	1
mount.	1
	1
34:4	1
And	1
he	1
hewed	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
first;	1
and	1
Moses	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone.	1
	1
34:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
descended	1
in	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
him	1
there,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
34:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
passed	1
by	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
proclaimed,	1
The	1
LORD,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God,	1
merciful	1
and	1
gracious,	1
longsuffering,	1
and	1
abundant	1
in	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth,	1
34:7	1
Keeping	1
mercy	1
for	1
thousands,	1
forgiving	1
iniquity	1
and	1
transgression	1
and	1
sin,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
clear	1
the	1
guilty;	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
upon	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
children's	1
children,	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation.	1
	1
34:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
toward	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
worshipped.	1
	1
34:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
let	1
my	1
LORD,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
go	1
among	1
us;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people;	1
and	1
pardon	1
our	1
iniquity	1
and	1
our	1
sin,	1
and	1
take	1
us	1
for	1
thine	1
inheritance.	1
	1
34:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
covenant:	1
before	1
all	1
thy	1
people	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
marvels,	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
nor	1
in	1
any	1
nation:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
among	1
which	1
thou	1
art	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
34:11	1
Observe	1
thou	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day:	1
behold,	1
I	1
drive	1
out	1
before	1
thee	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
34:12	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself,	1
lest	1
thou	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest,	1
lest	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
snare	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
34:13	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
destroy	1
their	1
altars,	1
break	1
their	1
images,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
their	1
groves:	1
34:14	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
worship	1
no	1
other	1
god:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
Jealous,	1
is	1
a	1
jealous	1
God:	1
34:15	1
Lest	1
thou	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
one	1
call	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
sacrifice;	1
34:16	1
And	1
thou	1
take	1
of	1
their	1
daughters	1
unto	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
sons	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
their	1
gods.	1
	1
34:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
thee	1
no	1
molten	1
gods.	1
	1
34:18	1
The	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
shalt	1
thou	1
keep.	1
Seven	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Abib:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Abib	1
thou	1
camest	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt.	1
	1
34:19	1
All	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix	1
is	1
mine;	1
and	1
every	1
firstling	1
among	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
whether	1
ox	1
or	1
sheep,	1
that	1
is	1
male.	1
	1
34:20	1
But	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
an	1
ass	1
thou	1
shalt	1
redeem	1
with	1
a	1
lamb:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
redeem	1
him	1
not,	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
break	1
his	1
neck.	1
All	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
thou	1
shalt	1
redeem.	1
And	1
none	1
shall	1
appear	1
before	1
me	1
empty.	1
	1
34:21	1
Six	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
work,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest:	1
in	1
earing	1
time	1
and	1
in	1
harvest	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest.	1
	1
34:22	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
observe	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
weeks,	1
of	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
wheat	1
harvest,	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
ingathering	1
at	1
the	1
year's	1
end.	1
	1
34:23	1
Thrice	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
shall	1
all	1
your	1
menchildren	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
34:24	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
nations	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
enlarge	1
thy	1
borders:	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
desire	1
thy	1
land,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
thrice	1
in	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
34:25	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
offer	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
leaven;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover	1
be	1
left	1
unto	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
34:26	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
seethe	1
a	1
kid	1
in	1
his	1
mother's	1
milk.	1
	1
34:27	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Write	1
thou	1
these	1
words:	1
for	1
after	1
the	1
tenor	1
of	1
these	1
words	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee	1
and	1
with	1
Israel.	1
	1
34:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights;	1
he	1
did	1
neither	1
eat	1
bread,	1
nor	1
drink	1
water.	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
upon	1
the	1
tables	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
the	1
ten	1
commandments.	1
	1
34:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Moses	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
testimony	1
in	1
Moses'	1
hand,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount,	1
that	1
Moses	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
shone	1
while	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
34:30	1
And	1
when	1
Aaron	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
Moses,	1
behold,	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
shone;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
to	1
come	1
nigh	1
him.	1
	1
34:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
returned	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
Moses	1
talked	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
34:32	1
And	1
afterward	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
nigh:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
in	1
commandment	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai.	1
	1
34:33	1
And	1
till	1
Moses	1
had	1
done	1
speaking	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
vail	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
34:34	1
But	1
when	1
Moses	1
went	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
vail	1
off,	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
out.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
commanded.	1
	1
34:35	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Moses,	1
that	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
Moses'	1
face	1
shone:	1
and	1
Moses	1
put	1
the	1
vail	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
again,	1
until	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
35:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
together,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
35:2	1
Six	1
days	1
shall	1
work	1
be	1
done,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
an	1
holy	1
day,	1
a	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
work	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
35:3	1
Ye	1
shall	1
kindle	1
no	1
fire	1
throughout	1
your	1
habitations	1
upon	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
35:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
35:5	1
Take	1
ye	1

LORD:	1
whosoever	1

	1
35:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
See,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
by	1
name	1
Bezaleel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uri,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hur,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah;	1
35:31	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
wisdom,	1
in	1
understanding,	1
and	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
workmanship;	1
35:32	1
And	1
to	1
devise	1
curious	1
works,	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
in	1
silver,	1
and	1
in	1
brass,	1
35:33	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
cutting	1
of	1
stones,	1
to	1
set	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
carving	1
of	1
wood,	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
cunning	1
work.	1
	1
35:34	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
teach,	1
both	1
he,	1
and	1
Aholiab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahisamach,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Dan.	1
	1
35:35	1
Them	1
hath	1
he	1
filled	1
with	1
wisdom	1
of	1
heart,	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
work,	1
of	1
the	1
engraver,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
cunning	1
workman,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
embroiderer,	1
in	1
blue,	1
and	1
in	1
purple,	1
in	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
weaver,	1
even	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
any	1
work,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
devise	1
cunning	1
work.	1
	1
36:1	1
Then	1
wrought	1
Bezaleel	1
and	1
Aholiab,	1
and	1
every	1
wise	1
hearted	1
man,	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded.	1
	1
36:2	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
Bezaleel	1
and	1
Aholiab,	1
and	1
every	1
wise	1
hearted	1
man,	1
in	1
whose	1
heart	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
put	1
wisdom,	1
even	1
every	1
one	1
whose	1
heart	1
stirred	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
it:	1
36:3	1
And	1
they	1
received	1
of	1
Moses	1
all	1
the	1
offering,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
brought	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
withal.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
yet	1
unto	1
him	1
free	1
offerings	1
every	1
morning.	1
	1
36:4	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
that	1
wrought	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
came	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
they	1
made;	1
36:5	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
The	1
people	1
bring	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
to	1
make.	1
	1
36:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
gave	1
commandment,	1
and	1
they	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
proclaimed	1
throughout	1
the	1
camp,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
woman	1
make	1
any	1
more	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
restrained	1
from	1
bringing.	1
	1
36:7	1
For	1
the	1
stuff	1
they	1
had	1
was	1
sufficient	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
make	1
it,	1
and	1
too	1
much.	1
	1
36:8	1
And	1
every	1
wise	1
hearted	1
man	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
wrought	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1

and	1
the	1
other	1
five	1

he	1
coupled	1
one	1

	1
36:11	1
And	1
he	1
made	1

on	1
the	1

of	1
one	1

from	1
the	1

36:12	1
Fifty	1

second:	1
the	1
loops	1
held	1
one	1
curtain	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
36:13	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
fifty	1
taches	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
coupled	1
the	1
curtains	1
one	1
unto	1
another	1
with	1
the	1
taches:	1
so	1
it	1
became	1
one	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
36:14	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
curtains	1
of	1
goats'	1
hair	1
for	1
the	1

And	1

	1
39:1	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
they	1
made	1
cloths	1
of	1
service,	1
to	1
do	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
holy	1
garments	1
for	1
Aaron;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1

	1
39:2	1
And	1
he	1

and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
fine	1
twined	1
linen.	1
	1
39:3	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
beat	1
the	1
gold	1
into	1
thin	1
plates,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
into	1
wires,	1
to	1

and	1
in	1
the	1
fine	1
linen,	1
with	1
cunning	1
work.	1
	1
39:4	1
They	1
made	1
shoulderpieces	1
for	1
it,	1
to	1
couple	1
it	1
together:	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
edges	1
was	1
it	1
coupled	1
together.	1
	1
39:5	1
And	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
his	1
ephod,	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
it,	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
thereof;	1
of	1
gold,	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
fine	1
twined	1
linen;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:6	1
And	1
they	1
wrought	1
onyx	1
stones	1
inclosed	1
in	1
ouches	1
of	1
gold,	1
graven,	1
as	1
signets	1
are	1
graven,	1
with	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
39:7	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
stones	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:8	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
cunning	1
work,	1
like	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
ephod;	1
of	1
gold,	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
fine	1
twined	1
linen.	1
	1
39:9	1
It	1
was	1
foursquare;	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
breastplate	1
double:	1
a	1
span	1
was	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
a	1
span	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof,	1
being	1
doubled.	1
	1
39:10	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
in	1
it	1
four	1
rows	1
of	1
stones:	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
was	1
a	1
sardius,	1
a	1
topaz,	1
and	1
a	1
carbuncle:	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
row.	1
	1
39:11	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
row,	1
an	1
emerald,	1
a	1
sapphire,	1
and	1
a	1
diamond.	1
	1
39:12	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
row,	1
a	1
ligure,	1
an	1
agate,	1
and	1
an	1
amethyst.	1
	1
39:13	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
row,	1
a	1
beryl,	1
an	1
onyx,	1
and	1
a	1
jasper:	1
they	1
were	1
inclosed	1
in	1
ouches	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
their	1
inclosings.	1
	1
39:14	1
And	1
the	1
stones	1
were	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
twelve,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
names,	1
like	1
the	1
engravings	1
of	1
a	1
signet,	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
name,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes.	1
	1
39:15	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
breastplate	1
chains	1
at	1
the	1
ends,	1
of	1
wreathen	1
work	1
of	1
pure	1
gold.	1
	1
39:16	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
two	1
ouches	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
two	1
gold	1
rings;	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
two	1
rings	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
breastplate.	1
	1
39:17	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
the	1
two	1
wreathen	1
chains	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
rings	1
on	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
breastplate.	1
	1
39:18	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
wreathen	1
chains	1
they	1
fastened	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
ouches,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
shoulderpieces	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
39:19	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
two	1
rings	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
breastplate,	1
upon	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ephod	1
inward.	1
	1
39:20	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
two	1
other	1
golden	1
rings,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ephod	1
underneath,	1
toward	1
the	1
forepart	1
of	1
it,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
coupling	1
thereof,	1
above	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
the	1
ephod.	1
	1
39:21	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
bind	1
the	1
breastplate	1
by	1
his	1
rings	1
unto	1
the	1
rings	1
of	1
the	1
ephod	1
with	1
a	1
lace	1
of	1
blue,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
above	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
breastplate	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
loosed	1
from	1
the	1
ephod;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:22	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
robe	1
of	1
the	1
ephod	1
of	1
woven	1
work,	1
all	1
of	1
blue.	1
	1
39:23	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
robe,	1
as	1
the	1
hole	1
of	1
an	1
habergeon,	1
with	1
a	1
band	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
hole,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
rend.	1
	1
39:24	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
hems	1
of	1
the	1
robe	1
pomegranates	1
of	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
twined	1
linen.	1
	1
39:25	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
bells	1
of	1
pure	1
gold,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
bells	1
between	1
the	1
pomegranates	1
upon	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
the	1
robe,	1
round	1
about	1
between	1
the	1
pomegranates;	1
39:26	1
A	1
bell	1
and	1
a	1
pomegranate,	1
a	1
bell	1
and	1
a	1
pomegranate,	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
the	1
robe	1
to	1
minister	1
in;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:27	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
coats	1
of	1
fine	1
linen	1
of	1
woven	1
work	1
for	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
sons,	1
39:28	1
And	1
a	1
mitre	1
of	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
goodly	1
bonnets	1
of	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
linen	1
breeches	1
of	1
fine	1
twined	1
linen,	1
39:29	1
And	1
a	1
girdle	1
of	1
fine	1
twined	1
linen,	1
and	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
of	1
needlework;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:30	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
plate	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
crown	1
of	1
pure	1
gold,	1
and	1
wrote	1
upon	1
it	1
a	1
writing,	1
like	1
to	1
the	1
engravings	1
of	1
a	1
signet,	1
HOLINESS	1
TO	1
THE	1
LORD.	1
	1
39:31	1
And	1
they	1
tied	1
unto	1
it	1
a	1
lace	1
of	1
blue,	1
to	1
fasten	1
it	1
on	1
high	1
upon	1
the	1
mitre;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:32	1
Thus	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
finished:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
did	1
they.	1
	1
39:33	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
furniture,	1
his	1
taches,	1
his	1
boards,	1
his	1
bars,	1
and	1
his	1
pillars,	1
and	1
his	1
sockets,	1
39:34	1
And	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
rams'	1
skins	1
dyed	1
red,	1
and	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
badgers'	1

According	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
39:43	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
look	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
work,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded,	1
even	1
so	1
had	1
they	1
done	1
it:	1
and	1
Moses	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
40:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
40:2	1
On	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
shalt	1
thou	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
40:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
therein	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
and	1
cover	1
the	1
ark	1
with	1
the	1
vail.	1
	1
40:4	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
candlestick,	1
and	1
light	1
the	1
lamps	1
thereof.	1
	1
40:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
gold	1
for	1
the	1
incense	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
hanging	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
40:6	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
40:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
the	1
laver	1
between	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
shalt	1
put	1
water	1
therein.	1
	1
40:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
court	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
hang	1
up	1
the	1
hanging	1
at	1
the	1
court	1
gate.	1
	1
40:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
anoint	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
and	1
shalt	1
hallow	1
it,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
thereof:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
40:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
the	1
altar:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
altar	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
40:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
the	1
laver	1
and	1
his	1
foot,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
it.	1
	1
40:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
wash	1
them	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
40:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
upon	1
Aaron	1
the	1
holy	1
garments,	1
and	1
anoint	1
him,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
him;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
40:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
clothe	1
them	1
with	1
coats:	1
40:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
them,	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
anoint	1
their	1
father,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office:	1
for	1
their	1
anointing	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
an	1
everlasting	1
priesthood	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
40:16	1
Thus	1
did	1
Moses:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him,	1
so	1
did	1
he.	1
	1
40:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
was	1
reared	1
up.	1
	1
40:18	1
And	1
Moses	1
reared	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
fastened	1
his	1
sockets,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
boards	1
thereof,	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
bars	1
thereof,	1
and	1
reared	1
up	1
his	1
pillars.	1
	1
40:19	1
And	1
he	1
spread	1
abroad	1
the	1
tent	1
over	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
above	1
upon	1
it;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:20	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
testimony	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
staves	1
on	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
above	1
upon	1
the	1
ark:	1
40:21	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
ark	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
vail	1
of	1
the	1
covering,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:22	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
upon	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
northward,	1
without	1
the	1
vail.	1
	1
40:23	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
bread	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:24	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
candlestick	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
table,	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
southward.	1
	1
40:25	1
And	1
he	1
lighted	1
the	1
lamps	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:26	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
the	1
vail:	1
40:27	1
And	1
he	1
burnt	1
sweet	1
incense	1
thereon;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:28	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
hanging	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
40:29	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
burnt	1
offering	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
offered	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
meat	1
offering;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:30	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
laver	1
between	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
put	1
water	1
there,	1
to	1
wash	1
withal.	1
	1
40:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
washed	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
their	1
feet	1
thereat:	1
40:32	1
When	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
altar,	1
they	1
washed;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:33	1
And	1
he	1
reared	1
up	1
the	1
court	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
hanging	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
gate.	1
So	1
Moses	1
finished	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
40:34	1
Then	1
a	1
cloud	1
covered	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
filled	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
40:35	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
because	1
the	1
cloud	1
abode	1
thereon,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
filled	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
40:36	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
over	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
onward	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
journeys:	1
40:37	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
cloud	1
were	1
not	1
taken	1
up,	1
then	1
they	1
journeyed	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
taken	1
up.	1
	1
40:38	1
For	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
fire	1
was	1
on	1
it	1
by	1
night,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
throughout	1
all	1
their	1
journeys.	1

The	1
Third	1
Book	1
of	1
Moses:	1
	1
Called	1
Leviticus	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
of	1
you	1
bring	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
your	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
cattle,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
herd,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
1:3	1
If	1
his	1
offering	1
be	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
herd,	1
let	1
him	1
offer	1
a	1
male	1
without	1
blemish:	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
it	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
voluntary	1
will	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
accepted	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
atonement	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
kill	1
the	1
bullock	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
Aaron's	1
sons,	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
the	1
blood	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
flay	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
pieces.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
put	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
wood	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
the	1
fire:	1
1:8	1
And	1
the	1
priests,	1
Aaron's	1
sons,	1
shall	1
lay	1
the	1
parts,	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
fat,	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
the	1
wood	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
1:9	1
But	1
his	1
inwards	1
and	1
his	1
legs	1
shall	1
he	1
wash	1
in	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
burn	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
altar,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
if	1
his	1
offering	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
flocks,	1
namely,	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
goats,	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice;	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
it	1
a	1
male	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
kill	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
northward	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1

Aaron's	1

shall	1
sprinkle	1
his	1
blood	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
cut	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
pieces,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1

in	1

on	1
the	1
wood	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1

1:13	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
wash	1
the	1
inwards	1
and	1
the	1
legs	1
with	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
bring	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
burn	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
an	1

	1
1:14	1
And	1

And	1
that	1
which	1

No	1

	1
2:12	1
As	1

And	1
every	1

And	1
thou	1

	1
2:16	1
And	1

	1
5:10	1
And	1
he	1

offer	1
the	1

	1
5:11	1
But	1

the	1
tenth	1

an	1

	1
5:12	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
the	1

fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
touching	1
his	1
sin	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
sinned	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
these,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's,	1
as	1
a	1
meat	1
offering.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
5:15	1
If	1
a	1
soul	1
commit	1
a	1
trespass,	1
and	1
sin	1
through	1
ignorance,	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1

of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
then	1
he	1

bring	1
for	1
his	1
trespass	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
ram	1
without	1

by	1
shekels	1
of	1

after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
the	1
harm	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
thing,	1
and	1
shall	1
add	1
the	1
fifth	1

thereto,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1

for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1

	1
5:17	1
And	1

the	1
flock,	1
with	1
thy	1
estimation,	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering,	1
unto	1
the	1
priest:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him	1
concerning	1
his	1
ignorance	1
wherein	1
he	1
erred	1
and	1
wist	1
it	1
not,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
5:19	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
he	1
hath	1
certainly	1
trespassed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:2	1
If	1
a	1
soul	1
sin,	1
and	1
commit	1
a	1
trespass	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
lie	1
unto	1
his	1
neighbour	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
keep,	1
or	1
in	1
fellowship,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
thing	1
taken	1
away	1
by	1
violence,	1
or	1
hath	1
deceived	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
6:3	1
Or	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
lieth	1
concerning	1
it,	1
and	1
sweareth	1
falsely;	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
doeth,	1
sinning	1
therein:	1
6:4	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
sinned,	1
and	1
is	1
guilty,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
restore	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
violently	1
away,	1
or	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
deceitfully	1
gotten,	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
keep,	1
or	1
the	1
lost	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
found,	1
6:5	1
Or	1
all	1
that	1
about	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
sworn	1
falsely;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
restore	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
principal,	1
and	1
shall	1
add	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
more	1
thereto,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
appertaineth,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
his	1
trespass	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
a	1
ram	1
without	1
blemish	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
with	1
thy	1
estimation,	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering,	1
unto	1
the	1
priest:	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him	1
for	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
in	1
trespassing	1
therein.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:9	1
Command	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
all	1
night	1
unto	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
burning	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
linen	1
garment,	1
and	1
his	1
linen	1
breeches	1
shall	1
he	1
put	1
upon	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
ashes	1
which	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
consumed	1
with	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
on	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
them	1
beside	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
off	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
other	1
garments,	1
and	1
carry	1
forth	1
the	1
ashes	1
without	1
the	1
camp	1
unto	1
a	1
clean	1
place.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
burning	1
in	1
it;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
out:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
burn	1
wood	1
on	1
it	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
thereon	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
6:13	1
The	1
fire	1
shall	1
ever	1
be	1
burning	1
upon	1
the	1
altar;	1
it	1
shall	1
never	1
go	1
out.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1
offering:	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
offer	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
before	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
it	1
his	1
handful,	1
of	1
the	1
flour	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
oil	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
frankincense	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
shall	1
burn	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
even	1
the	1
memorial	1
of	1
it,	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
the	1
remainder	1
thereof	1
shall	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
eat:	1
with	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
eaten	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place;	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
6:17	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
baken	1
with	1
leaven.	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
portion	1
of	1
my	1
offerings	1
made	1
by	1
fire;	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
6:18	1
All	1
the	1
males	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
generations	1
concerning	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
toucheth	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:20	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
Aaron	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
anointed;	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
fine	1
flour	1
for	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
perpetual,	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
half	1
thereof	1
at	1
night.	1
	1
6:21	1
In	1
a	1
pan	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
with	1
oil;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
baken,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
it	1
in:	1
and	1
the	1
baken	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
shalt	1
thou	1
offer	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:22	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
that	1
is	1
anointed	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
shall	1
offer	1
it:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
wholly	1
burnt.	1
	1
6:23	1
For	1
every	1
meat	1
offering	1
for	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
be	1
wholly	1
burnt:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:25	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering:	1
In	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
is	1
killed	1
shall	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
be	1
killed	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
6:26	1
The	1
priest	1
that	1
offereth	1
it	1
for	1
sin	1
shall	1
eat	1
it:	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
eaten,	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
6:27	1
Whatsoever	1
shall	1
touch	1
the	1
flesh	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
holy:	1
and	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
sprinkled	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof	1
upon	1
any	1
garment,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
wash	1
that	1
whereon	1
it	1
was	1
sprinkled	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
6:28	1
But	1
the	1
earthen	1
vessel	1
wherein	1
it	1
is	1
sodden	1
shall	1
be	1
broken:	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
sodden	1
in	1
a	1
brasen	1
pot,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
both	1
scoured,	1
and	1
rinsed	1
in	1
water.	1
	1
6:29	1
All	1
the	1
males	1
among	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
eat	1
thereof:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
no	1
sin	1
offering,	1
whereof	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
to	1
reconcile	1
withal	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
7:1	1
Likewise	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
7:2	1
In	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
kill	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
shall	1
they	1
kill	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof	1
shall	1
he	1
sprinkle	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
fat	1
thereof;	1
the	1
rump,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
covereth	1
the	1
inwards,	1
7:4	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
them,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
flanks,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
that	1
is	1
above	1
the	1
liver,	1
with	1
the	1
kidneys,	1
it	1
shall	1
he	1
take	1
away:	1
7:5	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
burn	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
7:6	1
Every	1
male	1
among	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
eat	1
thereof:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
7:7	1
As	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
is,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
law	1
for	1
them:	1
the	1
priest	1
that	1
maketh	1
atonement	1
therewith	1
shall	1
have	1
it.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
that	1
offereth	1
any	1
man's	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
even	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
offered.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
that	1
is	1
baken	1
in	1
the	1
oven,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
fryingpan,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
pan,	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's	1
that	1
offereth	1
it.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
every	1
meat	1
offering,	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
dry,	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
have,	1
one	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
another.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:12	1
If	1
he	1
offer	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
thanksgiving,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
with	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
unleavened	1
cakes	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
unleavened	1
wafers	1
anointed	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
cakes	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil,	1
of	1
fine	1
flour,	1
fried.	1
	1
7:13	1
Besides	1
the	1
cakes,	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
for	1
his	1
offering	1
leavened	1
bread	1
with	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
oblation	1
for	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's	1
that	1
sprinkleth	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings	1
for	1
thanksgiving	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
offered;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
any	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
7:16	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
offering	1
be	1
a	1
vow,	1
or	1
a	1
voluntary	1
offering,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
offereth	1
his	1
sacrifice:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
also	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten:	1
7:17	1
But	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings	1
be	1
eaten	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
accepted,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
imputed	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
offereth	1
it:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination,	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
the	1
flesh	1
that	1
toucheth	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
flesh,	1
all	1
that	1
be	1
clean	1
shall	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:20	1
But	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1

For	1

And	1
the	1
LORD	1

unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
7:29	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1

of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
He	1
that	1

	1
7:30	1
His	1

that	1

be	1
waved	1

a	1

before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
burn	1
the	1
fat	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
but	1
the	1
breast	1
shall	1

Aaron's	1

	1
7:32	1
And	1

	1
7:33	1
He	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
that	1
offereth	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1

fat,	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder	1
for	1

	1
7:34	1
For	1
the	1
wave	1
breast	1
and	1
the	1
heave	1
shoulder	1
have	1
I	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
their	1
peace	1

and	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
unto	1
his	1
sons	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:35	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
presented	1
them	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office;	1
7:36	1
Which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
anointed	1
them,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
7:37	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
consecrations,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings;	1
7:38	1
Which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
offer	1
their	1
oblations	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
8:2	1
Take	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
garments,	1
and	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
a	1
bullock	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
two	1
rams,	1
and	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread;	1
8:3	1
And	1
gather	1
thou	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
assembly	1
was	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
washed	1
them	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
coat,	1
and	1
girded	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
girdle,	1
and	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
robe,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
ephod	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
girded	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
bound	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
therewith.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
breastplate	1
upon	1
him:	1
also	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
breastplate	1
the	1
Urim	1
and	1
the	1
Thummim.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head;	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
mitre,	1
even	1
upon	1
his	1
forefront,	1
did	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
golden	1
plate,	1
the	1
holy	1
crown;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
anointed	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
therein,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
them.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
thereof	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
seven	1
times,	1
and	1
anointed	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
vessels,	1
both	1
the	1
laver	1
and	1
his	1
foot,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
poured	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil	1
upon	1
Aaron's	1
head,	1
and	1
anointed	1
him,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
him.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
Aaron's	1
sons,	1
and	1
put	1
coats	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
girded	1
them	1
with	1
girdles,	1
and	1
put	1
bonnets	1
upon	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
bullock	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bullock	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
it;	1
and	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about	1
with	1
his	1
finger,	1
and	1
purified	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
poured	1
the	1
blood	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
it,	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
inwards,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
above	1
the	1
liver,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
their	1
fat,	1
and	1
Moses	1
burned	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
8:17	1
But	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
his	1
hide,	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
his	1
dung,	1
he	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire	1
without	1
the	1
camp;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
ram	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
ram.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
he	1
killed	1
it;	1
and	1
Moses	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
he	1
cut	1
the	1
ram	1
into	1
pieces;	1
and	1
Moses	1
burnt	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
pieces,	1
and	1
the	1
fat.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
he	1
washed	1
the	1
inwards	1
and	1
the	1
legs	1
in	1
water;	1
and	1
Moses	1
burnt	1
the	1
whole	1
ram	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
and	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
other	1
ram,	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
consecration:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
ram.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
it;	1
and	1
Moses	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
Aaron's	1
right	1
ear,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
thumb	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
toe	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
foot.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
Aaron's	1
sons,	1
and	1
Moses	1
put	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
ear,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
thumbs	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
hands,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
toes	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
feet:	1
and	1
Moses	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
the	1
rump,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
inwards,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
above	1
the	1
liver,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
their	1
fat,	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder:	1
8:26	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
basket	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
took	1
one	1
unleavened	1
cake,	1
and	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
oiled	1
bread,	1
and	1
one	1
wafer,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder:	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
all	1
upon	1
Aaron's	1
hands,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons'	1
hands,	1
and	1
waved	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
them	1
from	1
off	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
burnt	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
upon	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
they	1
were	1
consecrations	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour:	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
breast,	1
and	1
waved	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
of	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
consecration	1
it	1
was	1
Moses'	1
part;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
it	1
upon	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons'	1
garments	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
sanctified	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
garments	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
Boil	1
the	1
flesh	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
there	1
eat	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
bread	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
basket	1
of	1
consecrations,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
shall	1
ye	1
burn	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
8:33	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
in	1
seven	1
days,	1
until	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
consecration	1
be	1
at	1
an	1
end:	1
for	1
seven	1
days	1
shall	1
he	1
consecrate	1
you.	1
	1
8:34	1
As	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
day,	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded	1
to	1
do,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
8:35	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
abide	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
seven	1
days,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
ye	1
die	1
not:	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
am	1
commanded.	1
	1
8:36	1
So	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
did	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day,	1
that	1
Moses	1
called	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel;	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
thee	1
a	1
young	1
calf	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
without	1
blemish,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
ye	1
a	1
kid	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering;	1
and	1
a	1
calf	1
and	1
a	1
lamb,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year,	1
without	1
blemish,	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
9:4	1
Also	1
a	1
bullock	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
for	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil:	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
appear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
that	1
which	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
drew	1
near	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do:	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
appear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Go	1
unto	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
offer	1
thy	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
thyself,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
offer	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded.	1
	1
9:8	1
Aaron	1
therefore	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
calf	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
brought	1
the	1
blood	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
dipped	1
his	1
finger	1
in	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
blood	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
9:10	1
But	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
the	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
above	1
the	1
liver	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
he	1
burnt	1
upon	1
the	1
altar;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
hide	1
he	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
and	1
Aaron's	1
sons	1
presented	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
they	1
presented	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
unto	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
pieces	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
head:	1
and	1
he	1
burnt	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
wash	1
the	1
inwards	1
and	1
the	1
legs,	1
and	1
burnt	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
on	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
people's	1
offering,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
goat,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
slew	1
it,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
for	1
sin,	1
as	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
manner.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
handful	1
thereof,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
beside	1
the	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
9:18	1
He	1
slew	1
also	1
the	1
bullock	1
and	1
the	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
Aaron's	1
sons	1
presented	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about,	1
9:19	1
And	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
bullock	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ram,	1
the	1
rump,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
covereth	1
the	1
inwards,	1
and	1
the	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
above	1
the	1
liver:	1
9:20	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
the	1
fat	1
upon	1
the	1
breasts,	1
and	1
he	1
burnt	1
the	1
fat	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
9:21	1
And	1
the	1
breasts	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder	1
Aaron	1
waved	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
Moses	1
commanded.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
Aaron	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
toward	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
blessed	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
fire	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
consumed	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
fat:	1
which	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw,	1
they	1
shouted,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
faces.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
Nadab	1
and	1
Abihu,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
took	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
his	1
censer,	1
and	1
put	1
fire	1
therein,	1
and	1
put	1
incense	1
thereon,	1
and	1
offered	1
strange	1
fire	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
devoured	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
died	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:3	1
Then	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
This	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
come	1
nigh	1
me,	1
and	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glorified.	1
And	1
Aaron	1
held	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
Mishael	1
and	1
Elzaphan,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Uzziel	1
the	1
uncle	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
near,	1
carry	1
your	1
brethren	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
10:5	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
near,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
coats	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp;	1
as	1
Moses	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
and	1
unto	1
Ithamar,	1
his	1
sons,	1
Uncover	1
not	1
your	1
heads,	1
neither	1
rend	1
your	1
clothes;	1
lest	1
ye	1
die,	1
and	1
lest	1
wrath	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
brethren,	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
bewail	1
the	1
burning	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
kindled.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die:	1
for	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
10:9	1
Do	1
not	1
drink	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink,	1
thou,	1
nor	1
thy	1
sons	1
with	1
thee,	1
when	1
ye	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations:	1
10:10	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
put	1
difference	1
between	1
holy	1
and	1
unholy,	1
and	1
between	1
unclean	1
and	1
clean;	1
10:11	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
teach	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
all	1
the	1
statutes	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
and	1
unto	1
Ithamar,	1
his	1
sons	1
that	1
were	1
left,	1
Take	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
that	1
remaineth	1
of	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
without	1
leaven	1
beside	1
the	1
altar:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy:	1
10:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
thy	1
due,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
due,	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire:	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
am	1
commanded.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
the	1
wave	1
breast	1
and	1
heave	1
shoulder	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
place;	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
thy	1
due,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
due,	1
which	1
are	1
given	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:15	1
The	1
heave	1
shoulder	1
and	1
the	1
wave	1
breast	1
shall	1
they	1
bring	1
with	1
the	1
offerings	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
fat,	1
to	1
wave	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
thine,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
with	1
thee,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
Moses	1
diligently	1
sought	1
the	1
goat	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
burnt:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
Eleazar	1
and	1
Ithamar,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
which	1
were	1
left	1
alive,	1
saying,	1
10:17	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
eaten	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy,	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
you	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
make	1
atonement	1
for	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
10:18	1
Behold,	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
brought	1
in	1
within	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
ye	1
should	1
indeed	1
have	1
eaten	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
they	1
offered	1
their	1
sin	1
offering	1
and	1
their	1
burnt	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
such	1
things	1
have	1
befallen	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
eaten	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
to	1
day,	1
should	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
when	1
Moses	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
content.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
to	1
Aaron,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
11:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
beasts	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:3	1
Whatsoever	1
parteth	1
the	1
hoof,	1
and	1
is	1
clovenfooted,	1
and	1
cheweth	1
the	1
cud,	1
among	1
the	1
beasts,	1
that	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat.	1
	1
11:4	1
Nevertheless	1
these	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
chew	1
the	1
cud,	1
or	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
divide	1
the	1
hoof:	1
as	1
the	1
camel,	1
because	1
he	1
cheweth	1
the	1
cud,	1
but	1
divideth	1
not	1
the	1
hoof;	1
he	1
is	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
coney,	1
because	1
he	1
cheweth	1
the	1
cud,	1
but	1
divideth	1
not	1
the	1
hoof;	1
he	1
is	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
hare,	1
because	1
he	1

	1
11:7	1
And	1
the	1

though	1
he	1
divide	1
the	1

clovenfooted,	1
yet	1
he	1
cheweth	1

	1
11:8	1
Of	1
their	1
flesh	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1

and	1
their	1

they	1

to	1
you.	1
	1
11:9	1
These	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
of	1
all	1

And	1

they	1

an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
you:	1
11:11	1
They	1

ye	1

	1
11:12	1
Whatsoever	1

that	1

	1
11:13	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
ye	1

have	1
in	1
abomination	1
among	1
the	1
fowls;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1

they	1
are	1
an	1
abomination:	1
the	1
eagle,	1
and	1
the	1
ossifrage,	1
and	1
the	1
ospray,	1
11:14	1
And	1
the	1

11:15	1
Every	1

And	1
the	1

	1
11:20	1
All	1
fowls	1
that	1

shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1

	1
11:21	1
Yet	1
these	1

of	1
every	1

that	1

which	1

11:22	1
Even	1
these	1
of	1
them	1
ye	1

	1
11:23	1
But	1
all	1

which	1

shall	1
be	1
an	1

unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:24	1
And	1
for	1
these	1
ye	1

whosoever	1

	1
11:25	1
And	1
whosoever	1

	1
11:26	1
The	1

	1
11:27	1
And	1

among	1
all	1

of	1
beasts	1
that	1

those	1

	1
11:28	1
And	1
he	1

	1
11:29	1
These	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you	1
among	1
the	1

that	1

11:30	1
And	1

	1
11:31	1
These	1
are	1
unclean	1
to	1
you	1

whosoever	1

	1
11:32	1
And	1
upon	1
whatsoever	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1

it	1

	1
11:33	1
And	1
every	1

whereinto	1
any	1

falleth,	1
whatsoever	1

in	1
it	1

break	1
it.	1
	1
11:34	1
Of	1
all	1
meat	1
which	1
may	1

that	1
on	1

in	1
every	1

	1
11:35	1
And	1
every	1
thing	1
whereupon	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
their	1

shall	1
be	1
unclean;	1
whether	1
it	1

they	1

for	1
they	1
are	1
unclean	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:36	1
Nevertheless	1
a	1
fountain	1
or	1
pit,	1
wherein	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
water,	1
shall	1
be	1

but	1
that	1
which	1

	1
11:37	1
And	1
if	1

upon	1
any	1
sowing	1

which	1

it	1

	1
11:38	1
But	1
if	1

it	1

unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
beast,	1
of	1
which	1
ye	1
may	1
eat,	1
die;	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
carcase	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1

	1
11:40	1
And	1
he	1
that	1

of	1
it	1

	1
11:41	1
And	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination;	1
it	1

	1
11:42	1
Whatsoever	1
goeth	1

whatsoever	1

among	1
all	1
creeping	1
things	1
that	1

upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
an	1
abomination.	1
	1
11:43	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
yourselves	1
abominable	1
with	1
any	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
yourselves	1
unclean	1
with	1
them,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
defiled	1
thereby.	1
	1
11:44	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
sanctify	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1

for	1
I	1

holy:	1
neither	1

any	1
manner	1
of	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1

	1
11:45	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
bringeth	1
you	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
God:	1
ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
be	1
holy,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
11:46	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fowl,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1

and	1
of	1
every	1
creature	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
11:47	1
To	1
make	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
unclean	1
and	1
the	1
clean,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1

eaten	1
and	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
may	1
not	1

	1
12:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
12:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
If	1
a	1
woman	1
have	1
conceived	1
seed,	1
and	1
born	1
a	1
man	1
child:	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
seven	1
days;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
separation	1
for	1
her	1
infirmity	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
foreskin	1
shall	1
be	1
circumcised.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
then	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
her	1
purifying	1
three	1
and	1
thirty	1
days;	1
she	1
shall	1
touch	1
no	1
hallowed	1
thing,	1
nor	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
until	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
purifying	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
12:5	1
But	1
if	1
she	1
bear	1
a	1
maid	1
child,	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
two	1
weeks,	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
separation:	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
her	1
purifying	1
threescore	1
and	1
six	1
days.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
purifying	1
are	1
fulfilled,	1
for	1
a	1
son,	1
or	1
for	1
a	1
daughter,	1
she	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
lamb	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
pigeon,	1
or	1
a	1
turtledove,	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
unto	1
the	1
priest:	1
12:7	1
Who	1
shall	1
offer	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
cleansed	1
from	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
her	1
blood.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
hath	1
born	1
a	1
male	1
or	1
a	1
female.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
lamb,	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
bring	1
two	1
turtles,	1
or	1
two	1
young	1
pigeons;	1
the	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1

and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
13:2	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
a	1
rising,	1
a	1
scab,	1
or	1
bright	1
spot,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
like	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
or	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
the	1
priests:	1
13:3	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
plague	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
flesh:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
hair	1
in	1
the	1
plague	1
is	1
turned	1
white,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
in	1
sight	1
be	1
deeper	1
than	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
pronounce	1
him	1
unclean.	1
	1
13:4	1
If	1
the	1
bright	1
spot	1
be	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
in	1
sight	1
be	1
not	1
deeper	1
than	1
the	1
skin,	1
and	1
the	1
hair	1
thereof	1
be	1
not	1
turned	1
white;	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
shut	1
up	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
plague	1
seven	1
days:	1
13:5	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
in	1
his	1
sight	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
stay,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
spread	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
skin;	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
shut	1
him	1
up	1
seven	1
days	1
more:	1
13:6	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
be	1
somewhat	1
dark,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
spread	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
clean:	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
scab:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
13:7	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
scab	1
spread	1
much	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
for	1
his	1
cleansing,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
again.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
priest	1
see	1
that,	1
behold,	1
the	1
scab	1
spreadeth	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
unclean:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
leprosy.	1
	1
13:9	1
When	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
man,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
priest;	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
see	1
him:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
rising	1
be	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
and	1
it	1
have	1
turned	1
the	1

white,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
quick	1
raw	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
rising;	1
13:11	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
leprosy	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
unclean,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
shut	1
him	1
up:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
leprosy	1
break	1
out	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
and	1
the	1
leprosy	1

of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
plague	1
from	1
his	1
head	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
foot,	1
wheresoever	1
the	1
priest	1
looketh;	1
13:13	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
consider:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
leprosy	1
have	1
covered	1
all	1
his	1
flesh,	1
he	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
clean	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
plague:	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
turned	1
white:	1
he	1
is	1
clean.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
raw	1
flesh	1
appeareth	1
in	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
raw	1
flesh,	1
and	1
pronounce	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
unclean:	1
for	1
the	1
raw	1
flesh	1
is	1
unclean:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
leprosy.	1
	1
13:16	1
Or	1
if	1
the	1
raw	1
flesh	1
turn	1
again,	1
and	1
be	1
changed	1
unto	1
white,	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
priest;	1
13:17	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
see	1
him:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
white;	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
clean	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
plague:	1
he	1
is	1
clean.	1
	1
13:18	1
The	1

also,	1
in	1
which,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1

thereof,	1
was	1
a	1

and	1
it	1

13:20	1
And	1
if,	1
when	1
the	1

it,	1
behold,	1
it	1

the	1

it	1

a	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy	1
broken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

	1
13:21	1
But	1

And	1

	1
13:23	1
But	1

	1
13:24	1
Or	1

Then	1

And	1

	1
13:29	1
If	1

And	1

But	1

	1
13:37	1
But	1

And	1

13:44	1
He	1

	1
13:45	1
And	1

Unclean,	1

All	1
the	1

him	1
he	1

	1
13:52	1
He	1

13:54	1
Then	1
the	1

shall	1
command	1
that	1
they	1
wash	1
the	1
thing	1
wherein	1
the	1
plague	1
is,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
shut	1
it	1
up	1
seven	1
days	1
more:	1
13:55	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
plague,	1
after	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
washed:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
have	1
not	1
changed	1
his	1
colour,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
be	1
not	1
spread;	1
it	1
is	1
unclean;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
burn	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
it	1
is	1
fret	1
inward,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
bare	1
within	1
or	1
without.	1
	1
13:56	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
priest	1
look,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
plague	1
be	1
somewhat	1
dark	1
after	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
it;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
rend	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

or	1
out	1

13:57	1
And	1
if	1

either	1
in	1
the	1

or	1
in	1
the	1
woof,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
skin;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
spreading	1
plague:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
burn	1
that	1
wherein	1
the	1
plague	1
is	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
13:58	1
And	1
the	1

or	1
whatsoever	1

which	1
thou	1

then	1
it	1

be	1
washed	1
the	1

and	1
shall	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
13:59	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
leprosy	1
in	1
a	1

	1
14:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
14:2	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
leper	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
cleansing:	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
priest:	1
14:3	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
the	1

and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy	1
be	1
healed	1
in	1
the	1
leper;	1
14:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
priest	1
command	1
to	1
take	1
for	1
him	1
that	1

14:5	1
And	1
the	1

14:6	1
As	1
for	1
the	1

he	1

of	1
the	1

that	1
was	1
killed	1
over	1
the	1
running	1
water:	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
sprinkle	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
to	1

cleansed	1
from	1
the	1

	1
14:8	1
And	1
he	1
that	1

shall	1
wash	1

	1
14:9	1
But	1

14:14	1
And	1

14:37	1
And	1

cast	1
them	1
into	1
an	1

place	1
without	1
the	1

14:41	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
scraped	1
within	1
round	1

and	1
they	1

that	1
they	1

14:42	1
And	1
they	1

	1
14:43	1
And	1
if	1

14:44	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
look,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
be	1
spread	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fretting	1
leprosy	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
it	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
14:45	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1

thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1

and	1
he	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
into	1
an	1
unclean	1
place.	1
	1
14:46	1
Moreover	1
he	1
that	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
shut	1
up	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1

	1
14:47	1
And	1
he	1
that	1

and	1
he	1
that	1

	1
14:48	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
it,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
plague	1
hath	1
not	1
spread	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
after	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
plaistered:	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
the	1
house	1
clean,	1
because	1
the	1
plague	1
is	1
healed.	1
	1
14:49	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1

two	1
birds,	1
and	1
cedar	1

14:50	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
kill	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
in	1
an	1
earthen	1
vessel	1
over	1
running	1

14:51	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1

and	1
the	1

them	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
slain	1

and	1
in	1
the	1

and	1
sprinkle	1
the	1
house	1
seven	1
times:	1
14:52	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
cleanse	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
with	1

and	1
with	1
the	1

and	1
with	1
the	1

14:53	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
living	1

out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
into	1
the	1

fields,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1

and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
14:54	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy,	1
and	1
scall,	1
14:55	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
leprosy	1
of	1
a	1

14:56	1
And	1
for	1

14:57	1
To	1
teach	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
unclean,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
clean:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
leprosy.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1

Speak	1

When	1

	1
15:3	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1

or	1
his	1

stopped	1

	1
15:4	1
Every	1

And	1

And	1
when	1

	1
15:26	1
Every	1

And	1

	1
15:28	1
But	1
if	1

	1
15:29	1
And	1
on	1

	1
15:30	1
And	1

the	1
LORD	1
for	1
the	1

of	1
her	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
15:31	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
separate	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
their	1
uncleanness;	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
uncleanness,	1
when	1
they	1
defile	1
my	1
tabernacle	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
15:32	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
issue,	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
whose	1
seed	1
goeth	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
is	1
defiled	1
therewith;	1
15:33	1
And	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
sick	1
of	1
her	1
flowers,	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
issue,	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
lieth	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
when	1
they	1
offered	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
died;	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother,	1
that	1
he	1
come	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
within	1
the	1
vail	1
before	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
ark;	1
that	1
he	1
die	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
upon	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat.	1
	1
16:3	1
Thus	1
shall	1
Aaron	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
16:4	1
He	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
holy	1
linen	1
coat,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
linen	1
breeches	1
upon	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
girded	1
with	1
a	1
linen	1
girdle,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
linen	1
mitre	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
attired:	1
these	1
are	1
holy	1
garments;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
he	1
wash	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
so	1
put	1
them	1
on.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
two	1
kids	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
one	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
offer	1
his	1
bullock	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
two	1
goats,	1
and	1
present	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
cast	1
lots	1
upon	1
the	1
two	1
goats;	1
one	1
lot	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
lot	1
for	1
the	1
scapegoat.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
goat	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
LORD's	1
lot	1
fell,	1
and	1
offer	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
16:10	1
But	1
the	1
goat,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
scapegoat,	1
shall	1
be	1
presented	1
alive	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
scapegoat	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
bullock	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
shall	1
kill	1
the	1
bullock	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
himself:	1
16:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
a	1
censer	1
full	1
of	1
burning	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
full	1
of	1
sweet	1
incense	1
beaten	1
small,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
within	1
the	1
vail:	1
16:13	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
the	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
fire	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
the	1
incense	1
may	1
cover	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
testimony,	1
that	1
he	1
die	1
not:	1
16:14	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
upon	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
eastward;	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
shall	1
he	1
sprinkle	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
seven	1
times.	1
	1
16:15	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
kill	1
the	1
goat	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
that	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
bring	1
his	1
blood	1
within	1
the	1
vail,	1
and	1
do	1
with	1
that	1
blood	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat:	1
16:16	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
transgressions	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
sins:	1
and	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
that	1
remaineth	1
among	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
when	1
he	1
goeth	1
in	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
until	1
he	1
come	1
out,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
household,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
goat,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
sprinkle	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
seven	1
times,	1
and	1
cleanse	1
it,	1
and	1
hallow	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
reconciling	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
live	1
goat:	1
16:21	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
lay	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
live	1
goat,	1
and	1
confess	1
over	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
transgressions	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
sins,	1
putting	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
goat,	1
and	1
shall	1
send	1
him	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
fit	1
man	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
16:22	1
And	1
the	1
goat	1
shall	1
bear	1
upon	1
him	1
all	1
their	1
iniquities	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
not	1
inhabited:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
goat	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
shall	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
linen	1
garments,	1
which	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
them	1
there:	1
16:24	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
flesh	1
with	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
offer	1
his	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
shall	1
he	1
burn	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
goat	1
for	1
the	1
scapegoat	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
afterward	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
16:27	1
And	1
the	1
bullock	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
goat	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
whose	1
blood	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
to	1
make	1
atonement	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
shall	1
one	1
carry	1
forth	1
without	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
burn	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
their	1
skins,	1
and	1
their	1
flesh,	1
and	1
their	1
dung.	1
	1
16:28	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
them	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
afterward	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
16:29	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
unto	1
you:	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
ye	1
shall	1
afflict	1
your	1
souls,	1
and	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
at	1
all,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
country,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
you:	1
16:30	1
For	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
priest	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
cleanse	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
clean	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
sins	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:31	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
afflict	1
your	1
souls,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
the	1
priest,	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
anoint,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
consecrate	1
to	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
in	1
his	1

and	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes,	1
even	1
the	1
holy	1
garments:	1
16:33	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1

and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
everlasting	1
statute	1
unto	1
you,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
once	1
a	1
year.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
17:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them;	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
17:3	1
What	1
man	1
soever	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
killeth	1
an	1
ox,	1
or	1
lamb,	1
or	1
goat,	1
in	1
the	1
camp,	1
or	1
that	1
killeth	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
17:4	1
And	1
bringeth	1
it	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
imputed	1
unto	1
that	1
man;	1
he	1
hath	1
shed	1
blood;	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people:	1
17:5	1
To	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
may	1
bring	1
their	1
sacrifices,	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
field,	1
even	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
for	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
sprinkle	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
burn	1
the	1
fat	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
offer	1
their	1
sacrifices	1
unto	1
devils,	1
after	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring.	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
unto	1
them	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whatsoever	1
man	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
which	1
sojourn	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
offereth	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
or	1
sacrifice,	1
17:9	1
And	1
bringeth	1
it	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
offer	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
even	1
that	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
man	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
sojourn	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
eateth	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
blood;	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
soul	1
that	1
eateth	1
blood,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
17:11	1
For	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
blood:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
your	1
souls:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
maketh	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
soul.	1
	1
17:12	1
Therefore	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
No	1
soul	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
eat	1
blood,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
you	1

	1
17:13	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
man	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1

that	1

among	1
you,	1
which	1
hunteth	1
and	1
catcheth	1
any	1
beast	1
or	1
fowl	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
eaten;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof,	1
and	1
cover	1
it	1
with	1
dust.	1
	1
17:14	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
all	1
flesh;	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
thereof:	1
therefore	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
flesh:	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof:	1
whosoever	1
eateth	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
every	1
soul	1
that	1
eateth	1
that	1
which	1
died	1
of	1
itself,	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
torn	1
with	1
beasts,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
country,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
he	1
shall	1
both	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
bathe	1
himself	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even:	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
17:16	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
wash	1
them	1
not,	1
nor	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
18:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
18:3	1
After	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
dwelt,	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1

and	1
after	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
whither	1
I	1
bring	1
you,	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
do:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
ordinances.	1
	1
18:4	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
keep	1
mine	1
ordinances,	1
to	1
walk	1
therein:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
18:5	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
my	1
judgments:	1
which	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
do,	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:6	1
None	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
approach	1
to	1
any	1
that	1
is	1
near	1
of	1
kin	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1

	1
18:11	1
The	1

18:12	1
Thou	1

18:13	1
Thou	1

	1
18:14	1
Thou	1

18:15	1
Thou	1

	1
18:17	1
Thou	1

to	1
uncover	1

	1
18:18	1
Neither	1

18:20	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lie	1
carnally	1
with	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
to	1
defile	1
thyself	1
with	1

	1
18:21	1
And	1
thou	1

of	1
thy	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:22	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lie	1
with	1
mankind,	1
as	1
with	1
womankind:	1
it	1
is	1
abomination.	1
	1
18:23	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
lie	1
with	1
any	1
beast	1

therewith:	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
woman	1
stand	1
before	1
a	1
beast	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
thereto:	1
it	1
is	1
confusion.	1
	1
18:24	1
Defile	1
not	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
for	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
the	1
nations	1
are	1
defiled	1
which	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
you:	1
18:25	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
defiled:	1
therefore	1
I	1
do	1
visit	1
the	1
iniquity	1
thereof	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
itself	1
vomiteth	1
out	1
her	1
inhabitants.	1
	1
18:26	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes	1
and	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
commit	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
abominations;	1
neither	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
nation,	1
nor	1
any	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
you:	1
18:27	1
(For	1
all	1
these	1
abominations	1
have	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
done,	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
defiled;)	1
18:28	1
That	1
the	1
land	1
spue	1
not	1
you	1
out	1
also,	1
when	1
ye	1
defile	1
it,	1
as	1
it	1
spued	1
out	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
18:29	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
commit	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
abominations,	1
even	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
commit	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
people.	1
	1
18:30	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
keep	1
mine	1
ordinance,	1
that	1
ye	1
commit	1
not	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
abominable	1
customs,	1
which	1
were	1
committed	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
defile	1
not	1
yourselves	1
therein:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
19:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
be	1
holy:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
19:3	1
Ye	1
shall	1
fear	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
sabbaths:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:4	1
Turn	1
ye	1
not	1
unto	1
idols,	1
nor	1
make	1
to	1
yourselves	1
molten	1
gods:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
it	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
will.	1
	1
19:6	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
ye	1
offer	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow:	1
and	1
if	1
ought	1
remain	1
until	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
eaten	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
it	1
is	1
abominable;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
accepted.	1
	1
19:8	1
Therefore	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
eateth	1
it	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
profaned	1
the	1
hallowed	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
reap	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
your	1
land,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
wholly	1
reap	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
thy	1

neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
gather	1
the	1

of	1
thy	1

	1
19:10	1
And	1
thou	1

not	1
glean	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
gather	1
every	1
grape	1
of	1
thy	1
vineyard;	1
thou	1

leave	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1

stranger:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1

	1
19:11	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
steal,	1
neither	1
deal	1
falsely,	1
neither	1
lie	1
one	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1

by	1
my	1

falsely,	1
neither	1

the	1

thy	1

I	1

the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
defraud	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
neither	1
rob	1
him:	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
hired	1
shall	1
not	1
abide	1
with	1
thee	1
all	1
night	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
19:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
curse	1
the	1
deaf,	1
nor	1
put	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
before	1
the	1
blind,	1
but	1
shalt	1
fear	1
thy	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:15	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
judgment:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
respect	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
nor	1
honor	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
mighty:	1
but	1
in	1
righteousness	1
shalt	1
thou	1
judge	1
thy	1
neighbour.	1
	1
19:16	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
talebearer	1
among	1
thy	1
people:	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
neighbour;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
hate	1
thy	1
brother	1
in	1
thine	1
heart:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
rebuke	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
not	1
suffer	1
sin	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
19:18	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
avenge,	1
nor	1
bear	1
any	1
grudge	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:19	1
Ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes.	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
let	1
thy	1
cattle	1
gender	1
with	1
a	1
diverse	1
kind:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
sow	1
thy	1
field	1
with	1
mingled	1
seed:	1
neither	1
shall	1
a	1
garment	1
mingled	1
of	1
linen	1
and	1
woollen	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
whosoever	1
lieth	1
carnally	1
with	1
a	1
woman,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
bondmaid,	1
betrothed	1
to	1
an	1

not	1
at	1
all	1

she	1
shall	1
be	1
scourged;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
free.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
his	1
trespass	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
even	1
a	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
his	1
sin	1
which	1

and	1
the	1
sin	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
planted	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
trees	1
for	1
food,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
count	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
as	1
uncircumcised:	1
three	1
years	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
as	1
uncircumcised	1
unto	1
you:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten	1
of.	1
	1
19:24	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
to	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
withal.	1
	1
19:25	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
yield	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
increase	1
thereof:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:26	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
any	1
thing	1
with	1
the	1
blood:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
use	1
enchantment,	1
nor	1
observe	1
times.	1
	1
19:27	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
round	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
your	1
heads,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
mar	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
thy	1
beard.	1
	1
19:28	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
cuttings	1
in	1
your	1
flesh	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
nor	1
print	1
any	1
marks	1
upon	1
you:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:29	1
Do	1
not	1
prostitute	1
thy	1
daughter,	1
to	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
whore;	1
lest	1
the	1
land	1
fall	1
to	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
become	1
full	1
of	1
wickedness.	1
	1
19:30	1
Ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
reverence	1
my	1
sanctuary:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:31	1
Regard	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
neither	1
seek	1
after	1
wizards,	1
to	1
be	1
defiled	1
by	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:32	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
rise	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
hoary	1
head,	1
and	1
honour	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
fear	1
thy	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
stranger	1
sojourn	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
your	1
land,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
vex	1
him.	1
	1
19:34	1
But	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
one	1
born	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
thyself;	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:35	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
judgment,	1
in	1
meteyard,	1
in	1
weight,	1
or	1
in	1
measure.	1
	1
19:36	1
Just	1
balances,	1
just	1
weights,	1
a	1
just	1
ephah,	1
and	1
a	1
just	1
hin,	1
shall	1
ye	1
have:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
19:37	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
observe	1
all	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
20:2	1
Again,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
sojourn	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
giveth	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
unto	1
Molech;	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
stone	1
him	1
with	1
stones.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
unto	1
Molech,	1
to	1
defile	1
my	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
to	1
profane	1
my	1
holy	1
name.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
do	1
any	1
ways	1
hide	1
their	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
giveth	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
unto	1
Molech,	1
and	1
kill	1
him	1
not:	1
20:5	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
him,	1
to	1
commit	1
whoredom	1
with	1
Molech,	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
people.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
turneth	1
after	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
after	1
wizards,	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
soul,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
20:7	1
Sanctify	1
yourselves	1
therefore,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
holy:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
sanctify	1
you.	1
	1
20:9	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
curseth	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
he	1
hath	1
cursed	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother;	1
his	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
with	1
another	1
man's	1
wife,	1
even	1
he	1
that	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
the	1
adulterer	1
and	1
the	1
adulteress	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
lieth	1
with	1
his	1
father's	1
wife	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
his	1
father's	1
nakedness:	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lie	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
they	1
have	1
wrought	1
confusion;	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:13	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
also	1
lie	1
with	1
mankind,	1
as	1
he	1
lieth	1
with	1
a	1
woman,	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
committed	1
an	1
abomination:	1
they	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
it	1
is	1
wickedness:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire,	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
they;	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
wickedness	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lie	1
with	1
a	1
beast,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
slay	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
20:16	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
approach	1
unto	1
any	1
beast,	1
and	1
lie	1
down	1
thereto,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
kill	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
beast:	1
they	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
take	1
his	1
sister,	1
his	1
father's	1
daughter,	1
or	1
his	1
mother's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
nakedness,	1
and	1
she	1
see	1
his	1
nakedness;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
wicked	1
thing;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
their	1
people:	1
he	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
his	1
sister's	1
nakedness;	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
her	1
sickness,	1
and	1
shall	1
uncover	1
her	1
nakedness;	1
he	1
hath	1
discovered	1
her	1
fountain,	1
and	1
she	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
her	1
blood:	1
and	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
people.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
uncover	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
thy	1
mother's	1
sister,	1
nor	1
of	1
thy	1
father's	1
sister:	1
for	1
he	1
uncovereth	1
his	1
near	1
kin:	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
his	1
uncle's	1
wife,	1
he	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
his	1
uncle's	1
nakedness:	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
sin;	1
they	1
shall	1
die	1
childless.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
take	1
his	1
brother's	1
wife,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unclean	1
thing:	1
he	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
his	1
brother's	1
nakedness;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
childless.	1
	1
20:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
keep	1
all	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
that	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
spue	1
you	1
not	1
out.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
which	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
you:	1
for	1
they	1
committed	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
abhorred	1
them.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
inherit	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
have	1
separated	1
you	1
from	1
other	1
people.	1
	1
20:25	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
put	1
difference	1
between	1
clean	1
beasts	1
and	1
unclean,	1
and	1
between	1
unclean	1
fowls	1
and	1
clean:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
your	1
souls	1
abominable	1
by	1
beast,	1
or	1
by	1
fowl,	1
or	1
by	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
living	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
separated	1
from	1
you	1
as	1
unclean.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
am	1
holy,	1
and	1
have	1
severed	1
you	1
from	1
other	1
people,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
mine.	1
	1
20:27	1
A	1
man	1
also	1
or	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
wizard,	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
they	1
shall	1
stone	1
them	1
with	1
stones:	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
There	1
shall	1
none	1
be	1
defiled	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
among	1
his	1
people:	1
21:2	1
But	1
for	1
his	1
kin,	1
that	1
is	1
near	1
unto	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
for	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
a	1
virgin,	1
that	1
is	1
nigh	1
unto	1
him,	1
which	1
hath	1
had	1
no	1
husband;	1
for	1
her	1
may	1
he	1
be	1
defiled.	1
	1
21:4	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
defile	1
himself,	1
being	1
a	1
chief	1
man	1
among	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
profane	1
himself.	1
	1
21:5	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
baldness	1
upon	1
their	1
head,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
shave	1
off	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
their	1
beard,	1
nor	1
make	1
any	1
cuttings	1
in	1
their	1
flesh.	1
	1
21:6	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
profane	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
their	1
God,	1
they	1
do	1
offer:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
21:7	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
whore,	1
or	1
profane;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
take	1
a	1
woman	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
husband:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
21:8	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
sanctify	1
him	1
therefore;	1
for	1
he	1
offereth	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
thy	1
God:	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
sanctify	1
you,	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
any	1
priest,	1
if	1
she	1
profane	1
herself	1
by	1
playing	1
the	1
whore,	1
she	1
profaneth	1
her	1
father:	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
among	1
his	1
brethren,	1
upon	1
whose	1
head	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil	1
was	1
poured,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
consecrated	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
garments,	1
shall	1
not	1
uncover	1
his	1
head,	1
nor	1

his	1
clothes;	1
21:11	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
any	1
dead	1
body,	1
nor	1
defile	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
for	1
his	1
mother;	1
21:12	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
nor	1
profane	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
his	1
God;	1
for	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil	1
of	1
his	1
God	1
is	1
upon	1
him:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
in	1
her	1
virginity.	1
	1
21:14	1
A	1
widow,	1
or	1
a	1
divorced	1
woman,	1
or	1
profane,	1
or	1
an	1
harlot,	1
these	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
take:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
a	1
virgin	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
21:15	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
profane	1
his	1
seed	1
among	1
his	1
people:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
him.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
21:17	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
Whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
thy	1
seed	1
in	1
their	1
generations	1
that	1
hath	1
any	1
blemish,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
approach	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
21:18	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
man	1
he	1
be	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
approach:	1
a	1
blind	1
man,	1
or	1
a	1
lame,	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
flat	1
nose,	1
or	1
any	1
thing	1
superfluous,	1
21:19	1
Or	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
brokenfooted,	1
or	1
brokenhanded,	1
21:20	1
Or	1
crookbackt,	1
or	1
a	1
dwarf,	1
or	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish	1
in	1
his	1
eye,	1
or	1
be	1
scurvy,	1
or	1
scabbed,	1
or	1
hath	1
his	1
stones	1
broken;	1
21:21	1
No	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire:	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
21:22	1
He	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
his	1
God,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
holy,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
holy.	1
	1
21:23	1
Only	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
vail,	1
nor	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
altar,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish;	1
that	1
he	1
profane	1
not	1
my	1
sanctuaries:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
22:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
that	1
they	1
separate	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
profane	1
not	1
my	1
holy	1
name	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
hallow	1
unto	1
me:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:3	1
Say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
seed	1
among	1
your	1
generations,	1
that	1
goeth	1
unto	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
hallow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
having	1
his	1
uncleanness	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
my	1
presence:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:4	1
What	1
man	1
soever	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Aaron	1
is	1
a	1
leper,	1
or	1
hath	1
a	1
running	1
issue;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
until	1
he	1
be	1
clean.	1
And	1
whoso	1
toucheth	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
unclean	1
by	1
the	1
dead,	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
seed	1
goeth	1
from	1
him;	1
22:5	1
Or	1
whosoever	1
toucheth	1
any	1
creeping	1
thing,	1
whereby	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
unclean,	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
uncleanness,	1
whatsoever	1
uncleanness	1
he	1
hath;	1
22:6	1
The	1
soul	1
which	1
hath	1
touched	1
any	1
such	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
even,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
unless	1
he	1
wash	1
his	1
flesh	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
down,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
clean,	1
and	1
shall	1
afterward	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
food.	1
	1
22:8	1
That	1
which	1
dieth	1
of	1
itself,	1
or	1
is	1
torn	1
with	1
beasts,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
to	1
defile	1
himself	1
therewith;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:9	1
They	1
shall	1
therefore	1
keep	1
mine	1
ordinance,	1
lest	1
they	1
bear	1
sin	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
die	1
therefore,	1
if	1
they	1
profane	1
it:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
22:10	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
stranger	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
thing:	1
a	1
sojourner	1
of	1
the	1
priest,	1
or	1
an	1
hired	1
servant,	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
thing.	1
	1
22:11	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
priest	1
buy	1
any	1
soul	1
with	1
his	1
money,	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
his	1
house:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
meat.	1
	1
22:12	1
If	1
the	1
priest's	1
daughter	1
also	1
be	1
married	1
unto	1
a	1
stranger,	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things.	1
	1
22:13	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
priest's	1
daughter	1
be	1
a	1
widow,	1
or	1
divorced,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
child,	1
and	1
is	1
returned	1
unto	1
her	1
father's	1
house,	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
youth,	1
she	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
meat:	1
but	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
stranger	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
thing	1
unwittingly,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
thereof	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
thing.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
profane	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
22:16	1
Or	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
trespass,	1
when	1
they	1
eat	1
their	1
holy	1
things:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
22:18	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whatsoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
will	1
offer	1
his	1
oblation	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
vows,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
freewill	1
offerings,	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
22:19	1
Ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
will	1
a	1
male	1
without	1
blemish,	1
of	1
the	1
beeves,	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
goats.	1
	1
22:20	1
But	1
whatsoever	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish,	1
that	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
offer:	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
acceptable	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
whosoever	1
offereth	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
accomplish	1
his	1
vow,	1
or	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering	1
in	1
beeves	1
or	1
sheep,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
perfect	1
to	1
be	1
accepted;	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
blemish	1
therein.	1
	1
22:22	1
Blind,	1
or	1
broken,	1
or	1
maimed,	1
or	1
having	1
a	1
wen,	1
or	1
scurvy,	1
or	1
scabbed,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
offer	1
these	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
make	1
an	1
offering	1
by	1
fire	1
of	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:23	1
Either	1
a	1
bullock	1
or	1
a	1
lamb	1
that	1
hath	1
any	1
thing	1
superfluous	1
or	1
lacking	1
in	1
his	1
parts,	1
that	1
mayest	1
thou	1
offer	1
for	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering;	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
vow	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
accepted.	1
	1
22:24	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
bruised,	1
or	1
crushed,	1
or	1
broken,	1
or	1
cut;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
any	1
offering	1
thereof	1
in	1
your	1
land.	1
	1
22:25	1
Neither	1
from	1
a	1
stranger's	1
hand	1
shall	1
ye	1
offer	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
your	1
God	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
these;	1
because	1
their	1
corruption	1
is	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
blemishes	1
be	1
in	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
accepted	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
22:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
22:27	1
When	1
a	1
bullock,	1
or	1
a	1
sheep,	1
or	1
a	1
goat,	1
is	1
brought	1
forth,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
days	1
under	1
the	1
dam;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
and	1
thenceforth	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
accepted	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
cow,	1
or	1
ewe,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
kill	1
it	1
and	1
her	1
young	1
both	1
in	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
22:29	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
will	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
offer	1
it	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
will.	1
	1
22:30	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
up;	1
ye	1
shall	1
leave	1
none	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
morrow:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:31	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:32	1
Neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
profane	1
my	1
holy	1
name;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
hallowed	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
hallow	1
you,	1
22:33	1
That	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Concerning	1
the	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
proclaim	1
to	1
be	1
holy	1
convocations,	1
even	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
feasts.	1
	1
23:3	1
Six	1
days	1
shall	1
work	1
be	1
done:	1
but	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest,	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation;	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
therein:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
dwellings.	1
	1
23:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
holy	1
convocations,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
proclaim	1
in	1
their	1
seasons.	1
	1
23:5	1
In	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
at	1
even	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
passover.	1
	1
23:6	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
month	1
is	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
seven	1
days	1
ye	1
must	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread.	1
	1
23:7	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation:	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
servile	1
work	1
therein.	1
	1
23:8	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
seven	1
days:	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
is	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation:	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1

	1
23:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:10	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
harvest	1
thereof,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
sheaf	1
of	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
your	1
harvest	1
unto	1
the	1
priest:	1
23:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
wave	1
the	1
sheaf	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1

And	1

	1
23:21	1
And	1
ye	1

the	1
selfsame	1
day,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1

	1
23:22	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
reap	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
your	1
land,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
clean	1
riddance	1
of	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
thy	1
field	1
when	1
thou	1
reapest,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
gather	1
any	1

of	1
thy	1
harvest:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
leave	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
stranger:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1

your	1
God.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:24	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
In	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
shall	1
ye	1
have	1
a	1
sabbath,	1
a	1
memorial	1
of	1
blowing	1
of	1
trumpets,	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation.	1
	1
23:25	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
servile	1
work	1
therein:	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:27	1
Also	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
seventh	1
month	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
atonement:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation	1
unto	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
afflict	1
your	1
souls,	1
and	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
atonement,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
23:29	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
soul	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
afflicted	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
day,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
23:30	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
soul	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
doeth	1
any	1
work	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
day,	1
the	1
same	1
soul	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
23:31	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
work:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
your	1

in	1
all	1
your	1

	1
23:32	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
afflict	1
your	1

in	1
the	1
ninth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
at	1
even,	1
from	1
even	1
unto	1
even,	1
shall	1
ye	1
celebrate	1
your	1
sabbath.	1
	1
23:33	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:34	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1

for	1

	1
23:35	1
On	1
the	1

shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation:	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
servile	1
work	1
therein.	1
	1
23:36	1
Seven	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1

unto	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1

an	1

it	1
is	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
servile	1
work	1
therein.	1
	1
23:37	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
proclaim	1
to	1
be	1

a	1

Beside	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

	1
23:39	1
Also	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

month,	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
gathered	1

ye	1

	1
23:40	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
the	1
boughs	1
of	1
goodly	1
trees,	1
branches	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
ye	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
23:41	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
seven	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1

for	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
generations:	1
ye	1
shall	1
celebrate	1

in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month.	1
	1
23:42	1
Ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
booths	1
seven	1
days;	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
Israelites	1
born	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
booths:	1
23:43	1
That	1
your	1
generations	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
booths,	1
when	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
23:44	1
And	1
Moses	1
declared	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
the	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
24:2	1
Command	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
thee	1
pure	1
oil	1
olive	1
beaten	1
for	1
the	1
light,	1
to	1
cause	1
the	1
lamps	1
to	1
burn	1
continually.	1
	1
24:3	1
Without	1
the	1
vail	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
shall	1
Aaron	1
order	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
evening	1
unto	1
the	1
morning	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
continually:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
24:4	1
He	1
shall	1
order	1
the	1
lamps	1
upon	1
the	1
pure	1
candlestick	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
continually.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
bake	1
twelve	1
cakes	1
thereof:	1
two	1
tenth	1
deals	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
one	1
cake.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
two	1
rows,	1
six	1
on	1
a	1
row,	1
upon	1
the	1
pure	1
table	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
pure	1
frankincense	1
upon	1
each	1
row,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
bread	1
for	1
a	1
memorial,	1
even	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:8	1
Every	1
sabbath	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
continually,	1
being	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
by	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
Aaron's	1
and	1
his	1
sons';	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
by	1
a	1
perpetual	1
statute.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
an	1
Israelitish	1
woman,	1
whose	1
father	1
was	1
an	1
Egyptian,	1
went	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
this	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
Israelitish	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Israel	1
strove	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
camp;	1
24:11	1
And	1
the	1
Israelitish	1
woman's	1
son	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
cursed.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Moses:	1
(and	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Shelomith,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Dibri,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Dan:)	1
24:12	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
ward,	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
might	1
be	1
shewed	1
them.	1
	1
24:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
24:14	1
Bring	1
forth	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
cursed	1
without	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
stone	1
him.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Whosoever	1
curseth	1
his	1
God	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
sin.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
blasphemeth	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
certainly	1
stone	1
him:	1
as	1
well	1
the	1
stranger,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
when	1
he	1
blasphemeth	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
a	1
beast	1
shall	1
make	1
it	1
good;	1
beast	1
for	1
beast.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
cause	1
a	1
blemish	1
in	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
done,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
him;	1
24:20	1
Breach	1
for	1
breach,	1
eye	1
for	1
eye,	1
tooth	1
for	1
tooth:	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
caused	1
a	1
blemish	1
in	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
a	1
beast,	1
he	1
shall	1
restore	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
24:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
manner	1
of	1
law,	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
stranger,	1
as	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
country:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
cursed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
stone	1
him	1
with	1
stones.	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
25:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
saying,	1
25:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
you,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
keep	1
a	1
sabbath	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:3	1
Six	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sow	1
thy	1
field,	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prune	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
gather	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof;	1
25:4	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest	1
unto	1
the	1
land,	1
a	1
sabbath	1
for	1
the	1
LORD:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
neither	1
sow	1
thy	1
field,	1
nor	1
prune	1
thy	1
vineyard.	1
	1
25:5	1
That	1
which	1
groweth	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
accord	1
of	1
thy	1
harvest	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
reap,	1
neither	1
gather	1
the	1
grapes	1
of	1
thy	1
vine	1
undressed:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
year	1
of	1
rest	1
unto	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
you;	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
maid,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
hired	1
servant,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
for	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
thy	1
land,	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
increase	1
thereof	1
be	1
meat.	1
	1
25:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
number	1
seven	1
sabbaths	1
of	1
years	1
unto	1
thee,	1
seven	1
times	1
seven	1
years;	1
and	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
sabbaths	1
of	1
years	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
forty	1
and	1
nine	1
years.	1
	1
25:9	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
cause	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
the	1
jubile	1
to	1
sound	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
atonement	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
the	1
trumpet	1
sound	1
throughout	1
all	1
your	1
land.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
hallow	1
the	1
fiftieth	1
year,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
liberty	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
jubile	1
unto	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
possession,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
family.	1
	1
25:11	1
A	1
jubile	1
shall	1
that	1
fiftieth	1
year	1
be	1
unto	1
you:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
sow,	1
neither	1
reap	1
that	1
which	1
groweth	1
of	1
itself	1
in	1
it,	1
nor	1
gather	1
the	1
grapes	1
in	1
it	1
of	1
thy	1
vine	1
undressed.	1
	1
25:12	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
jubile;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
you:	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
increase	1
thereof	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
25:13	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
this	1
jubile	1
ye	1
shall	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
sell	1
ought	1
unto	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
or	1
buyest	1
ought	1
of	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
hand,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
oppress	1
one	1
another:	1
25:15	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
after	1
the	1
jubile	1
thou	1
shalt	1
buy	1
of	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
fruits	1
he	1
shall	1
sell	1
unto	1
thee:	1
25:16	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
increase	1
the	1
price	1
thereof,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fewness	1
of	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
diminish	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
it:	1
for	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
fruits	1
doth	1
he	1
sell	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
25:17	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
therefore	1
oppress	1
one	1
another;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
fear	1
thy	1
God:for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
25:18	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
safety.	1
	1
25:19	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
yield	1
her	1
fruit,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
your	1
fill,	1
and	1
dwell	1
therein	1
in	1
safety.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
eat	1
the	1
seventh	1
year?	1
behold,	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
sow,	1
nor	1
gather	1
in	1
our	1
increase:	1
25:21	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
command	1
my	1
blessing	1
upon	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
year,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
for	1
three	1
years.	1
	1
25:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
sow	1
the	1
eighth	1
year,	1
and	1
eat	1
yet	1
of	1
old	1
fruit	1
until	1
the	1
ninth	1
year;	1
until	1
her	1
fruits	1
come	1
in	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
store.	1
	1
25:23	1
The	1
land	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
sold	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
mine,	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
strangers	1
and	1
sojourners	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
possession	1
ye	1
shall	1
grant	1
a	1
redemption	1
for	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
25:25	1
If	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
waxen	1
poor,	1
and	1
hath	1
sold	1
away	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
kin	1
come	1
to	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
redeem	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
brother	1
sold.	1
	1
25:26	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
have	1
none	1
to	1
redeem	1
it,	1
and	1
himself	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
redeem	1
it;	1
25:27	1
Then	1
let	1
him	1
count	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
sale	1
thereof,	1
and	1
restore	1
the	1
overplus	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
sold	1
it;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
25:28	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
restore	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
sold	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
bought	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
jubile	1
it	1
shall	1
go	1
out,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
25:29	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
sell	1
a	1
dwelling	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
walled	1
city,	1
then	1
he	1
may	1
redeem	1
it	1
within	1
a	1
whole	1
year	1
after	1
it	1
is	1
sold;	1
within	1
a	1
full	1
year	1
may	1
he	1
redeem	1
it.	1
	1
25:30	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
redeemed	1
within	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
full	1
year,	1
then	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
walled	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
bought	1
it	1
throughout	1
his	1
generations:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
jubile.	1
	1
25:31	1
But	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
villages	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
wall	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
as	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
the	1
country:	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
redeemed,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
jubile.	1
	1
25:32	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
their	1
possession,	1
may	1
the	1
Levites	1
redeem	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
	1
25:33	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
then	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
was	1
sold,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile:	1
for	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
are	1
their	1
possession	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
25:34	1
But	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
the	1
suburbs	1
of	1
their	1
cities	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
sold;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
their	1
perpetual	1
possession.	1
	1
25:35	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
waxen	1
poor,	1
and	1
fallen	1
in	1
decay	1
with	1
thee;	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
relieve	1
him:	1
yea,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
stranger,	1
or	1
a	1
sojourner;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
live	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
25:36	1
Take	1
thou	1
no	1
usury	1
of	1
him,	1
or	1
increase:	1
but	1
fear	1
thy	1
God;	1
that	1
thy	1
brother	1
may	1
live	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
25:37	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
thy	1
money	1
upon	1
usury,	1
nor	1
lend	1
him	1
thy	1
victuals	1
for	1
increase.	1
	1
25:38	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
25:39	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
by	1
thee	1
be	1
waxen	1
poor,	1
and	1
be	1
sold	1
unto	1
thee;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
compel	1
him	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
bondservant:	1
25:40	1
But	1
as	1
an	1
hired	1
servant,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
sojourner,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
serve	1
thee	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile.	1
	1
25:41	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
depart	1
from	1
thee,	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
family,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
fathers	1
shall	1
he	1
return.	1
	1
25:42	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
servants,	1
which	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
sold	1
as	1
bondmen.	1
	1
25:43	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
rule	1
over	1
him	1
with	1
rigour;	1
but	1
shalt	1
fear	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
25:44	1
Both	1
thy	1
bondmen,	1
and	1
thy	1
bondmaids,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have,	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
you;	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
ye	1
buy	1
bondmen	1
and	1
bondmaids.	1
	1
25:45	1
Moreover	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
do	1
sojourn	1
among	1
you,	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
ye	1
buy,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
families	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
you,	1
which	1
they	1
begat	1
in	1
your	1
land:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
possession.	1
	1
25:46	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
as	1
an	1
inheritance	1
for	1
your	1
children	1
after	1
you,	1
to	1
inherit	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
possession;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
bondmen	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
over	1
your	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
rule	1
one	1
over	1
another	1
with	1
rigour.	1
	1
25:47	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
sojourner	1
or	1
stranger	1
wax	1
rich	1
by	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
brother	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
by	1
him	1
wax	1
poor,	1
and	1
sell	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
stranger	1
or	1
sojourner	1
by	1
thee,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
the	1
stranger's	1
family:	1
25:48	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
sold	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
redeemed	1
again;	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
may	1
redeem	1
him:	1
25:49	1
Either	1
his	1
uncle,	1
or	1
his	1
uncle's	1
son,	1
may	1
redeem	1
him,	1
or	1
any	1
that	1
is	1
nigh	1
of	1
kin	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
may	1
redeem	1
him;	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
able,	1
he	1
may	1
redeem	1
himself.	1
	1

And	1
he	1
shall	1
reckon	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
bought	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sold	1
to	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile:	1
and	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
his	1
sale	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
years,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
an	1
hired	1
servant	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
25:51	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
yet	1
many	1
years	1
behind,	1
according	1
unto	1
them	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
again	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
his	1
redemption	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
bought	1
for.	1
	1
25:52	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
remain	1
but	1
few	1
years	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
count	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
according	1
unto	1
his	1
years	1
shall	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
his	1
redemption.	1
	1
25:53	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
yearly	1
hired	1
servant	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1

shall	1
not	1
rule	1
with	1
rigour	1
over	1
him	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
25:54	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
redeemed	1
in	1
these	1
years,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile,	1
both	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
25:55	1
For	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
servants;	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
servants	1
whom	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
26:1	1
Ye	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
no	1
idols	1
nor	1
graven	1
image,	1
neither	1
rear	1
you	1
up	1
a	1
standing	1
image,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
set	1
up	1
any	1
image	1
of	1
stone	1
in	1
your	1
land,	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
unto	1
it:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
26:2	1
Ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
reverence	1
my	1
sanctuary:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:3	1
If	1
ye	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
26:4	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
rain	1
in	1
due	1
season,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
yield	1
her	1
increase,	1
and	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
yield	1
their	1
fruit.	1
	1
26:5	1
And	1
your	1
threshing	1
shall	1
reach	1
unto	1
the	1
vintage,	1
and	1
the	1
vintage	1
shall	1
reach	1
unto	1
the	1
sowing	1
time:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
your	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
land	1
safely.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
afraid:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rid	1
evil	1
beasts	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sword	1
go	1
through	1
your	1
land.	1
	1
26:7	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
chase	1
your	1
enemies,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
before	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
26:8	1
And	1
five	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
chase	1
an	1
hundred,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
put	1
ten	1
thousand	1
to	1
flight:	1
and	1
your	1
enemies	1
shall	1
fall	1
before	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
26:9	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
respect	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply	1
you,	1
and	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
26:10	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
old	1
store,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
old	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
new.	1
	1
26:11	1
And	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
tabernacle	1
among	1
you:	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
not	1
abhor	1
you.	1
	1
26:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
26:13	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
their	1
bondmen;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
your	1
yoke,	1
and	1
made	1
you	1
go	1
upright.	1
	1
26:14	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
commandments;	1
26:15	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
despise	1
my	1
statutes,	1
or	1
if	1
your	1
soul	1
abhor	1
my	1
judgments,	1
so	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
all	1
my	1
commandments,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
break	1
my	1
covenant:	1
26:16	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
unto	1
you;	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
appoint	1
over	1
you	1
terror,	1
consumption,	1
and	1
the	1
burning	1
ague,	1
that	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
cause	1
sorrow	1
of	1
heart:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
sow	1
your	1
seed	1
in	1
vain,	1
for	1
your	1
enemies	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
26:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
before	1
your	1
enemies:	1
they	1
that	1
hate	1
you	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
flee	1
when	1
none	1
pursueth	1
you.	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
seven	1
times	1
more	1
for	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
26:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
power;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
your	1
heaven	1
as	1
iron,	1
and	1
your	1
earth	1
as	1
brass:	1
26:20	1
And	1
your	1
strength	1
shall	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
your	1
land	1
shall	1
not	1
yield	1
her	1
increase,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
yield	1
their	1
fruits.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me;	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
seven	1
times	1
more	1
plagues	1
upon	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
26:22	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
send	1
wild	1
beasts	1
among	1
you,	1
which	1
shall	1
rob	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
children,	1
and	1
destroy	1
your	1
cattle,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
few	1
in	1
number;	1
and	1
your	1
high	1
ways	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate.	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
reformed	1
by	1
me	1
by	1
these	1
things,	1
but	1
will	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
me;	1
26:24	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
yet	1
seven	1
times	1
for	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
26:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
a	1
sword	1
upon	1
you,	1
that	1
shall	1
avenge	1
the	1
quarrel	1
of	1
my	1
covenant:	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
within	1
your	1
cities,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
the	1
pestilence	1
among	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
26:26	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
your	1
bread,	1
ten	1
women	1
shall	1
bake	1
your	1
bread	1
in	1
one	1
oven,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
your	1
bread	1
again	1
by	1
weight:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied.	1
	1
26:27	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
me;	1
26:28	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
you	1
also	1
in	1
fury;	1
and	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
chastise	1
you	1
seven	1
times	1
for	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
26:29	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
your	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
your	1
images,	1
and	1
cast	1
your	1
carcases	1
upon	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
your	1
idols,	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
abhor	1
you.	1
	1
26:31	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
your	1
cities	1
waste,	1
and	1
bring	1
your	1
sanctuaries	1
unto	1
desolation,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
smell	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
your	1
sweet	1
odours.	1
	1
26:32	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
desolation:	1
and	1
your	1
enemies	1
which	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
26:33	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
you	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
will	1
draw	1
out	1
a	1
sword	1
after	1
you:	1
and	1
your	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
your	1
cities	1
waste.	1
	1
26:34	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
enjoy	1
her	1
sabbaths,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
lieth	1
desolate,	1
and	1
ye	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
enemies'	1
land;	1
even	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
rest,	1
and	1
enjoy	1
her	1
sabbaths.	1
	1
26:35	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
lieth	1
desolate	1
it	1
shall	1
rest;	1
because	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
rest	1
in	1
your	1
sabbaths,	1
when	1
ye	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
26:36	1
And	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
alive	1
of	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
faintness	1
into	1
their	1
hearts	1
in	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
shaken	1
leaf	1
shall	1
chase	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
flee,	1
as	1
fleeing	1
from	1
a	1
sword;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
when	1
none	1
pursueth.	1
	1
26:37	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
one	1
upon	1
another,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
before	1
a	1
sword,	1
when	1
none	1
pursueth:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
your	1
enemies.	1
	1
26:38	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
perish	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
shall	1
eat	1
you	1
up.	1
	1
26:39	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
pine	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
iniquity	1
in	1
your	1
enemies'	1
lands;	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
shall	1
they	1
pine	1
away	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
26:40	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
confess	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
with	1
their	1
trespass	1
which	1
they	1
trespassed	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
also	1
they	1
have	1
walked	1
contrary	1
unto	1
me;	1
26:41	1
And	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
walked	1
contrary	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
enemies;	1
if	1
then	1
their	1
uncircumcised	1
hearts	1
be	1
humbled,	1
and	1
they	1
then	1
accept	1
of	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
26:42	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
Abraham	1
will	1
I	1
remember;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
26:43	1
The	1
land	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
enjoy	1
her	1
sabbaths,	1
while	1
she	1
lieth	1
desolate	1
without	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
accept	1
of	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
because,	1
even	1
because	1
they	1
despised	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
because	1
their	1
soul	1
abhorred	1
my	1
statutes.	1
	1
26:44	1
And	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
when	1
they	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
cast	1
them	1
away,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
abhor	1
them,	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
utterly,	1
and	1
to	1
break	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
26:45	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
remember	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
their	1
ancestors,	1
whom	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
their	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:46	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments	1
and	1
laws,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
27:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
make	1
a	1
singular	1
vow,	1
the	1
persons	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
thy	1
estimation.	1
	1
27:3	1
And	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
male	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
even	1
unto	1
sixty	1
years	1
old,	1
even	1
thy	1

shall	1
be	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
27:4	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
female,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
thirty	1
shekels.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
even	1
unto	1
twenty	1
years	1
old,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
male	1
twenty	1
shekels,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
female	1
ten	1
shekels.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
a	1
month	1
old	1
even	1
unto	1
five	1
years	1
old,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
male	1
five	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
female	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
three	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
sixty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
above;	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
male,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
fifteen	1
shekels,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
female	1
ten	1
shekels.	1
	1
27:8	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
poorer	1
than	1
thy	1
estimation,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
present	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
value	1
him;	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ability	1
that	1
vowed	1
shall	1
the	1
priest	1
value	1
him.	1
	1
27:9	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
beast,	1
whereof	1
men	1
bring	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
giveth	1
of	1
such	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
27:10	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
alter	1
it,	1
nor	1
change	1
it,	1
a	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
bad,	1
or	1
a	1
bad	1
for	1
a	1
good:	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
at	1
all	1
change	1
beast	1
for	1
beast,	1
then	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
exchange	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
any	1
unclean	1
beast,	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
present	1
the	1
beast	1
before	1
the	1
priest:	1
27:12	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
value	1
it,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad:	1
as	1
thou	1
valuest	1
it,	1
who	1
art	1
the	1
priest,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be.	1
	1
27:13	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
at	1
all	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
add	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
thereof	1
unto	1
thy	1
estimation.	1
	1
27:14	1
And	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
estimate	1
it,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad:	1
as	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
estimate	1
it,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
stand.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
that	1
sanctified	1
it	1
will	1
redeem	1
his	1
house,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
add	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
thy	1
estimation	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
seed	1
thereof:	1
an	1
homer	1
of	1
barley	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
valued	1
at	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
27:17	1
If	1
he	1
sanctify	1
his	1
field	1
from	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
estimation	1
it	1
shall	1
stand.	1
	1
27:18	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
sanctify	1
his	1
field	1
after	1
the	1
jubile,	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
reckon	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
money	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
years	1
that	1
remain,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
jubile,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
abated	1
from	1
thy	1
estimation.	1
	1
27:19	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
that	1
sanctified	1
the	1
field	1
will	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
add	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
thy	1
estimation	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
assured	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
redeem	1
the	1
field,	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
sold	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
another	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
redeemed	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
27:21	1
But	1
the	1
field,	1
when	1
it	1
goeth	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
jubile,	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
a	1
field	1
devoted;	1
the	1
possession	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
sanctify	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
field	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
bought,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
his	1
possession;	1
27:23	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
reckon	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
thy	1
estimation,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
jubile:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
thine	1
estimation	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
as	1
a	1
holy	1
thing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:24	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
jubile	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
bought,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
did	1
belong.	1
	1
27:25	1
And	1
all	1
thy	1
estimations	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
twenty	1
gerahs	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
shekel.	1
	1
27:26	1
Only	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
the	1
beasts,	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's	1
firstling,	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
it;	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
ox,	1
or	1
sheep:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
27:27	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
an	1
unclean	1
beast,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
redeem	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
estimation,	1
and	1
shall	1
add	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
thereto:	1
or	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
redeemed,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
sold	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
estimation.	1
	1
27:28	1
Notwithstanding	1
no	1
devoted	1
thing,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
devote	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
both	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
beast,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
shall	1
be	1
sold	1
or	1
redeemed:	1
every	1
devoted	1
thing	1
is	1
most	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:29	1
None	1
devoted,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
devoted	1
of	1
men,	1
shall	1
be	1
redeemed;	1
but	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
whether	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's:	1
it	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:31	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
will	1
at	1
all	1
redeem	1
ought	1
of	1
his	1
tithes,	1
he	1
shall	1
add	1
thereto	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
thereof.	1
	1
27:32	1
And	1
concerning	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
the	1
herd,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
even	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
passeth	1
under	1
the	1
rod,	1
the	1
tenth	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:33	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
search	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
change	1
it:	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
change	1
it	1
at	1
all,	1
then	1
both	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
change	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
holy;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
redeemed.	1
	1
27:34	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
commandments,	1
which	1
the	1

But	1

	1
1:51	1
And	1
when	1

the	1

	1
1:52	1
And	1
the	1

	1
1:54	1
And	1
the	1

Moses,	1
so	1

they.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1

unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
2:2	1
Every	1
man	1

the	1

Israel	1
shall	1

And	1
the	1

And	1

	1
3:3	1
These	1

	1
3:4	1
And	1
Nadab	1
and	1
Abihu	1
died	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
they	1
offered	1
strange	1
fire	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
they	1

and	1
Eleazar	1

Ithamar	1
ministered	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Aaron	1
their	1

	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
3:6	1
Bring	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi	1
near,	1
and	1
present	1
them	1
before	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
his	1

of	1
the	1

before	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
all	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1

of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

	1
3:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
the	1
Levites	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons:	1
they	1
are	1
wholly	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
appoint	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
wait	1
on	1
their	1
priest's	1
office:	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
cometh	1
nigh	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
3:12	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
instead	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
therefore	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
be	1
mine;	1
3:13	1
Because	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
are	1
mine;	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
I	1
hallowed	1
unto	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
Israel,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast:	1
mine	1
shall	1
they	1
be:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
saying,	1
3:15	1
Number	1

shalt	1
thou	1
number	1
them.	1
	1

the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
burden	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
4:48	1
Even	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
numbered	1
of	1
them,	1
were	1
eight	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore,	1
4:49	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
were	1
numbered	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses,	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
service,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
burden:	1
thus	1
were	1
they	1
numbered	1
of	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
5:2	1
Command	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
every	1
leper,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
issue,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
is	1
defiled	1
by	1
the	1
dead:	1
5:3	1
Both	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
shall	1
ye	1
put	1
out,	1
without	1
the	1
camp	1
shall	1
ye	1
put	1
them;	1
that	1
they	1
defile	1
not	1
their	1
camps,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
whereof	1
I	1
dwell.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
out	1
without	1
the	1
camp:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
5:6	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
shall	1
commit	1
any	1
sin	1
that	1
men	1
commit,	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
trespass	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
person	1
be	1
guilty;	1
5:7	1
Then	1
they	1
shall	1
confess	1
their	1
sin	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
done:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
recompense	1
his	1
trespass	1
with	1
the	1
principal	1
thereof,	1
and	1
add	1
unto	1
it	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
thereof,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
trespassed.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
have	1
no	1
kinsman	1
to	1
recompense	1
the	1
trespass	1
unto,	1
let	1
the	1
trespass	1
be	1
recompensed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
priest;	1
beside	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1
atonement,	1
whereby	1
an	1
atonement	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
every	1
offering	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
shall	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
every	1
man's	1
hallowed	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
his:	1
whatsoever	1
any	1
man	1
giveth	1
the	1
priest,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
5:12	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
wife	1
go	1
aside,	1
and	1
commit	1
a	1
trespass	1
against	1
him,	1
5:13	1
And	1
a	1
man	1
lie	1
with	1
her	1
carnally,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
be	1
kept	1
close,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
witness	1
against	1
her,	1
neither	1
she	1
be	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
manner;	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
jealousy	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
defiled:	1
or	1
if	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
jealousy	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
not	1
defiled:	1
5:15	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
man	1
bring	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
her	1
offering	1
for	1
her,	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
barley	1
meal;	1
he	1
shall	1
pour	1
no	1
oil	1
upon	1
it,	1
nor	1
put	1
frankincense	1
thereon;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
memorial,	1
bringing	1
iniquity	1
to	1
remembrance.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
bring	1
her	1
near,	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
5:17	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
holy	1
water	1
in	1
an	1
earthen	1
vessel;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
water:	1
5:18	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
set	1
the	1
woman	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
uncover	1
the	1
woman's	1
head,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
memorial	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
jealousy	1
offering:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
have	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
bitter	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse:	1
5:19	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
charge	1
her	1
by	1
an	1
oath,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
If	1
no	1
man	1
have	1
lain	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
gone	1
aside	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
with	1
another	1
instead	1
of	1
thy	1
husband,	1
be	1
thou	1
free	1
from	1
this	1
bitter	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse:	1
5:20	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
gone	1
aside	1
to	1
another	1
instead	1
of	1
thy	1
husband,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
some	1
man	1
have	1
lain	1
with	1
thee	1
beside	1
thine	1
husband:	1
5:21	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
charge	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
cursing,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
The	1
LORD	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
curse	1
and	1
an	1
oath	1
among	1
thy	1
people,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
make	1
thy	1
thigh	1
to	1
rot,	1
and	1
thy	1
belly	1
to	1
swell;	1
5:22	1
And	1
this	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
thy	1
bowels,	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
belly	1
to	1
swell,	1
and	1
thy	1
thigh	1
to	1
rot:	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
shall	1
say,	1
Amen,	1
amen.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
write	1
these	1
curses	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
blot	1
them	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
bitter	1
water:	1
5:24	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
bitter	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse:	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
her,	1
and	1
become	1
bitter.	1
	1
5:25	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
jealousy	1
offering	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
woman's	1
hand,	1
and	1
shall	1
wave	1
the	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
offer	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
5:26	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
an	1
handful	1
of	1
the	1
offering,	1
even	1
the	1
memorial	1
thereof,	1
and	1
burn	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
afterward	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
her	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
water,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
trespass	1
against	1
her	1
husband,	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
her,	1
and	1
become	1
bitter,	1
and	1
her	1
belly	1
shall	1
swell,	1
and	1
her	1
thigh	1
shall	1
rot:	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
curse	1
among	1
her	1
people.	1
	1
5:28	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
be	1
not	1
defiled,	1
but	1
be	1
clean;	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
free,	1
and	1
shall	1
conceive	1
seed.	1
	1
5:29	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
jealousies,	1
when	1
a	1
wife	1
goeth	1
aside	1
to	1
another	1
instead	1
of	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
is	1
defiled;	1
5:30	1
Or	1
when	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
jealousy	1
cometh	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
jealous	1
over	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
the	1
woman	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
execute	1
upon	1
her	1
all	1
this	1
law.	1
	1
5:31	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
man	1
be	1
guiltless	1
from	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
this	1
woman	1
shall	1
bear	1
her	1
iniquity.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
either	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
shall	1
separate	1
themselves	1
to	1
vow	1
a	1
vow	1
of	1
a	1
Nazarite,	1
to	1
separate	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
6:3	1
He	1
shall	1
separate	1
himself	1
from	1
wine	1
and	1
strong	1
drink,	1
and	1
shall	1
drink	1
no	1
vinegar	1
of	1
wine,	1
or	1
vinegar	1
of	1
strong	1
drink,	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
drink	1
any	1
liquor	1
of	1
grapes,	1
nor	1
eat	1
moist	1
grapes,	1
or	1
dried.	1
	1
6:4	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
separation	1
shall	1
he	1
eat	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
vine	1
tree,	1
from	1
the	1
kernels	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
husk.	1
	1
6:5	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
vow	1
of	1
his	1
separation	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
razor	1
come	1
upon	1
his	1
head:	1
until	1
the	1
days	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
separateth	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holy,	1
and	1
shall	1
let	1
the	1
locks	1
of	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
grow.	1
	1
6:6	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
he	1
separateth	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
at	1
no	1
dead	1
body.	1
	1
6:7	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
himself	1
unclean	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
for	1
his	1
mother,	1
for	1
his	1
brother,	1
or	1
for	1
his	1
sister,	1
when	1
they	1
die:	1
because	1
the	1
consecration	1
of	1
his	1
God	1
is	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
6:8	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
separation	1
he	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
die	1
very	1
suddenly	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
defiled	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
consecration;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
shave	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
cleansing,	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
shall	1
he	1
shave	1
it.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
two	1
turtles,	1
or	1
two	1
young	1
pigeons,	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
6:11	1
And	1
the	1

shall	1
offer	1
the	1
one	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1

and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
sinned	1
by	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
shall	1
hallow	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
same	1
day.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
consecrate	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
separation,	1
and	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
lamb	1
of	1
the	1

for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
but	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
shall	1
be	1
lost,	1
because	1
his	1
separation	1
was	1
defiled.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Nazarite,	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
separation	1
are	1
fulfilled:	1
he	1

be	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
6:14	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1

his	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
one	1
he	1
lamb	1
of	1
the	1

	1
6:16	1
And	1
the	1

saying,	1
On	1

ye	1

Israel,	1
saying	1
unto	1

6:24	1
The	1

bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
keep	1
thee:	1
6:25	1
The	1
LORD	1
make	1
his	1
face	1
shine	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
thee:	1
6:26	1
The	1
LORD	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
countenance	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
peace.	1
	1
6:27	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
put	1
my	1
name	1
upon	1
the	1

of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1

And	1

the	1
vessels	1
thereof,	1
and	1
had	1
anointed	1

sanctified	1
them;	1
7:2	1
That	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
who	1

they	1
brought	1

	1
7:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
7:5	1
Take	1
it	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
service.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
wagons	1
and	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
7:7	1
Two	1
wagons	1
and	1
four	1
oxen	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Gershon,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
service:	1
7:8	1
And	1
four	1
wagons	1
and	1
eight	1
oxen	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1

of	1
Merari,	1

under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Ithamar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
7:9	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Kohath	1
he	1
gave	1
none:	1
because	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
belonging	1
unto	1
them	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bear	1

	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1

They	1

with	1

speaking	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
off	1

mercy	1
seat	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
testimony,	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
two	1

and	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
8:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
When	1
thou	1
lightest	1
the	1
lamps,	1
the	1
seven	1
lamps	1
shall	1
give	1
light	1
over	1
against	1

And	1
Aaron	1
did	1
so;	1
he	1
lighted	1
the	1
lamps	1
thereof	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
candlestick,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
this	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
candlestick	1
was	1
of	1
beaten	1
gold,	1
unto	1
the	1
shaft	1
thereof,	1
unto	1
the	1
flowers	1
thereof,	1
was	1
beaten	1
work:	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
pattern	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
shewed	1
Moses,	1
so	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
candlestick.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
8:6	1
Take	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
cleanse	1
them.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
unto	1
them,	1
to	1
cleanse	1
them:	1
Sprinkle	1
water	1
of	1
purifying	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
shave	1
all	1
their	1
flesh,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
wash	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
so	1
make	1
themselves	1
clean.	1
	1
8:8	1
Then	1
let	1
them	1
take	1
a	1
young	1
bullock	1
with	1
his	1
meat	1
offering,	1
even	1
fine	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
another	1
young	1
bullock	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
the	1
Levites	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
gather	1
the	1
whole	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
together:	1
8:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
the	1
Levites	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
put	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
Levites:	1
8:11	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
offer	1
the	1
Levites	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
execute	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
bullocks:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
the	1
one	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
the	1
Levites	1
before	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:14	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
separate	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
be	1
mine.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
shall	1
the	1
Levites	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cleanse	1
them,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
for	1
an	1
offering.	1
	1
8:16	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
wholly	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
instead	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
open	1
every	1
womb,	1
even	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
have	1
I	1
taken	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
mine,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast:	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
smote	1
every	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
I	1
sanctified	1
them	1
for	1
myself.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
Levites	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
Levites	1
as	1
a	1
gift	1
to	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
plague	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
Moses,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
Levites	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
concerning	1
the	1
Levites,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
purified,	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
their	1
clothes;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
offered	1
them	1
as	1
an	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
made	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
cleanse	1
them.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
went	1
the	1
Levites	1
in	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
sons:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
concerning	1
the	1
Levites,	1
so	1
did	1
they	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
8:24	1
This	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites:	1
from	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
8:25	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
fifty	1
years	1
they	1
shall	1
cease	1
waiting	1
upon	1
the	1
service	1
thereof,	1
and	1
shall	1
serve	1
no	1
more:	1
8:26	1
But	1
shall	1
minister	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
charge,	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
service.	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites	1
touching	1
their	1
charge.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
saying,	1
9:2	1
Let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
also	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
at	1
his	1
appointed	1
season.	1
	1
9:3	1
In	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
month,	1
at	1
even,	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
appointed	1
season:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rites	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
ye	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
passover	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
at	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
men,	1
who	1
were	1
defiled	1
by	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
on	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
before	1
Moses	1
and	1
before	1
Aaron	1
on	1
that	1
day:	1
9:7	1
And	1
those	1
men	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
defiled	1
by	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man:	1
wherefore	1
are	1
we	1
kept	1
back,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
his	1
appointed	1
season	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Stand	1
still,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
command	1
concerning	1
you.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
9:10	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
of	1
you	1
or	1
of	1
your	1
posterity	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
body,	1
or	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
journey	1
afar	1
off,	1
yet	1
he	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:11	1
The	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month	1
at	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
it,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
with	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
and	1
bitter	1
herbs.	1
	1
9:12	1
They	1
shall	1
leave	1
none	1
of	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
morning,	1
nor	1
break	1
any	1
bone	1
of	1
it:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
passover	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
clean,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
journey,	1
and	1
forbeareth	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
passover,	1
even	1
the	1
same	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people:	1
because	1
he	1
brought	1
not	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
his	1
appointed	1
season,	1
that	1
man	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
sin.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
sojourn	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
manner	1
thereof,	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
do:	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
ordinance,	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
stranger,	1
and	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
was	1
reared	1
up	1
the	1
cloud	1
covered	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
namely,	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
testimony:	1
and	1
at	1
even	1
there	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
fire,	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
9:16	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
alway:	1
the	1
cloud	1
covered	1
it	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
fire	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
then	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
cloud	1
abode,	1
there	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
9:18	1
At	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
pitched:	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
cloud	1
abode	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
they	1
rested	1
in	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
tarried	1
long	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
many	1
days,	1
then	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
kept	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
journeyed	1
not.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
abode	1
in	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
journeyed.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
abode	1
from	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
then	1
they	1
journeyed:	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
by	1
night	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up,	1
they	1
journeyed.	1
	1
9:22	1
Or	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
days,	1
or	1
a	1
month,	1
or	1
a	1
year,	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
tarried	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
remaining	1
thereon,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
abode	1
in	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
journeyed	1
not:	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
taken	1
up,	1
they	1
journeyed.	1
	1
9:23	1
At	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
rested	1
in	1
the	1
tents,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
journeyed:	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
10:2	1
Make	1
thee	1
two	1
trumpets	1
of	1
silver;	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
piece	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
them:	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
use	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
calling	1
of	1
the	1
assembly,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
journeying	1
of	1
the	1
camps.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
blow	1
with	1
them,	1
all	1
the	1
assembly	1
shall	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
to	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
blow	1
but	1
with	1
one	1
trumpet,	1
then	1
the	1
princes,	1
which	1
are	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
gather	1
themselves	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:5	1
When	1
ye	1
blow	1
an	1
alarm,	1
then	1
the	1
camps	1
that	1
lie	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
parts	1
shall	1
go	1
forward.	1
	1
10:6	1
When	1
ye	1
blow	1
an	1
alarm	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
then	1
the	1
camps	1
that	1
lie	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
shall	1
take	1
their	1
journey:	1
they	1
shall	1
blow	1
an	1
alarm	1
for	1
their	1
journeys.	1
	1
10:7	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
congregation	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
ye	1
shall	1
blow,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
sound	1
an	1
alarm.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
the	1
priests,	1
shall	1
blow	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
war	1
in	1
your	1
land	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
that	1
oppresseth	1
you,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
blow	1
an	1
alarm	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
remembered	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
your	1
enemies.	1
	1
10:10	1
Also	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
gladness,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
solemn	1
days,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
your	1
months,	1
ye	1
shall	1
blow	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets	1
over	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
your	1
peace	1
offerings;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
before	1
your	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year,	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
testimony.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
took	1
their	1
journeys	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai;	1
and	1
the	1
cloud	1
rested	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
they	1
first	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:14	1
In	1
the	1
first	1

and	1

	1
10:18	1
And	1

	1
10:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Hobab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Raguel	1
the	1
Midianite,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
We	1
are	1
journeying	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you:	1
come	1
thou	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
thee	1
good:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
good	1
concerning	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
depart	1
to	1
mine	1
own	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
kindred.	1
	1
10:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Leave	1
us	1
not,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee;	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
knowest	1
how	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
encamp	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
to	1
us	1
instead	1
of	1
eyes.	1
	1
10:32	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
thou	1
go	1
with	1
us,	1
yea,	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
what	1
goodness	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
us,	1
the	1
same	1
will	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:33	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
three	1
days'	1
journey:	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
before	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
days'	1
journey,	1
to	1
search	1
out	1
a	1
resting	1
place	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
10:34	1
And	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
by	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
ark	1
set	1
forward,	1
that	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
LORD,	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
enemies	1
be	1
scattered;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
thee	1
flee	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
rested,	1
he	1
said,	1
Return,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
complained,	1
it	1
displeased	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
it;	1
and	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled;	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
burnt	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
consumed	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
cried	1
unto	1
Moses;	1
and	1
when	1
Moses	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
fire	1
was	1
quenched.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Taberah:	1
because	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
burnt	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
the	1
mixt	1
multitude	1
that	1
was	1
among	1
them	1
fell	1
a	1
lusting:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
also	1
wept	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
shall	1
give	1
us	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
11:5	1
We	1
remember	1
the	1
fish,	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
eat	1
in	1
Egypt	1
freely;	1
the	1
cucumbers,	1
and	1
the	1
melons,	1
and	1
the	1
leeks,	1
and	1
the	1
onions,	1
and	1
the	1
garlick:	1
11:6	1
But	1
now	1
our	1
soul	1
is	1
dried	1
away:	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
beside	1
this	1
manna,	1
before	1
our	1
eyes.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
the	1
manna	1
was	1
as	1
coriander	1
seed,	1
and	1
the	1
colour	1
thereof	1
as	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
bdellium.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
about,	1
and	1
gathered	1
it,	1
and	1
ground	1
it	1
in	1
mills,	1
or	1
beat	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
mortar,	1
and	1
baked	1
it	1
in	1
pans,	1
and	1
made	1
cakes	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
fresh	1
oil.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
dew	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
the	1
manna	1
fell	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
11:10	1
Then	1
Moses	1
heard	1
the	1
people	1
weep	1
throughout	1
their	1
families,	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
tent:	1
and	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
greatly;	1
Moses	1
also	1
was	1
displeased.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
afflicted	1
thy	1
servant?	1
and	1
wherefore	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
that	1
thou	1
layest	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
upon	1
me?	1
	1
11:12	1
Have	1
I	1
conceived	1
all	1
this	1
people?	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
them,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
Carry	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
bosom,	1
as	1
a	1
nursing	1
father	1
beareth	1
the	1
sucking	1
child,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
swarest	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers?	1
	1
11:13	1
Whence	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
flesh	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
all	1
this	1
people?	1
for	1
they	1
weep	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Give	1
us	1
flesh,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat.	1
	1
11:14	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
alone,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
heavy	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
deal	1
thus	1
with	1
me,	1
kill	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
out	1
of	1
hand,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight;	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
wretchedness.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Gather	1
unto	1
me	1
seventy	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
thou	1
knowest	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
officers	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
stand	1
there	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
talk	1
with	1
thee	1
there:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
bear	1
it	1
not	1
thyself	1
alone.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
say	1
thou	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Sanctify	1
yourselves	1
against	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
flesh:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
wept	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
shall	1
give	1
us	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat?	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
flesh,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat.	1
	1
11:19	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
one	1
day,	1
nor	1
two	1
days,	1
nor	1
five	1
days,	1
neither	1
ten	1
days,	1
nor	1
twenty	1
days;	1
11:20	1
But	1
even	1
a	1
whole	1
month,	1
until	1
it	1
come	1
out	1
at	1
your	1
nostrils,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
loathsome	1
unto	1
you:	1
because	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
wept	1
before	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
came	1
we	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
The	1
people,	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
am,	1
are	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
footmen;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
flesh,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat	1
a	1
whole	1
month.	1
	1
11:22	1
Shall	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
the	1
herds	1
be	1
slain	1
for	1
them,	1
to	1
suffice	1
them?	1
	1
or	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
for	1
them,	1
to	1
suffice	1
them?	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand	1
waxed	1
short?	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
now	1
whether	1
my	1
word	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
unto	1
thee	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
11:24	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
seventy	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
seventy	1
elders:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
spirit	1
rested	1
upon	1
them,	1
they	1
prophesied,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
cease.	1
	1
11:26	1
But	1
there	1
remained	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
camp,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Eldad,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Medad:	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
rested	1
upon	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
written,	1
but	1
went	1
not	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
and	1
they	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
there	1
ran	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
told	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Eldad	1
and	1
Medad	1
do	1
prophesy	1
in	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Moses,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
lord	1
Moses,	1
forbid	1
them.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Enviest	1
thou	1
for	1
my	1
sake?	1
would	1
God	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
LORD's	1
people	1
were	1
prophets,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
put	1
his	1
spirit	1
upon	1
them!	1
	1
11:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
gat	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
forth	1
a	1
wind	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
brought	1
quails	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
camp,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
day's	1
journey	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
day's	1
journey	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
cubits	1
high	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
up	1
all	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
they	1
gathered	1
the	1
quails:	1
he	1
that	1
gathered	1
least	1
gathered	1
ten	1
homers:	1
and	1
they	1
spread	1
them	1
all	1
abroad	1
for	1
themselves	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
flesh	1
was	1
yet	1
between	1
their	1
teeth,	1
ere	1
it	1
was	1
chewed,	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
plague.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Kibrothhattaavah:	1
because	1
there	1
they	1
buried	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
lusted.	1
	1
11:35	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Kibrothhattaavah	1
unto	1
Hazeroth;	1
and	1
abode	1
at	1
Hazeroth.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
Miriam	1
and	1
Aaron	1
spake	1
against	1
Moses	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopian	1
woman	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
married:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
an	1
Ethiopian	1
woman.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
indeed	1
spoken	1
only	1
by	1
Moses?	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
spoken	1
also	1
by	1
us?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
12:3	1
(Now	1
the	1
man	1
Moses	1
was	1
very	1
meek,	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.)	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
suddenly	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
Miriam,	1
Come	1
out	1
ye	1
three	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
And	1
they	1
three	1
came	1
out.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
called	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Miriam:	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
came	1
forth.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hear	1
now	1
my	1
words:	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
prophet	1
among	1
you,	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
make	1
myself	1
known	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
and	1
will	1
speak	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
12:7	1
My	1
servant	1
Moses	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
who	1
is	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
mine	1
house.	1
	1
12:8	1
With	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
speak	1
mouth	1
to	1
mouth,	1
even	1
apparently,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
dark	1
speeches;	1
and	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
he	1
behold:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
were	1
ye	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
against	1
my	1
servant	1
Moses?	1
12:9	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
the	1
cloud	1
departed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
tabernacle;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Miriam	1
became	1
leprous,	1
white	1
as	1
snow:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
looked	1
upon	1
Miriam,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
she	1
was	1
leprous.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Alas,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
lay	1
not	1
the	1
sin	1
upon	1
us,	1
wherein	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
foolishly,	1
and	1
wherein	1
we	1
have	1
sinned.	1
	1
12:12	1
Let	1
her	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
dead,	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
half	1
consumed	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Heal	1
her	1
now,	1
O	1
God,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
If	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
but	1
spit	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
should	1
she	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
seven	1
days?	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
shut	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
camp	1
seven	1
days,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
received	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
Miriam	1
was	1
shut	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
camp	1
seven	1
days:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
journeyed	1
not	1
till	1
Miriam	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
afterward	1
the	1
people	1
removed	1
from	1
Hazeroth,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
13:2	1
Send	1
thou	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
search	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
of	1
every	1
tribe	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
shall	1
ye	1
send	1
a	1
man,	1
every	1
one	1
a	1
ruler	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran:	1
all	1
those	1
men	1
were	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
these	1
were	1
their	1

	1
13:16	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
Moses	1
sent	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
Oshea	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun	1
Jehoshua.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Get	1
you	1
up	1
this	1
way	1
southward,	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mountain:	1
13:18	1
And	1
see	1
the	1
land,	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
strong	1
or	1
weak,	1
few	1
or	1
many;	1
13:19	1
And	1
what	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
dwell	1
in,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad;	1
and	1
what	1
cities	1
they	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
dwell	1
in,	1
whether	1
in	1
tents,	1
or	1
in	1
strong	1
holds;	1
13:20	1
And	1
what	1
the	1
land	1
is,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
fat	1
or	1
lean,	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
wood	1
therein,	1
or	1
not.	1
And	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
bring	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
Now	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
firstripe	1
grapes.	1
	1
13:21	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
searched	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Zin	1
unto	1
Rehob,	1
as	1
men	1
come	1
to	1
Hamath.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
they	1
ascended	1
by	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Hebron;	1
where	1
Ahiman,	1
Sheshai,	1
and	1
Talmai,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Anak,	1
were.	1
(Now	1
Hebron	1
was	1
built	1
seven	1
years	1
before	1
Zoan	1
in	1
Egypt.)	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
Eshcol,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
from	1
thence	1
a	1
branch	1
with	1
one	1
cluster	1
of	1
grapes,	1
and	1
they	1
bare	1
it	1
between	1
two	1
upon	1
a	1
staff;	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
of	1
the	1
pomegranates,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
figs.	1
	1
13:24	1
The	1
place	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
brook	1
Eshcol,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
cluster	1
of	1
grapes	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cut	1
down	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
they	1
returned	1
from	1
searching	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
after	1
forty	1
days.	1
	1
13:26	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Moses,	1
and	1
to	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran,	1
to	1
Kadesh;	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
word	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
shewed	1
them	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
sentest	1
us,	1
and	1
surely	1
it	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:28	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
be	1
strong	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
are	1
walled,	1
and	1
very	1
great:	1
and	1
moreover	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Anak	1
there.	1
	1
13:29	1
The	1
Amalekites	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
south:	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
mountains:	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
dwell	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Jordan.	1
	1
13:30	1
And	1
Caleb	1
stilled	1
the	1
people	1
before	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
possess	1
it;	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
overcome	1
it.	1
	1
13:31	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
said,	1
We	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
people;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
stronger	1
than	1
we.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
up	1
an	1
evil	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
searched	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1
land,	1
through	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
search	1
it,	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
eateth	1
up	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
we	1
saw	1
in	1
it	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
stature.	1
	1
13:33	1
And	1
there	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
giants,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Anak,	1
which	1
come	1
of	1
the	1
giants:	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
sight	1
as	1
grasshoppers,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
cried;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
wept	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron:	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Would	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt!	1
or	1
would	1
God	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness!	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
us	1
unto	1
this	1
land,	1
to	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
that	1
our	1
wives	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
prey?	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
better	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
Egypt?	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
captain,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
14:5	1
Then	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
faces	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
searched	1
the	1
land,	1
rent	1
their	1
clothes:	1
14:7	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1
land,	1
which	1
we	1
passed	1
through	1
to	1
search	1
it,	1
is	1
an	1
exceeding	1
good	1
land.	1
	1
14:8	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
delight	1
in	1
us,	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
us	1
into	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
us;	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
14:9	1
Only	1
rebel	1
not	1
ye	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
fear	1
ye	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
bread	1
for	1
us:	1
their	1
defence	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
us:	1
fear	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
bade	1
stone	1
them	1
with	1
stones.	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
How	1
long	1
will	1
this	1
people	1
provoke	1
me?	1
	1
and	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
ere	1
they	1
believe	1
me,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
among	1
them?	1
	1
14:12	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
disinherit	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
greater	1
nation	1
and	1
mightier	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Then	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
hear	1
it,	1
(for	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
up	1
this	1
people	1
in	1
thy	1
might	1
from	1
among	1
them;)	1
14:14	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
land:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
thou	1
LORD	1
art	1
among	1
this	1
people,	1
that	1
thou	1
LORD	1
art	1
seen	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
that	1
thy	1
cloud	1
standeth	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
goest	1
before	1
them,	1
by	1
day	1
time	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
14:15	1
Now	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
kill	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
as	1
one	1
man,	1
then	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
thee	1
will	1
speak,	1
saying,	1
14:16	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
people	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
them,	1
therefore	1
he	1
hath	1
slain	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
now,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
my	1
LORD	1
be	1
great,	1
according	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken,	1
saying,	1
14:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
longsuffering,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
mercy,	1
forgiving	1
iniquity	1
and	1
transgression,	1
and	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
clearing	1
the	1
guilty,	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
generation.	1
	1
14:19	1
Pardon,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgiven	1
this	1
people,	1
from	1
Egypt	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
pardoned	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word:	1
14:21	1
But	1
as	1
truly	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:22	1
Because	1
all	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
glory,	1
and	1
my	1
miracles,	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
in	1
Egypt	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
have	1
tempted	1
me	1
now	1
these	1
ten	1
times,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
to	1
my	1
voice;	1
14:23	1
Surely	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
provoked	1
me	1
see	1
it:	1
14:24	1
But	1
my	1
servant	1
Caleb,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
another	1
spirit	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
hath	1
followed	1
me	1
fully,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
whereinto	1
he	1
went;	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
shall	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
14:25	1
(Now	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
valley.)	1
Tomorrow	1
turn	1
you,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
14:27	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
bear	1
with	1
this	1
evil	1
congregation,	1
which	1
murmur	1
against	1
me?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
murmurings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
murmur	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
14:28	1
Say	1
unto	1
them,	1
As	1
truly	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
you:	1
14:29	1
Your	1
carcases	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
numbered	1
of	1
you,	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
whole	1
number,	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward	1
which	1
have	1
murmured	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
14:30	1
Doubtless	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
concerning	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
save	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
your	1
little	1
ones,	1
which	1
ye	1
said	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
prey,	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
in,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
despised.	1
	1
14:32	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
your	1
carcases,	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:33	1
And	1
your	1
children	1
shall	1
wander	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years,	1
and	1
bear	1
your	1
whoredoms,	1
until	1
your	1
carcases	1
be	1
wasted	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:34	1
After	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
in	1
which	1
ye	1
searched	1
the	1
land,	1
even	1
forty	1
days,	1
each	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
year,	1
shall	1
ye	1
bear	1
your	1
iniquities,	1
even	1
forty	1
years,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
my	1
breach	1
of	1
promise.	1
	1
14:35	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
do	1
it	1
unto	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
congregation,	1
that	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
me:	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
14:36	1
And	1
the	1
men,	1
which	1
Moses	1
sent	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
land,	1
who	1
returned,	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
to	1
murmur	1
against	1
him,	1
by	1
bringing	1
up	1
a	1
slander	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
14:37	1
Even	1
those	1
men	1
that	1
did	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
evil	1
report	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
died	1
by	1
the	1
plague	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:38	1
But	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
land,	1
lived	1
still.	1
	1
14:39	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
these	1
sayings	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
mourned	1
greatly.	1
	1
14:40	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
gat	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
saying,	1
Lo,	1
we	1
be	1
here,	1
and	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
promised:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
sinned.	1
	1
14:41	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
do	1
ye	1
transgress	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper.	1
	1
14:42	1
Go	1
not	1
up,	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
not	1
among	1
you;	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
smitten	1
before	1
your	1
enemies.	1
	1
14:43	1
For	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
are	1
there	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
14:44	1
But	1
they	1
presumed	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
hill	1
top:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Moses,	1
departed	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
14:45	1
Then	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
came	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
that	1
hill,	1
and	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
discomfited	1
them,	1
even	1
unto	1
Hormah.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
15:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
habitations,	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you,	1
15:3	1
And	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
offering	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
or	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
performing	1
a	1
vow,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering,	1
or	1
in	1
your	1
solemn	1
feasts,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
of	1
the	1
herd	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
flock:	1
15:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
offereth	1
his	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
bring	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
of	1
a	1
tenth	1
deal	1
of	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
wine	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
shalt	1
thou	1
prepare	1
with	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
or	1
sacrifice,	1
for	1
one	1
lamb.	1
	1
15:6	1
Or	1
for	1
a	1
ram,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prepare	1
for	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
two	1
tenth	1
deals	1
of	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
wine,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
preparest	1
a	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
or	1
for	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
performing	1
a	1
vow,	1
or	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
15:9	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
bring	1
with	1
a	1
bullock	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
of	1
three	1
tenth	1
deals	1
of	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
half	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
half	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
wine,	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:11	1
Thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
one	1
bullock,	1
or	1
for	1
one	1
ram,	1
or	1
for	1
a	1
lamb,	1
or	1
a	1
kid.	1
	1
15:12	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
prepare,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
do	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
number.	1
	1
15:13	1
All	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
shall	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
in	1
offering	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
stranger	1
sojourn	1
with	1
you,	1
or	1
whosoever	1
be	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
generations,	1
and	1
will	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
ye	1
do,	1
so	1
he	1
shall	1
do.	1
	1
15:15	1
One	1
ordinance	1
shall	1
be	1
both	1
for	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
with	1
you,	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
generations:	1
as	1
ye	1
are,	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
stranger	1
be	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:16	1
One	1
law	1
and	1
one	1
manner	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
15:18	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
I	1
bring	1
you,	1
15:19	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
up	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:20	1
Ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
up	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
your	1
dough	1
for	1
an	1
heave	1
offering:	1
as	1
ye	1
do	1
the	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
threshingfloor,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
heave	1
it.	1
	1
15:21	1
Of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
your	1
dough	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
in	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
erred,	1
and	1
not	1
observed	1
all	1
these	1
commandments,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
15:23	1
Even	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses,	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
and	1
henceforward	1
among	1
your	1
generations;	1
15:24	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
ought	1
be	1
committed	1
by	1
ignorance	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
offer	1
one	1
young	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
with	1
his	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
his	1
drink	1
offering,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
manner,	1
and	1
one	1
kid	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
them;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
ignorance:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
their	1
offering,	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
sin	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
their	1
ignorance:	1
15:26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
them;	1
seeing	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
ignorance.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
soul	1
sin	1
through	1
ignorance,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
she	1
goat	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
sinneth	1
ignorantly,	1
when	1
he	1
sinneth	1
by	1
ignorance	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
15:29	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
law	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
sinneth	1
through	1
ignorance,	1
both	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
15:30	1
But	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
doeth	1
ought	1
presumptuously,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
the	1
same	1
reproacheth	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
15:31	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
despised	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hath	1
broken	1
his	1
commandment,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
utterly	1
be	1
cut	1
off;	1
his	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
15:32	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
gathered	1
sticks	1
upon	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
found	1
him	1
gathering	1
sticks	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
ward,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
declared	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
The	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
stone	1
him	1
with	1
stones	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
brought	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him	1
with	1
stones,	1
and	1
he	1
died;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
15:38	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
bid	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
make	1
them	1
fringes	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
their	1
garments	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
put	1
upon	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
the	1
borders	1
a	1
ribband	1
of	1
blue:	1
15:39	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
fringe,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
look	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
remember	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
seek	1
not	1
after	1
your	1
own	1
heart	1
and	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
after	1
which	1
ye	1
use	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
whoring:	1
15:40	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
remember,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
15:41	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
16:1	1
Now	1
Korah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Izhar,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kohath,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Levi,	1
and	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliab,	1
and	1
On,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Peleth,	1
sons	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
took	1
men:	1
16:2	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
Moses,	1
with	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
assembly,	1
famous	1
in	1
the	1
congregation,	1
men	1
of	1
renown:	1
16:3	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
take	1
too	1
much	1
upon	1
you,	1
seeing	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
are	1
holy,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
among	1
them:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
lift	1
ye	1
up	1
yourselves	1
above	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
when	1
Moses	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face:	1
16:5	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Korah	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
company,	1
saying,	1
Even	1
to	1
morrow	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
shew	1
who	1
are	1
his,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
holy;	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
him:	1
even	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
will	1
he	1
cause	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
16:6	1
This	1
do;	1
Take	1
you	1
censers,	1
Korah,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
company;	1
16:7	1
And	1
put	1
fire	1
therein,	1
and	1
put	1
incense	1
in	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
morrow:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
choose,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holy:	1
ye	1
take	1
too	1
much	1
upon	1
you,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Korah,	1
Hear,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi:	1
16:9	1
Seemeth	1
it	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
separated	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
bring	1
you	1
near	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
congregation	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
thee	1
near	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
brethren	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi	1
with	1
thee:	1
and	1
seek	1
ye	1
the	1
priesthood	1
also?	1
	1
16:11	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
both	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
company	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
Aaron,	1
that	1
ye	1
murmur	1
against	1
him?	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
to	1
call	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliab:	1
which	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
up:	1
16:13	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
to	1
kill	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
except	1
thou	1
make	1
thyself	1
altogether	1
a	1
prince	1
over	1
us?	1
	1
16:14	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
brought	1
us	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
or	1
given	1
us	1
inheritance	1
of	1
fields	1
and	1
vineyards:	1
wilt	1
thou	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
these	1
men?	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
up.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
very	1
wroth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Respect	1
not	1
thou	1
their	1
offering:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
taken	1
one	1
ass	1
from	1
them,	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
hurt	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Korah,	1
Be	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
company	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thou,	1
and	1
they,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
to	1
morrow:	1
16:17	1
And	1
take	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
censer,	1
and	1
put	1
incense	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
ye	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
censer,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
censers;	1
thou	1
also,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
his	1
censer.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
censer,	1
and	1
put	1
fire	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
laid	1
incense	1
thereon,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
with	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
Korah	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
against	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
16:21	1
Separate	1
yourselves	1
from	1
among	1
this	1
congregation,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
consume	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
shall	1
one	1
man	1
sin,	1
and	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
wroth	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
congregation?	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
16:24	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
about	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Korah,	1
Dathan,	1
and	1
Abiram.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
Moses	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram;	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
saying,	1
Depart,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
from	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
these	1
wicked	1
men,	1
and	1
touch	1
nothing	1
of	1
their's,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
consumed	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
16:27	1
So	1
they	1
gat	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Korah,	1
Dathan,	1
and	1
Abiram,	1
on	1
every	1
side:	1
and	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
their	1
sons,	1
and	1
their	1
little	1
children.	1
	1
16:28	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Hereby	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
works;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
them	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
16:29	1
If	1
these	1
men	1
die	1
the	1
common	1
death	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
visited	1
after	1
the	1
visitation	1
of	1
all	1
men;	1
then	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
16:30	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
LORD	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
thing,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
open	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallow	1
them	1
up,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
appertain	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
down	1
quick	1
into	1
the	1
pit;	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
understand	1
that	1
these	1
men	1
have	1
provoked	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
that	1
the	1
ground	1
clave	1
asunder	1
that	1
was	1
under	1
them:	1
16:32	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
their	1
houses,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
appertained	1
unto	1
Korah,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
goods.	1
	1
16:33	1
They,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
appertained	1
to	1
them,	1
went	1
down	1
alive	1
into	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
closed	1
upon	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
perished	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
fled	1
at	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Lest	1
the	1
earth	1
swallow	1
us	1
up	1
also.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
a	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
consumed	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
men	1
that	1
offered	1
incense.	1
	1
16:36	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
16:37	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
he	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
censers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
burning,	1
and	1
scatter	1
thou	1
the	1
fire	1
yonder;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
hallowed.	1
	1
16:38	1
The	1
censers	1
of	1
these	1
sinners	1
against	1
their	1
own	1
souls,	1
let	1
them	1
make	1
them	1
broad	1
plates	1
for	1
a	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
for	1
they	1
offered	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
hallowed:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:39	1
And	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
the	1
brasen	1
censers,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
burnt	1
had	1
offered;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
broad	1
plates	1
for	1
a	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
16:40	1
To	1
be	1
a	1
memorial	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
no	1
stranger,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
offer	1
incense	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
that	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
as	1
Korah,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
company:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
16:41	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
have	1
killed	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:42	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
gathered	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron,	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
cloud	1
covered	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared.	1
	1
16:43	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
came	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:44	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
16:45	1
Get	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
among	1
this	1
congregation,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
consume	1
them	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
And	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces.	1
	1
16:46	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
a	1
censer,	1
and	1
put	1
fire	1
therein	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
incense,	1
and	1
go	1
quickly	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
them:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
wrath	1
gone	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
LORD;	1
the	1
plague	1
is	1
begun.	1
	1
16:47	1
And	1
Aaron	1
took	1
as	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
congregation;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
begun	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
incense,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
16:48	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
the	1
living;	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
stayed.	1
	1
16:49	1
Now	1
they	1
that	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
plague	1
were	1
fourteen	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred,	1
beside	1
them	1
that	1
died	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
Korah.	1
	1
16:50	1
And	1
Aaron	1
returned	1
unto	1
Moses	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
stayed.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
17:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
rod	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
princes	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
twelve	1
rods:	1
write	1
thou	1
every	1
man's	1
name	1
upon	1
his	1
rod.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
write	1
Aaron's	1
name	1
upon	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
Levi:	1
for	1
one	1
rod	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lay	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
the	1
testimony,	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
man's	1
rod,	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
choose,	1
shall	1
blossom:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
murmurings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whereby	1
they	1
murmur	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
princes	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
rod	1
apiece,	1
for	1
each	1
prince	1
one,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
fathers'	1
houses,	1
even	1
twelve	1
rods:	1
and	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
Aaron	1
was	1
among	1
their	1
rods.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
laid	1
up	1
the	1
rods	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
Moses	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
Aaron	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Levi	1
was	1
budded,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
buds,	1
and	1
bloomed	1
blossoms,	1
and	1
yielded	1
almonds.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
rods	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
they	1
looked,	1
and	1
took	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
rod.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Bring	1
Aaron's	1
rod	1
again	1
before	1
the	1
testimony,	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
against	1
the	1
rebels;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
quite	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
murmurings	1
from	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
not.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
so:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him,	1
so	1
did	1
he.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
die,	1
we	1
perish,	1
we	1
all	1
perish.	1
	1
17:13	1
Whosoever	1
cometh	1
any	1
thing	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
die:	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
consumed	1
with	1
dying?	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
father's	1
house	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
and	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
your	1
priesthood.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
thy	1
brethren	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi,	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
bring	1
thou	1
with	1
thee,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee:	1
but	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
minister	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
thy	1
charge,	1
and	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
only	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
that	1
neither	1
they,	1
nor	1
ye	1
also,	1
die.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
and	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
wrath	1
any	1
more	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
your	1
brethren	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
to	1
you	1
they	1
are	1
given	1
as	1
a	1
gift	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
18:7	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
keep	1
your	1
priest's	1
office	1
for	1
everything	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
within	1
the	1
vail;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
serve:	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
your	1
priest's	1
office	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
service	1
of	1
gift:	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
cometh	1
nigh	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
mine	1
heave	1
offerings	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
hallowed	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
unto	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
them	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
anointing,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
sons,	1
by	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
18:9	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
thine	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
things,	1
reserved	1
from	1
the	1
fire:	1
every	1
oblation	1
of	1
theirs,	1
every	1
meat	1
offering	1
of	1
theirs,	1
and	1
every	1
sin	1
offering	1
of	1
theirs,	1
and	1
every	1
trespass	1
offering	1
of	1
theirs	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
render	1
unto	1
me,	1
shall	1
be	1
most	1
holy	1
for	1
thee	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
sons.	1
	1
18:10	1
In	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
it;	1
every	1
male	1
shall	1
eat	1
it:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
thine;	1
the	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
their	1
gift,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
wave	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
daughters	1
with	1
thee,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
clean	1
in	1
thy	1
house	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
18:12	1
All	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
oil,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wheat,	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
them	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
thee.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
first	1
ripe	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
shall	1
be	1
thine;	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
clean	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
18:14	1
Every	1
thing	1
devoted	1
in	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
thine.	1
	1
18:15	1
Every	1
thing	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix	1
in	1
all	1
flesh,	1
which	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
men	1
or	1
beasts,	1
shall	1
be	1
thine:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
man	1
shalt	1
thou	1
surely	1
redeem,	1
and	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
unclean	1
beasts	1
shalt	1
thou	1
redeem.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
redeemed	1
from	1
a	1
month	1
old	1
shalt	1
thou	1
redeem,	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
estimation,	1
for	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
five	1
shekels,	1
after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
which	1
is	1
twenty	1
gerahs.	1
	1
18:17	1
But	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
a	1
cow,	1
or	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
a	1
sheep,	1
or	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
a	1
goat,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
redeem;	1
they	1
are	1
holy:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sprinkle	1
their	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
shalt	1
burn	1
their	1
fat	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
thine,	1
as	1
the	1
wave	1
breast	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder	1
are	1
thine.	1
	1
18:19	1
All	1
the	1
heave	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
with	1
thee,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
salt	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
inheritance	1
in	1
their	1
land,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
any	1
part	1
among	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
part	1
and	1
thine	1
inheritance	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:21	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Levi	1
all	1
the	1
tenth	1
in	1
Israel	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
for	1
their	1
service	1
which	1
they	1
serve,	1
even	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
18:22	1
Neither	1
must	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
henceforth	1
come	1
nigh	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
lest	1
they	1
bear	1
sin,	1
and	1
die.	1
	1
18:23	1
But	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations,	1
that	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
inheritance.	1
	1
18:24	1
But	1
the	1
tithes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
as	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Levites	1
to	1
inherit:	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
inheritance.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
18:26	1
Thus	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
the	1
tithes	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
from	1
them	1
for	1
your	1
inheritance,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
up	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
tithe.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
this	1
your	1
heave	1
offering	1
shall	1
be	1
reckoned	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
corn	1
of	1
the	1
threshingfloor,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
winepress.	1
	1
18:28	1
Thus	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
offer	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
tithes,	1
which	1
ye	1
receive	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
thereof	1
the	1
LORD's	1
heave	1
offering	1
to	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
18:29	1
Out	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
gifts	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
every	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
thereof,	1
even	1
the	1
hallowed	1
part	1
thereof	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
18:30	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
have	1
heaved	1
the	1
best	1
thereof	1
from	1
it,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites	1
as	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
threshingfloor,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
winepress.	1
	1
18:31	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
every	1
place,	1
ye	1
and	1
your	1
households:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
reward	1
for	1
your	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
18:32	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
bear	1
no	1
sin	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
it,	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
heaved	1
from	1
it	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
pollute	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
19:2	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
bring	1
thee	1
a	1
red	1
heifer	1
without	1
spot,	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
blemish,	1
and	1
upon	1
which	1
never	1
came	1
yoke:	1
19:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
her	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
bring	1
her	1
forth	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
one	1
shall	1
slay	1
her	1
before	1
his	1
face:	1
19:4	1
And	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
with	1
his	1
finger,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
directly	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
seven	1
times:	1
19:5	1
And	1
one	1
shall	1
burn	1
the	1
heifer	1
in	1
his	1
sight;	1
her	1
skin,	1
and	1
her	1
flesh,	1
and	1
her	1
blood,	1
with	1
her	1
dung,	1
shall	1
he	1
burn:	1
19:6	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
cedar	1
wood,	1
and	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
the	1
heifer.	1
	1
19:7	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
afterward	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
her	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
clean	1
shall	1
gather	1
up	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
heifer,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
up	1
without	1
the	1
camp	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
place,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
a	1
water	1
of	1
separation:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
purification	1
for	1
sin.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
heifer	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
them,	1
for	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
19:11	1
He	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
19:12	1
He	1
shall	1
purify	1
himself	1
with	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
clean:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
purify	1
not	1
himself	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
then	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
19:13	1
Whosoever	1
toucheth	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
purifieth	1
not	1
himself,	1
defileth	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Israel:	1
because	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation	1
was	1
not	1
sprinkled	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean;	1
his	1
uncleanness	1
is	1
yet	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
19:14	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law,	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
dieth	1
in	1
a	1
tent:	1
all	1
that	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
tent,	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
every	1
open	1
vessel,	1
which	1
hath	1
no	1
covering	1
bound	1
upon	1
it,	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
whosoever	1
toucheth	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
slain	1
with	1
a	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
fields,	1
or	1
a	1
dead	1
body,	1
or	1
a	1
bone	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
or	1
a	1
grave,	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
for	1
an	1
unclean	1
person	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
heifer	1
of	1
purification	1
for	1
sin,	1
and	1
running	1
water	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
thereto	1
in	1
a	1
vessel:	1
19:18	1
And	1
a	1
clean	1
person	1
shall	1
take	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
dip	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
vessels,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
persons	1
that	1
were	1
there,	1
and	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
touched	1
a	1
bone,	1
or	1
one	1
slain,	1
or	1
one	1
dead,	1
or	1
a	1
grave:	1
19:19	1
And	1
the	1
clean	1
person	1
shall	1
sprinkle	1
upon	1
the	1
unclean	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
purify	1
himself,	1
and	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
bathe	1
himself	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
clean	1
at	1
even.	1
	1
19:20	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
purify	1
himself,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
congregation,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
defiled	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
sprinkled	1
upon	1
him;	1
he	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
perpetual	1
statute	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
sprinkleth	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
even.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
the	1
unclean	1
person	1
toucheth	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean;	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
toucheth	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
even.	1
	1
20:1	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation,	1
into	1
the	1
desert	1
of	1
Zin	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
abode	1
in	1
Kadesh;	1
and	1
Miriam	1
died	1
there,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
there.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
chode	1
with	1
Moses,	1
and	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
Would	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
when	1
our	1
brethren	1
died	1
before	1
the	1
LORD!	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
why	1
have	1
ye	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
into	1
this	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
we	1
and	1
our	1
cattle	1
should	1
die	1
there?	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
made	1
us	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
bring	1
us	1
in	1
unto	1
this	1
evil	1
place?	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
of	1
seed,	1
or	1
of	1
figs,	1
or	1
of	1
vines,	1
or	1
of	1
pomegranates;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
water	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
assembly	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces:	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
20:8	1
Take	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
gather	1
thou	1
the	1
assembly	1
together,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother,	1
and	1
speak	1
ye	1
unto	1
the	1
rock	1
before	1
their	1
eyes;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
give	1
forth	1
his	1
water,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
forth	1
to	1
them	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock:	1
so	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
their	1
beasts	1
drink.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
rod	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
he	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
gathered	1
the	1
congregation	1
together	1
before	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear	1
now,	1
ye	1
rebels;	1
must	1
we	1
fetch	1
you	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
rock?	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
rod	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
rock	1
twice:	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
came	1
out	1
abundantly,	1
and	1
the	1
congregation	1
drank,	1
and	1
their	1
beasts	1
also.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
Because	1
ye	1
believed	1
me	1
not,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
bring	1
this	1
congregation	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them.	1
	1
20:13	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Meribah;	1
because	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
strove	1
with	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
sanctified	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
messengers	1
from	1
Kadesh	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
thy	1
brother	1
Israel,	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
the	1
travail	1
that	1
hath	1
befallen	1
us:	1
20:15	1
How	1
our	1
fathers	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Egypt	1
a	1
long	1
time;	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
vexed	1
us,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers:	1
20:16	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
heard	1
our	1
voice,	1
and	1
sent	1
an	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
brought	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
Kadesh,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
of	1
thy	1
border:	1
20:17	1
Let	1
us	1
pass,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
through	1
thy	1
country:	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fields,	1
or	1
through	1
the	1
vineyards,	1
neither	1
will	1
we	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
wells:	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
high	1
way,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
passed	1
thy	1
borders.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
Edom	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
pass	1
by	1
me,	1
lest	1
I	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
way:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
cattle	1
drink	1
of	1
thy	1
water,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
for	1
it:	1
I	1
will	1
only,	1
without	1
doing	1
anything	1
else,	1
go	1
through	1
on	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
through.	1
And	1
Edom	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
much	1
people,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand.	1
	1
20:21	1
Thus	1
Edom	1
refused	1
to	1
give	1
Israel	1
passage	1
through	1
his	1
border:	1
wherefore	1
Israel	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation,	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Kadesh,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
mount	1
Hor.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
in	1
mount	1
Hor,	1
by	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom,	1
saying,	1
20:24	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
because	1
ye	1
rebelled	1
against	1
my	1
word	1
at	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Meribah.	1
	1
20:25	1
Take	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
mount	1
Hor:	1
20:26	1
And	1
strip	1
Aaron	1
of	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
shall	1
die	1
there.	1
	1
20:27	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
mount	1
Hor	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
Moses	1
stripped	1
Aaron	1
of	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
died	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount:	1
and	1
Moses	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
saw	1
that	1
Aaron	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
mourned	1
for	1
Aaron	1
thirty	1
days,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
when	1
king	1
Arad	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
south,	1
heard	1
tell	1
that	1
Israel	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
spies;	1
then	1
he	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
took	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
prisoners.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
Israel	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
indeed	1
deliver	1
this	1
people	1
into	1
my	1
hand,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
Canaanites;	1
and	1
they	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
cities:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Hormah.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed	1
from	1
mount	1
Hor	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
to	1
compass	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom:	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
much	1
discouraged	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
spake	1
against	1
God,	1
and	1
against	1
Moses,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
bread,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
water;	1
and	1
our	1
soul	1
loatheth	1
this	1
light	1
bread.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
fiery	1
serpents	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
bit	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
died.	1
	1
21:7	1
Therefore	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
spoken	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
against	1
thee;	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
serpents	1
from	1
us.	1
And	1
Moses	1
prayed	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Make	1
thee	1
a	1
fiery	1
serpent,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
upon	1
a	1
pole:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
bitten,	1
when	1
he	1
looketh	1
upon	1
it,	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
made	1
a	1
serpent	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
a	1
pole,	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
serpent	1
had	1
bitten	1
any	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
serpent	1
of	1
brass,	1
he	1
lived.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
set	1
forward,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Oboth.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Oboth,	1
and	1
pitched	1
at	1
Ijeabarim,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Moab,	1
toward	1
the	1
sunrising.	1
	1
21:12	1
From	1
thence	1
they	1
removed,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Zared.	1
	1
21:13	1
From	1
thence	1
they	1
removed,	1
and	1
pitched	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites:	1
for	1
Arnon	1
is	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Moab,	1
between	1
Moab	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
21:14	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
wars	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
What	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
brooks	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
21:15	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
the	1
brooks	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dwelling	1
of	1
Ar,	1
and	1
lieth	1
upon	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Beer:	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
well	1
whereof	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Gather	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
water.	1
	1
21:17	1
Then	1
Israel	1
sang	1
this	1
song,	1
Spring	1
up,	1
O	1
well;	1
sing	1
ye	1
unto	1
it:	1
21:18	1
The	1
princes	1
digged	1
the	1
well,	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
digged	1
it,	1
by	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
lawgiver,	1
with	1
their	1
staves.	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Mattanah:	1
21:19	1
And	1
from	1
Mattanah	1
to	1
Nahaliel:	1
and	1
from	1
Nahaliel	1
to	1
Bamoth:	1
21:20	1
And	1
from	1
Bamoth	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab,	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Pisgah,	1
which	1
looketh	1
toward	1
Jeshimon.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
Israel	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
saying,	1
21:22	1
Let	1
me	1
pass	1
through	1
thy	1
land:	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
into	1
the	1
fields,	1
or	1
into	1
the	1
vineyards;	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
well:	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
high	1
way,	1
until	1
we	1
be	1
past	1
thy	1
borders.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
Sihon	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
Israel	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
his	1
border:	1
but	1
Sihon	1
gathered	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
Israel	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Jahaz,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Israel	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
possessed	1
his	1
land	1
from	1
Arnon	1
unto	1
Jabbok,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon:	1
for	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
was	1
strong.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
Israel	1
took	1
all	1
these	1
cities:	1
and	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
in	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:26	1
For	1
Heshbon	1
was	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sihon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
who	1
had	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
former	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
taken	1
all	1
his	1
land	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
even	1
unto	1
Arnon.	1
	1
21:27	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
that	1
speak	1
in	1
proverbs	1
say,	1
Come	1
into	1
Heshbon,	1
let	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sihon	1
be	1
built	1
and	1
prepared:	1
21:28	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
fire	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
a	1
flame	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sihon:	1
it	1
hath	1
consumed	1
Ar	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Arnon.	1
	1
21:29	1
Woe	1
to	1
thee,	1
Moab!	1
thou	1
art	1
undone,	1
O	1
people	1
of	1
Chemosh:	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
his	1
sons	1
that	1
escaped,	1
and	1
his	1
daughters,	1
into	1
captivity	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
21:30	1
We	1
have	1
shot	1
at	1
them;	1
Heshbon	1
is	1
perished	1
even	1
unto	1
Dibon,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
laid	1
them	1
waste	1
even	1
unto	1
Nophah,	1
which	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
Medeba.	1
	1
21:31	1
Thus	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
21:32	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
Jaazer,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof,	1
and	1
drove	1
out	1
the	1
Amorites	1
that	1
were	1
there.	1
	1
21:33	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Bashan:	1
and	1
Og	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
them,	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
at	1
Edrei.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Fear	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
him	1
into	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
his	1
land;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Heshbon.	1
	1
21:35	1
So	1
they	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
until	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
left	1
him	1
alive:	1
and	1
they	1
possessed	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
set	1
forward,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moab	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
by	1
Jericho.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
Israel	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
Moab	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
many:	1
and	1
Moab	1
was	1
distressed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
Moab	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Now	1
shall	1
this	1
company	1
lick	1
up	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
us,	1
as	1
the	1
ox	1
licketh	1
up	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
And	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor	1
was	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
22:5	1
He	1
sent	1
messengers	1
therefore	1
unto	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
to	1
Pethor,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
call	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt:	1
behold,	1
they	1
cover	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
they	1
abide	1
over	1
against	1
me:	1
22:6	1
Come	1
now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
curse	1
me	1
this	1
people;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
too	1
mighty	1
for	1
me:	1
peradventure	1
I	1
shall	1
prevail,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
smite	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
I	1
wot	1
that	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
blessest	1
is	1
blessed,	1
and	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
cursest	1
is	1
cursed.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Moab	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Midian	1
departed	1
with	1
the	1
rewards	1
of	1
divination	1
in	1
their	1
hand;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Balak.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Lodge	1
here	1
this	1
night,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
word	1
again,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Moab	1
abode	1
with	1
Balaam.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
men	1
are	1
these	1
with	1
thee?	1
22:10	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor,	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
hath	1
sent	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
22:11	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
covereth	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
come	1
now,	1
curse	1
me	1
them;	1
peradventure	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
overcome	1
them,	1
and	1
drive	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
with	1
them;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
curse	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
blessed.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
Balaam	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Balak,	1
Get	1
you	1
into	1
your	1
land:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
refuseth	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Moab	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
and	1
said,	1
Balaam	1
refuseth	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
Balak	1
sent	1
yet	1
again	1
princes,	1
more,	1
and	1
more	1
honourable	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor,	1
Let	1
nothing,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
hinder	1
thee	1
from	1
coming	1
unto	1
me:	1
22:17	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
promote	1
thee	1
unto	1
very	1
great	1
honour,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
sayest	1
unto	1
me:	1
come	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
curse	1
me	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
22:18	1
And	1
Balaam	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Balak,	1
If	1
Balak	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
his	1
house	1
full	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
beyond	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
to	1
do	1
less	1
or	1
more.	1
	1
22:19	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
tarry	1
ye	1
also	1
here	1
this	1
night,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
more.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
Balaam	1
at	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
the	1
men	1
come	1
to	1
call	1
thee,	1
rise	1
up,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
them;	1
but	1
yet	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
Balaam	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
saddled	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
God's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
because	1
he	1
went:	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
an	1
adversary	1
against	1
him.	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
riding	1
upon	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
servants	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
the	1
ass	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
his	1
sword	1
drawn	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
turned	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
Balaam	1
smote	1
the	1
ass,	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
22:24	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards,	1
a	1
wall	1
being	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
a	1
wall	1
on	1
that	1
side.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ass	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
she	1
thrust	1
herself	1
unto	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
crushed	1
Balaam's	1
foot	1
against	1
the	1
wall:	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
her	1
again.	1
	1
22:26	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
further,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
narrow	1
place,	1
where	1
was	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
turn	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
22:27	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ass	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
she	1
fell	1
down	1
under	1
Balaam:	1
and	1
Balaam's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled,	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
ass	1
with	1
a	1
staff.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
opened	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
smitten	1
me	1
these	1
three	1
times?	1
	1
22:29	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
ass,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
mocked	1
me:	1
I	1
would	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
sword	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
for	1
now	1
would	1
I	1
kill	1
thee.	1
	1
22:30	1
And	1
the	1
ass	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
Am	1
not	1
I	1
thine	1
ass,	1
upon	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
ridden	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
thine	1
unto	1
this	1
day?	1
was	1
I	1
ever	1
wont	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay.	1
	1
22:31	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
his	1
sword	1
drawn	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
down	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
fell	1
flat	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
22:32	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
smitten	1
thine	1
ass	1
these	1
three	1
times?	1
behold,	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
withstand	1
thee,	1
because	1
thy	1
way	1
is	1
perverse	1
before	1
me:	1
22:33	1
And	1
the	1
ass	1
saw	1
me,	1
and	1
turned	1
from	1
me	1
these	1
three	1
times:	1
unless	1
she	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
me,	1
surely	1
now	1
also	1
I	1
had	1
slain	1
thee,	1
and	1
saved	1
her	1
alive.	1
	1
22:34	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned;	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
stoodest	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
against	1
me:	1
now	1
therefore,	1
if	1
it	1
displease	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
me	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
22:35	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
Go	1
with	1
the	1
men:	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak.	1
So	1
Balaam	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Balak.	1
	1
22:36	1
And	1
when	1
Balak	1
heard	1
that	1
Balaam	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
unto	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Moab,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
coast.	1
	1
22:37	1
And	1
Balak	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
earnestly	1
send	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
call	1
thee?	1
wherefore	1
camest	1
thou	1
not	1
unto	1
me?	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
able	1
indeed	1
to	1
promote	1
thee	1
to	1
honour?	1
	1
22:38	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
have	1
I	1
now	1
any	1
power	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
say	1
any	1
thing?	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
God	1
putteth	1
in	1
my	1
mouth,	1
that	1
shall	1
I	1
speak.	1
	1
22:39	1
And	1
Balaam	1
went	1
with	1
Balak,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
Kirjathhuzoth.	1
	1
22:40	1
And	1
Balak	1
offered	1
oxen	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
princes	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Balak	1
took	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Baal,	1
that	1
thence	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
the	1
utmost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
Build	1
me	1
here	1
seven	1
altars,	1
and	1
prepare	1
me	1
here	1
seven	1
oxen	1
and	1
seven	1
rams.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
Balak	1
did	1
as	1
Balaam	1
had	1
spoken;	1
and	1
Balak	1
and	1
Balaam	1
offered	1
on	1
every	1
altar	1
a	1
bullock	1
and	1
a	1
ram.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
Stand	1
by	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go:	1
peradventure	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
meet	1
me:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
sheweth	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
an	1
high	1
place.	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
God	1
met	1
Balaam:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
seven	1
altars,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
offered	1
upon	1
every	1
altar	1
a	1
bullock	1
and	1
a	1
ram.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
Balaam's	1
mouth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Return	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
and	1
thus	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak.	1
	1
23:6	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
unto	1
him,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
his	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
Balak	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
hath	1
brought	1
me	1
from	1
Aram,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
saying,	1
Come,	1
curse	1
me	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
come,	1
defy	1
Israel.	1
	1
23:8	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
curse,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
cursed?	1
or	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
defy,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
defied?	1
	1
23:9	1
For	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rocks	1
I	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hills	1
I	1
behold	1
him:	1
lo,	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
dwell	1
alone,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
reckoned	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
23:10	1
Who	1
can	1
count	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
Israel?	1
Let	1
me	1
die	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
let	1
my	1
last	1
end	1
be	1
like	1
his!	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
Balak	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
unto	1
me?	1
I	1
took	1
thee	1
to	1
curse	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
blessed	1
them	1
altogether.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Must	1
I	1
not	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
speak	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
my	1
mouth?	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
Balak	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
with	1
me	1
unto	1
another	1
place,	1
from	1
whence	1
thou	1
mayest	1
see	1
them:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
but	1
the	1
utmost	1
part	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
them	1
all:	1
and	1
curse	1
me	1
them	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Zophim,	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Pisgah,	1
and	1
built	1
seven	1
altars,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
bullock	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
on	1
every	1
altar.	1
	1
23:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
Stand	1
here	1
by	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
while	1
I	1
meet	1
the	1
LORD	1
yonder.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
met	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
again	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
and	1
say	1
thus.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
behold,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
his	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Moab	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
Balak	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken?	1
	1
23:18	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
Balak,	1
and	1
hear;	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor:	1
23:19	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
lie;	1
neither	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
repent:	1
hath	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
do	1
it?	1
or	1
hath	1
he	1
spoken,	1
and	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
good?	1
	1
23:20	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
commandment	1
to	1
bless:	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
blessed;	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
reverse	1
it.	1
	1
23:21	1
He	1
hath	1
not	1
beheld	1
iniquity	1
in	1
Jacob,	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
seen	1
perverseness	1
in	1
Israel:	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
shout	1
of	1
a	1
king	1
is	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
23:22	1
God	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
he	1
hath	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
an	1
unicorn.	1
	1
23:23	1
Surely	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
enchantment	1
against	1
Jacob,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
divination	1
against	1
Israel:	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
time	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
of	1
Israel,	1
What	1
hath	1
God	1
wrought!	1
	1
23:24	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
lion,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lion:	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
lie	1
down	1
until	1
he	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
drink	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
slain.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
Balak	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
Neither	1
curse	1
them	1
at	1
all,	1
nor	1
bless	1
them	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
23:26	1
But	1
Balaam	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
Told	1
not	1
I	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
speaketh,	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
do?	1
	1
23:27	1
And	1
Balak	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
Come,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
unto	1
another	1
place;	1
peradventure	1
it	1
will	1
please	1
God	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
curse	1
me	1
them	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
Balak	1
brought	1
Balaam	1
unto	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Peor,	1
that	1
looketh	1
toward	1
Jeshimon.	1
	1
23:29	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
Build	1
me	1
here	1
seven	1
altars,	1
and	1
prepare	1
me	1
here	1
seven	1
bullocks	1
and	1
seven	1
rams.	1
	1
23:30	1
And	1
Balak	1
did	1
as	1
Balaam	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
bullock	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
on	1
every	1
altar.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
when	1
Balaam	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
bless	1
Israel,	1
he	1
went	1
not,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
enchantments,	1
but	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Balaam	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
Israel	1
abiding	1
in	1
his	1
tents	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
tribes;	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
hath	1
said,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
eyes	1
are	1
open	1
hath	1
said:	1
24:4	1
He	1
hath	1
said,	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
saw	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
trance,	1
but	1
having	1
his	1
eyes	1
open:	1
24:5	1
How	1
goodly	1
are	1
thy	1
tents,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
thy	1
tabernacles,	1
O	1
Israel!	1
	1
24:6	1
As	1
the	1
valleys	1
are	1
they	1
spread	1
forth,	1
as	1
gardens	1
by	1
the	1
river's	1
side,	1
as	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
lign	1
aloes	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
planted,	1
and	1
as	1
cedar	1
trees	1
beside	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
24:7	1
He	1
shall	1
pour	1
the	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
buckets,	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
his	1
king	1
shall	1
be	1
higher	1
than	1
Agag,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
24:8	1
God	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
he	1
hath	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
an	1
unicorn:	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
nations	1
his	1
enemies,	1
and	1
shall	1
break	1
their	1
bones,	1
and	1
pierce	1
them	1
through	1
with	1
his	1
arrows.	1
	1
24:9	1
He	1
couched,	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
lion:	1
who	1
shall	1
stir	1
him	1
up?	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
blesseth	1
thee,	1
and	1
cursed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
curseth	1
thee.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
Balak's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
his	1
hands	1
together:	1
and	1
Balak	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
I	1
called	1
thee	1
to	1
curse	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
altogether	1
blessed	1
them	1
these	1
three	1
times.	1
	1
24:11	1
Therefore	1
now	1
flee	1
thou	1
to	1
thy	1
place:	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
promote	1
thee	1
unto	1
great	1
honour;	1
but,	1
lo,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
kept	1
thee	1
back	1
from	1
honour.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
Spake	1
I	1
not	1
also	1
to	1
thy	1
messengers	1
which	1
thou	1
sentest	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
24:13	1
If	1
Balak	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
his	1
house	1
full	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
beyond	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
do	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
mind;	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
speak?	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
people:	1
come	1
therefore,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
advertise	1
thee	1
what	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
do	1
to	1
thy	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
hath	1
said,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
eyes	1
are	1
open	1
hath	1
said:	1
24:16	1
He	1
hath	1
said,	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
knew	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
which	1
saw	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
trance,	1
but	1
having	1
his	1
eyes	1
open:	1
24:17	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
him,	1
but	1
not	1
now:	1
I	1
shall	1
behold	1
him,	1
but	1
not	1
nigh:	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
a	1
Star	1
out	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
a	1
Sceptre	1
shall	1
rise	1
out	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Sheth.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
Edom	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
possession,	1
Seir	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
possession	1
for	1
his	1
enemies;	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
do	1
valiantly.	1
	1
24:19	1
Out	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
come	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
have	1
dominion,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
him	1
that	1
remaineth	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
24:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
Amalek,	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
Amalek	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
nations;	1
but	1
his	1
latter	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
perish	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
Kenites,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
Strong	1
is	1
thy	1
dwellingplace,	1
and	1
thou	1
puttest	1
thy	1
nest	1
in	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
24:22	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
Kenite	1
shall	1
be	1
wasted,	1
until	1
Asshur	1
shall	1
carry	1
thee	1
away	1
captive.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
Alas,	1
who	1
shall	1
live	1
when	1
God	1
doeth	1
this!	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
ships	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Chittim,	1
and	1
shall	1
afflict	1
Asshur,	1
and	1
shall	1
afflict	1
Eber,	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
shall	1
perish	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
24:25	1
And	1
Balaam	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
place:	1
and	1
Balak	1
also	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
25:1	1
And	1
Israel	1
abode	1
in	1
Shittim,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
commit	1
whoredom	1
with	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
their	1
gods:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
gods.	1
	1
25:3	1
And	1
Israel	1
joined	1
himself	1
unto	1
Baalpeor:	1
and	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
25:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Take	1
all	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
hang	1
them	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
the	1
sun,	1
that	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
may	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
Israel.	1
	1
25:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Slay	1
ye	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
joined	1
unto	1
Baalpeor.	1
	1
25:6	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
and	1
brought	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren	1
a	1
Midianitish	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Moses,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
were	1
weeping	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
when	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
javelin	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
25:8	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
after	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
Israel	1
into	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
thrust	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
through,	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
through	1
her	1
belly.	1
So	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
stayed	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
25:9	1
And	1
those	1
that	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
plague	1
were	1
twenty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
25:11	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
hath	1
turned	1
my	1
wrath	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
zealous	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
among	1
them,	1
that	1
I	1
consumed	1
not	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
my	1
jealousy.	1
	1
25:12	1
Wherefore	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
my	1
covenant	1
of	1
peace:	1
25:13	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
it,	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him,	1
even	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
an	1
everlasting	1
priesthood;	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
zealous	1
for	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
25:14	1
Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Israelite	1
that	1
was	1
slain,	1
even	1
that	1
was	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
Midianitish	1
woman,	1
was	1
Zimri,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Salu,	1
a	1
prince	1
of	1
a	1
chief	1
house	1
among	1
the	1
Simeonites.	1
	1
25:15	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Midianitish	1
woman	1
that	1
was	1
slain	1
was	1
Cozbi,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zur;	1
he	1
was	1
head	1
over	1
a	1
people,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
chief	1
house	1
in	1
Midian.	1
	1
25:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
25:17	1
Vex	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
and	1
smite	1
them:	1
25:18	1
For	1
they	1
vex	1
you	1
with	1
their	1
wiles,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
have	1
beguiled	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
Peor,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
Cozbi,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
prince	1
of	1
Midian,	1
their	1
sister,	1
which	1
was	1
slain	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
plague	1
for	1
Peor's	1
sake.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
plague,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
saying,	1
26:2	1
Take	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward,	1
throughout	1
their	1
fathers'	1
house,	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
able	1
to	1

the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
them,	1
They	1
shall	1
surely	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
left	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
them,	1
save	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun.	1
	1
27:1	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zelophehad,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hepher,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Machir,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
of	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph:	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
daughters;	1
Mahlah,	1
Noah,	1
and	1
Hoglah,	1
and	1
Milcah,	1
and	1
Tirzah.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
they	1
stood	1
before	1
Moses,	1
and	1
before	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation,	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
saying,	1
27:3	1
Our	1
father	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
Korah;	1
but	1
died	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
sin,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
sons.	1
	1
27:4	1
Why	1
should	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
be	1
done	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
family,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
son?	1
Give	1
unto	1
us	1
therefore	1
a	1
possession	1
among	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
our	1
father.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
their	1
cause	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
27:7	1
The	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zelophehad	1
speak	1
right:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
their	1
father's	1
brethren;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cause	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
to	1
pass	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
27:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
die,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
son,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
cause	1
his	1
inheritance	1
to	1
pass	1
unto	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
27:9	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
no	1
daughter,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
27:10	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
no	1
brethren,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
his	1
father's	1
brethren.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
if	1
his	1
father	1
have	1
no	1
brethren,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
his	1
kinsman	1
that	1
is	1
next	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
possess	1
it:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
a	1
statute	1
of	1
judgment,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Get	1
thee	1
up	1
into	1
this	1
mount	1
Abarim,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
it,	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
thy	1
people,	1
as	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother	1
was	1
gathered.	1
	1
27:14	1
For	1
ye	1
rebelled	1
against	1
my	1
commandment	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
of	1
Zin,	1
in	1
the	1
strife	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
water	1
before	1
their	1
eyes:	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Meribah	1
in	1
Kadesh	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Zin.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
27:16	1
Let	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
set	1
a	1
man	1
over	1
the	1
congregation,	1
27:17	1
Which	1
may	1
go	1
out	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
which	1
may	1
go	1
in	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
which	1
may	1
lead	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
which	1
may	1
bring	1
them	1
in;	1
that	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
not	1
as	1
sheep	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
shepherd.	1
	1
27:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Take	1
thee	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
lay	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
him;	1
27:19	1
And	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
congregation;	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
charge	1
in	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
some	1
of	1
thine	1
honour	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
may	1
be	1
obedient.	1
	1
27:21	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
who	1
shall	1
ask	1
counsel	1
for	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
Urim	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
at	1
his	1
word	1
shall	1
they	1
go	1
out,	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
word	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
in,	1
both	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
congregation:	1
27:23	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
charge,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
28:2	1
Command	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
offering,	1
and	1
my	1
bread	1
for	1
my	1
sacrifices	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
me,	1
shall	1
ye	1
observe	1
to	1
offer	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
their	1
due	1
season.	1
	1
28:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
two	1
lambs	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
without	1
spot	1
day	1
by	1
day,	1
for	1
a	1
continual	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
28:4	1
The	1
one	1
lamb	1
shalt	1
thou	1
offer	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
lamb	1
shalt	1
thou	1
offer	1
at	1
even;	1
28:5	1
And	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
flour	1
for	1
a	1
meat	1
offering,	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
beaten	1
oil.	1
	1
28:6	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
continual	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
for	1
a	1

savour,	1
a	1

	1
28:7	1
And	1

thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
fourth	1

of	1
an	1

in	1
the	1

shalt	1
thou	1
cause	1
the	1
strong	1
wine	1
to	1
be	1
poured	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
a	1

	1
28:8	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
lamb	1
shalt	1
thou	1
offer	1
at	1
even:	1
as	1

This	1

	1
30:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
concerning	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded.	1
	1
30:2	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
vow	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
or	1
swear	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
bind	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
a	1
bond;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
break	1
his	1
word,	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
30:3	1
If	1
a	1
woman	1
also	1
vow	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
bind	1
herself	1
by	1
a	1
bond,	1
being	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
house	1
in	1
her	1
youth;	1
30:4	1
And	1
her	1
father	1
hear	1
her	1
vow,	1
and	1
her	1
bond	1
wherewith	1
she	1
hath	1
bound	1
her	1
soul,	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
shall	1
hold	1
his	1
peace	1
at	1
her;	1
then	1
all	1
her	1
vows	1
shall	1
stand,	1
and	1
every	1
bond	1
wherewith	1
she	1
hath	1
bound	1
her	1
soul	1
shall	1
stand.	1
	1
30:5	1
But	1
if	1
her	1
father	1
disallow	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
heareth;	1
not	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
vows,	1
or	1
of	1
her	1
bonds	1
wherewith	1
she	1
hath	1
bound	1
her	1
soul,	1
shall	1
stand:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
forgive	1
her,	1
because	1
her	1
father	1
disallowed	1
her.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
all	1
an	1
husband,	1
when	1
she	1
vowed,	1
or	1
uttered	1
ought	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
lips,	1
wherewith	1
she	1
bound	1
her	1
soul;	1
30:7	1
And	1
her	1
husband	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
it:	1
then	1
her	1
vows	1
shall	1
stand,	1
and	1
her	1
bonds	1
wherewith	1
she	1
bound	1
her	1
soul	1
shall	1
stand.	1
	1
30:8	1
But	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
disallowed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
it;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
her	1
vow	1
which	1
she	1
vowed,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
uttered	1
with	1
her	1
lips,	1
wherewith	1
she	1
bound	1
her	1
soul,	1
of	1
none	1
effect:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
forgive	1
her.	1
	1
30:9	1
But	1
every	1
vow	1
of	1
a	1
widow,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
divorced,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
have	1
bound	1
their	1
souls,	1
shall	1
stand	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
30:10	1
And	1
if	1
she	1
vowed	1
in	1
her	1
husband's	1
house,	1
or	1
bound	1
her	1
soul	1
by	1
a	1
bond	1
with	1
an	1
oath;	1
30:11	1
And	1
her	1
husband	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
disallowed	1
her	1
not:	1
then	1
all	1
her	1
vows	1
shall	1
stand,	1
and	1
every	1
bond	1
wherewith	1
she	1
bound	1
her	1
soul	1
shall	1
stand.	1
	1
30:12	1
But	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
hath	1
utterly	1
made	1
them	1
void	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
heard	1
them;	1
then	1
whatsoever	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
concerning	1
her	1
vows,	1
or	1
concerning	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
her	1
soul,	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
her	1
husband	1
hath	1
made	1
them	1
void;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
forgive	1
her.	1
	1
30:13	1
Every	1
vow,	1
and	1
every	1
binding	1
oath	1
to	1
afflict	1
the	1
soul,	1
her	1
husband	1
may	1
establish	1
it,	1
or	1
her	1
husband	1
may	1
make	1
it	1
void.	1
	1
30:14	1
But	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
altogether	1
hold	1
his	1
peace	1
at	1
her	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day;	1
then	1
he	1
establisheth	1
all	1
her	1
vows,	1
or	1
all	1
her	1
bonds,	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
her:	1
he	1
confirmeth	1
them,	1
because	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
30:15	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
any	1
ways	1
make	1
them	1
void	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
heard	1
them;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
her	1
iniquity.	1
	1
30:16	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
statutes,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
between	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
between	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
daughter,	1
being	1
yet	1
in	1
her	1
youth	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
31:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
31:2	1
Avenge	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites:	1
afterward	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
31:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Arm	1
some	1
of	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
war,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
and	1
avenge	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
31:4	1
Of	1
every	1
tribe	1
a	1
thousand,	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
ye	1
send	1
to	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
31:5	1
So	1
there	1
were	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Israel,	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
every	1
tribe,	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
armed	1
for	1
war.	1
	1
31:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
every	1
tribe,	1
them	1
and	1
Phinehas	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
instruments,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpets	1
to	1
blow	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
31:7	1
And	1
they	1
warred	1
against	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses;	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
males.	1
	1
31:8	1
And	1
they	1
slew	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Midian,	1
beside	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
slain;	1
namely,	1
Evi,	1
and	1
Rekem,	1
and	1
Zur,	1
and	1
Hur,	1
and	1
Reba,	1
five	1
kings	1
of	1
Midian:	1
Balaam	1
also	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
they	1
slew	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
31:9	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
Midian	1
captives,	1
and	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
flocks,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
goods.	1
	1
31:10	1
And	1
they	1
burnt	1
all	1
their	1
cities	1
wherein	1
they	1
dwelt,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
goodly	1
castles,	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
31:11	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prey,	1
both	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
of	1
beasts.	1
	1
31:12	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
captives,	1
and	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
the	1
spoil,	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
the	1
camp	1
at	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moab,	1
which	1
are	1
by	1
Jordan	1
near	1
Jericho.	1
	1
31:13	1
And	1
Moses,	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
31:14	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
with	1
the	1
captains	1
over	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
hundreds,	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
31:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
saved	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
alive?	1
31:16	1
Behold,	1
these	1
caused	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
through	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Balaam,	1
to	1
commit	1
trespass	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
Peor,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
plague	1
among	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:17	1
Now	1
therefore	1
kill	1
every	1
male	1
among	1
the	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
kill	1
every	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
known	1
man	1
by	1
lying	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
31:18	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
children,	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
a	1
man	1
by	1
lying	1
with	1
him,	1
keep	1
alive	1
for	1
yourselves.	1
	1
31:19	1
And	1
do	1
ye	1
abide	1
without	1
the	1
camp	1
seven	1
days:	1
whosoever	1
hath	1
killed	1
any	1
person,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
hath	1
touched	1
any	1
slain,	1
purify	1
both	1
yourselves	1
and	1
your	1
captives	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day.	1
	1
31:20	1
And	1
purify	1
all	1
your	1
raiment,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
skins,	1
and	1
all	1
work	1
of	1
goats'	1
hair,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
made	1
of	1
wood.	1
	1
31:21	1
And	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
which	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
battle,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses;	1
31:22	1
Only	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
silver,	1
the	1
brass,	1
the	1
iron,	1
the	1
tin,	1
and	1
the	1
lead,	1
31:23	1
Every	1
thing	1
that	1
may	1
abide	1
the	1
fire,	1
ye	1
shall	1
make	1
it	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
clean:	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
purified	1
with	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation:	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
abideth	1
not	1
the	1
fire	1
ye	1
shall	1
make	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
31:24	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
wash	1
your	1
clothes	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
clean,	1
and	1
afterward	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
31:25	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
31:26	1
Take	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
prey	1
that	1
was	1
taken,	1
both	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
of	1
beast,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
31:27	1
And	1
divide	1
the	1
prey	1
into	1
two	1
parts;	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
took	1
the	1
war	1
upon	1
them,	1
who	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
battle,	1
and	1
between	1
all	1
the	1
congregation:	1
31:28	1
And	1
levy	1
a	1
tribute	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
which	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
battle:	1
one	1
soul	1
of	1
five	1
hundred,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
persons,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
beeves,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
asses,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sheep:	1
31:29	1
Take	1
it	1
of	1
their	1
half,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
for	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:30	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel's	1
half,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
one	1
portion	1
of	1
fifty,	1
of	1
the	1
persons,	1
of	1
the	1
beeves,	1
of	1
the	1
asses,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
flocks,	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
beasts,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites,	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
31:32	1
And	1
the	1
booty,	1
being	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
prey	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
caught,	1
was	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
and	1
seventy	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
thousand	1
sheep,	1
31:33	1
And	1
threescore	1
and	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
beeves,	1
31:34	1
And	1
threescore	1
and	1
one	1
thousand	1
asses,	1
31:35	1
And	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand	1
persons	1
in	1
all,	1
of	1
women	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
man	1
by	1
lying	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
31:36	1
And	1
the	1
half,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
war,	1
was	1
in	1
number	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
and	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
sheep:	1
31:37	1
And	1
the	1
LORD's	1
tribute	1
of	1
the	1
sheep	1
was	1
six	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
fifteen.	1
	1
31:38	1
And	1
the	1
beeves	1
were	1
thirty	1
and	1
six	1
thousand;	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD's	1
tribute	1
was	1
threescore	1
and	1
twelve.	1
	1
31:39	1
And	1
the	1
asses	1
were	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred;	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD's	1
tribute	1
was	1
threescore	1
and	1
one.	1
	1
31:40	1
And	1
the	1
persons	1
were	1
sixteen	1
thousand;	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD's	1
tribute	1
was	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
persons.	1
	1
31:41	1
And	1
Moses	1
gave	1
the	1
tribute,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
LORD's	1
heave	1
offering,	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
31:42	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel's	1
half,	1
which	1
Moses	1
divided	1
from	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
warred,	1
31:43	1
(Now	1
the	1
half	1
that	1
pertained	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
and	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
sheep,	1
31:44	1
And	1
thirty	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
beeves,	1
31:45	1
And	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
asses	1
and	1
five	1
hundred,	1
31:46	1
And	1
sixteen	1
thousand	1
persons;)	1
31:47	1
Even	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel's	1
half,	1
Moses	1
took	1
one	1
portion	1
of	1
fifty,	1
both	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
of	1
beast,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites,	1
which	1
kept	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
31:48	1
And	1
the	1
officers	1
which	1
were	1
over	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
Moses:	1
31:49	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Thy	1
servants	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
which	1
are	1
under	1
our	1
charge,	1
and	1
there	1
lacketh	1
not	1
one	1
man	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
31:50	1
We	1
have	1
therefore	1
brought	1
an	1
oblation	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
what	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
gotten,	1
of	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
chains,	1
and	1
bracelets,	1
rings,	1
earrings,	1
and	1
tablets,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
our	1
souls	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:51	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
them,	1
even	1
all	1
wrought	1
jewels.	1
	1
31:52	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
the	1
offering	1
that	1
they	1
offered	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
of	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
was	1
sixteen	1
thousand	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
shekels.	1
	1
31:53	1
(For	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
taken	1
spoil,	1
every	1
man	1
for	1
himself.)	1
31:54	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands	1
and	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:1	1
Now	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
cattle:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jazer,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
cattle;	1
32:2	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
came	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
to	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
saying,	1
32:3	1
Ataroth,	1
and	1
Dibon,	1
and	1
Jazer,	1
and	1
Nimrah,	1
and	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
Elealeh,	1
and	1
Shebam,	1
and	1
Nebo,	1
and	1
Beon,	1
32:4	1
Even	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
before	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
for	1
cattle,	1
and	1
thy	1
servants	1
have	1
cattle:	1
32:5	1
Wherefore,	1
said	1
they,	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
let	1
this	1
land	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
for	1
a	1
possession,	1
and	1
bring	1
us	1
not	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
Shall	1
your	1
brethren	1
go	1
to	1
war,	1
and	1
shall	1
ye	1
sit	1
here?	1
	1
32:7	1
And	1
wherefore	1
discourage	1
ye	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
going	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
them?	1
	1
32:8	1
Thus	1
did	1
your	1
fathers,	1
when	1
I	1
sent	1
them	1
from	1
Kadeshbarnea	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
32:9	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Eshcol,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
land,	1
they	1
discouraged	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
given	1
them.	1
	1
32:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
and	1
he	1
sware,	1
saying,	1
32:11	1
Surely	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward,	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
unto	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
unto	1
Jacob;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
wholly	1
followed	1
me:	1
32:12	1
Save	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh	1
the	1
Kenezite,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
wholly	1
followed	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
wander	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years,	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
generation,	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
was	1
consumed.	1
	1
32:14	1
And,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
are	1
risen	1
up	1
in	1
your	1
fathers'	1
stead,	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
sinful	1
men,	1
to	1
augment	1
yet	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
toward	1
Israel.	1
	1
32:15	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
after	1
him,	1
he	1
will	1
yet	1
again	1
leave	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
destroy	1
all	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
32:16	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
build	1
sheepfolds	1
here	1
for	1
our	1
cattle,	1
and	1
cities	1
for	1
our	1
little	1
ones:	1
32:17	1
But	1
we	1
ourselves	1
will	1
go	1
ready	1
armed	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
their	1
place:	1
and	1
our	1
little	1
ones	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
32:18	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
return	1
unto	1
our	1
houses,	1
until	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
inherited	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
32:19	1
For	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
inherit	1
with	1
them	1
on	1
yonder	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
or	1
forward;	1
because	1
our	1
inheritance	1
is	1
fallen	1
to	1
us	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
eastward.	1
	1
32:20	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
thing,	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
go	1
armed	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
war,	1
32:21	1
And	1
will	1
go	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
armed	1
over	1
Jordan	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
until	1
he	1
hath	1
driven	1
out	1
his	1
enemies	1
from	1
before	1
him,	1
32:22	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
be	1
subdued	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
then	1
afterward	1
ye	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
be	1
guiltless	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
before	1
Israel;	1
and	1
this	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
possession	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:23	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
so,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
be	1
sure	1
your	1
sin	1
will	1
find	1
you	1
out.	1
	1
32:24	1
Build	1
you	1
cities	1
for	1
your	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
folds	1
for	1
your	1
sheep;	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
hath	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
32:25	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
servants	1
will	1
do	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
commandeth.	1
	1
32:26	1
Our	1
little	1
ones,	1
our	1
wives,	1
our	1
flocks,	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
cattle,	1
shall	1
be	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Gilead:	1
32:27	1
But	1
thy	1
servants	1
will	1
pass	1
over,	1
every	1
man	1
armed	1
for	1
war,	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
battle,	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
saith.	1
	1
32:28	1
So	1
concerning	1
them	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
32:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
will	1
pass	1
with	1
you	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
every	1
man	1
armed	1
to	1
battle,	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
subdued	1
before	1
you;	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead	1
for	1
a	1
possession:	1
32:30	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
with	1
you	1
armed,	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
possessions	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
32:31	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
so	1
will	1
we	1
do.	1
	1
32:32	1
We	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
armed	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
that	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
may	1
be	1
ours.	1
	1
32:33	1
And	1
Moses	1
gave	1
unto	1
them,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
and	1
unto	1
half	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
the	1
land,	1
with	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
coasts,	1
even	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
32:34	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
built	1
Dibon,	1
and	1
Ataroth,	1
and	1
Aroer,	1
32:35	1
And	1
Atroth,	1
Shophan,	1
and	1
Jaazer,	1
and	1
Jogbehah,	1
32:36	1
And	1
Bethnimrah,	1
and	1
Bethharan,	1
fenced	1
cities:	1
and	1
folds	1
for	1
sheep.	1
	1
32:37	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
built	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
Elealeh,	1
and	1
Kirjathaim,	1
32:38	1
And	1
Nebo,	1
and	1
Baalmeon,	1
(their	1
names	1
being	1
changed,)	1
and	1
Shibmah:	1
and	1
gave	1
other	1
names	1
unto	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
they	1
builded.	1
	1
32:39	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Machir	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
went	1
to	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
dispossessed	1
the	1
Amorite	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
32:40	1
And	1
Moses	1
gave	1
Gilead	1
unto	1
Machir	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh;	1
and	1
he	1
dwelt	1
therein.	1
	1
32:41	1
And	1
Jair	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
small	1
towns	1
thereof,	1
and	1
called	1
them	1
Havothjair.	1
	1
32:42	1
And	1
Nobah	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
Kenath,	1
and	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
Nobah,	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
name.	1
	1
33:1	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
journeys	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
their	1
armies	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron.	1
	1
33:2	1
And	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
their	1
goings	1
out	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
journeys	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
their	1
journeys	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
goings	1
out.	1
	1
33:3	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Rameses	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month;	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
the	1
passover	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
an	1
high	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
33:4	1
For	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
buried	1
all	1
their	1
firstborn,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
smitten	1
among	1
them:	1
upon	1
their	1
gods	1
also	1
the	1
LORD	1
executed	1
judgments.	1
	1
33:5	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
removed	1
from	1
Rameses,	1
and	1
pitched	1

	1
33:6	1
And	1

and	1
pitched	1

	1
33:7	1
And	1
they	1

from	1
Etham,	1
and	1
turned	1
again	1
unto	1
Pihahiroth,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Baalzephon:	1
and	1
they	1
pitched	1
before	1
Migdol.	1
	1
33:8	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
before	1
Pihahiroth,	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1

into	1
the	1

and	1
went	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
Etham,	1
and	1
pitched	1

	1
33:9	1
And	1
they	1

Elim:	1
and	1
in	1
Elim	1
were	1
twelve	1
fountains	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1

and	1
they	1

	1
33:10	1
And	1
they	1
removed	1
from	1
Elim,	1

	1
33:12	1
And	1

	1
33:49	1
And	1

	1
33:50	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moab	1
by	1
Jordan	1
near	1
Jericho,	1
saying,	1
33:51	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
are	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
33:52	1
Then	1
ye	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
destroy	1
all	1
their	1
pictures,	1
and	1
destroy	1
all	1
their	1
molten	1
images,	1
and	1
quite	1
pluck	1
down	1
all	1
their	1
high	1
places:	1
33:53	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
dispossess	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
33:54	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
land	1
by	1
lot	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
your	1
families:	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
the	1
more	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
fewer	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
the	1
less	1
inheritance:	1
every	1
man's	1
inheritance	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
his	1
lot	1
falleth;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
ye	1
shall	1
inherit.	1
	1
33:55	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
before	1
you;	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
those	1
which	1
ye	1
let	1
remain	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
pricks	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
thorns	1
in	1
your	1
sides,	1
and	1
shall	1
vex	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
ye	1
dwell.	1
	1
33:56	1
Moreover	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
34:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1

refuge,	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
stranger,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sojourner	1
among	1
them:	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
killeth	1
any	1
person	1
unawares	1
may	1
flee	1
thither.	1
	1
35:16	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
smite	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
instrument	1
of	1
iron,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
die,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
murderer:	1
the	1
murderer	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
35:17	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
smite	1
him	1
with	1
throwing	1
a	1
stone,	1
wherewith	1
he	1
may	1
die,	1
and	1
he	1
die,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
murderer:	1
the	1
murderer	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
35:18	1
Or	1
if	1
he	1
smite	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
hand	1
weapon	1
of	1
wood,	1
wherewith	1
he	1
may	1
die,	1
and	1
he	1
die,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
murderer:	1
the	1
murderer	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
35:19	1
The	1
revenger	1
of	1
blood	1
himself	1
shall	1
slay	1
the	1
murderer:	1
when	1
he	1
meeteth	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
35:20	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
thrust	1
him	1
of	1
hatred,	1
or	1
hurl	1
at	1
him	1
by	1
laying	1
of	1
wait,	1
that	1
he	1
die;	1
35:21	1
Or	1
in	1
enmity	1
smite	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
that	1
he	1
die:	1
he	1
that	1
smote	1
him	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
murderer:	1
the	1
revenger	1
of	1
blood	1
shall	1
slay	1
the	1
murderer,	1
when	1
he	1
meeteth	1
him.	1
	1
35:22	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
thrust	1
him	1
suddenly	1
without	1
enmity,	1
or	1
have	1
cast	1
upon	1
him	1
any	1
thing	1
without	1
laying	1
of	1
wait,	1
35:23	1
Or	1
with	1
any	1
stone,	1
wherewith	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
die,	1
seeing	1
him	1
not,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
die,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
enemy,	1
neither	1
sought	1
his	1
harm:	1
35:24	1
Then	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
judge	1
between	1
the	1
slayer	1
and	1
the	1
revenger	1
of	1
blood	1
according	1
to	1
these	1
judgments:	1
35:25	1
And	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
deliver	1
the	1
slayer	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
revenger	1
of	1
blood,	1
and	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
restore	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
his	1
refuge,	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
fled:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
which	1
was	1
anointed	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
oil.	1
	1
35:26	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
slayer	1
shall	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
come	1
without	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
his	1
refuge,	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
fled;	1
35:27	1
And	1
the	1
revenger	1
of	1
blood	1
find	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
his	1
refuge,	1
and	1
the	1
revenger	1
of	1
blood	1
kill	1
the	1
slayer;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
blood:	1
35:28	1
Because	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
his	1
refuge	1
until	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
the	1
slayer	1
shall	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
35:29	1
So	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
statute	1
of	1
judgment	1
unto	1
you	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
dwellings.	1
	1
35:30	1
Whoso	1
killeth	1
any	1
person,	1
the	1
murderer	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
witnesses:	1
but	1
one	1
witness	1
shall	1
not	1
testify	1
against	1
any	1
person	1
to	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
die.	1
	1
35:31	1
Moreover	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
satisfaction	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
murderer,	1
which	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
death:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
35:32	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
satisfaction	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
his	1
refuge,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
until	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
35:33	1
So	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
pollute	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
ye	1
are:	1
for	1
blood	1
it	1
defileth	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
cannot	1
be	1
cleansed	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
is	1
shed	1
therein,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
shed	1
it.	1
	1
35:34	1
Defile	1
not	1
therefore	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
inhabit,	1
wherein	1
I	1
dwell:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
dwell	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
36:1	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Machir,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
of	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
spake	1
before	1
Moses,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
chief	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
36:2	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
my	1
lord	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
by	1
lot	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
my	1
lord	1
was	1
commanded	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
Zelophehad	1
our	1
brother	1
unto	1
his	1
daughters.	1
	1
36:3	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
then	1
shall	1
their	1
inheritance	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
whereunto	1
they	1
are	1
received:	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance.	1
	1
36:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
jubile	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be,	1
then	1
shall	1
their	1
inheritance	1
be	1
put	1
unto	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
whereunto	1
they	1
are	1
received:	1
so	1
shall	1
their	1
inheritance	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
36:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
The	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joseph	1
hath	1
said	1
well.	1
	1
36:6	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
command	1
concerning	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zelophehad,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
them	1
marry	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
think	1
best;	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
shall	1
they	1
marry.	1
	1
36:7	1
So	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
remove	1
from	1
tribe	1
to	1
tribe:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
keep	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
his	1
fathers.	1
	1
36:8	1
And	1
every	1
daughter,	1
that	1
possesseth	1
an	1
inheritance	1
in	1
any	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
be	1
wife	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
may	1
enjoy	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
his	1
fathers.	1
	1
36:9	1
Neither	1
shall	1
the	1
inheritance	1
remove	1
from	1
one	1
tribe	1
to	1
another	1
tribe;	1
but	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
keep	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
inheritance.	1
	1
36:10	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zelophehad:	1
36:11	1
For	1
Mahlah,	1
Tirzah,	1
and	1
Hoglah,	1
and	1
Milcah,	1
and	1
Noah,	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zelophehad,	1
were	1
married	1
unto	1
their	1
father's	1
brothers'	1
sons:	1
36:12	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
married	1
into	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
their	1
inheritance	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
their	1
father.	1
	1
36:13	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
the	1
judgments,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moab	1
by	1
Jordan	1
near	1
Jericho.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Fifth	1
Book	1
of	1
Moses:	1
	1
Called	1
Deuteronomy	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
These	1
be	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
between	1
Paran,	1
and	1
Tophel,	1
and	1
Laban,	1
and	1
Hazeroth,	1
and	1
Dizahab.	1
	1
1:2	1
(There	1
are	1
eleven	1
days'	1
journey	1
from	1
Horeb	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
mount	1
Seir	1
unto	1
Kadeshbarnea.)	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fortieth	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
in	1
commandment	1
unto	1
them;	1
1:4	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
Sihon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
Og	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Astaroth	1
in	1
Edrei:	1
1:5	1
On	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
began	1
Moses	1
to	1
declare	1
this	1
law,	1
saying,	1
1:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
Horeb,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
have	1
dwelt	1
long	1
enough	1
in	1
this	1
mount:	1
1:7	1
Turn	1
you,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
journey,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
nigh	1
thereunto,	1
in	1
the	1
plain,	1
in	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
vale,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side,	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
unto	1
Lebanon,	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
river,	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
1:8	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
the	1
land	1
before	1
you:	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers,	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
seed	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
you	1
myself	1
alone:	1
1:10	1
The	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
multiplied	1
you,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
are	1
this	1
day	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
1:11	1
(The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
so	1
many	1
more	1
as	1
ye	1
are,	1
and	1
bless	1
you,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
you!)	1
	1
1:12	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
myself	1
alone	1
bear	1
your	1
cumbrance,	1
and	1
your	1
burden,	1
and	1
your	1
strife?	1
1:13	1
Take	1
you	1
wise	1
men,	1
and	1
understanding,	1
and	1
known	1
among	1
your	1
tribes,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
rulers	1
over	1
you.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
ye	1
answered	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
thing	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
1:15	1
So	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
your	1
tribes,	1
wise	1
men,	1
and	1
known,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
heads	1
over	1
you,	1
captains	1
over	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
fifties,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
tens,	1
and	1
officers	1
among	1
your	1
tribes.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
I	1
charged	1
your	1
judges	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
saying,	1
Hear	1
the	1
causes	1
between	1
your	1
brethren,	1
and	1
judge	1
righteously	1
between	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
1:17	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
respect	1
persons	1
in	1
judgment;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
small	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
great;	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
man;	1
for	1
the	1
judgment	1
is	1
God's:	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
that	1
is	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
you,	1
bring	1
it	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
I	1
commanded	1
you	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
should	1
do.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
departed	1
from	1
Horeb,	1
we	1
went	1
through	1
all	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
wilderness,	1
which	1
ye	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
commanded	1
us;	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Kadeshbarnea.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
doth	1
give	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
1:21	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
the	1
land	1
before	1
thee:	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
possess	1
it,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee;	1
fear	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
discouraged.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
ye	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
send	1
men	1
before	1
us,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
search	1
us	1
out	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
bring	1
us	1
word	1
again	1
by	1
what	1
way	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
up,	1
and	1
into	1
what	1
cities	1
we	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
the	1
saying	1
pleased	1
me	1
well:	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
twelve	1
men	1
of	1
you,	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
tribe:	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Eshcol,	1
and	1
searched	1
it	1
out.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
down	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
brought	1
us	1
word	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
doth	1
give	1
us.	1
	1
1:26	1
Notwithstanding	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
up,	1
but	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
1:27	1
And	1
ye	1
murmured	1
in	1
your	1
tents,	1
and	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hated	1
us,	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
to	1
destroy	1
us.	1
	1
1:28	1
Whither	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
up?	1
our	1
brethren	1
have	1
discouraged	1
our	1
heart,	1
saying,	1
The	1
people	1
is	1
greater	1
and	1
taller	1
than	1
we;	1
the	1
cities	1
are	1
great	1
and	1
walled	1
up	1
to	1
heaven;	1
and	1
moreover	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
Anakims	1
there.	1
	1
1:29	1
Then	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
Dread	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
1:30	1
The	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
which	1
goeth	1
before	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
fight	1
for	1
you,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
Egypt	1
before	1
your	1
eyes;	1
1:31	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
bare	1
thee,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
doth	1
bear	1
his	1
son,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
ye	1
went,	1
until	1
ye	1
came	1
into	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
1:32	1
Yet	1
in	1
this	1
thing	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
1:33	1
Who	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
before	1
you,	1
to	1
search	1
you	1
out	1
a	1
place	1
to	1
pitch	1
your	1
tents	1
in,	1
in	1
fire	1
by	1
night,	1
to	1
shew	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
way	1
ye	1
should	1
go,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
by	1
day.	1
	1
1:34	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
your	1
words,	1
and	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
sware,	1
saying,	1
1:35	1
Surely	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
evil	1
generation	1
see	1
that	1
good	1
land,	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:36	1
Save	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh;	1
he	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
trodden	1
upon,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
children,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
wholly	1
followed	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:37	1
Also	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
thither.	1
	1
1:38	1
But	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
which	1
standeth	1
before	1
thee,	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
thither:	1
encourage	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
Israel	1
to	1
inherit	1
it.	1
	1
1:39	1
Moreover	1
your	1
little	1
ones,	1
which	1
ye	1
said	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
prey,	1
and	1
your	1
children,	1
which	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
between	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
thither,	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
1:40	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
turn	1
you,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
1:41	1
Then	1
ye	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
fight,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
commanded	1
us.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
had	1
girded	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
weapons	1
of	1
war,	1
ye	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
1:42	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Say	1
unto	1
them.	1
Go	1
not	1
up,	1
neither	1
fight;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
among	1
you;	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
smitten	1
before	1
your	1
enemies.	1
	1
1:43	1
So	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
hear,	1
but	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
went	1
presumptuously	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
1:44	1
And	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
that	1
mountain,	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
chased	1
you,	1
as	1
bees	1
do,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
you	1
in	1
Seir,	1
even	1
unto	1
Hormah.	1
	1
1:45	1
And	1
ye	1
returned	1
and	1
wept	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
your	1
voice,	1
nor	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:46	1
So	1
ye	1
abode	1
in	1
Kadesh	1
many	1
days,	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
ye	1
abode	1
there.	1
	1
2:1	1
Then	1
we	1
turned,	1
and	1
took	1
our	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
we	1
compassed	1
mount	1
Seir	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
2:3	1
Ye	1
have	1
compassed	1
this	1
mountain	1
long	1
enough:	1
turn	1
you	1
northward.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
command	1
thou	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
are	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Esau,	1
which	1
dwell	1
in	1
Seir;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
you:	1
take	1
ye	1
good	1
heed	1
unto	1
yourselves	1
therefore:	1
2:5	1
Meddle	1
not	1
with	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
you	1
of	1
their	1
land,	1
no,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
foot	1
breadth;	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
mount	1
Seir	1
unto	1
Esau	1
for	1
a	1
possession.	1
	1
2:6	1
Ye	1
shall	1
buy	1
meat	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
money,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
eat;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
also	1
buy	1
water	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
money,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
drink.	1
	1
2:7	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thy	1
hand:	1
he	1
knoweth	1
thy	1
walking	1
through	1
this	1
great	1
wilderness:	1
these	1
forty	1
years	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
thee;	1
thou	1
hast	1
lacked	1
nothing.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
passed	1
by	1
from	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Esau,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Seir,	1
through	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
from	1
Elath,	1
and	1
from	1
Eziongaber,	1
we	1
turned	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Distress	1
not	1
the	1
Moabites,	1
neither	1
contend	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
battle:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
thee	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
for	1
a	1
possession;	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
Ar	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Lot	1
for	1
a	1
possession.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
Emims	1
dwelt	1
therein	1
in	1
times	1
past,	1
a	1
people	1
great,	1
and	1
many,	1
and	1
tall,	1
as	1
the	1
Anakims;	1
2:11	1
Which	1
also	1
were	1
accounted	1
giants,	1
as	1
the	1
Anakims;	1
but	1
the	1
Moabites	1
called	1
them	1
Emims.	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
Horims	1
also	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Seir	1
beforetime;	1
but	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Esau	1
succeeded	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
destroyed	1
them	1
from	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
stead;	1
as	1
Israel	1
did	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:13	1
Now	1
rise	1
up,	1
said	1
I,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Zered.	1
And	1
we	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Zered.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
the	1
space	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
came	1
from	1
Kadeshbarnea,	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Zered,	1
was	1
thirty	1
and	1
eight	1
years;	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
generation	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
were	1
wasted	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
host,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
indeed	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
against	1
them,	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
host,	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
consumed.	1
	1
2:16	1
So	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
were	1
consumed	1
and	1
dead	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
2:17	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
2:18	1
Thou	1
art	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
through	1
Ar,	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Moab,	1
this	1
day:	1
2:19	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
nigh	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
distress	1
them	1
not,	1
nor	1
meddle	1
with	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
any	1
possession;	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Lot	1
for	1
a	1
possession.	1
	1
2:20	1
(That	1
also	1
was	1
accounted	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
giants:	1
giants	1
dwelt	1
therein	1
in	1
old	1
time;	1
and	1
the	1
Ammonites	1
call	1
them	1
Zamzummims;	1
2:21	1
A	1
people	1
great,	1
and	1
many,	1
and	1
tall,	1
as	1
the	1
Anakims;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
destroyed	1
them	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
succeeded	1
them,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
stead:	1
2:22	1
As	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Esau,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Seir,	1
when	1
he	1
destroyed	1
the	1
Horims	1
from	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
succeeded	1
them,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
stead	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
2:23	1
And	1
the	1
Avims	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Hazerim,	1
even	1
unto	1
Azzah,	1
the	1
Caphtorims,	1
which	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Caphtor,	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
stead.)	1
	1
2:24	1
Rise	1
ye	1
up,	1
take	1
your	1
journey,	1
and	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
river	1
Arnon:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
into	1
thine	1
hand	1
Sihon	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
his	1
land:	1
begin	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
and	1
contend	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
2:25	1
This	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
thee	1
upon	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven,	1
who	1
shall	1
hear	1
report	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
tremble,	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
anguish	1
because	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
I	1
sent	1
messengers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Kedemoth	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon	1
with	1
words	1
of	1
peace,	1
saying,	1
2:27	1
Let	1
me	1
pass	1
through	1
thy	1
land:	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
way,	1
I	1
will	1
neither	1
turn	1
unto	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
2:28	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
sell	1
me	1
meat	1
for	1
money,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat;	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
water	1
for	1
money,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
drink:	1
only	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
on	1
my	1
feet;	1
2:29	1
(As	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Esau	1
which	1
dwell	1
in	1
Seir,	1
and	1
the	1
Moabites	1
which	1
dwell	1
in	1
Ar,	1
did	1
unto	1
me;)	1
until	1
I	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
Jordan	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
giveth	1
us.	1
	1
2:30	1
But	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
pass	1
by	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hardened	1
his	1
spirit,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
heart	1
obstinate,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
thy	1
hand,	1
as	1
appeareth	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
2:31	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
give	1
Sihon	1
and	1
his	1
land	1
before	1
thee:	1
begin	1
to	1
possess,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
inherit	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
2:32	1
Then	1
Sihon	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
us,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
fight	1
at	1
Jahaz.	1
	1
2:33	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
delivered	1
him	1
before	1
us;	1
and	1
we	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
2:34	1
And	1
we	1
took	1
all	1
his	1
cities	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
ones,	1
of	1
every	1
city,	1
we	1
left	1
none	1
to	1
remain:	1
2:35	1
Only	1
the	1
cattle	1
we	1
took	1
for	1
a	1
prey	1
unto	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
we	1
took.	1
	1
2:36	1
From	1
Aroer,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
river,	1
even	1
unto	1
Gilead,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
city	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
us:	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
delivered	1
all	1
unto	1
us:	1
2:37	1
Only	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
thou	1
camest	1
not,	1
nor	1
unto	1
any	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Jabbok,	1
nor	1
unto	1
the	1
cities	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
nor	1
unto	1
whatsoever	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
forbad	1
us.	1
	1
3:1	1
Then	1
we	1
turned,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Bashan:	1
and	1
Og	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
us,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
battle	1
at	1
Edrei.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Fear	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
his	1
land,	1
into	1
thy	1
hand;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Heshbon.	1
	1
3:3	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
delivered	1
into	1
our	1
hands	1
Og	1
also,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people:	1
and	1
we	1
smote	1
him	1
until	1
none	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
him	1
remaining.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
we	1
took	1
all	1
his	1
cities	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
city	1
which	1
we	1
took	1
not	1
from	1
them,	1
threescore	1
cities,	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Argob,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Og	1
in	1
Bashan.	1
	1
3:5	1
All	1
these	1
cities	1
were	1
fenced	1
with	1
high	1
walls,	1
gates,	1
and	1
bars;	1
beside	1
unwalled	1
towns	1
a	1
great	1
many.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
we	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
as	1
we	1
did	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
utterly	1
destroying	1
the	1
men,	1
women,	1
and	1
children,	1
of	1
every	1
city.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
cattle,	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
cities,	1
we	1
took	1
for	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
ourselves.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
we	1
took	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Arnon	1
unto	1
mount	1
Hermon;	1
3:9	1
(Which	1
Hermon	1
the	1
Sidonians	1
call	1
Sirion;	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites	1
call	1
it	1
Shenir;)	1
3:10	1
All	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
all	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
all	1
Bashan,	1
unto	1
Salchah	1
and	1
Edrei,	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Og	1
in	1
Bashan.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
only	1
Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
giants;	1
behold	1
his	1
bedstead	1
was	1
a	1
bedstead	1
of	1
iron;	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
Rabbath	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon?	1
nine	1
cubits	1
was	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
four	1
cubits	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
it,	1
after	1
the	1
cubit	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
this	1
land,	1
which	1
we	1
possessed	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
from	1
Aroer,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Arnon,	1
and	1
half	1
mount	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof,	1
gave	1
I	1
unto	1
the	1
Reubenites	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Gadites.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
all	1
Bashan,	1
being	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Og,	1
gave	1
I	1
unto	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh;	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Argob,	1
with	1
all	1
Bashan,	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
giants.	1
	1
3:14	1
Jair	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Argob	1
unto	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Geshuri	1
and	1
Maachathi;	1
and	1
called	1
them	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
name,	1
Bashanhavothjair,	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
Gilead	1
unto	1
Machir.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
Reubenites	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Gadites	1
I	1
gave	1
from	1
Gilead	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
Arnon	1
half	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
Jabbok,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon;	1
3:17	1
The	1
plain	1
also,	1
and	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
the	1
coast	1
thereof,	1
from	1
Chinnereth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
even	1
the	1
salt	1
sea,	1
under	1
Ashdothpisgah	1
eastward.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
I	1
commanded	1
you	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
this	1
land	1
to	1
possess	1
it:	1
ye	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
armed	1
before	1
your	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
3:19	1
But	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
your	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
your	1
cattle,	1
(for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
much	1
cattle,)	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
your	1
cities	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you;	1
3:20	1
Until	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
given	1
rest	1
unto	1
your	1
brethren,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
until	1
they	1
also	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
them	1
beyond	1
Jordan:	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
possession,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
I	1
commanded	1
Joshua	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
saying,	1
Thine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
done	1
unto	1
these	1
two	1
kings:	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
whither	1
thou	1
passest.	1
	1
3:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fear	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
he	1
shall	1
fight	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
I	1
besought	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
saying,	1
3:24	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
begun	1
to	1
shew	1
thy	1
servant	1
thy	1
greatness,	1
and	1
thy	1
mighty	1
hand:	1
for	1
what	1
God	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
heaven	1
or	1
in	1
earth,	1
that	1
can	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
might?	1
	1
3:25	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
over,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
good	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
that	1
goodly	1
mountain,	1
and	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
3:26	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Let	1
it	1
suffice	1
thee;	1
speak	1
no	1
more	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
3:27	1
Get	1
thee	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Pisgah,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
westward,	1
and	1
northward,	1
and	1
southward,	1
and	1
eastward,	1
and	1
behold	1
it	1
with	1
thine	1
eyes:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
this	1
Jordan.	1
	1
3:28	1
But	1
charge	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
encourage	1
him,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
over	1
before	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see.	1
	1
3:29	1
So	1
we	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
over	1
against	1
Bethpeor.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
therefore	1
hearken,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
judgments,	1
which	1
I	1
teach	1
you,	1
for	1
to	1
do	1
them,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
giveth	1
you.	1
	1
4:2	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
add	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
diminish	1
ought	1
from	1
it,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
4:3	1
Your	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
because	1
of	1
Baalpeor:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
followed	1
Baalpeor,	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
destroyed	1
them	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
4:4	1
But	1
ye	1
that	1
did	1
cleave	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
are	1
alive	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:5	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
commanded	1
me,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
4:6	1
Keep	1
therefore	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
wisdom	1
and	1
your	1
understanding	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
which	1
shall	1
hear	1
all	1
these	1
statutes,	1
and	1
say,	1
Surely	1
this	1
great	1
nation	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
understanding	1
people.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
what	1
nation	1
is	1
there	1
so	1
great,	1
who	1
hath	1
God	1
so	1
nigh	1
unto	1
them,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
for?	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
what	1
nation	1
is	1
there	1
so	1
great,	1
that	1
hath	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments	1
so	1
righteous	1
as	1
all	1
this	1
law,	1
which	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
you	1
this	1
day?	1
	1
4:9	1
Only	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself,	1
and	1
keep	1
thy	1
soul	1
diligently,	1
lest	1
thou	1
forget	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
lest	1
they	1
depart	1
from	1
thy	1
heart	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life:	1
but	1
teach	1
them	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
sons;	1
4:10	1
Specially	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
stoodest	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
Horeb,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Gather	1
me	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn	1
to	1
fear	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
live	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
teach	1
their	1
children.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
ye	1
came	1
near	1
and	1
stood	1
under	1
the	1
mountain;	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
burned	1
with	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
with	1
darkness,	1
clouds,	1
and	1
thick	1
darkness.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire:	1
ye	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
words,	1
but	1
saw	1
no	1
similitude;	1
only	1
ye	1
heard	1
a	1
voice.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
declared	1
unto	1
you	1
his	1
covenant,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
you	1
to	1
perform,	1
even	1
ten	1
commandments;	1
and	1
he	1
wrote	1
them	1
upon	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
to	1
teach	1
you	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
do	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
ye	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
4:15	1
Take	1
ye	1
therefore	1
good	1
heed	1
unto	1
yourselves;	1
for	1
ye	1
saw	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
similitude	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
Horeb	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire:	1
4:16	1
Lest	1
ye	1
corrupt	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
any	1
figure,	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
male	1
or	1
female,	1
4:17	1
The	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
beast	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
winged	1
fowl	1
that	1
flieth	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
4:18	1
The	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
fish	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
beneath	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:19	1
And	1
lest	1
thou	1
lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
seest	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
the	1
stars,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
shouldest	1
be	1
driven	1
to	1
worship	1
them,	1
and	1
serve	1
them,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
divided	1
unto	1
all	1
nations	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven.	1
	1
4:20	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
taken	1
you,	1
and	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
furnace,	1
even	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
inheritance,	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:21	1
Furthermore	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
and	1
sware	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
that	1
good	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance:	1
4:22	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
die	1
in	1
this	1
land,	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
Jordan:	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
over,	1
and	1
possess	1
that	1
good	1
land.	1
	1
4:23	1
Take	1
heed	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
lest	1
ye	1
forget	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
or	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
thing,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
forbidden	1
thee.	1
	1
4:24	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
consuming	1
fire,	1
even	1
a	1
jealous	1
God.	1
	1
4:25	1
When	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beget	1
children,	1
and	1
children's	1
children,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
remained	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
corrupt	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
or	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
thing,	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
anger:	1
4:26	1
I	1
call	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
to	1
witness	1
against	1
you	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
soon	1
utterly	1
perish	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
go	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
possess	1
it;	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
prolong	1
your	1
days	1
upon	1
it,	1
but	1
shall	1
utterly	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
scatter	1
you	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
few	1
in	1
number	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whither	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
lead	1
you.	1
	1
4:28	1
And	1
there	1
ye	1
shall	1
serve	1
gods,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
men's	1
hands,	1
wood	1
and	1
stone,	1
which	1
neither	1
see,	1
nor	1
hear,	1
nor	1
eat,	1
nor	1
smell.	1
	1
4:29	1
But	1
if	1
from	1
thence	1
thou	1
shalt	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
him,	1
if	1
thou	1
seek	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
4:30	1
When	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days,	1
if	1
thou	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
his	1
voice;	1
4:31	1
(For	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
merciful	1
God;)	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
thee,	1
neither	1
destroy	1
thee,	1
nor	1
forget	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:32	1
For	1
ask	1
now	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
are	1
past,	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
thee,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
God	1
created	1
man	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
ask	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
heaven	1
unto	1
the	1
other,	1
whether	1
there	1
hath	1
been	1
any	1
such	1
thing	1
as	1
this	1
great	1
thing	1
is,	1
or	1
hath	1
been	1
heard	1
like	1
it?	1
	1
4:33	1
Did	1
ever	1
people	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
God	1
speaking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard,	1
and	1
live?	1
	1
4:34	1
Or	1
hath	1
God	1
assayed	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
a	1
nation	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
another	1
nation,	1
by	1
temptations,	1
by	1
signs,	1
and	1
by	1
wonders,	1
and	1
by	1
war,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
and	1
by	1
great	1
terrors,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
did	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
Egypt	1
before	1
your	1
eyes?	1
4:35	1
Unto	1
thee	1
it	1
was	1
shewed,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
he	1
is	1
God;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
4:36	1
Out	1
of	1
heaven	1
he	1
made	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
instruct	1
thee:	1
and	1
upon	1
earth	1
he	1
shewed	1
thee	1
his	1
great	1
fire;	1
and	1
thou	1
heardest	1
his	1
words	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
therefore	1
he	1
chose	1
their	1
seed	1
after	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
sight	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
power	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
4:38	1
To	1
drive	1
out	1
nations	1
from	1
before	1
thee	1
greater	1
and	1
mightier	1
than	1
thou	1
art,	1
to	1
bring	1
thee	1
in,	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
their	1
land	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:39	1
Know	1
therefore	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
consider	1
it	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
he	1
is	1
God	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else.	1
	1
4:40	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
therefore	1
his	1
statutes,	1
and	1
his	1
commandments,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
go	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
children	1
after	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prolong	1
thy	1
days	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
4:41	1
Then	1
Moses	1
severed	1
three	1
cities	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
toward	1
the	1
sunrising;	1
4:42	1
That	1
the	1
slayer	1
might	1
flee	1
thither,	1
which	1
should	1
kill	1
his	1
neighbour	1
unawares,	1
and	1
hated	1
him	1
not	1
in	1
times	1
past;	1
and	1
that	1
fleeing	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
cities	1
he	1
might	1
live:	1
4:43	1
Namely,	1
Bezer	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
country,	1
of	1
the	1
Reubenites;	1
and	1
Ramoth	1
in	1
Gilead,	1
of	1
the	1
Gadites;	1
and	1
Golan	1
in	1
Bashan,	1
of	1
the	1
Manassites.	1
	1
4:44	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
Moses	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
4:45	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
testimonies,	1
and	1
the	1
statutes,	1
and	1
the	1
judgments,	1
which	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
after	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
4:46	1
On	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
over	1
against	1
Bethpeor,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
who	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Heshbon,	1
whom	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
smote,	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
4:47	1
And	1
they	1
possessed	1
his	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
two	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
toward	1
the	1
sunrising;	1
4:48	1
From	1
Aroer,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Arnon,	1
even	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
which	1
is	1
Hermon,	1
4:49	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
plain	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
eastward,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
under	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
Pisgah.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments	1
which	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
your	1
ears	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
learn	1
them,	1
and	1
keep,	1
and	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
5:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
Horeb.	1
	1
5:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
made	1
not	1
this	1
covenant	1
with	1
our	1
fathers,	1
but	1
with	1
us,	1
even	1
us,	1
who	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
here	1
alive	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
5:4	1
The	1
LORD	1
talked	1
with	1
you	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
5:5	1
(I	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
you	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
to	1
shew	1
you	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
afraid	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount;)	1
saying,	1
5:6	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
5:7	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
none	1
other	1
gods	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
5:8	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
thee	1
any	1
graven	1
image,	1
or	1
any	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
beneath	1
the	1
earth:	1
5:9	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bow	1
down	1
thyself	1
unto	1
them,	1
nor	1
serve	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
am	1
a	1
jealous	1
God,	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
generation	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me,	1
5:10	1
And	1
shewing	1
mercy	1
unto	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
me	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments.	1
	1
5:11	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
hold	1
him	1
guiltless	1
that	1
taketh	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
5:12	1
Keep	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
to	1
sanctify	1
it,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
thee.	1
	1
5:13	1
Six	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
labour,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
thy	1
work:	1
5:14	1
But	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
in	1
it	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
do	1
any	1
work,	1
thou,	1
nor	1
thy	1
son,	1
nor	1
thy	1
daughter,	1
nor	1
thy	1
manservant,	1
nor	1
thy	1
maidservant,	1
nor	1
thine	1
ox,	1
nor	1
thine	1
ass,	1
nor	1
any	1
of	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
nor	1
thy	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
thy	1
gates;	1
that	1
thy	1
manservant	1
and	1
thy	1
maidservant	1
may	1
rest	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
thou.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
a	1
servant	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
thence	1
through	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm:	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
commanded	1
thee	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
5:16	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
thee;	1
that	1
thy	1
days	1
may	1
be	1
prolonged,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
go	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee.	1
	1
5:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill.	1
	1
5:18	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
5:19	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
steal.	1
	1
5:20	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bear	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
thy	1
neighbour.	1
	1
5:21	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
desire	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
covet	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
house,	1
his	1
field,	1
or	1
his	1
manservant,	1
or	1
his	1
maidservant,	1
his	1
ox,	1
or	1
his	1
ass,	1
or	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
thy	1
neighbour's.	1
	1
5:22	1
These	1
words	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
your	1
assembly	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
thick	1
darkness,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
voice:	1
and	1
he	1
added	1
no	1
more.	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
them	1
in	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
ye	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
darkness,	1
(for	1
the	1
mountain	1
did	1
burn	1
with	1
fire,)	1
that	1
ye	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
your	1
tribes,	1
and	1
your	1
elders;	1
5:24	1
And	1
ye	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
us	1
his	1
glory	1
and	1
his	1
greatness,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire:	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
day	1
that	1
God	1
doth	1
talk	1
with	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
liveth.	1
	1
5:25	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
should	1
we	1
die?	1
for	1
this	1
great	1
fire	1
will	1
consume	1
us:	1
if	1
we	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
any	1
more,	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
5:26	1
For	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
that	1
hath	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
speaking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
as	1
we	1
have,	1
and	1
lived?	1
	1
5:27	1
Go	1
thou	1
near,	1
and	1
hear	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
say:	1
and	1
speak	1
thou	1
unto	1
us	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
hear	1
it,	1
and	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
5:28	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
your	1
words,	1
when	1
ye	1
spake	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
people,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thee:	1
they	1
have	1
well	1
said	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
spoken.	1
	1
5:29	1
O	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
such	1
an	1
heart	1
in	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
fear	1
me,	1
and	1
keep	1
all	1
my	1
commandments	1
always,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
children	1
for	1
ever!	1
	1
5:30	1
Go	1
say	1
to	1
them,	1
Get	1
you	1
into	1
your	1
tents	1
again.	1
	1
5:31	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
thee,	1
stand	1
thou	1
here	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
commandments,	1
and	1
the	1
statutes,	1
and	1
the	1
judgments,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
teach	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
5:32	1
Ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
therefore	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
turn	1
aside	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
5:33	1
Ye	1
shall	1
walk	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
ways	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prolong	1
your	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
possess.	1
	1
6:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
commandments,	1
the	1
statutes,	1
and	1
the	1
judgments,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
commanded	1
to	1
teach	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
do	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
possess	1
it:	1
6:2	1
That	1
thou	1
mightest	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
keep	1
all	1
his	1
statutes	1
and	1
his	1
commandments,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
thy	1
son's	1
son,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life;	1
and	1
that	1
thy	1
days	1
may	1
be	1
prolonged.	1
	1
6:3	1
Hear	1
therefore,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
and	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
it;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
increase	1
mightily,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers	1
hath	1
promised	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
6:4	1
Hear,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
The	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
one	1
LORD:	1
6:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
might.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
these	1
words,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
thine	1
heart:	1
6:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
teach	1
them	1
diligently	1
unto	1
thy	1
children,	1
and	1
shalt	1
talk	1
of	1
them	1
when	1
thou	1
sittest	1
in	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
walkest	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
liest	1
down,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
risest	1
up.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bind	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
upon	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
frontlets	1
between	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
write	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
posts	1
of	1
thy	1
house,	1
and	1
on	1
thy	1
gates.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
great	1
and	1
goodly	1
cities,	1
which	1
thou	1
buildedst	1
not,	1
6:11	1
And	1
houses	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
good	1
things,	1
which	1
thou	1
filledst	1
not,	1
and	1
wells	1
digged,	1
which	1
thou	1
diggedst	1
not,	1
vineyards	1
and	1
olive	1
trees,	1
which	1
thou	1
plantedst	1
not;	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
be	1
full;	1
6:12	1
Then	1
beware	1
lest	1
thou	1
forget	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
6:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
shalt	1
swear	1
by	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
6:14	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
you;	1
6:15	1
(For	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
jealous	1
God	1
among	1
you)	1
lest	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
be	1
kindled	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
destroy	1
thee	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:16	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
tempt	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
as	1
ye	1
tempted	1
him	1
in	1
Massah.	1
	1
6:17	1
Ye	1
shall	1
diligently	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
his	1
testimonies,	1
and	1
his	1
statutes,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
thee.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
good	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers.	1
	1
6:19	1
To	1
cast	1
out	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
from	1
before	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
when	1
thy	1
son	1
asketh	1
thee	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
saying,	1
What	1
mean	1
the	1
testimonies,	1
and	1
the	1
statutes,	1
and	1
the	1
judgments,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you?	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
thy	1
son,	1
We	1
were	1
Pharaoh's	1
bondmen	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand:	1
6:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
great	1
and	1
sore,	1
upon	1
Egypt,	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
household,	1
before	1
our	1
eyes:	1
6:23	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
us	1
out	1
from	1
thence,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
in,	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
statutes,	1
to	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
for	1
our	1
good	1
always,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
preserve	1
us	1
alive,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
our	1
righteousness,	1
if	1
we	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
commandments	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
us.	1
	1
7:1	1
When	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
and	1
hath	1
cast	1
out	1
many	1
nations	1
before	1
thee,	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Girgashites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
seven	1
nations	1
greater	1
and	1
mightier	1
than	1
thou;	1
7:2	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
deliver	1
them	1
before	1
thee;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
them,	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
no	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
nor	1
shew	1
mercy	1
unto	1
them:	1
7:3	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
marriages	1
with	1
them;	1
thy	1
daughter	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
give	1
unto	1
his	1
son,	1
nor	1
his	1
daughter	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
unto	1
thy	1
son.	1
	1
7:4	1
For	1
they	1
will	1
turn	1
away	1
thy	1
son	1
from	1
following	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
other	1
gods:	1
so	1
will	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
kindled	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
destroy	1
thee	1
suddenly.	1
	1
7:5	1
But	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
deal	1
with	1
them;	1
ye	1
shall	1
destroy	1
their	1
altars,	1
and	1
break	1
down	1
their	1
images,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
their	1
groves,	1
and	1
burn	1
their	1
graven	1
images	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
holy	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
special	1
people	1
unto	1
himself,	1
above	1
all	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
did	1
not	1
set	1
his	1
love	1
upon	1
you,	1
nor	1
choose	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
were	1
more	1
in	1
number	1
than	1
any	1
people;	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
fewest	1
of	1
all	1
people:	1
7:8	1
But	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
loved	1
you,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
keep	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers,	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
redeemed	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondmen,	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:9	1
Know	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
he	1
is	1
God,	1
the	1
faithful	1
God,	1
which	1
keepeth	1
covenant	1
and	1
mercy	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
generations;	1
7:10	1
And	1
repayeth	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
him	1
to	1
their	1
face,	1
to	1
destroy	1
them:	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
slack	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
hateth	1
him,	1
he	1
will	1
repay	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
7:11	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
therefore	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments,	1
and	1
the	1
statutes,	1
and	1
the	1
judgments,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
ye	1
hearken	1
to	1
these	1
judgments,	1
and	1
keep,	1
and	1
do	1
them,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
keep	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
covenant	1
and	1
the	1
mercy	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers:	1
7:13	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
love	1
thee,	1
and	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thee:	1
he	1
will	1
also	1
bless	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
womb,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
thy	1
corn,	1
and	1
thy	1
wine,	1
and	1
thine	1
oil,	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
thy	1
kine,	1
and	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
thy	1
sheep,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
7:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blessed	1
above	1
all	1
people:	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
male	1
or	1
female	1
barren	1
among	1
you,	1
or	1
among	1
your	1
cattle.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
thee	1
all	1
sickness,	1
and	1
will	1
put	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
diseases	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
upon	1
thee;	1
but	1
will	1
lay	1
them	1
upon	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
thee.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
consume	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
deliver	1
thee;	1
thine	1
eye	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
upon	1
them:	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve	1
their	1
gods;	1
for	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
7:17	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
These	1
nations	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
I;	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
dispossess	1
them?	1
	1
7:18	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
them:	1
but	1
shalt	1
well	1
remember	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
did	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
Egypt;	1
7:19	1
The	1
great	1
temptations	1
which	1
thine	1
eyes	1
saw,	1
and	1
the	1
signs,	1
and	1
the	1
wonders,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
whereby	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
brought	1
thee	1
out:	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
do	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
afraid.	1
	1
7:20	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
send	1
the	1
hornet	1
among	1
them,	1
until	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
left,	1
and	1
hide	1
themselves	1
from	1
thee,	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
7:21	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
affrighted	1
at	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
a	1
mighty	1
God	1
and	1
terrible.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
put	1
out	1
those	1
nations	1
before	1
thee	1
by	1
little	1
and	1
little:	1
thou	1
mayest	1
not	1
consume	1
them	1
at	1
once,	1
lest	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
increase	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
7:23	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
deliver	1
them	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
destruction,	1
until	1
they	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
deliver	1
their	1
kings	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
destroy	1
their	1
name	1
from	1
under	1
heaven:	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
have	1
destroyed	1
them.	1
	1
7:25	1
The	1
graven	1
images	1
of	1
their	1
gods	1
shall	1
ye	1
burn	1
with	1
fire:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
desire	1
the	1
silver	1
or	1
gold	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
them,	1
nor	1
take	1
it	1
unto	1
thee,	1
lest	1
thou	1
be	1
snared	1
therin:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
7:26	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bring	1
an	1
abomination	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
lest	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
cursed	1
thing	1
like	1
it:	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
utterly	1
detest	1
it,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
utterly	1
abhor	1
it;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
cursed	1
thing.	1
	1
8:1	1
All	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
shall	1
ye	1
observe	1
to	1
do,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
multiply,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
remember	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
led	1
thee	1
these	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
to	1
humble	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
thee,	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
whether	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
or	1
no.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
he	1
humbled	1
thee,	1
and	1
suffered	1
thee	1
to	1
hunger,	1
and	1
fed	1
thee	1
with	1
manna,	1
which	1
thou	1
knewest	1
not,	1
neither	1
did	1
thy	1
fathers	1
know;	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
thee	1
know	1
that	1
man	1
doth	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
man	1
live.	1
	1
8:4	1
Thy	1
raiment	1
waxed	1
not	1
old	1
upon	1
thee,	1
neither	1
did	1
thy	1
foot	1
swell,	1
these	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
8:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
consider	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
chasteneth	1
his	1
son,	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
chasteneth	1
thee.	1
	1
8:6	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
to	1
fear	1
him.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
bringeth	1
thee	1
into	1
a	1
good	1
land,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
brooks	1
of	1
water,	1
of	1
fountains	1
and	1
depths	1
that	1
spring	1
out	1
of	1
valleys	1
and	1
hills;	1
8:8	1
A	1
land	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
barley,	1
and	1
vines,	1
and	1
fig	1
trees,	1
and	1
pomegranates;	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
oil	1
olive,	1
and	1
honey;	1
8:9	1
A	1
land	1
wherein	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
bread	1
without	1
scarceness,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lack	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
it;	1
a	1
land	1
whose	1
stones	1
are	1
iron,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
whose	1
hills	1
thou	1
mayest	1
dig	1
brass.	1
	1
8:10	1
When	1
thou	1
hast	1
eaten	1
and	1
art	1
full,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
thee.	1
	1
8:11	1
Beware	1
that	1
thou	1
forget	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
in	1
not	1
keeping	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
his	1
judgments,	1
and	1
his	1
statutes,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day:	1
8:12	1
Lest	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
eaten	1
and	1
art	1
full,	1
and	1
hast	1
built	1
goodly	1
houses,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
therein;	1
8:13	1
And	1
when	1
thy	1
herds	1
and	1
thy	1
flocks	1
multiply,	1
and	1
thy	1
silver	1
and	1
thy	1
gold	1
is	1
multiplied,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
is	1
multiplied;	1
8:14	1
Then	1
thine	1
heart	1
be	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
thou	1
forget	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage;	1
8:15	1
Who	1
led	1
thee	1
through	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
wilderness,	1
wherein	1
were	1
fiery	1
serpents,	1
and	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
drought,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water;	1
who	1
brought	1
thee	1
forth	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
flint;	1
8:16	1
Who	1
fed	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
manna,	1
which	1
thy	1
fathers	1
knew	1
not,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
humble	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
prove	1
thee,	1
to	1
do	1
thee	1
good	1
at	1
thy	1
latter	1
end;	1
8:17	1
And	1
thou	1
say	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
My	1
power	1
and	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
mine	1
hand	1
hath	1
gotten	1
me	1
this	1
wealth.	1
	1
8:18	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
remember	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
thee	1
power	1
to	1
get	1
wealth,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
establish	1
his	1
covenant	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
thou	1
do	1
at	1
all	1
forget	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
walk	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
worship	1
them,	1
I	1
testify	1
against	1
you	1
this	1
day	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
surely	1
perish.	1
	1
8:20	1
As	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
destroyeth	1
before	1
your	1
face,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
perish;	1
because	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
9:1	1
Hear,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
Thou	1
art	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
Jordan	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
possess	1
nations	1
greater	1
and	1
mightier	1
than	1
thyself,	1
cities	1
great	1
and	1
fenced	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
9:2	1
A	1
people	1
great	1
and	1
tall,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Anakims,	1
whom	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
say,	1
Who	1
can	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Anak!	1
	1
9:3	1
Understand	1
therefore	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
goeth	1
over	1
before	1
thee;	1
as	1
a	1
consuming	1
fire	1
he	1
shall	1
destroy	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
before	1
thy	1
face:	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
drive	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
quickly,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
9:4	1
Speak	1
not	1
thou	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
For	1
my	1
righteousness	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
brought	1
me	1
in	1
to	1
possess	1
this	1
land:	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
these	1
nations	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
9:5	1
Not	1
for	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
uprightness	1
of	1
thine	1
heart,	1
dost	1
thou	1
go	1
to	1
possess	1
their	1
land:	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
these	1
nations	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
doth	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
perform	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob.	1
	1
9:6	1
Understand	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
not	1
this	1
good	1
land	1
to	1
possess	1
it	1
for	1
thy	1
righteousness;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people.	1
	1
9:7	1
Remember,	1
and	1
forget	1
not,	1
how	1
thou	1
provokedst	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
to	1
wrath	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
until	1
ye	1
came	1
unto	1
this	1
place,	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
rebellious	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:8	1
Also	1
in	1
Horeb	1
ye	1
provoked	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
wrath,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
destroyed	1
you.	1
	1
9:9	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
gone	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
even	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
with	1
you,	1
then	1
I	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights,	1
I	1
neither	1
did	1
eat	1
bread	1
nor	1
drink	1
water:	1
9:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
unto	1
me	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone	1
written	1
with	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
on	1
them	1
was	1
written	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
words,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
assembly.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
even	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
covenant.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
get	1
thee	1
down	1
quickly	1
from	1
hence;	1
for	1
thy	1
people	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
have	1
corrupted	1
themselves;	1
they	1
are	1
quickly	1
turned	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them;	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
molten	1
image.	1
	1
9:13	1
Furthermore	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
people,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people:	1
9:14	1
Let	1
me	1
alone,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
destroy	1
them,	1
and	1
blot	1
out	1
their	1
name	1
from	1
under	1
heaven:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
nation	1
mightier	1
and	1
greater	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
9:15	1
So	1
I	1
turned	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
the	1
mount	1
burned	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
were	1
in	1
my	1
two	1
hands.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
had	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
you	1
a	1
molten	1
calf:	1
ye	1
had	1
turned	1
aside	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
you.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
tables,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
two	1
hands,	1
and	1
brake	1
them	1
before	1
your	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights:	1
I	1
did	1
neither	1
eat	1
bread,	1
nor	1
drink	1
water,	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
sins	1
which	1
ye	1
sinned,	1
in	1
doing	1
wickedly	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
anger	1
and	1
hot	1
displeasure,	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
wroth	1
against	1
you	1
to	1
destroy	1
you.	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
also.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
very	1
angry	1
with	1
Aaron	1
to	1
have	1
destroyed	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
prayed	1
for	1
Aaron	1
also	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
your	1
sin,	1
the	1
calf	1
which	1
ye	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
stamped	1
it,	1
and	1
ground	1
it	1
very	1
small,	1
even	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
dust:	1
and	1
I	1
cast	1
the	1
dust	1
thereof	1
into	1
the	1
brook	1
that	1
descended	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
at	1
Taberah,	1
and	1
at	1
Massah,	1
and	1
at	1
Kibrothhattaavah,	1
ye	1
provoked	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
wrath.	1
	1
9:23	1
Likewise	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
you	1
from	1
Kadeshbarnea,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
up	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you;	1
then	1
ye	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
believed	1
him	1
not,	1
nor	1
hearkened	1
to	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
9:24	1
Ye	1
have	1
been	1
rebellious	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
you.	1
	1
9:25	1
Thus	1
I	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights,	1
as	1
I	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
first;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
destroy	1
you.	1
	1
9:26	1
I	1
prayed	1
therefore	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
destroy	1
not	1
thy	1
people	1
and	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
through	1
thy	1
greatness,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand.	1
	1
9:27	1
Remember	1
thy	1
servants,	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob;	1
look	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
stubbornness	1
of	1
this	1
people,	1
nor	1
to	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
nor	1
to	1
their	1
sin:	1
9:28	1
Lest	1
the	1
land	1
whence	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
us	1
out	1
say,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
promised	1
them,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
hated	1
them,	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
9:29	1
Yet	1
they	1
are	1
thy	1
people	1
and	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
which	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
out	1
by	1
thy	1
mighty	1
power	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm.	1
	1
10:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Hew	1
thee	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
an	1
ark	1
of	1
wood.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
on	1
the	1
tables	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
tables	1
which	1
thou	1
brakest,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
I	1
made	1
an	1
ark	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood,	1
and	1
hewed	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount,	1
having	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
in	1
mine	1
hand.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
tables,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
writing,	1
the	1
ten	1
commandments,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
assembly:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
I	1
turned	1
myself	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
tables	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
made;	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
be,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
me.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
from	1
Beeroth	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Jaakan	1
to	1
Mosera:	1
there	1
Aaron	1
died,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
buried;	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son	1
ministered	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
10:7	1
From	1
thence	1
they	1
journeyed	1
unto	1
Gudgodah;	1
and	1
from	1
Gudgodah	1
to	1
Jotbath,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
rivers	1
of	1
waters.	1
	1
10:8	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
LORD	1
separated	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi,	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
bless	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
10:9	1
Wherefore	1
Levi	1
hath	1
no	1
part	1
nor	1
inheritance	1
with	1
his	1
brethren;	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
inheritance,	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
promised	1
him.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
I	1
stayed	1
in	1
the	1
mount,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
not	1
destroy	1
thee.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
take	1
thy	1
journey	1
before	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
now,	1
Israel,	1
what	1
doth	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
require	1
of	1
thee,	1
but	1
to	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
10:13	1
To	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
statutes,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
for	1
thy	1
good?	1
	1
10:14	1
Behold,	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
of	1
heavens	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
thy	1
God,	1
the	1
earth	1
also,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
therein	1
is.	1
	1
10:15	1
Only	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
a	1
delight	1
in	1
thy	1
fathers	1
to	1
love	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
chose	1
their	1
seed	1
after	1
them,	1
even	1
you	1
above	1
all	1
people,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
10:16	1
Circumcise	1
therefore	1
the	1
foreskin	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
and	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
stiffnecked.	1
	1
10:17	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
is	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords,	1
a	1
great	1
God,	1
a	1
mighty,	1
and	1
a	1
terrible,	1
which	1
regardeth	1
not	1
persons,	1
nor	1
taketh	1
reward:	1
10:18	1
He	1
doth	1
execute	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless	1
and	1
widow,	1
and	1
loveth	1
the	1
stranger,	1
in	1
giving	1
him	1
food	1
and	1
raiment.	1
	1
10:19	1
Love	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
stranger:	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:20	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
him	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
shalt	1
thou	1
cleave,	1
and	1
swear	1
by	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
10:21	1
He	1
is	1
thy	1
praise,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
hath	1
done	1
for	1
thee	1
these	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
things,	1
which	1
thine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen.	1
	1
10:22	1
Thy	1
fathers	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt	1
with	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
persons;	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
11:1	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
charge,	1
and	1
his	1
statutes,	1
and	1
his	1
judgments,	1
and	1
his	1
commandments,	1
alway.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
know	1
ye	1
this	1
day:	1
for	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
with	1
your	1
children	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
known,	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
his	1
greatness,	1
his	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
his	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
11:3	1
And	1
his	1
miracles,	1
and	1
his	1
acts,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
land;	1
11:4	1
And	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
unto	1
their	1
horses,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
chariots;	1
how	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
to	1
overflow	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
pursued	1
after	1
you,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
destroyed	1
them	1
unto	1
this	1
day;	1
11:5	1
And	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
until	1
ye	1
came	1
into	1
this	1
place;	1
11:6	1
And	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Reuben:	1
how	1
the	1
earth	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
their	1
households,	1
and	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
substance	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
possession,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
Israel:	1
11:7	1
But	1
your	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
11:8	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
keep	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
possess	1
it;	1
11:9	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prolong	1
your	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
seed,	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
in	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
whence	1
ye	1
came	1
out,	1
where	1
thou	1
sowedst	1
thy	1
seed,	1
and	1
wateredst	1
it	1
with	1
thy	1
foot,	1
as	1
a	1
garden	1
of	1
herbs:	1
11:11	1
But	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
hills	1
and	1
valleys,	1
and	1
drinketh	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
rain	1
of	1
heaven:	1
11:12	1
A	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
careth	1
for:	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
are	1
always	1
upon	1
it,	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
hearken	1
diligently	1
unto	1
my	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
soul,	1
11:14	1
That	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
rain	1
of	1
your	1
land	1
in	1
his	1
due	1
season,	1
the	1
first	1
rain	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
rain,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
gather	1
in	1
thy	1
corn,	1
and	1
thy	1
wine,	1
and	1
thine	1
oil.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
grass	1
in	1
thy	1
fields	1
for	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
eat	1
and	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
11:16	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
not	1
deceived,	1
and	1
ye	1
turn	1
aside,	1
and	1
serve	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
worship	1
them;	1
11:17	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
LORD's	1
wrath	1
be	1
kindled	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
he	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
heaven,	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
rain,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
yield	1
not	1
her	1
fruit;	1
and	1
lest	1
ye	1
perish	1
quickly	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
good	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
giveth	1
you.	1
	1
11:18	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
lay	1
up	1
these	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
soul,	1
and	1
bind	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
upon	1
your	1
hand,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
frontlets	1
between	1
your	1
eyes.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
teach	1
them	1
your	1
children,	1
speaking	1
of	1
them	1
when	1
thou	1
sittest	1
in	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
walkest	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
when	1
thou	1
liest	1
down,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
risest	1
up.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
write	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
door	1
posts	1
of	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
gates:	1
11:21	1
That	1
your	1
days	1
may	1
be	1
multiplied,	1
and	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
children,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
them,	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
heaven	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:22	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
diligently	1
keep	1
all	1
these	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you,	1
to	1
do	1
them,	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
to	1
cleave	1
unto	1
him;	1
11:23	1
Then	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
drive	1
out	1
all	1
these	1
nations	1
from	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
possess	1
greater	1
nations	1
and	1
mightier	1
than	1
yourselves.	1
	1
11:24	1
Every	1
place	1
whereon	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
your	1
feet	1
shall	1
tread	1
shall	1
be	1
yours:	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
Lebanon,	1
from	1
the	1
river,	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
uttermost	1
sea	1
shall	1
your	1
coast	1
be.	1
	1
11:25	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
shall	1
lay	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
you	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
tread	1
upon,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:26	1
Behold,	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
you	1
this	1
day	1
a	1
blessing	1
and	1
a	1
curse;	1
11:27	1
A	1
blessing,	1
if	1
ye	1
obey	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
this	1
day:	1
11:28	1
And	1
a	1
curse,	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
but	1
turn	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
go	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
known.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
brought	1
thee	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
the	1
blessing	1
upon	1
mount	1
Gerizim,	1
and	1
the	1
curse	1
upon	1
mount	1
Ebal.	1
	1
11:30	1
Are	1
they	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
where	1
the	1
sun	1
goeth	1
down,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
which	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
champaign	1
over	1
against	1
Gilgal,	1
beside	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moreh?	1
	1
11:31	1
For	1
ye	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
giveth	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
possess	1
it,	1
and	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments	1
which	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
you	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
12:1	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers	1
giveth	1
thee	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
ye	1
live	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:2	1
Ye	1
shall	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
places,	1
wherein	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
possess	1
served	1
their	1
gods,	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
mountains,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree:	1
12:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
overthrow	1
their	1
altars,	1
and	1
break	1
their	1
pillars,	1
and	1
burn	1
their	1
groves	1
with	1
fire;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
hew	1
down	1
the	1
graven	1
images	1
of	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
12:4	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
12:5	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
shall	1
choose	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
tribes	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
name	1
there,	1
even	1
unto	1
his	1
habitation	1
shall	1
ye	1
seek,	1
and	1
thither	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come:	1
12:6	1
And	1
thither	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
your	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
your	1
tithes,	1
and	1
heave	1
offerings	1
of	1
your	1
hand,	1
and	1
your	1
vows,	1
and	1
your	1
freewill	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
firstlings	1
of	1
your	1
herds	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
flocks:	1
12:7	1
And	1
there	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
ye	1
put	1
your	1
hand	1
unto,	1
ye	1
and	1
your	1
households,	1
wherein	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thee.	1
	1
12:8	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
here	1
this	1
day,	1
every	1
man	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
	1
12:9	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inheritance,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
giveth	1
you.	1
	1
12:10	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
go	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
giveth	1
you	1
to	1
inherit,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
giveth	1
you	1
rest	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
enemies	1
round	1
about,	1
so	1
that	1
ye	1
dwell	1
in	1
safety;	1
12:11	1
Then	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
cause	1
his	1
name	1
to	1
dwell	1
there;	1
thither	1
shall	1
ye	1
bring	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
you;	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
your	1
sacrifices,	1
your	1
tithes,	1
and	1
the	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
your	1
hand,	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
choice	1
vows	1
which	1
ye	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
12:12	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
ye,	1
and	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
your	1
daughters,	1
and	1
your	1
menservants,	1
and	1
your	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
the	1
Levite	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
your	1
gates;	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
part	1
nor	1
inheritance	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
12:13	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself	1
that	1
thou	1
offer	1
not	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
that	1
thou	1
seest:	1
12:14	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
choose	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
tribes,	1
there	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
there	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee.	1
	1
12:15	1
Notwithstanding	1
thou	1
mayest	1
kill	1
and	1
eat	1
flesh	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
gates,	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
soul	1
lusteth	1
after,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
thee:	1
the	1
unclean	1
and	1
the	1
clean	1
may	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
roebuck,	1
and	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
hart.	1
	1
12:16	1
Only	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
the	1
blood;	1
ye	1
shall	1
pour	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
water.	1
	1
12:17	1
Thou	1
mayest	1
not	1
eat	1
within	1
thy	1
gates	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
thy	1
corn,	1
or	1
of	1
thy	1
wine,	1
or	1
of	1
thy	1
oil,	1
or	1
the	1
firstlings	1
of	1
thy	1
herds	1
or	1
of	1
thy	1
flock,	1
nor	1
any	1
of	1
thy	1
vows	1
which	1
thou	1
vowest,	1
nor	1
thy	1
freewill	1
offerings,	1
or	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
thine	1
hand:	1
12:18	1
But	1
thou	1
must	1
eat	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
choose,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughter,	1
and	1
thy	1
manservant,	1
and	1
thy	1
maidservant,	1
and	1
the	1
Levite	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
thy	1
gates:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rejoice	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
puttest	1
thine	1
hands	1
unto.	1
	1
12:19	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself	1
that	1
thou	1
forsake	1
not	1
the	1
Levite	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
thou	1
livest	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:20	1
When	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
enlarge	1
thy	1
border,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
because	1
thy	1
soul	1
longeth	1
to	1
eat	1
flesh;	1
thou	1
mayest	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
soul	1
lusteth	1
after.	1
	1
12:21	1
If	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
name	1
there	1
be	1
too	1
far	1
from	1
thee,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
kill	1
of	1
thy	1
herd	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
flock,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
thee,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
in	1
thy	1
gates	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
soul	1
lusteth	1
after.	1
	1
12:22	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
roebuck	1
and	1
the	1
hart	1
is	1
eaten,	1
so	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
them:	1
the	1
unclean	1
and	1
the	1
clean	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
them	1
alike.	1
	1
12:23	1
Only	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
thou	1
eat	1
not	1
the	1
blood:	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
is	1
the	1
life;	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
not	1
eat	1
the	1
life	1
with	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
12:24	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
it;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
pour	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
water.	1
	1
12:25	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
it;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
go	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
children	1
after	1
thee,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:26	1
Only	1
thy	1
holy	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
thy	1
vows,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take,	1
and	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
choose:	1
12:27	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
blood,	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
sacrifices	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
12:28	1
Observe	1
and	1
hear	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
go	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
children	1
after	1
thee	1
for	1
ever,	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
12:29	1
When	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
nations	1
from	1
before	1
thee,	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
possess	1
them,	1
and	1
thou	1
succeedest	1
them,	1
and	1
dwellest	1
in	1
their	1
land;	1
12:30	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself	1
that	1
thou	1
be	1
not	1
snared	1
by	1
following	1
them,	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
enquire	1
not	1
after	1
their	1
gods,	1
saying,	1
How	1
did	1
these	1
nations	1
serve	1
their	1
gods?	1
even	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
likewise.	1
	1
12:31	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
for	1
every	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
hateth,	1
have	1
they	1
done	1
unto	1
their	1
gods;	1
for	1
even	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
they	1
have	1
burnt	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
their	1
gods.	1
	1
12:32	1
What	1
thing	1
soever	1
I	1
command	1
you,	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
it:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
add	1
thereto,	1
nor	1
diminish	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
13:1	1
If	1
there	1
arise	1
among	1
you	1
a	1
prophet,	1
or	1
a	1
dreamer	1
of	1
dreams,	1
and	1
giveth	1
thee	1
a	1
sign	1
or	1
a	1
wonder,	1
13:2	1
And	1
the	1
sign	1
or	1
the	1
wonder	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
whereof	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
known,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
serve	1
them;	1
13:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
that	1
prophet,	1
or	1
that	1
dreamer	1
of	1
dreams:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
proveth	1
you,	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
ye	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
soul.	1
	1
13:4	1
Ye	1
shall	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
fear	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
obey	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
cleave	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
that	1
prophet,	1
or	1
that	1
dreamer	1
of	1
dreams,	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
to	1
turn	1
you	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
redeemed	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage,	1
to	1
thrust	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
commanded	1
thee	1
to	1
walk	1
in.	1
So	1
shalt	1
thou	1
put	1
the	1
evil	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
13:6	1
If	1
thy	1
brother,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
thy	1
mother,	1
or	1
thy	1
son,	1
or	1
thy	1
daughter,	1
or	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
thy	1
bosom,	1
or	1
thy	1
friend,	1
which	1
is	1
as	1
thine	1
own	1
soul,	1
entice	1
thee	1
secretly,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
serve	1
other	1
gods,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
known,	1
thou,	1
nor	1
thy	1
fathers;	1
13:7	1
Namely,	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
you,	1
nigh	1
unto	1
thee,	1
or	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
thee,	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
13:8	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
consent	1
unto	1
him,	1
nor	1
hearken	1
unto	1
him;	1
neither	1
shall	1
thine	1
eye	1
pity	1
him,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
spare,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
conceal	1
him:	1
13:9	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
kill	1
him;	1
thine	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
first	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stone	1
him	1
with	1
stones,	1
that	1
he	1
die;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
sought	1
to	1
thrust	1
thee	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
fear,	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
any	1
such	1
wickedness	1
as	1
this	1
is	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
13:12	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
say	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
cities,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
to	1
dwell	1
there,	1
saying,	1
13:13	1
Certain	1
men,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Belial,	1
are	1
gone	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
withdrawn	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
their	1
city,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
serve	1
other	1
gods,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
known;	1
13:14	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
enquire,	1
and	1
make	1
search,	1
and	1
ask	1
diligently;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
certain,	1
that	1
such	1
abomination	1
is	1
wrought	1
among	1
you;	1
13:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
smite	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
destroying	1
it	1
utterly,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
and	1
the	1
cattle	1
thereof,	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
gather	1
all	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
thereof,	1
and	1
shalt	1
burn	1
with	1
fire	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
spoil	1
thereof	1
every	1
whit,	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
heap	1
for	1
ever;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
built	1
again.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
cleave	1
nought	1
of	1
the	1
cursed	1
thing	1
to	1
thine	1
hand:	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
may	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
shew	1
thee	1
mercy,	1
and	1
have	1
compassion	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thee,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
sworn	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers;	1
13:18	1
When	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
keep	1
all	1
his	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
14:1	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
cut	1
yourselves,	1
nor	1
make	1
any	1
baldness	1
between	1
your	1
eyes	1
for	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
holy	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chosen	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people	1
unto	1
himself,	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
any	1
abominable	1
thing.	1
	1
14:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
beasts	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat:	1
the	1
ox,	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
goat,	1
14:5	1
The	1
hart,	1
and	1
the	1
roebuck,	1
and	1
the	1
fallow	1
deer,	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
goat,	1
and	1
the	1
pygarg,	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
ox,	1
and	1
the	1
chamois.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
every	1
beast	1
that	1
parteth	1
the	1
hoof,	1
and	1
cleaveth	1
the	1
cleft	1
into	1
two	1
claws,	1
and	1
cheweth	1
the	1
cud	1
among	1
the	1
beasts,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat.	1
	1
14:7	1
Nevertheless	1
these	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
chew	1
the	1
cud,	1
or	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
divide	1
the	1
cloven	1
hoof;	1
as	1
the	1
camel,	1
and	1
the	1
hare,	1
and	1
the	1
coney:	1
for	1
they	1
chew	1
the	1
cud,	1
but	1
divide	1
not	1
the	1
hoof;	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
the	1
swine,	1
because	1
it	1
divideth	1
the	1
hoof,	1
yet	1
cheweth	1
not	1
the	1
cud,	1
it	1
is	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
their	1
flesh,	1
nor	1
touch	1
their	1
dead	1
carcase.	1
	1
14:9	1
These	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
waters:	1
all	1
that	1
have	1
fins	1
and	1
scales	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat:	1
14:10	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
hath	1
not	1
fins	1
and	1
scales	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
eat;	1
it	1
is	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
14:11	1
Of	1
all	1
clean	1
birds	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat.	1
	1
14:12	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
of	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat:	1
the	1
eagle,	1
and	1
the	1
ossifrage,	1
and	1
the	1
ospray,	1
14:13	1
And	1
the	1
glede,	1
and	1
the	1
kite,	1
and	1
the	1
vulture	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
14:14	1
And	1
every	1
raven	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
14:15	1
And	1
the	1
owl,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
hawk,	1
and	1
the	1
cuckow,	1
and	1
the	1
hawk	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
14:16	1
The	1
little	1
owl,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
owl,	1
and	1
the	1
swan,	1
14:17	1
And	1
the	1
pelican,	1
and	1
the	1
gier	1
eagle,	1
and	1
the	1
cormorant,	1
14:18	1
And	1
the	1
stork,	1
and	1
the	1
heron	1
after	1
her	1
kind,	1
and	1
the	1
lapwing,	1
and	1
the	1
bat.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
flieth	1
is	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten.	1
	1
14:20	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
clean	1
fowls	1
ye	1
may	1
eat.	1
	1
14:21	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
dieth	1
of	1
itself:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
gates,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat	1
it;	1
or	1
thou	1
mayest	1
sell	1
it	1
unto	1
an	1
alien:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
holy	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
seethe	1
a	1
kid	1
in	1
his	1
mother's	1
milk.	1
	1
14:22	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
truly	1
tithe	1
all	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
thy	1
seed,	1
that	1
the	1
field	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
year	1
by	1
year.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
place	1
his	1
name	1
there,	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
thy	1
corn,	1
of	1
thy	1
wine,	1
and	1
of	1
thine	1
oil,	1
and	1
the	1
firstlings	1
of	1
thy	1
herds	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
flocks;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
learn	1
to	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
always.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
way	1
be	1
too	1
long	1
for	1
thee,	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
carry	1
it;	1
or	1
if	1
the	1
place	1
be	1
too	1
far	1
from	1
thee,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
name	1
there,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thee:	1
14:25	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
turn	1
it	1
into	1
money,	1
and	1
bind	1
up	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
shalt	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
choose:	1
14:26	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bestow	1
that	1
money	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
soul	1
lusteth	1
after,	1
for	1
oxen,	1
or	1
for	1
sheep,	1
or	1
for	1
wine,	1
or	1
for	1
strong	1
drink,	1
or	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
soul	1
desireth:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
there	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rejoice,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thine	1
household,	1
14:27	1
And	1
the	1
Levite	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
thy	1
gates;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
forsake	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
part	1
nor	1
inheritance	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:28	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
forth	1
all	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
thine	1
increase	1
the	1
same	1
year,	1
and	1
shalt	1
lay	1
it	1
up	1
within	1
thy	1
gates:	1
14:29	1
And	1
the	1
Levite,	1
(because	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
part	1
nor	1
inheritance	1
with	1
thee,)	1
and	1
the	1
stranger,	1
and	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
the	1
widow,	1
which	1
are	1
within	1
thy	1
gates,	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
may	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hand	1
which	1
thou	1
doest.	1
	1
15:1	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
every	1
seven	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
a	1
release.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
release:	1
Every	1
creditor	1
that	1
lendeth	1
ought	1
unto	1
his	1
neighbour	1
shall	1
release	1
it;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
exact	1
it	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
or	1
of	1
his	1
brother;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
LORD's	1
release.	1
	1
15:3	1
Of	1
a	1
foreigner	1
thou	1
mayest	1
exact	1
it	1
again:	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
thine	1
with	1
thy	1
brother	1
thine	1
hand	1
shall	1
release;	1
15:4	1
Save	1
when	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
poor	1
among	1
you;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
greatly	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
to	1
possess	1
it:	1
15:5	1
Only	1
if	1
thou	1
carefully	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
15:6	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
blesseth	1
thee,	1
as	1
he	1
promised	1
thee:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lend	1
unto	1
many	1
nations,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
borrow;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
reign	1
over	1
many	1
nations,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
reign	1
over	1
thee.	1
	1
15:7	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
among	1
you	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
within	1
any	1
of	1
thy	1
gates	1
in	1
thy	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
harden	1
thine	1
heart,	1
nor	1
shut	1
thine	1
hand	1
from	1
thy	1
poor	1
brother:	1
15:8	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
open	1
thine	1
hand	1
wide	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
shalt	1
surely	1
lend	1
him	1
sufficient	1
for	1
his	1
need,	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
wanteth.	1
	1
15:9	1
Beware	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
not	1
a	1
thought	1
in	1
thy	1
wicked	1
heart,	1
saying,	1
The	1
seventh	1
year,	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
release,	1
is	1
at	1
hand;	1
and	1
thine	1
eye	1
be	1
evil	1
against	1
thy	1
poor	1
brother,	1
and	1
thou	1
givest	1
him	1
nought;	1
and	1
he	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
sin	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
15:10	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
give	1
him,	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
grieved	1
when	1
thou	1
givest	1
unto	1
him:	1
because	1
that	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
puttest	1
thine	1
hand	1
unto.	1
	1
15:11	1
For	1
the	1
poor	1
shall	1
never	1
cease	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
therefore	1
I	1
command	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
open	1
thine	1
hand	1
wide	1
unto	1
thy	1
brother,	1
to	1
thy	1
poor,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
needy,	1
in	1
thy	1
land.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
brother,	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
man,	1
or	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
woman,	1
be	1
sold	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
serve	1
thee	1
six	1
years;	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
thou	1
shalt	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
free	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
sendest	1
him	1
out	1
free	1
from	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
away	1
empty:	1
15:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
furnish	1
him	1
liberally	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
flock,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
floor,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
winepress:	1
of	1
that	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thee	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
a	1
bondman	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
redeemed	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
thing	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
he	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
thee;	1
because	1
he	1
loveth	1
thee	1
and	1
thine	1
house,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
well	1
with	1
thee;	1
15:17	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
an	1
aul,	1
and	1
thrust	1
it	1
through	1
his	1
ear	1
unto	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
servant	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
also	1
unto	1
thy	1
maidservant	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
likewise.	1
	1
15:18	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
seem	1
hard	1
unto	1
thee,	1
when	1
thou	1
sendest	1
him	1
away	1
free	1
from	1
thee;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
worth	1
a	1
double	1
hired	1
servant	1
to	1
thee,	1
in	1
serving	1
thee	1
six	1
years:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
doest.	1
	1
15:19	1
All	1
the	1
firstling	1
males	1
that	1
come	1
of	1
thy	1
herd	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
flock	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sanctify	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
with	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
thy	1
bullock,	1
nor	1
shear	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
thy	1
sheep.	1
	1
15:20	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
year	1
by	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
choose,	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
household.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
blemish	1
therein,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
lame,	1
or	1
blind,	1
or	1
have	1
any	1
ill	1
blemish,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
15:22	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
it	1
within	1
thy	1
gates:	1
the	1
unclean	1
and	1
the	1
clean	1
person	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
alike,	1
as	1
the	1
roebuck,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
hart.	1
	1
15:23	1
Only	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
pour	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
water.	1
	1
16:1	1
Observe	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
Abib,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
Abib	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
brought	1
thee	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
16:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
therefore	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
and	1
the	1
herd,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
place	1
his	1
name	1
there.	1
	1
16:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
no	1
leavened	1
bread	1
with	1
it;	1
seven	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
therewith,	1
even	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
affliction;	1
for	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
in	1
haste:	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
remember	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
leavened	1
bread	1
seen	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
coast	1
seven	1
days;	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
which	1
thou	1
sacrificedst	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
at	1
even,	1
remain	1
all	1
night	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
16:5	1
Thou	1
mayest	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
passover	1
within	1
any	1
of	1
thy	1
gates,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee:	1
16:6	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
place	1
his	1
name	1
in,	1
there	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
passover	1
at	1
even,	1
at	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
at	1
the	1
season	1
that	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
roast	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
choose:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
go	1
unto	1
thy	1
tents.	1
	1
16:8	1
Six	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
therein.	1
	1
16:9	1
Seven	1
weeks	1
shalt	1
thou	1
number	1
unto	1
thee:	1
begin	1
to	1
number	1
the	1
seven	1
weeks	1
from	1
such	1
time	1
as	1
thou	1
beginnest	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
sickle	1
to	1
the	1
corn.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
weeks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
a	1
tribute	1
of	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thee:	1
16:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rejoice	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
thou,	1

thy	1

thy	1

thy	1

and	1
thy	1
maidservant,	1

the	1

that	1
is	1
within	1
thy	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
the	1

that	1
are	1
among	1
you,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
to	1
place	1
his	1
name	1
there.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
a	1
bondman	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
observe	1
and	1
do	1
these	1
statutes.	1
	1
16:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
observe	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles	1
seven	1
days,	1
after	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
gathered	1
in	1
thy	1
corn	1
and	1
thy	1
wine:	1
16:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
feast,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
thy	1

and	1
thy	1

that	1

	1
16:15	1
Seven	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
keep	1
a	1
solemn	1
feast	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
choose:	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thine	1
increase,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thine	1
hands,	1
therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
rejoice.	1
	1
16:16	1
Three	1
times	1
in	1
a	1
year	1
shall	1
all	1
thy	1
males	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
choose;	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
weeks,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
empty:	1
16:17	1
Every	1
man	1
shall	1
give	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
able,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
thee.	1
	1
16:18	1
Judges	1
and	1
officers	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
gates,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
throughout	1
thy	1
tribes:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
just	1
judgment.	1
	1
16:19	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
wrest	1
judgment;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
respect	1
persons,	1
neither	1
take	1
a	1
gift:	1
for	1
a	1
gift	1
doth	1
blind	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
pervert	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
16:20	1
That	1
which	1
is	1
altogether	1
just	1
shalt	1
thou	1
follow,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
live,	1
and	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee.	1
	1
16:21	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
plant	1
thee	1
a	1
grove	1
of	1
any	1
trees	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
thee.	1
	1
16:22	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
set	1
thee	1
up	1
any	1
image;	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hateth.	1
	1
17:1	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
any	1
bullock,	1
or	1
sheep,	1
wherein	1
is	1
blemish,	1
or	1
any	1
evilfavouredness:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
17:2	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
found	1
among	1
you,	1
within	1
any	1
of	1
thy	1
gates	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
man	1
or	1
woman,	1
that	1
hath	1
wrought	1
wickedness	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
in	1
transgressing	1
his	1
covenant,	1
17:3	1
And	1
hath	1
gone	1
and	1
served	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
them,	1
either	1
the	1
sun,	1
or	1
moon,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
commanded;	1
17:4	1
And	1
it	1
be	1
told	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
enquired	1
diligently,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
be	1
true,	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
certain,	1
that	1
such	1
abomination	1
is	1
wrought	1
in	1
Israel:	1
17:5	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bring	1
forth	1
that	1
man	1
or	1
that	1
woman,	1
which	1
have	1
committed	1
that	1
wicked	1
thing,	1
unto	1
thy	1
gates,	1
even	1
that	1
man	1
or	1
that	1
woman,	1
and	1
shalt	1
stone	1
them	1
with	1
stones,	1
till	1
they	1
die.	1
	1
17:6	1
At	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
witnesses,	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses,	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
one	1
witness	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
17:7	1
The	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
witnesses	1
shall	1
be	1
first	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
afterward	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
So	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
the	1
evil	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
17:8	1
If	1
there	1
arise	1
a	1
matter	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
in	1
judgment,	1
between	1
blood	1
and	1
blood,	1
between	1
plea	1
and	1
plea,	1
and	1
between	1
stroke	1
and	1
stroke,	1
being	1
matters	1
of	1
controversy	1
within	1
thy	1
gates:	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
arise,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
choose;	1
17:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
judge	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
enquire;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
judgment:	1
17:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
sentence,	1
which	1
they	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
choose	1
shall	1
shew	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
inform	1
thee:	1
17:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
teach	1
thee,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
decline	1
from	1
the	1
sentence	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
shew	1
thee,	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
presumptuously,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
that	1
standeth	1
to	1
minister	1
there	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
or	1
unto	1
the	1
judge,	1
even	1
that	1
man	1
shall	1
die:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
evil	1
from	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
fear,	1
and	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
presumptuously.	1
	1
17:14	1
When	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
and	1
shalt	1
possess	1
it,	1
and	1
shalt	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
and	1
shalt	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
me,	1
like	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
me;	1
17:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
set	1
him	1
king	1
over	1
thee,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
choose:	1
one	1
from	1
among	1
thy	1
brethren	1
shalt	1
thou	1
set	1
king	1
over	1
thee:	1
thou	1
mayest	1
not	1
set	1
a	1
stranger	1
over	1
thee,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
17:16	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
multiply	1
horses	1
to	1
himself,	1
nor	1
cause	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
multiply	1
horses:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
henceforth	1
return	1
no	1
more	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
17:17	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
multiply	1
wives	1
to	1
himself,	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
turn	1
not	1
away:	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
greatly	1
multiply	1
to	1
himself	1
silver	1
and	1
gold.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
he	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
write	1
him	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
this	1
law	1
in	1
a	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites:	1
17:19	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
read	1
therein	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life:	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
learn	1
to	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
to	1
keep	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
law	1
and	1
these	1
statutes,	1
to	1
do	1
them:	1
17:20	1
That	1
his	1
heart	1
be	1
not	1
lifted	1
up	1
above	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
turn	1
not	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1
commandment,	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left:	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
prolong	1
his	1
days	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
children,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:1	1
The	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi,	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
part	1
nor	1
inheritance	1
with	1
Israel:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
18:2	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
inheritance	1
among	1
their	1
brethren:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's	1
due	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
ox	1
or	1
sheep;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
the	1
maw.	1
	1
18:4	1
The	1
firstfruit	1
also	1
of	1
thy	1
corn,	1
of	1
thy	1
wine,	1
and	1
of	1
thine	1
oil,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
fleece	1
of	1
thy	1
sheep,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
give	1
him.	1
	1
18:5	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
tribes,	1
to	1
stand	1
to	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
Levite	1
come	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
thy	1
gates	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
where	1
he	1
sojourned,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
choose;	1
18:7	1
Then	1
he	1
shall	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
as	1
all	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
Levites	1
do,	1
which	1
stand	1
there	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:8	1
They	1
shall	1
have	1
like	1
portions	1
to	1
eat,	1
beside	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
of	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
his	1
patrimony.	1
	1
18:9	1
When	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
learn	1
to	1
do	1
after	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
those	1
nations.	1
	1
18:10	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
among	1
you	1
any	1
one	1
that	1
maketh	1
his	1
son	1
or	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
or	1
that	1
useth	1
divination,	1
or	1
an	1
observer	1
of	1
times,	1
or	1
an	1
enchanter,	1
or	1
a	1
witch.	1
	1
18:11	1
Or	1
a	1
charmer,	1
or	1
a	1
consulter	1
with	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
or	1
a	1
wizard,	1
or	1
a	1
necromancer.	1
	1
18:12	1
For	1
all	1
that	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
these	1
abominations	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
doth	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
18:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
perfect	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
18:14	1
For	1
these	1
nations,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
possess,	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
observers	1
of	1
times,	1
and	1
unto	1
diviners:	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
thee,	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
suffered	1
thee	1
so	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
18:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
Prophet	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
unto	1
him	1
ye	1
shall	1
hearken;	1
18:16	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
desiredst	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
Horeb	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
assembly,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
me	1
not	1
hear	1
again	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
neither	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
this	1
great	1
fire	1
any	1
more,	1
that	1
I	1
die	1
not.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
They	1
have	1
well	1
spoken	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
spoken.	1
	1
18:18	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
them	1
up	1
a	1
Prophet	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
his	1
mouth;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
command	1
him.	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
I	1
will	1
require	1
it	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
18:20	1
But	1
the	1
prophet,	1
which	1
shall	1
presume	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
speak,	1
or	1
that	1
shall	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
other	1
gods,	1
even	1
that	1
prophet	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
say	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
spoken?	1
	1
18:22	1
When	1
a	1
prophet	1
speaketh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
if	1
the	1
thing	1
follow	1
not,	1
nor	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
spoken,	1
but	1
the	1
prophet	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it	1
presumptuously:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
19:1	1
When	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
nations,	1
whose	1
land	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
succeedest	1
them,	1
and	1
dwellest	1
in	1
their	1
cities,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
houses;	1
19:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
separate	1
three	1
cities	1
for	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
19:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
prepare	1
thee	1
a	1
way,	1
and	1
divide	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
to	1
inherit,	1
into	1
three	1
parts,	1
that	1
every	1
slayer	1
may	1
flee	1
thither.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
slayer,	1
which	1
shall	1
flee	1
thither,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
live:	1
Whoso	1
killeth	1
his	1
neighbour	1
ignorantly,	1
whom	1
he	1
hated	1
not	1
in	1
time	1
past;	1
19:5	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour	1
to	1
hew	1
wood,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
fetcheth	1
a	1
stroke	1
with	1
the	1
axe	1
to	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
slippeth	1
from	1
the	1
helve,	1
and	1
lighteth	1
upon	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
that	1
he	1
die;	1
he	1
shall	1
flee	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
cities,	1
and	1
live:	1
19:6	1
Lest	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
pursue	1
the	1
slayer,	1
while	1
his	1
heart	1
is	1
hot,	1
and	1
overtake	1
him,	1
because	1
the	1
way	1
is	1
long,	1
and	1
slay	1
him;	1
whereas	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
hated	1
him	1
not	1
in	1
time	1
past.	1
	1
19:7	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
command	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
separate	1
three	1
cities	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
enlarge	1
thy	1
coast,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
sworn	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers;	1
19:9	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
all	1
these	1
commandments	1
to	1
do	1
them,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
ever	1
in	1
his	1
ways;	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
add	1
three	1
cities	1
more	1
for	1
thee,	1
beside	1
these	1
three:	1
19:10	1
That	1
innocent	1
blood	1
be	1
not	1
shed	1
in	1
thy	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
so	1
blood	1
be	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
19:11	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hate	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
smite	1
him	1
mortally	1
that	1
he	1
die,	1
and	1
fleeth	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
cities:	1
19:12	1
Then	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
his	1
city	1
shall	1
send	1
and	1
fetch	1
him	1
thence,	1
and	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
blood,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die.	1
	1
19:13	1
Thine	1
eye	1
shall	1
not	1
pity	1
him,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
innocent	1
blood	1
from	1
Israel,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
go	1
well	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
19:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
remove	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
landmark,	1
which	1
they	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
have	1
set	1
in	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
inherit	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
19:15	1
One	1
witness	1
shall	1
not	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
any	1
iniquity,	1
or	1
for	1
any	1
sin,	1
in	1
any	1
sin	1
that	1
he	1
sinneth:	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
witnesses,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
three	1
witnesses,	1
shall	1
the	1
matter	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
19:16	1
If	1
a	1
false	1
witness	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
testify	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
wrong;	1
19:17	1
Then	1
both	1
the	1
men,	1
between	1
whom	1
the	1
controversy	1
is,	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
before	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
judges,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
those	1
days;	1
19:18	1
And	1
the	1
judges	1
shall	1
make	1
diligent	1
inquisition:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
witness	1
be	1
a	1
false	1
witness,	1
and	1
hath	1
testified	1
falsely	1
against	1
his	1
brother;	1
19:19	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
do	1
unto	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
his	1
brother:	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
put	1
the	1
evil	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
those	1
which	1
remain	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
fear,	1
and	1
shall	1
henceforth	1
commit	1
no	1
more	1
any	1
such	1
evil	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
thine	1
eye	1
shall	1
not	1
pity;	1
but	1
life	1
shall	1
go	1
for	1
life,	1
eye	1
for	1
eye,	1
tooth	1
for	1
tooth,	1
hand	1
for	1
hand,	1
foot	1
for	1
foot.	1
	1
20:1	1
When	1
thou	1
goest	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
seest	1
horses,	1
and	1
chariots,	1
and	1
a	1
people	1
more	1
than	1
thou,	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
battle,	1
that	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
approach	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
20:3	1
And	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
ye	1
approach	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
battle	1
against	1
your	1
enemies:	1
let	1
not	1
your	1
hearts	1
faint,	1
fear	1
not,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
tremble,	1
neither	1
be	1
ye	1
terrified	1
because	1
of	1
them;	1
20:4	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
goeth	1
with	1
you,	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
you	1
against	1
your	1
enemies,	1
to	1
save	1
you.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
the	1
officers	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
hath	1
built	1
a	1
new	1
house,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
dedicated	1
it?	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
lest	1
he	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
another	1
man	1
dedicate	1
it.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
yet	1
eaten	1
of	1
it?	1
let	1
him	1
also	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
lest	1
he	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
another	1
man	1
eat	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
hath	1
betrothed	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
taken	1
her?	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
lest	1
he	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
another	1
man	1
take	1
her.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
the	1
officers	1
shall	1
speak	1
further	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
is	1
fearful	1
and	1
fainthearted?	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
lest	1
his	1
brethren's	1
heart	1
faint	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
the	1
officers	1
have	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
20:10	1
When	1
thou	1
comest	1
nigh	1
unto	1
a	1
city	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
it,	1
then	1
proclaim	1
peace	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
it	1
make	1
thee	1
answer	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
open	1
unto	1
thee,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
found	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
tributaries	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
serve	1
thee.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
peace	1
with	1
thee,	1
but	1
will	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
thee,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
besiege	1
it:	1
20:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
it	1
into	1
thine	1
hands,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
every	1
male	1
thereof	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword:	1
20:14	1
But	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
the	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
spoil	1
thereof,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
unto	1
thyself;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee.	1
	1
20:15	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
are	1
very	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
thee,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
these	1
nations.	1
	1
20:16	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
these	1
people,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
doth	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
alive	1
nothing	1
that	1
breatheth:	1
20:17	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them;	1
namely,	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
20:18	1
That	1
they	1
teach	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
after	1
all	1
their	1
abominations,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
their	1
gods;	1
so	1
should	1
ye	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:19	1
When	1
thou	1
shalt	1
besiege	1
a	1
city	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
in	1
making	1
war	1
against	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
it,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
trees	1
thereof	1
by	1
forcing	1
an	1
axe	1
against	1
them:	1
for	1
thou	1
mayest	1
eat	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
cut	1
them	1
down	1
(for	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
is	1
man's	1
life)	1
to	1
employ	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
siege:	1
20:20	1
Only	1
the	1
trees	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
trees	1
for	1
meat,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
destroy	1
and	1
cut	1
them	1
down;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
build	1
bulwarks	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
maketh	1
war	1
with	1
thee,	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
subdued.	1
	1
21:1	1
If	1
one	1
be	1
found	1
slain	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
known	1
who	1
hath	1
slain	1
him:	1
21:2	1
Then	1
thy	1
elders	1
and	1
thy	1
judges	1
shall	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
measure	1
unto	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
slain:	1
21:3	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
is	1
next	1
unto	1
the	1
slain	1
man,	1
even	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
shall	1
take	1
an	1
heifer,	1
which	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
wrought	1
with,	1
and	1
which	1
hath	1
not	1
drawn	1
in	1
the	1
yoke;	1
21:4	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
heifer	1
unto	1
a	1
rough	1
valley,	1
which	1
is	1
neither	1
eared	1
nor	1
sown,	1
and	1
shall	1
strike	1
off	1
the	1
heifer's	1
neck	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
valley:	1
21:5	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi	1
shall	1
come	1
near;	1
for	1
them	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
bless	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
word	1
shall	1
every	1
controversy	1
and	1
every	1
stroke	1
be	1
tried:	1
21:6	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
that	1
city,	1
that	1
are	1
next	1
unto	1
the	1
slain	1
man,	1
shall	1
wash	1
their	1
hands	1
over	1
the	1
heifer	1
that	1
is	1
beheaded	1
in	1
the	1
valley:	1
21:7	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say,	1
Our	1
hands	1
have	1
not	1
shed	1
this	1
blood,	1
neither	1
have	1
our	1
eyes	1
seen	1
it.	1
	1
21:8	1
Be	1
merciful,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed,	1
and	1
lay	1
not	1
innocent	1
blood	1
unto	1
thy	1
people	1
of	1
Israel's	1
charge.	1
And	1
the	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
them.	1
	1
21:9	1
So	1
shalt	1
thou	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
innocent	1
blood	1
from	1
among	1
you,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:10	1
When	1
thou	1
goest	1
forth	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
thine	1
hands,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
them	1
captive,	1
21:11	1
And	1
seest	1
among	1
the	1
captives	1
a	1
beautiful	1
woman,	1
and	1
hast	1
a	1
desire	1
unto	1
her,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
have	1
her	1
to	1
thy	1
wife;	1
21:12	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
her	1
home	1
to	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
shave	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
pare	1
her	1
nails;	1
21:13	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
put	1
the	1
raiment	1
of	1
her	1
captivity	1
from	1
off	1
her,	1
and	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
bewail	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
a	1
full	1
month:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
be	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
wife.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
thou	1
have	1
no	1
delight	1
in	1
her,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
whither	1
she	1
will;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
sell	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
money,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
merchandise	1
of	1
her,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
humbled	1
her.	1
	1
21:15	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
two	1
wives,	1
one	1
beloved,	1
and	1
another	1
hated,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
children,	1
both	1
the	1
beloved	1
and	1
the	1
hated;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
firstborn	1
son	1
be	1
hers	1
that	1
was	1
hated:	1
21:16	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
he	1
maketh	1
his	1
sons	1
to	1
inherit	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
make	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
beloved	1
firstborn	1
before	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
hated,	1
which	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
firstborn:	1
21:17	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
hated	1
for	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
by	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
double	1
portion	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
strength;	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn	1
is	1
his.	1
	1
21:18	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
a	1
stubborn	1
and	1
rebellious	1
son,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
that,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
chastened	1
him,	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
them:	1
21:19	1
Then	1
shall	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
his	1
city,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
place;	1
21:20	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
his	1
city,	1
This	1
our	1
son	1
is	1
stubborn	1
and	1
rebellious,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
obey	1
our	1
voice;	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
glutton,	1
and	1
a	1
drunkard.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
city	1
shall	1
stone	1
him	1
with	1
stones,	1
that	1
he	1
die:	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
put	1
evil	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you;	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
fear.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
committed	1
a	1
sin	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
thou	1
hang	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
21:23	1
His	1
body	1
shall	1
not	1
remain	1
all	1
night	1
upon	1
the	1
tree,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
bury	1
him	1
that	1
day;	1
(for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
hanged	1
is	1
accursed	1
of	1
God;)	1
that	1
thy	1
land	1
be	1
not	1
defiled,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance.	1
	1
22:1	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
thy	1
brother's	1
ox	1
or	1
his	1
sheep	1
go	1
astray,	1
and	1
hide	1
thyself	1
from	1
them:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
not	1
nigh	1
unto	1
thee,	1
or	1
if	1
thou	1
know	1
him	1
not,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
it	1
unto	1
thine	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee	1
until	1
thy	1
brother	1
seek	1
after	1
it,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
restore	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
22:3	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
ass;	1
and	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
raiment;	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
lost	1
thing	1
of	1
thy	1
brother's,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
lost,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
found,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
likewise:	1
thou	1
mayest	1
not	1
hide	1
thyself.	1
	1
22:4	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
thy	1
brother's	1
ass	1
or	1
his	1
ox	1
fall	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
hide	1
thyself	1
from	1
them:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
lift	1
them	1
up	1
again.	1
	1
22:5	1
The	1
woman	1
shall	1
not	1
wear	1
that	1
which	1
pertaineth	1
unto	1
a	1
man,	1
neither	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
woman's	1
garment:	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
do	1
so	1
are	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
22:6	1
If	1
a	1
bird's	1
nest	1
chance	1
to	1
be	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
any	1
tree,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
young	1
ones,	1
or	1
eggs,	1
and	1
the	1
dam	1
sitting	1
upon	1
the	1
young,	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
eggs,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
dam	1
with	1
the	1
young:	1
22:7	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
let	1
the	1
dam	1
go,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
young	1
to	1
thee;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prolong	1
thy	1
days.	1
	1
22:8	1
When	1
thou	1
buildest	1
a	1
new	1
house,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
a	1
battlement	1
for	1
thy	1
roof,	1
that	1
thou	1
bring	1
not	1
blood	1
upon	1
thine	1
house,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
fall	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
22:9	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
sow	1
thy	1
vineyard	1
with	1
divers	1
seeds:	1
lest	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
seed	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sown,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
be	1
defiled.	1
	1
22:10	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
plow	1
with	1
an	1
ox	1
and	1
an	1
ass	1
together.	1
	1
22:11	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
wear	1
a	1
garment	1
of	1
divers	1
sorts,	1
as	1
of	1
woollen	1
and	1
linen	1
together.	1
	1
22:12	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
thee	1
fringes	1
upon	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
thy	1
vesture,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
coverest	1
thyself.	1
	1
22:13	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
take	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
hate	1
her,	1
22:14	1
And	1
give	1
occasions	1
of	1
speech	1
against	1
her,	1
and	1
bring	1
up	1
an	1
evil	1
name	1
upon	1
her,	1
and	1
say,	1
I	1
took	1
this	1
woman,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
her,	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
not	1
a	1
maid:	1
22:15	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
damsel,	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
take	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
tokens	1
of	1
the	1
damsel's	1
virginity	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
gate:	1
22:16	1
And	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
elders,	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
daughter	1
unto	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
hateth	1
her;	1
22:17	1
And,	1
lo,	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
occasions	1
of	1
speech	1
against	1
her,	1
saying,	1
I	1
found	1
not	1
thy	1
daughter	1
a	1
maid;	1
and	1
yet	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
tokens	1
of	1
my	1
daughter's	1
virginity.	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
spread	1
the	1
cloth	1
before	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
22:18	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
shall	1
take	1
that	1
man	1
and	1
chastise	1
him;	1
22:19	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
amerce	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
damsel,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
up	1
an	1
evil	1
name	1
upon	1
a	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
wife;	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
put	1
her	1
away	1
all	1
his	1
days.	1
	1
22:20	1
But	1
if	1
this	1
thing	1
be	1
true,	1
and	1
the	1
tokens	1
of	1
virginity	1
be	1
not	1
found	1
for	1
the	1
damsel:	1
22:21	1
Then	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
damsel	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
her	1
city	1
shall	1
stone	1
her	1
with	1
stones	1
that	1
she	1
die:	1
because	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
folly	1
in	1
Israel,	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
whore	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
house:	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
put	1
evil	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
22:22	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
found	1
lying	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
married	1
to	1
an	1
husband,	1
then	1
they	1
shall	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
die,	1
both	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
lay	1
with	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
woman:	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
put	1
away	1
evil	1
from	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:23	1
If	1
a	1
damsel	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
virgin	1
be	1
betrothed	1
unto	1
an	1
husband,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
find	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
lie	1
with	1
her;	1
22:24	1
Then	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
them	1
both	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
that	1
city,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
stone	1
them	1
with	1
stones	1
that	1
they	1
die;	1
the	1
damsel,	1
because	1
she	1
cried	1
not,	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
the	1
man,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
humbled	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife:	1
so	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
away	1
evil	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
22:25	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
find	1
a	1
betrothed	1
damsel	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
force	1
her,	1
and	1
lie	1
with	1
her:	1
then	1
the	1
man	1
only	1
that	1
lay	1
with	1
her	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
22:26	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
damsel	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
nothing;	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
damsel	1
no	1
sin	1
worthy	1
of	1
death:	1
for	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
riseth	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
slayeth	1
him,	1
even	1
so	1
is	1
this	1
matter:	1
22:27	1
For	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
betrothed	1
damsel	1
cried,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
save	1
her.	1
	1
22:28	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
find	1
a	1
damsel	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
virgin,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
betrothed,	1
and	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
lie	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
they	1
be	1
found;	1
22:29	1
Then	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
lay	1
with	1
her	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
wife;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
humbled	1
her,	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
put	1
her	1
away	1
all	1
his	1
days.	1
	1
22:30	1
A	1
man	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
father's	1
wife,	1
nor	1
discover	1
his	1
father's	1
skirt.	1
	1
23:1	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
stones,	1
or	1
hath	1
his	1
privy	1
member	1
cut	1
off,	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:2	1
A	1
bastard	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
tenth	1
generation	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:3	1
An	1
Ammonite	1
or	1
Moabite	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
even	1
to	1
their	1
tenth	1
generation	1
shall	1
they	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
ever:	1
23:4	1
Because	1
they	1
met	1
you	1
not	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
with	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
when	1
ye	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
hired	1
against	1
thee	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
of	1
Pethor	1
of	1
Mesopotamia,	1
to	1
curse	1
thee.	1
	1
23:5	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
Balaam;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
turned	1
the	1
curse	1
into	1
a	1
blessing	1
unto	1
thee,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
loved	1
thee.	1
	1
23:6	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
seek	1
their	1
peace	1
nor	1
their	1
prosperity	1
all	1
thy	1
days	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
23:7	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
abhor	1
an	1
Edomite;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
thy	1
brother:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
abhor	1
an	1
Egyptian;	1
because	1
thou	1
wast	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
23:8	1
The	1
children	1
that	1
are	1
begotten	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
their	1
third	1
generation.	1
	1
23:9	1
When	1
the	1
host	1
goeth	1
forth	1
against	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
then	1
keep	1
thee	1
from	1
every	1
wicked	1
thing.	1
	1
23:10	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
among	1
you	1
any	1
man,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
clean	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
uncleanness	1
that	1
chanceth	1
him	1
by	1
night,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
go	1
abroad	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
within	1
the	1
camp:	1
23:11	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
evening	1
cometh	1
on,	1
he	1
shall	1
wash	1
himself	1
with	1
water:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
down,	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp	1
again.	1
	1
23:12	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
a	1
place	1
also	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
whither	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
forth	1
abroad:	1
23:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
a	1
paddle	1
upon	1
thy	1
weapon;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
thou	1
wilt	1
ease	1
thyself	1
abroad,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dig	1
therewith,	1
and	1
shalt	1
turn	1
back	1
and	1
cover	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
from	1
thee:	1
23:14	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
walketh	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thy	1
camp,	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
thine	1
enemies	1
before	1
thee;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
thy	1
camp	1
be	1
holy:	1
that	1
he	1
see	1
no	1
unclean	1
thing	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
23:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
deliver	1
unto	1
his	1
master	1
the	1
servant	1
which	1
is	1
escaped	1
from	1
his	1
master	1
unto	1
thee:	1
23:16	1
He	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
thee,	1
even	1
among	1
you,	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
choose	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
gates,	1
where	1
it	1
liketh	1
him	1
best:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
oppress	1
him.	1
	1
23:17	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
whore	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Israel,	1
nor	1
a	1
sodomite	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
23:18	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bring	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
a	1
whore,	1
or	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
a	1
dog,	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
for	1
any	1
vow:	1
for	1
even	1
both	1
these	1
are	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
23:19	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lend	1
upon	1
usury	1
to	1
thy	1
brother;	1
usury	1
of	1
money,	1
usury	1
of	1
victuals,	1
usury	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
lent	1
upon	1
usury:	1
23:20	1
Unto	1
a	1
stranger	1
thou	1
mayest	1
lend	1
upon	1
usury;	1
but	1
unto	1
thy	1
brother	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lend	1
upon	1
usury:	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
may	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
settest	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
23:21	1
When	1
thou	1
shalt	1
vow	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
slack	1
to	1
pay	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
surely	1
require	1
it	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
sin	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
23:22	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
forbear	1
to	1
vow,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
sin	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
23:23	1
That	1
which	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
lips	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
and	1
perform;	1
even	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering,	1
according	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
vowed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
promised	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:24	1
When	1
thou	1
comest	1
into	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
vineyard,	1
then	1
thou	1
mayest	1
eat	1
grapes	1
thy	1
fill	1
at	1
thine	1
own	1
pleasure;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
put	1
any	1
in	1
thy	1
vessel.	1
	1
23:25	1
When	1
thou	1
comest	1
into	1
the	1
standing	1
corn	1
of	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
then	1
thou	1
mayest	1
pluck	1
the	1
ears	1
with	1
thine	1
hand;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
move	1
a	1
sickle	1
unto	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
standing	1
corn.	1
	1
24:1	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
hath	1
taken	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
married	1
her,	1
and	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
she	1
find	1
no	1
favour	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
found	1
some	1
uncleanness	1
in	1
her:	1
then	1
let	1
him	1
write	1
her	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
divorcement,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
send	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
she	1
may	1
go	1
and	1
be	1
another	1
man's	1
wife.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
latter	1
husband	1
hate	1
her,	1
and	1
write	1
her	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
divorcement,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
sendeth	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house;	1
or	1
if	1
the	1
latter	1
husband	1
die,	1
which	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife;	1
24:4	1
Her	1
former	1
husband,	1
which	1
sent	1
her	1
away,	1
may	1
not	1
take	1
her	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife,	1
after	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
defiled;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
abomination	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
cause	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
sin,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance.	1
	1
24:5	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
hath	1
taken	1
a	1
new	1
wife,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
war,	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
any	1
business:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
free	1
at	1
home	1
one	1
year,	1
and	1
shall	1
cheer	1
up	1
his	1
wife	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
taken.	1
	1
24:6	1
No	1
man	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
nether	1
or	1
the	1
upper	1
millstone	1
to	1
pledge:	1
for	1
he	1
taketh	1
a	1
man's	1
life	1
to	1
pledge.	1
	1
24:7	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
found	1
stealing	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
maketh	1
merchandise	1
of	1
him,	1
or	1
selleth	1
him;	1
then	1
that	1
thief	1
shall	1
die;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
evil	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
24:8	1
Take	1
heed	1
in	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy,	1
that	1
thou	1
observe	1
diligently,	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
teach	1
you:	1
as	1
I	1
commanded	1
them,	1
so	1
ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
24:9	1
Remember	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
did	1
unto	1
Miriam	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
24:10	1
When	1
thou	1
dost	1
lend	1
thy	1
brother	1
any	1
thing,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
fetch	1
his	1
pledge.	1
	1
24:11	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
stand	1
abroad,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
dost	1
lend	1
shall	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
pledge	1
abroad	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
be	1
poor,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
sleep	1
with	1
his	1
pledge:	1
24:13	1
In	1
any	1
case	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deliver	1
him	1
the	1
pledge	1
again	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
goeth	1
down,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
sleep	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
raiment,	1
and	1
bless	1
thee:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
thee	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
24:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
oppress	1
an	1
hired	1
servant	1
that	1
is	1
poor	1
and	1
needy,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
or	1
of	1
thy	1
strangers	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
thy	1
land	1
within	1
thy	1
gates:	1
24:15	1
At	1
his	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
hire,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sun	1
go	1
down	1
upon	1
it;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
poor,	1
and	1
setteth	1
his	1
heart	1
upon	1
it:	1
lest	1
he	1
cry	1
against	1
thee	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
sin	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
24:16	1
The	1
fathers	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
the	1
children,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
the	1
fathers:	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sin.	1
	1
24:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
pervert	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
stranger,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless;	1
nor	1
take	1
a	1
widow's	1
raiment	1
to	1
pledge:	1
24:18	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
a	1
bondman	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
redeemed	1
thee	1
thence:	1
therefore	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
24:19	1
When	1
thou	1
cuttest	1
down	1
thine	1
harvest	1
in	1
thy	1
field,	1
and	1
hast	1
forgot	1
a	1
sheaf	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
fetch	1
it:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
stranger,	1
for	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
widow:	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
may	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hands.	1
	1
24:20	1
When	1
thou	1
beatest	1
thine	1
olive	1
tree,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
boughs	1
again:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
stranger,	1
for	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
widow.	1
	1
24:21	1
When	1
thou	1
gatherest	1
the	1
grapes	1
of	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
glean	1
it	1
afterward:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
stranger,	1
for	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
widow.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
a	1
bondman	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
therefore	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
25:1	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
controversy	1
between	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
judgment,	1
that	1
the	1
judges	1
may	1
judge	1
them;	1
then	1
they	1
shall	1
justify	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
condemn	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
the	1
wicked	1
man	1
be	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
beaten,	1
that	1
the	1
judge	1
shall	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
beaten	1
before	1
his	1
face,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
fault,	1
by	1
a	1
certain	1
number.	1
	1
25:3	1
Forty	1
stripes	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
him,	1
and	1
not	1
exceed:	1
lest,	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
exceed,	1
and	1
beat	1
him	1
above	1
these	1
with	1
many	1
stripes,	1
then	1
thy	1
brother	1
should	1
seem	1
vile	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
25:4	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
ox	1
when	1
he	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
	1
25:5	1
If	1
brethren	1
dwell	1
together,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
die,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
child,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
not	1
marry	1
without	1
unto	1
a	1
stranger:	1
her	1
husband's	1
brother	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
wife,	1
and	1
perform	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
an	1
husband's	1
brother	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
the	1
firstborn	1
which	1
she	1
beareth	1
shall	1
succeed	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
which	1
is	1
dead,	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
be	1
not	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
like	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
brother's	1
wife,	1
then	1
let	1
his	1
brother's	1
wife	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
unto	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
say,	1
My	1
husband's	1
brother	1
refuseth	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
his	1
brother	1
a	1
name	1
in	1
Israel,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
perform	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
my	1
husband's	1
brother.	1
	1
25:8	1
Then	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
his	1
city	1
shall	1
call	1
him,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
stand	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
say,	1
I	1
like	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
her;	1
25:9	1
Then	1
shall	1
his	1
brother's	1
wife	1
come	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
loose	1
his	1
shoe	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
foot,	1
and	1
spit	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say,	1
So	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
that	1
man	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
build	1
up	1
his	1
brother's	1
house.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
Israel,	1
The	1
house	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
his	1
shoe	1
loosed.	1
	1
25:11	1
When	1
men	1
strive	1
together	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
draweth	1
near	1
for	1
to	1
deliver	1
her	1
husband	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
smiteth	1
him,	1
and	1
putteth	1
forth	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
taketh	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
secrets:	1
25:12	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
off	1
her	1
hand,	1
thine	1
eye	1
shall	1
not	1
pity	1
her.	1
	1
25:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
have	1
in	1
thy	1
bag	1
divers	1
weights,	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
a	1
small.	1
	1
25:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
have	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
divers	1
measures,	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
a	1
small.	1
	1
25:15	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
a	1
perfect	1
and	1
just	1
weight,	1
a	1
perfect	1
and	1
just	1
measure	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have:	1
that	1
thy	1
days	1
may	1
be	1
lengthened	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee.	1
	1
25:16	1
For	1
all	1
that	1
do	1
such	1
things,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
do	1
unrighteously,	1
are	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
25:17	1
Remember	1
what	1
Amalek	1
did	1
unto	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
when	1
ye	1
were	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
25:18	1
How	1
he	1
met	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
hindmost	1
of	1
thee,	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
feeble	1
behind	1
thee,	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
faint	1
and	1
weary;	1
and	1
he	1
feared	1
not	1
God.	1
	1
25:19	1
Therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
rest	1
from	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
round	1
about,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
blot	1
out	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
Amalek	1
from	1
under	1
heaven;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
forget	1
it.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
possessest	1
it,	1
and	1
dwellest	1
therein;	1
26:2	1
That	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
and	1
shalt	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
basket,	1
and	1
shalt	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
place	1
his	1
name	1
there.	1
	1
26:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
profess	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
for	1
to	1
give	1
us.	1
	1
26:4	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
basket	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
26:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
and	1
say	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
A	1
Syrian	1
ready	1
to	1
perish	1
was	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
sojourned	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
few,	1
and	1
became	1
there	1
a	1
nation,	1
great,	1
mighty,	1
and	1
populous:	1
26:6	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
evil	1
entreated	1
us,	1
and	1
afflicted	1
us,	1
and	1
laid	1
upon	1
us	1
hard	1
bondage:	1
26:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
our	1
voice,	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
our	1
affliction,	1
and	1
our	1
labour,	1
and	1
our	1
oppression:	1
26:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
outstretched	1
arm,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
terribleness,	1
and	1
with	1
signs,	1
and	1
with	1
wonders:	1
26:9	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
us	1
into	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
this	1
land,	1
even	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
26:10	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
hast	1
given	1
me.	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
26:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rejoice	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
unto	1
thine	1
house,	1
thou,	1
and	1
the	1
Levite,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
26:12	1
When	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
tithing	1
all	1
the	1
tithes	1
of	1
thine	1
increase	1
the	1
third	1
year,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
tithing,	1
and	1
hast	1
given	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
Levite,	1
the	1
stranger,	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
the	1
widow,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat	1
within	1
thy	1
gates,	1
and	1
be	1
filled;	1
26:13	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
away	1
the	1
hallowed	1
things	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
also	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
Levite,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
stranger,	1
to	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
widow,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
thy	1
commandments	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded	1
me:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
transgressed	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
forgotten	1
them.	1
	1
26:14	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
eaten	1
thereof	1
in	1
my	1
mourning,	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
taken	1
away	1
ought	1
thereof	1
for	1
any	1
unclean	1
use,	1
nor	1
given	1
ought	1
thereof	1
for	1
the	1
dead:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded	1
me.	1
	1
26:15	1
Look	1
down	1
from	1
thy	1
holy	1
habitation,	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
bless	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
us,	1
as	1
thou	1
swarest	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers,	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
26:16	1
This	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
thee	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
therefore	1
keep	1
and	1
do	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
26:17	1
Thou	1
hast	1
avouched	1
the	1
LORD	1
this	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
statutes,	1
and	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
his	1
judgments,	1
and	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
his	1
voice:	1
26:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
avouched	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
peculiar	1
people,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
keep	1
all	1
his	1
commandments;	1
26:19	1
And	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
high	1
above	1
all	1
nations	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made,	1
in	1
praise,	1
and	1
in	1
name,	1
and	1
in	1
honour;	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
with	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
commanded	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Keep	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
Jordan	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
thee	1
up	1
great	1
stones,	1
and	1
plaister	1
them	1
with	1
plaister:	1
27:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
write	1
upon	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
law,	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
passed	1
over,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee,	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers	1
hath	1
promised	1
thee.	1
	1
27:4	1
Therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
gone	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
set	1
up	1
these	1
stones,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
this	1
day,	1
in	1
mount	1
Ebal,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
plaister	1
them	1
with	1
plaister.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
build	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
an	1
altar	1
of	1
stones:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
any	1
iron	1
tool	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
27:6	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
build	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
of	1
whole	1
stones:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
thereon	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
27:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
and	1
shalt	1
eat	1
there,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
27:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
write	1
upon	1
the	1
stones	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
law	1
very	1
plainly.	1
	1
27:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
and	1
hearken,	1
O	1
Israel;	1
this	1
day	1
thou	1
art	1
become	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
27:10	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
therefore	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
do	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
his	1
statutes,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
charged	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
saying,	1
27:12	1
These	1
shall	1
stand	1
upon	1
mount	1
Gerizim	1
to	1
bless	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
over	1
Jordan;	1
Simeon,	1
and	1
Levi,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Issachar,	1
and	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
Benjamin:	1
27:13	1
And	1
these	1
shall	1
stand	1
upon	1
mount	1
Ebal	1
to	1
curse;	1
Reuben,	1
Gad,	1
and	1
Asher,	1
and	1
Zebulun,	1
Dan,	1
and	1
Naphtali.	1
	1
27:14	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
speak,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
27:15	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
maketh	1
any	1
graven	1

an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
craftsman,	1
and	1
putteth	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
place.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1

shall	1
answer	1
and	1

Amen.	1
	1
27:16	1
Cursed	1

thee	1
this	1

of	1
thy	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1

	1
28:5	1
Blessed	1

shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
when	1
thou	1
goest	1
out.	1
	1
28:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
cause	1
thine	1
enemies	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1

out	1
against	1
thee	1
one	1
way,	1
and	1
flee	1
before	1
thee	1
seven	1
ways.	1
	1
28:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
command	1
the	1
blessing	1
upon	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
storehouses,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
settest	1
thine	1

unto;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee.	1
	1
28:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
establish	1
thee	1
an	1
holy	1
people	1
unto	1
himself,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
sworn	1
unto	1
thee,	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
28:10	1
And	1
all	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
plenteous	1
in	1
goods,	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
body,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1

of	1
thy	1

in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
28:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
open	1
unto	1
thee	1
his	1
good	1
treasure,	1
the	1
heaven	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
rain	1
unto	1
thy	1
land	1
in	1
his	1
season,	1
and	1
to	1
bless	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hand:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lend	1
unto	1
many	1
nations,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
borrow.	1
	1
28:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
tail;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
above	1
only,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
beneath;	1
if	1
that	1
thou	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
observe	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
them:	1
28:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
aside	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
to	1
go	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
serve	1
them.	1
	1
28:15	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1

which	1
I	1

thee	1
this	1
day;	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
curses	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
overtake	1
thee:	1
28:16	1
Cursed	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
cursed	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
28:17	1
Cursed	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
basket	1
and	1
thy	1
store.	1
	1
28:18	1
Cursed	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
the	1

of	1
thy	1
kine,	1
and	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
thy	1
sheep.	1
	1
28:19	1
Cursed	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
in,	1
and	1
cursed	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
when	1
thou	1
goest	1
out.	1
	1
28:20	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
send	1
upon	1
thee	1
cursing,	1
vexation,	1
and	1
rebuke,	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
settest	1
thine	1
hand	1
unto	1
for	1
to	1
do,	1
until	1
thou	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
until	1
thou	1
perish	1
quickly;	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
thy	1
doings,	1
whereby	1
thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
me.	1
	1
28:21	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
make	1
the	1
pestilence	1
cleave	1
unto	1
thee,	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
consumed	1
thee	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
28:22	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
with	1
a	1
consumption,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
fever,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
inflammation,	1

with	1
an	1
extreme	1
burning,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1

with	1
blasting,	1
and	1
with	1
mildew;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
pursue	1
thee	1
until	1
thou	1
perish.	1
	1
28:23	1
And	1
thy	1
heaven	1
that	1
is	1
over	1
thy	1
head	1
shall	1
be	1
brass,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1

	1
28:24	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
make	1
the	1
rain	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
powder	1
and	1
dust:	1
from	1
heaven	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
down	1
upon	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
28:25	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1
before	1
thine	1
enemies:	1
thou	1

go	1
out	1
one	1
way	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
flee	1
seven	1
ways	1
before	1

be	1
removed	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
28:26	1
And	1
thy	1
carcase	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
unto	1
all	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
unto	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
fray	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
28:27	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
botch	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
emerods,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
scab,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
itch,	1
whereof	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
28:28	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
with	1
madness,	1
and	1
blindness,	1
and	1
astonishment	1
of	1
heart:	1
28:29	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
grope	1
at	1
noonday,	1
as	1
the	1
blind	1
gropeth	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
prosper	1
in	1
thy	1
ways:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
only	1
oppressed	1
and	1
spoiled	1
evermore,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
save	1
thee.	1
	1
28:30	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
betroth	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
another	1
man	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
her:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
build	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
plant	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
gather	1
the	1
grapes	1
thereof.	1
	1
28:31	1
Thine	1
ox	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
before	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof:	1
thine	1
ass	1
shall	1
be	1
violently	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
thee:	1
thy	1
sheep	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
none	1
to	1
rescue	1
them.	1
	1
28:32	1
Thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
another	1
people,	1
and	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
look,	1
and	1
fail	1
with	1
longing	1
for	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
might	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
28:33	1
The	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
labours,	1
shall	1
a	1
nation	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
eat	1
up;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
only	1
oppressed	1
and	1
crushed	1
alway:	1
28:34	1
So	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
mad	1
for	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
thine	1
eyes	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see.	1
	1
28:35	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
knees,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
legs,	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
botch	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
healed,	1
from	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
thy	1
foot	1
unto	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
thy	1
head.	1
	1
28:36	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
king	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
over	1
thee,	1
unto	1
a	1
nation	1
which	1
neither	1
thou	1
nor	1
thy	1
fathers	1
have	1
known;	1
and	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve	1
other	1
gods,	1
wood	1
and	1
stone.	1
	1
28:37	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
become	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
a	1
proverb,	1
and	1
a	1
byword,	1
among	1
all	1
nations	1
whither	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
lead	1
thee.	1
	1
28:38	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
carry	1
much	1
seed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
shalt	1
gather	1
but	1
little	1
in;	1
for	1
the	1
locust	1
shall	1
consume	1
it.	1
	1
28:39	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
dress	1
them,	1
but	1
shalt	1
neither	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine,	1
nor	1
gather	1
the	1
grapes;	1
for	1
the	1
worms	1
shall	1
eat	1
them.	1
	1
28:40	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
olive	1
trees	1
throughout	1
all	1
thy	1
coasts,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
anoint	1
thyself	1
with	1
the	1
oil;	1
for	1
thine	1
olive	1
shall	1
cast	1
his	1
fruit.	1
	1
28:41	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
beget	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
enjoy	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity.	1
	1
28:42	1
All	1
thy	1
trees	1
and	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
the	1
locust	1
consume.	1
	1
28:43	1
The	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
thee	1
shall	1
get	1
up	1
above	1
thee	1
very	1
high;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
down	1
very	1
low.	1
	1
28:44	1
He	1
shall	1
lend	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lend	1
to	1
him:	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
the	1
tail.	1
	1
28:45	1
Moreover	1
all	1
these	1
curses	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
pursue	1
thee,	1
and	1
overtake	1
thee,	1
till	1
thou	1
be	1
destroyed;	1
because	1
thou	1
hearkenedst	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
his	1
statutes	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
28:46	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
wonder,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
28:47	1
Because	1
thou	1
servedst	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
joyfulness,	1
and	1
with	1
gladness	1
of	1
heart,	1
for	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
all	1
things;	1
28:48	1
Therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve	1
thine	1
enemies	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
send	1
against	1
thee,	1
in	1
hunger,	1
and	1
in	1
thirst,	1
and	1
in	1
nakedness,	1
and	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
all	1
things:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
a	1
yoke	1
of	1
iron	1
upon	1
thy	1
neck,	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
destroyed	1
thee.	1
	1
28:49	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
nation	1
against	1
thee	1
from	1
far,	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
as	1
swift	1
as	1
the	1
eagle	1
flieth;	1
a	1
nation	1
whose	1
tongue	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
understand;	1
28:50	1
A	1
nation	1
of	1
fierce	1
countenance,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
regard	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
old,	1
nor	1
shew	1
favour	1
to	1
the	1
young:	1
28:51	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
until	1
thou	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
which	1
also	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
thee	1
either	1
corn,	1
wine,	1
or	1
oil,	1
or	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
thy	1
kine,	1
or	1
flocks	1
of	1
thy	1
sheep,	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
destroyed	1
thee.	1
	1
28:52	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
besiege	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
gates,	1
until	1
thy	1
high	1
and	1
fenced	1
walls	1
come	1
down,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
trustedst,	1
throughout	1
all	1
thy	1
land:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
besiege	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
gates	1
throughout	1
all	1
thy	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee.	1
	1
28:53	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
body,	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
daughters,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
siege,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
straitness,	1
wherewith	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
distress	1
thee:	1
28:54	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
tender	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
very	1
delicate,	1
his	1
eye	1
shall	1
be	1
evil	1
toward	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
leave:	1
28:55	1
So	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
eat:	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
nothing	1
left	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
siege,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
straitness,	1
wherewith	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
distress	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
gates.	1
	1
28:56	1
The	1
tender	1
and	1
delicate	1
woman	1
among	1
you,	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
adventure	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
her	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
delicateness	1
and	1
tenderness,	1
her	1
eye	1
shall	1
be	1
evil	1
toward	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
her	1
bosom,	1
and	1
toward	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
toward	1
her	1
daughter,	1
28:57	1
And	1
toward	1
her	1
young	1
one	1
that	1
cometh	1
out	1
from	1
between	1
her	1
feet,	1
and	1
toward	1
her	1
children	1
which	1
she	1
shall	1
bear:	1
for	1
she	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
secretly	1
in	1
the	1
siege	1
and	1
straitness,	1
wherewith	1
thine	1
enemy	1
shall	1
distress	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
gates.	1
	1
28:58	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
law	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
fear	1
this	1
glorious	1
and	1
fearful	1
name,	1
THE	1
LORD	1
THY	1
GOD;	1
28:59	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
plagues	1
wonderful,	1
and	1
the	1
plagues	1
of	1
thy	1
seed,	1
even	1
great	1
plagues,	1
and	1
of	1
long	1
continuance,	1
and	1
sore	1
sicknesses,	1
and	1
of	1
long	1
continuance.	1
	1
28:60	1
Moreover	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
diseases	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
thou	1
wast	1
afraid	1
of;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
cleave	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
28:61	1
Also	1
every	1
sickness,	1
and	1
every	1
plague,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
this	1
law,	1
them	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
bring	1
upon	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
28:62	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
few	1
in	1
number,	1
whereas	1
ye	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
for	1
multitude;	1
because	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
28:63	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
rejoiced	1
over	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
good,	1
and	1
to	1
multiply	1
you;	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
rejoice	1
over	1
you	1
to	1
destroy	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
nought;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
plucked	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
28:64	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
scatter	1
thee	1
among	1
all	1
people,	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
there	1
thou	1
shalt	1
serve	1
other	1
gods,	1
which	1
neither	1
thou	1
nor	1
thy	1
fathers	1
have	1
known,	1
even	1
wood	1
and	1
stone.	1
	1
28:65	1
And	1
among	1
these	1
nations	1
shalt	1
thou	1
find	1
no	1
ease,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
thy	1
foot	1
have	1
rest:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
there	1
a	1
trembling	1
heart,	1
and	1
failing	1
of	1
eyes,	1
and	1
sorrow	1
of	1
mind:	1
28:66	1
And	1
thy	1
life	1
shall	1
hang	1
in	1
doubt	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
fear	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
and	1
shalt	1
have	1
none	1
assurance	1
of	1
thy	1
life:	1
28:67	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
Would	1
God	1
it	1
were	1
even!	1
and	1
at	1
even	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
Would	1
God	1
it	1
were	1
morning!	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
thine	1
heart	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
shalt	1
fear,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
thine	1
eyes	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see.	1
	1
28:68	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt	1
again	1
with	1
ships,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
whereof	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
it	1
no	1
more	1
again:	1
and	1
there	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
sold	1
unto	1
your	1
enemies	1
for	1
bondmen	1
and	1
bondwomen,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
buy	1
you.	1
	1
29:1	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
to	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
beside	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
Horeb.	1
	1
29:2	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
before	1
your	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
land;	1
29:3	1
The	1
great	1
temptations	1
which	1
thine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen,	1
the	1
signs,	1
and	1
those	1
great	1
miracles:	1
29:4	1
Yet	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
given	1
you	1
an	1
heart	1
to	1
perceive,	1
and	1
eyes	1
to	1
see,	1
and	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
29:5	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
led	1
you	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
your	1
clothes	1
are	1
not	1
waxen	1
old	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
thy	1
shoe	1
is	1
not	1
waxen	1
old	1
upon	1
thy	1
foot.	1
	1
29:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
eaten	1
bread,	1
neither	1
have	1
ye	1
drunk	1
wine	1
or	1
strong	1
drink:	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
29:7	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
came	1
unto	1
this	1
place,	1
Sihon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
Og	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
us	1
unto	1
battle,	1
and	1
we	1
smote	1
them:	1
29:8	1
And	1
we	1
took	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
the	1
Reubenites,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Gadites,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh.	1
	1
29:9	1
Keep	1
therefore	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
and	1
do	1
them,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prosper	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
29:10	1
Ye	1
stand	1
this	1
day	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
your	1
captains	1
of	1
your	1
tribes,	1
your	1
elders,	1
and	1
your	1
officers,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
29:11	1
Your	1
little	1
ones,	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
thy	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
camp,	1
from	1
the	1
hewer	1
of	1
thy	1
wood	1
unto	1
the	1
drawer	1
of	1
thy	1
water:	1
29:12	1
That	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
enter	1
into	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
into	1
his	1
oath,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
maketh	1
with	1
thee	1
this	1
day:	1
29:13	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
establish	1
thee	1
to	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
people	1
unto	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
sworn	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob.	1
	1
29:14	1
Neither	1
with	1
you	1
only	1
do	1
I	1
make	1
this	1
covenant	1
and	1
this	1
oath;	1
29:15	1
But	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
standeth	1
here	1
with	1
us	1
this	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
with	1
us	1
this	1
day:	1
29:16	1
(For	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
we	1
have	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
how	1
we	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
ye	1
passed	1
by;	1
29:17	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
their	1
abominations,	1
and	1
their	1
idols,	1
wood	1
and	1
stone,	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
which	1
were	1
among	1
them:)	1
29:18	1
Lest	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
among	1
you	1
man,	1
or	1
woman,	1
or	1
family,	1
or	1
tribe,	1
whose	1
heart	1
turneth	1
away	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
serve	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
these	1
nations;	1
lest	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
among	1
you	1
a	1
root	1
that	1
beareth	1
gall	1
and	1
wormwood;	1
29:19	1
And	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
heareth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
curse,	1
that	1
he	1
bless	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
saying,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
peace,	1
though	1
I	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
mine	1
heart,	1
to	1
add	1
drunkenness	1
to	1
thirst:	1
29:20	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
spare	1
him,	1
but	1
then	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
his	1
jealousy	1
shall	1
smoke	1
against	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
curses	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
shall	1
lie	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
blot	1
out	1
his	1
name	1
from	1
under	1
heaven.	1
	1
29:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
separate	1
him	1
unto	1
evil	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
curses	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
29:22	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
generation	1
to	1
come	1
of	1
your	1
children	1
that	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
after	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
land,	1
shall	1
say,	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
plagues	1
of	1
that	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
sicknesses	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
laid	1
upon	1
it;	1
29:23	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
thereof	1
is	1
brimstone,	1
and	1
salt,	1
and	1
burning,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
sown,	1
nor	1
beareth,	1
nor	1
any	1
grass	1
groweth	1
therein,	1
like	1
the	1
overthrow	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
Admah,	1
and	1
Zeboim,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
overthrew	1
in	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
wrath:	1
29:24	1
Even	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
say,	1
Wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
done	1
thus	1
unto	1
this	1
land?	1
what	1
meaneth	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
anger?	1
	1
29:25	1
Then	1
men	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
with	1
them	1
when	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
29:26	1
For	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
served	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
them,	1
gods	1
whom	1
they	1
knew	1
not,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
unto	1
them:	1
29:27	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
this	1
land,	1
to	1
bring	1
upon	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
curses	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book:	1
29:28	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
rooted	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
in	1
anger,	1
and	1
in	1
wrath,	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
indignation,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
another	1
land,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
29:29	1
The	1
secret	1
things	1
belong	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God:	1
but	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
revealed	1
belong	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
children	1
for	1
ever,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
law.	1
	1
30:1	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
the	1
blessing	1
and	1
the	1
curse,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
them	1
to	1
mind	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
whither	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
driven	1
thee,	1
30:2	1
And	1
shalt	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
shalt	1
obey	1
his	1
voice	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
children,	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul;	1
30:3	1
That	1
then	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
turn	1
thy	1
captivity,	1
and	1
have	1
compassion	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
gather	1
thee	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
whither	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
scattered	1
thee.	1
	1
30:4	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
thine	1
be	1
driven	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
outmost	1
parts	1
of	1
heaven,	1
from	1
thence	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
gather	1
thee,	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
will	1
he	1
fetch	1
thee:	1
30:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thy	1
fathers	1
possessed,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
possess	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
thee	1
good,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thee	1
above	1
thy	1
fathers.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
circumcise	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
thy	1
seed,	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
live.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
put	1
all	1
these	1
curses	1
upon	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
thee,	1
which	1
persecuted	1
thee.	1
	1
30:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
return	1
and	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
his	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
30:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
plenteous	1
in	1
every	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
body,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
for	1
good:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
again	1
rejoice	1
over	1
thee	1
for	1
good,	1
as	1
he	1
rejoiced	1
over	1
thy	1
fathers:	1
30:10	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
his	1
statutes	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
turn	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
30:11	1
For	1
this	1
commandment	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
hidden	1
from	1
thee,	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
far	1
off.	1
	1
30:12	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
heaven,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say,	1
Who	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
unto	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
hear	1
it,	1
and	1
do	1
it?	1
	1
30:13	1
Neither	1
is	1
it	1
beyond	1
the	1
sea,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say,	1
Who	1
shall	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
unto	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
hear	1
it,	1
and	1
do	1
it?	1
	1
30:14	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
very	1
nigh	1
unto	1
thee,	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
heart,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
30:15	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
life	1
and	1
good,	1
and	1
death	1
and	1
evil;	1
30:16	1
In	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
his	1
statutes	1
and	1
his	1
judgments,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
live	1
and	1
multiply:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
30:17	1
But	1
if	1
thine	1
heart	1
turn	1
away,	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
hear,	1
but	1
shalt	1
be	1
drawn	1
away,	1
and	1
worship	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
serve	1
them;	1
30:18	1
I	1
denounce	1
unto	1
you	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
surely	1
perish,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
prolong	1
your	1
days	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
thou	1
passest	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
30:19	1
I	1
call	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
to	1
record	1
this	1
day	1
against	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
you	1
life	1
and	1
death,	1
blessing	1
and	1
cursing:	1
therefore	1
choose	1
life,	1
that	1
both	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
may	1
live:	1
30:20	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
obey	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
cleave	1
unto	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
thy	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
thy	1
days:	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
to	1
give	1
them.	1
	1
31:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
and	1
spake	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
31:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
this	1
day;	1
I	1
can	1
no	1
more	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
come	1
in:	1
also	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
this	1
Jordan.	1
	1
31:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
he	1
will	1
go	1
over	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
destroy	1
these	1
nations	1
from	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
possess	1
them:	1
and	1
Joshua,	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
over	1
before	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said.	1
	1
31:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
Sihon	1
and	1
to	1
Og,	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
them,	1
whom	1
he	1
destroyed.	1
	1
31:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
them	1
up	1
before	1
your	1
face,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
do	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you.	1
	1
31:6	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
courage,	1
fear	1
not,	1
nor	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
doth	1
go	1
with	1
thee;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
thee,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
thee.	1
	1
31:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
courage:	1
for	1
thou	1
must	1
go	1
with	1
this	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
them;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
inherit	1
it.	1
	1
31:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
doth	1
go	1
before	1
thee;	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
thee,	1
neither	1
forsake	1
thee:	1
fear	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
dismayed.	1
	1
31:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
this	1
law,	1
and	1
delivered	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
which	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
31:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
every	1
seven	1
years,	1
in	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
release,	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles,	1
31:11	1
When	1
all	1
Israel	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
choose,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
read	1
this	1
law	1
before	1
all	1
Israel	1
in	1
their	1
hearing.	1
	1
31:12	1
Gather	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
thy	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
thy	1
gates,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
hear,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn,	1
and	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
law:	1
31:13	1
And	1
that	1
their	1
children,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
any	1
thing,	1
may	1
hear,	1
and	1
learn	1
to	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
ye	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
ye	1
go	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
31:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
days	1
approach	1
that	1
thou	1
must	1
die:	1
call	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
present	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
charge.	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Joshua	1
went,	1
and	1
presented	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
31:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
a	1
cloud:	1
and	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
stood	1
over	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
31:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sleep	1
with	1
thy	1
fathers;	1
and	1
this	1
people	1
will	1
rise	1
up,	1
and	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
they	1
go	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
forsake	1
me,	1
and	1
break	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
31:17	1
Then	1
my	1
anger	1
shall	1
be	1
kindled	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
forsake	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hide	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured,	1
and	1
many	1
evils	1
and	1
troubles	1
shall	1
befall	1
them;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
say	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
Are	1
not	1
these	1
evils	1
come	1
upon	1
us,	1
because	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
among	1
us?	1
	1
31:18	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
hide	1
my	1
face	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
evils	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
wrought,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
turned	1
unto	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
31:19	1
Now	1
therefore	1
write	1
ye	1
this	1
song	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
teach	1
it	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
mouths,	1
that	1
this	1
song	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
for	1
me	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
31:20	1
For	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers,	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
filled	1
themselves,	1
and	1
waxen	1
fat;	1
then	1
will	1
they	1
turn	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
provoke	1
me,	1
and	1
break	1
my	1
covenant.	1
	1
31:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
many	1
evils	1
and	1
troubles	1
are	1
befallen	1
them,	1
that	1
this	1
song	1
shall	1
testify	1
against	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
witness;	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
their	1
seed:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
imagination	1
which	1
they	1
go	1
about,	1
even	1
now,	1
before	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware.	1
	1
31:22	1
Moses	1
therefore	1
wrote	1
this	1
song	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
and	1
taught	1
it	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
31:23	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun	1
a	1
charge,	1
and	1
said,	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
courage:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
31:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Moses	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
writing	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
law	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
finished,	1
31:25	1
That	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
the	1
Levites,	1
which	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
31:26	1
Take	1
this	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
31:27	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
rebellion,	1
and	1
thy	1
stiff	1
neck:	1
behold,	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
yet	1
alive	1
with	1
you	1
this	1
day,	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
rebellious	1
against	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
after	1
my	1
death?	1
	1
31:28	1
Gather	1
unto	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
your	1
tribes,	1
and	1
your	1
officers,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
speak	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
call	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
to	1
record	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
31:29	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
after	1
my	1
death	1
ye	1
will	1
utterly	1
corrupt	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
turn	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you;	1
and	1
evil	1
will	1
befall	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days;	1
because	1
ye	1
will	1
do	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
through	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
your	1
hands.	1
	1
31:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
song,	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
ended.	1
	1
32:1	1
Give	1
ear,	1
O	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak;	1
and	1
hear,	1
O	1
earth,	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
32:2	1
My	1
doctrine	1
shall	1
drop	1
as	1
the	1
rain,	1
my	1
speech	1
shall	1
distil	1
as	1
the	1
dew,	1
as	1
the	1
small	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
tender	1
herb,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
showers	1
upon	1
the	1
grass:	1
32:3	1
Because	1
I	1
will	1
publish	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
ascribe	1
ye	1
greatness	1
unto	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
32:4	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
Rock,	1
his	1
work	1
is	1
perfect:	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
ways	1
are	1
judgment:	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
without	1
iniquity,	1
just	1
and	1
right	1
is	1
he.	1
	1
32:5	1
They	1
have	1
corrupted	1
themselves,	1
their	1
spot	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
spot	1
of	1
his	1
children:	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
perverse	1
and	1
crooked	1
generation.	1
	1
32:6	1
Do	1
ye	1
thus	1
requite	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
foolish	1
people	1
and	1
unwise?	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
thy	1
father	1
that	1
hath	1
bought	1
thee?	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
made	1
thee,	1
and	1
established	1
thee?	1
	1
32:7	1
Remember	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
consider	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
many	1
generations:	1
ask	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
thee;	1
thy	1
elders,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
tell	1
thee.	1
	1
32:8	1
When	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
divided	1
to	1
the	1
nations	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
when	1
he	1
separated	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Adam,	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
32:9	1
For	1
the	1
LORD's	1
portion	1
is	1
his	1
people;	1
Jacob	1
is	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
32:10	1
He	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
desert	1
land,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
waste	1
howling	1
wilderness;	1
he	1
led	1
him	1
about,	1
he	1
instructed	1
him,	1
he	1
kept	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
32:11	1
As	1
an	1
eagle	1
stirreth	1
up	1
her	1
nest,	1
fluttereth	1
over	1
her	1
young,	1
spreadeth	1
abroad	1
her	1
wings,	1
taketh	1
them,	1
beareth	1
them	1
on	1
her	1
wings:	1
32:12	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
alone	1
did	1
lead	1
him,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
strange	1
god	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
32:13	1
He	1
made	1
him	1
ride	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
eat	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
fields;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
suck	1
honey	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
oil	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flinty	1
rock;	1
32:14	1
Butter	1
of	1
kine,	1
and	1
milk	1
of	1
sheep,	1
with	1
fat	1
of	1
lambs,	1
and	1
rams	1
of	1
the	1
breed	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
and	1
goats,	1
with	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
kidneys	1
of	1
wheat;	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
drink	1
the	1
pure	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
grape.	1
	1
32:15	1
But	1
Jeshurun	1
waxed	1
fat,	1
and	1
kicked:	1
thou	1
art	1
waxen	1
fat,	1
thou	1
art	1
grown	1
thick,	1
thou	1
art	1
covered	1
with	1
fatness;	1
then	1
he	1
forsook	1
God	1
which	1
made	1
him,	1
and	1
lightly	1
esteemed	1
the	1
Rock	1
of	1
his	1
salvation.	1
	1
32:16	1
They	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
jealousy	1
with	1
strange	1
gods,	1
with	1
abominations	1
provoked	1
they	1
him	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
32:17	1
They	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
devils,	1
not	1
to	1
God;	1
to	1
gods	1
whom	1
they	1
knew	1
not,	1
to	1
new	1
gods	1
that	1
came	1
newly	1
up,	1
whom	1
your	1
fathers	1
feared	1
not.	1
	1
32:18	1
Of	1
the	1
Rock	1
that	1
begat	1
thee	1
thou	1
art	1
unmindful,	1
and	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
God	1
that	1
formed	1
thee.	1
	1
32:19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
abhorred	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
provoking	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
daughters.	1
	1
32:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
hide	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
what	1
their	1
end	1
shall	1
be:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
froward	1
generation,	1
children	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
no	1
faith.	1
	1
32:21	1
They	1
have	1
moved	1
me	1
to	1
jealousy	1
with	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
God;	1
they	1
have	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
their	1
vanities:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
move	1
them	1
to	1
jealousy	1
with	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
people;	1
I	1
will	1
provoke	1
them	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
a	1
foolish	1
nation.	1
	1
32:22	1
For	1
a	1
fire	1
is	1
kindled	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
shall	1
burn	1
unto	1
the	1
lowest	1
hell,	1
and	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
her	1
increase,	1
and	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
32:23	1
I	1
will	1
heap	1
mischiefs	1
upon	1
them;	1
I	1
will	1
spend	1
mine	1
arrows	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
32:24	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
hunger,	1
and	1
devoured	1
with	1
burning	1
heat,	1
and	1
with	1
bitter	1
destruction:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
send	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
beasts	1
upon	1
them,	1
with	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
serpents	1
of	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
32:25	1
The	1
sword	1
without,	1
and	1
terror	1
within,	1
shall	1
destroy	1
both	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
virgin,	1
the	1
suckling	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
gray	1
hairs.	1
	1
32:26	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
would	1
scatter	1
them	1
into	1
corners,	1
I	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
among	1
men:	1
32:27	1
Were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
feared	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
lest	1
their	1
adversaries	1
should	1
behave	1
themselves	1
strangely,	1
and	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
say,	1
Our	1
hand	1
is	1
high,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
done	1
all	1
this.	1
	1
32:28	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
nation	1
void	1
of	1
counsel,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
understanding	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
32:29	1
O	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
wise,	1
that	1
they	1
understood	1
this,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
consider	1
their	1
latter	1
end!	1
	1
32:30	1
How	1
should	1
one	1
chase	1
a	1
thousand,	1
and	1
two	1
put	1
ten	1
thousand	1
to	1
flight,	1
except	1
their	1
Rock	1
had	1
sold	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
shut	1
them	1
up?	1
	1
32:31	1
For	1
their	1
rock	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
our	1
Rock,	1
even	1
our	1
enemies	1
themselves	1
being	1
judges.	1
	1
32:32	1
For	1
their	1
vine	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Gomorrah:	1
their	1
grapes	1
are	1
grapes	1
of	1
gall,	1
their	1
clusters	1
are	1
bitter:	1
32:33	1
Their	1
wine	1
is	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
dragons,	1
and	1
the	1
cruel	1
venom	1
of	1
asps.	1
	1
32:34	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
sealed	1
up	1
among	1
my	1
treasures?	1
	1
32:35	1
To	1
me	1
belongeth	1
vengeance	1
and	1
recompence;	1
their	1
foot	1
shall	1
slide	1
in	1
due	1
time:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity	1
is	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
make	1
haste.	1
	1
32:36	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
judge	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
repent	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
servants,	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
that	1
their	1
power	1
is	1
gone,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
shut	1
up,	1
or	1
left.	1
	1
32:37	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
Where	1
are	1
their	1
gods,	1
their	1
rock	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
trusted,	1
32:38	1
Which	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
their	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
drank	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
their	1
drink	1
offerings?	1
let	1
them	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
help	1
you,	1
and	1
be	1
your	1
protection.	1
	1
32:39	1
See	1
now	1
that	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
am	1
he,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
god	1
with	1
me:	1
I	1
kill,	1
and	1
I	1
make	1
alive;	1
I	1
wound,	1
and	1
I	1
heal:	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
that	1
can	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
	1
32:40	1
For	1
I	1
lift	1
up	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
say,	1
I	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
32:41	1
If	1
I	1
whet	1
my	1
glittering	1
sword,	1
and	1
mine	1
hand	1
take	1
hold	1
on	1
judgment;	1
I	1
will	1
render	1
vengeance	1
to	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
will	1
reward	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me.	1
	1
32:42	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
mine	1
arrows	1
drunk	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
my	1
sword	1
shall	1
devour	1
flesh;	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
captives,	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
revenges	1
upon	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
32:43	1
Rejoice,	1
O	1
ye	1
nations,	1
with	1
his	1
people:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
will	1
render	1
vengeance	1
to	1
his	1
adversaries,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
his	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
32:44	1
And	1
Moses	1
came	1
and	1
spake	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
song	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he,	1
and	1
Hoshea	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun.	1
	1
32:45	1
And	1
Moses	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
to	1
all	1
Israel:	1
32:46	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Set	1
your	1
hearts	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
testify	1
among	1
you	1
this	1
day,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
command	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
observe	1
to	1
do,	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
law.	1
	1
32:47	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
vain	1
thing	1
for	1
you;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
life:	1
and	1
through	1
this	1
thing	1
ye	1
shall	1
prolong	1
your	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
ye	1
go	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
32:48	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
that	1
selfsame	1
day,	1
saying,	1
32:49	1
Get	1
thee	1
up	1
into	1
this	1
mountain	1
Abarim,	1
unto	1
mount	1
Nebo,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
that	1
is	1
over	1
against	1
Jericho;	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
a	1
possession:	1
32:50	1
And	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest	1
up,	1
and	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
thy	1
people;	1
as	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother	1
died	1
in	1
mount	1
Hor,	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people:	1
32:51	1
Because	1
ye	1
trespassed	1
against	1
me	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
MeribahKadesh,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Zin;	1
because	1
ye	1
sanctified	1
me	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
32:52	1
Yet	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
the	1
land	1
before	1
thee;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
thither	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
33:1	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
blessing,	1
wherewith	1
Moses	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
blessed	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
before	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
33:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
came	1
from	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
Seir	1
unto	1
them;	1
he	1
shined	1
forth	1
from	1
mount	1
Paran,	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
with	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
saints:	1
from	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
went	1
a	1
fiery	1
law	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
33:3	1
Yea,	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
people;	1
all	1
his	1
saints	1
are	1
in	1
thy	1
hand:	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
thy	1
feet;	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
33:4	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
us	1
a	1
law,	1
even	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
33:5	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
king	1
in	1
Jeshurun,	1
when	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
33:6	1
Let	1
Reuben	1
live,	1
and	1
not	1
die;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
his	1
men	1
be	1
few.	1
	1
33:7	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
Judah:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Hear,	1
LORD,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
his	1
people:	1
let	1
his	1
hands	1
be	1
sufficient	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
an	1
help	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
33:8	1
And	1
of	1
Levi	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
thy	1
Thummim	1
and	1
thy	1
Urim	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
holy	1
one,	1
whom	1
thou	1
didst	1
prove	1
at	1
Massah,	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
didst	1
strive	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Meribah;	1
33:9	1
Who	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
mother,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
him;	1
neither	1
did	1
he	1
acknowledge	1
his	1
brethren,	1
nor	1
knew	1
his	1
own	1
children:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
observed	1
thy	1
word,	1
and	1
kept	1
thy	1
covenant.	1
	1
33:10	1
They	1
shall	1
teach	1
Jacob	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
and	1
Israel	1
thy	1
law:	1
they	1
shall	1
put	1
incense	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
whole	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
upon	1
thine	1
altar.	1
	1
33:11	1
Bless,	1
LORD,	1
his	1
substance,	1
and	1
accept	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
hands;	1
smite	1
through	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
rise	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
him,	1
that	1
they	1
rise	1
not	1
again.	1
	1
33:12	1
And	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
beloved	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
safety	1
by	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
cover	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
dwell	1
between	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
33:13	1
And	1
of	1
Joseph	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
his	1
land,	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
of	1
heaven,	1
for	1
the	1
dew,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
deep	1
that	1
coucheth	1
beneath,	1
33:14	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
fruits	1
brought	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
put	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
moon,	1
33:15	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
mountains,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
lasting	1
hills,	1
33:16	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
fulness	1
thereof,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
bush:	1
let	1
the	1
blessing	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
separated	1
from	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
33:17	1
His	1
glory	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
his	1
bullock,	1
and	1
his	1
horns	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
unicorns:	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
shall	1
push	1
the	1
people	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Manasseh.	1
	1
33:18	1
And	1
of	1
Zebulun	1
he	1
said,	1
Rejoice,	1
Zebulun,	1
in	1
thy	1
going	1
out;	1
and,	1
Issachar,	1
in	1
thy	1
tents.	1
	1
33:19	1
They	1
shall	1
call	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
mountain;	1
there	1
they	1
shall	1
offer	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
suck	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
of	1
treasures	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
sand.	1
	1
33:20	1
And	1
of	1
Gad	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
enlargeth	1
Gad:	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
teareth	1
the	1
arm	1
with	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
head.	1
	1
33:21	1
And	1
he	1
provided	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
for	1
himself,	1
because	1
there,	1
in	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
lawgiver,	1
was	1
he	1
seated;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
executed	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
judgments	1
with	1
Israel.	1
	1
33:22	1
And	1
of	1
Dan	1
he	1
said,	1
Dan	1
is	1
a	1
lion's	1
whelp:	1
he	1
shall	1
leap	1
from	1
Bashan.	1
	1
33:23	1
And	1
of	1
Naphtali	1
he	1
said,	1
O	1
Naphtali,	1
satisfied	1
with	1
favour,	1
and	1
full	1
with	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
possess	1
thou	1
the	1
west	1
and	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
33:24	1
And	1
of	1
Asher	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
Asher	1
be	1
blessed	1
with	1
children;	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
acceptable	1
to	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
dip	1
his	1
foot	1
in	1
oil.	1
	1
33:25	1
Thy	1
shoes	1
shall	1
be	1
iron	1
and	1
brass;	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
days,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
strength	1
be.	1
	1
33:26	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jeshurun,	1
who	1
rideth	1
upon	1
the	1
heaven	1
in	1
thy	1
help,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
excellency	1
on	1
the	1
sky.	1
	1
33:27	1
The	1
eternal	1
God	1
is	1
thy	1
refuge,	1
and	1
underneath	1
are	1
the	1
everlasting	1
arms:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
thrust	1
out	1
the	1
enemy	1
from	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
shall	1
say,	1
Destroy	1
them.	1
	1
33:28	1
Israel	1
then	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
safety	1
alone:	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
wine;	1
also	1
his	1
heavens	1
shall	1
drop	1
down	1
dew.	1
	1
33:29	1
Happy	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
people	1
saved	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
thy	1
help,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
thy	1
excellency!	1
and	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
liars	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
tread	1
upon	1
their	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
34:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moab	1
unto	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Nebo,	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Pisgah,	1
that	1
is	1
over	1
against	1
Jericho.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
unto	1
Dan,	1
34:2	1
And	1
all	1
Naphtali,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
unto	1
the	1
utmost	1
sea,	1
34:3	1
And	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jericho,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
palm	1
trees,	1
unto	1
Zoar.	1
	1
34:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
unto	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed:	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
thee	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
with	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
thither.	1
	1
34:5	1
So	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
died	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
34:6	1
And	1
he	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
valley	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
over	1
against	1
Bethpeor:	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
of	1
his	1
sepulchre	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
34:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
died:	1
his	1
eye	1
was	1
not	1
dim,	1
nor	1
his	1
natural	1
force	1
abated.	1
	1
34:8	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
wept	1
for	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moab	1
thirty	1
days:	1
so	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
weeping	1
and	1
mourning	1
for	1
Moses	1
were	1
ended.	1
	1
34:9	1
And	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
wisdom;	1
for	1
Moses	1
had	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
34:10	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
not	1
a	1
prophet	1
since	1
in	1
Israel	1
like	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
knew	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
34:11	1
In	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
and	1
the	1
wonders,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
land,	1
34:12	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
terror	1
which	1
Moses	1
shewed	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Joshua	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
Moses'	1
minister,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Moses	1
my	1
servant	1
is	1
dead;	1
now	1
therefore	1
arise,	1
go	1
over	1
this	1
Jordan,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
people,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
give	1
to	1
them,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:3	1
Every	1
place	1
that	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
your	1
foot	1
shall	1
tread	1
upon,	1
that	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses.	1
	1
1:4	1
From	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
this	1
Lebanon	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
river,	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates,	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
sea	1
toward	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
coast.	1
	1
1:5	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life:	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
Moses,	1
so	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
thee,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
thee.	1
	1
1:6	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
courage:	1
for	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
shalt	1
thou	1
divide	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
them.	1
	1
1:7	1
Only	1
be	1
thou	1
strong	1
and	1
very	1
courageous,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
law,	1
which	1
Moses	1
my	1
servant	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
turn	1
not	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prosper	1
withersoever	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
1:8	1
This	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
meditate	1
therein	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
therein:	1
for	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
thy	1
way	1
prosperous,	1
and	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
good	1
success.	1
	1
1:9	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee?	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
courage;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
neither	1
be	1
thou	1
dismayed:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
1:10	1
Then	1
Joshua	1
commanded	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
1:11	1
Pass	1
through	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
command	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Prepare	1
you	1
victuals;	1
for	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
this	1
Jordan,	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
giveth	1
you	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
Reubenites,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Gadites,	1
and	1
to	1
half	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
spake	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
1:13	1
Remember	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
you,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
rest,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
this	1
land.	1
	1
1:14	1
Your	1
wives,	1
your	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
your	1
cattle,	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
Moses	1
gave	1
you	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
pass	1
before	1
your	1
brethren	1
armed,	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour,	1
and	1
help	1
them;	1
1:15	1
Until	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
given	1
your	1
brethren	1
rest,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
you,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
have	1
possessed	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
giveth	1
them:	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
possession,	1
and	1
enjoy	1
it,	1
which	1
Moses	1
the	1
LORD's	1
servant	1
gave	1
you	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
toward	1
the	1
sunrising.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
All	1
that	1
thou	1
commandest	1
us	1
we	1
will	1
do,	1
and	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
sendest	1
us,	1
we	1
will	1
go.	1
	1
1:17	1
According	1
as	1
we	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
so	1
will	1
we	1
hearken	1
unto	1
thee:	1
only	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
Moses.	1
	1
1:18	1
Whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
that	1
doth	1
rebel	1
against	1
thy	1
commandment,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
thy	1
words	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
commandest	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
only	1
be	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
courage.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun	1
sent	1
out	1
of	1
Shittim	1
two	1
men	1
to	1
spy	1
secretly,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
view	1
the	1
land,	1
even	1
Jericho.	1
And	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
an	1
harlot's	1
house,	1
named	1
Rahab,	1
and	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Jericho,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
came	1
men	1
in	1
hither	1
to	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
search	1
out	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Jericho	1
sent	1
unto	1
Rahab,	1
saying,	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
thee,	1
which	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
thine	1
house:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
come	1
to	1
search	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
men,	1
and	1
hid	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
thus,	1
There	1
came	1
men	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
wist	1
not	1
whence	1
they	1
were:	1
2:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
shutting	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
dark,	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
out:	1
whither	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
I	1
wot	1
not:	1
pursue	1
after	1
them	1
quickly;	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
overtake	1
them.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
hid	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
stalks	1
of	1
flax,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
laid	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
the	1
roof.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
pursued	1
after	1
them	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Jordan	1
unto	1
the	1
fords:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
which	1
pursued	1
after	1
them	1
were	1
gone	1
out,	1
they	1
shut	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
laid	1
down,	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
roof;	1
2:9	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
men,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
terror	1
is	1
fallen	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
faint	1
because	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
how	1
the	1
LORD	1
dried	1
up	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
for	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
what	1
ye	1
did	1
unto	1
the	1
two	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
Sihon	1
and	1
Og,	1
whom	1
ye	1
utterly	1
destroyed.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
our	1
hearts	1
did	1
melt,	1
neither	1
did	1
there	1
remain	1
any	1
more	1
courage	1
in	1
any	1
man,	1
because	1
of	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
he	1
is	1
God	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
and	1
in	1
earth	1
beneath.	1
	1
2:12	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
swear	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
you	1
kindness,	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
also	1
shew	1
kindness	1
unto	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
true	1
token:	1
2:13	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
save	1
alive	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
my	1
mother,	1
and	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
my	1
sisters,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have,	1
and	1
deliver	1
our	1
lives	1
from	1
death.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
answered	1
her,	1
Our	1
life	1
for	1
yours,	1
if	1
ye	1
utter	1
not	1
this	1
our	1
business.	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
deal	1
kindly	1
and	1
truly	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
2:15	1
Then	1
she	1
let	1
them	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
cord	1
through	1
the	1
window:	1
for	1
her	1
house	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
town	1
wall,	1
and	1
she	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Get	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
mountain,	1
lest	1
the	1
pursuers	1
meet	1
you;	1
and	1
hide	1
yourselves	1
there	1
three	1
days,	1
until	1
the	1
pursuers	1
be	1
returned:	1
and	1
afterward	1
may	1
ye	1
go	1
your	1
way.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
We	1
will	1
be	1
blameless	1
of	1
this	1
thine	1
oath	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
swear.	1
	1
2:18	1
Behold,	1
when	1
we	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bind	1
this	1
line	1
of	1
scarlet	1
thread	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
which	1
thou	1
didst	1
let	1
us	1
down	1
by:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
thy	1
mother,	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
father's	1
household,	1
home	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
thy	1
house	1
into	1
the	1
street,	1
his	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
guiltless:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
his	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
our	1
head,	1
if	1
any	1
hand	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
utter	1
this	1
our	1
business,	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
quit	1
of	1
thine	1
oath	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
to	1
swear.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
According	1
unto	1
your	1
words,	1
so	1
be	1
it.	1
And	1
she	1
sent	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
departed:	1
and	1
she	1
bound	1
the	1
scarlet	1
line	1
in	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
abode	1
there	1
three	1
days,	1
until	1
the	1
pursuers	1
were	1
returned:	1
and	1
the	1
pursuers	1
sought	1
them	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
way,	1
but	1
found	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
2:23	1
So	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
returned,	1
and	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
passed	1
over,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
befell	1
them:	1
2:24	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Truly	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
into	1
our	1
hands	1
all	1
the	1
land;	1
for	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
do	1
faint	1
because	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
Joshua	1
rose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
they	1
removed	1
from	1
Shittim,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jordan,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
lodged	1
there	1
before	1
they	1
passed	1
over.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
three	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
officers	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
host;	1
3:3	1
And	1
they	1
commanded	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
When	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites	1
bearing	1
it,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
remove	1
from	1
your	1
place,	1
and	1
go	1
after	1
it.	1
	1
3:4	1
Yet	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
space	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
it,	1
about	1
two	1
thousand	1
cubits	1
by	1
measure:	1
come	1
not	1
near	1
unto	1
it,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
which	1
ye	1
must	1
go:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
passed	1
this	1
way	1
heretofore.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Sanctify	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
wonders	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
Joshua	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
and	1
pass	1
over	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
and	1
went	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
This	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
magnify	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
Moses,	1
so	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
command	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
bear	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
saying,	1
When	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
ye	1
shall	1
stand	1
still	1
in	1
Jordan.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Come	1
hither,	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said,	1
Hereby	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
without	1
fail	1
drive	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
you	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Girgashites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites.	1
	1
3:11	1
Behold,	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
passeth	1
over	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Jordan.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
therefore	1
take	1
you	1
twelve	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
tribe	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
bear	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
shall	1
rest	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Jordan	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
above;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
stand	1
upon	1
an	1
heap.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
removed	1
from	1
their	1
tents,	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
bearing	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
before	1
the	1
people;	1
3:15	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
were	1
dipped	1
in	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
(for	1
Jordan	1
overfloweth	1
all	1
his	1
banks	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
harvest,)	1
3:16	1
That	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
above	1
stood	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
upon	1
an	1
heap	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
Adam,	1
that	1
is	1
beside	1
Zaretan:	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
came	1
down	1
toward	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
even	1
the	1
salt	1
sea,	1
failed,	1
and	1
were	1
cut	1
off:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
passed	1
over	1
right	1
against	1
Jericho.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
firm	1
on	1
dry	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
passed	1
over	1
on	1
dry	1
ground,	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
passed	1
clean	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
clean	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
4:2	1
Take	1
you	1
twelve	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
tribe	1
a	1
man,	1
4:3	1
And	1
command	1
ye	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
you	1
hence	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
priests'	1
feet	1
stood	1
firm,	1
twelve	1
stones,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
over	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
leave	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
lodging	1
place,	1
where	1
ye	1
shall	1
lodge	1
this	1
night.	1
	1
4:4	1
Then	1
Joshua	1
called	1
the	1
twelve	1
men,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
tribe	1
a	1
man:	1
4:5	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Pass	1
over	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
take	1
you	1
up	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
you	1
a	1
stone	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
4:6	1
That	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
when	1
your	1
children	1
ask	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
saying,	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
by	1
these	1
stones?	1
	1
4:7	1
Then	1
ye	1
shall	1
answer	1
them,	1
That	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Jordan	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
when	1
it	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Jordan	1
were	1
cut	1
off:	1
and	1
these	1
stones	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
so	1
as	1
Joshua	1
commanded,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
twelve	1
stones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
over	1
with	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
lodged,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
down	1
there.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
Joshua	1
set	1
up	1
twelve	1
stones	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
which	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
stood:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
there	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
the	1
priests	1
which	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
until	1
everything	1
was	1
finished	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Joshua	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
Joshua:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
hasted	1
and	1
passed	1
over.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
clean	1
passed	1
over,	1
that	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
passed	1
over,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
passed	1
over	1
armed	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
them:	1
4:13	1
About	1
forty	1
thousand	1
prepared	1
for	1
war	1
passed	1
over	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
battle,	1
to	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Jericho.	1
	1
4:14	1
On	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
magnified	1
Joshua	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
Israel;	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
him,	1
as	1
they	1
feared	1
Moses,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
4:16	1
Command	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
bear	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
that	1
they	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Jordan.	1
	1
4:17	1
Joshua	1
therefore	1
commanded	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
ye	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Jordan.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
were	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
the	1
priests'	1
feet	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
dry	1
land,	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Jordan	1
returned	1
unto	1
their	1
place,	1
and	1
flowed	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
banks,	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
before.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Jordan	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
and	1
encamped	1
in	1
Gilgal,	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
border	1
of	1
Jericho.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
those	1
twelve	1
stones,	1
which	1
they	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
did	1
Joshua	1
pitch	1
in	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
When	1
your	1
children	1
shall	1
ask	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
saying,	1
What	1
mean	1
these	1
stones?	1
	1
4:22	1
Then	1
ye	1
shall	1
let	1
your	1
children	1
know,	1
saying,	1
Israel	1
came	1
over	1
this	1
Jordan	1
on	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
4:23	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
dried	1
up	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Jordan	1
from	1
before	1
you,	1
until	1
ye	1
were	1
passed	1
over,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
which	1
he	1
dried	1
up	1
from	1
before	1
us,	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
gone	1
over:	1
4:24	1
That	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
mighty:	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Jordan	1
westward,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
which	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
dried	1
up	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Jordan	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
passed	1
over,	1
that	1
their	1
heart	1
melted,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
spirit	1
in	1
them	1
any	1
more,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:2	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Make	1
thee	1
sharp	1
knives,	1
and	1
circumcise	1
again	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
Joshua	1
made	1
him	1
sharp	1
knives,	1
and	1
circumcised	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
at	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
the	1
foreskins.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
why	1
Joshua	1
did	1
circumcise:	1
All	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
were	1
males,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
after	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
were	1
circumcised:	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
them	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
circumcised.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
walked	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
till	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
were	1
consumed,	1
because	1
they	1
obeyed	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
shew	1
them	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sware	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
us,	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
their	1
children,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
stead,	1
them	1
Joshua	1
circumcised:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
uncircumcised,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
circumcised	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
circumcising	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
abode	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
camp,	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
whole.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
This	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
rolled	1
away	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
Egypt	1
from	1
off	1
you.	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
is	1
called	1
Gilgal	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
encamped	1
in	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
kept	1
the	1
passover	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
at	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Jericho.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
corn	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
the	1
passover,	1
unleavened	1
cakes,	1
and	1
parched	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
the	1
manna	1
ceased	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
corn	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
neither	1
had	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
manna	1
any	1
more;	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
that	1
year.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Joshua	1
was	1
by	1
Jericho,	1
that	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
over	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
sword	1
drawn	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
Joshua	1
went	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
for	1
us,	1
or	1
for	1
our	1
adversaries?	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
as	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
am	1
I	1
now	1
come.	1
And	1
Joshua	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
did	1
worship,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
saith	1
my	1
Lord	1
unto	1
his	1
servant?	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
host	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Loose	1
thy	1
shoe	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
foot;	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
whereon	1
thou	1
standest	1
is	1
holy.	1
And	1
Joshua	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
6:1	1
Now	1
Jericho	1
was	1
straitly	1
shut	1
up	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
none	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
none	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
into	1
thine	1
hand	1
Jericho,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
compass	1
the	1
city,	1
all	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
go	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
once.	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
six	1
days.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
seven	1
priests	1
shall	1
bear	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
seven	1
trumpets	1
of	1
rams'	1
horns:	1
and	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
compass	1
the	1
city	1
seven	1
times,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
blow	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
make	1
a	1
long	1
blast	1
with	1
the	1
ram's	1
horn,	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
shout	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
shout;	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
flat,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
ascend	1
up	1
every	1
man	1
straight	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun	1
called	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
and	1
let	1
seven	1
priests	1
bear	1
seven	1
trumpets	1
of	1
rams'	1
horns	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Pass	1
on,	1
and	1
compass	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
armed	1
pass	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Joshua	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
the	1
seven	1
priests	1
bearing	1
the	1
seven	1
trumpets	1
of	1
rams'	1
horns	1
passed	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
blew	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets:	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
followed	1
them.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
the	1
armed	1
men	1
went	1
before	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
blew	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
the	1
rereward	1
came	1
after	1
the	1
ark,	1
the	1
priests	1
going	1
on,	1
and	1
blowing	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
Joshua	1
had	1
commanded	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
shout,	1
nor	1
make	1
any	1
noise	1
with	1
your	1
voice,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
word	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
bid	1
you	1
shout;	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
shout.	1
	1
6:11	1
So	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
compassed	1
the	1
city,	1
going	1
about	1
it	1
once:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
Joshua	1
rose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
seven	1
priests	1
bearing	1
seven	1
trumpets	1
of	1
rams'	1
horns	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
on	1
continually,	1
and	1
blew	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets:	1
and	1
the	1
armed	1
men	1
went	1
before	1
them;	1
but	1
the	1
rereward	1
came	1
after	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
priests	1
going	1
on,	1
and	1
blowing	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
they	1
compassed	1
the	1
city	1
once,	1
and	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
camp:	1
so	1
they	1
did	1
six	1
days.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
they	1
rose	1
early	1
about	1
the	1
dawning	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
compassed	1
the	1
city	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
seven	1
times:	1
only	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
compassed	1
the	1
city	1
seven	1
times.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
seventh	1
time,	1
when	1
the	1
priests	1
blew	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Shout;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
accursed,	1
even	1
it,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
therein,	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
only	1
Rahab	1
the	1
harlot	1
shall	1
live,	1
she	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
because	1
she	1
hid	1
the	1
messengers	1
that	1
we	1
sent.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
ye,	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
keep	1
yourselves	1
from	1
the	1
accursed	1
thing,	1
lest	1
ye	1
make	1
yourselves	1
accursed,	1
when	1
ye	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
accursed	1
thing,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel	1
a	1
curse,	1
and	1
trouble	1
it.	1
	1
6:19	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
iron,	1
are	1
consecrated	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
treasury	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:20	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
shouted	1
when	1
the	1
priests	1
blew	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shouted	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
shout,	1
that	1
the	1
wall	1
fell	1
down	1
flat,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
every	1
man	1
straight	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
they	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
woman,	1
young	1
and	1
old,	1
and	1
ox,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
ass,	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
6:22	1
But	1
Joshua	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
that	1
had	1
spied	1
out	1
the	1
country,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
harlot's	1
house,	1
and	1
bring	1
out	1
thence	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
hath,	1
as	1
ye	1
sware	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
6:23	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
spies	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
brought	1
out	1
Rahab,	1
and	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
her	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had;	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
out	1
all	1
her	1
kindred,	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
without	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
they	1
burnt	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
therein:	1
only	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
of	1
iron,	1
they	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
treasury	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
Joshua	1
saved	1
Rahab	1
the	1
harlot	1
alive,	1
and	1
her	1
father's	1
household,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had;	1
and	1
she	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
Israel	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day;	1
because	1
she	1
hid	1
the	1
messengers,	1
which	1
Joshua	1
sent	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
Jericho.	1
	1
6:26	1
And	1
Joshua	1
adjured	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
saying,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
riseth	1
up	1
and	1
buildeth	1
this	1
city	1
Jericho:	1
he	1
shall	1
lay	1
the	1
foundation	1
thereof	1
in	1
his	1
firstborn,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
youngest	1
son	1
shall	1
he	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
6:27	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
Joshua;	1
and	1
his	1
fame	1
was	1
noised	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
7:1	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
committed	1
a	1
trespass	1
in	1
the	1
accursed	1
thing:	1
for	1
Achan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Carmi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zabdi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zerah,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah,	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
accursed	1
thing:	1
and	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
Joshua	1
sent	1
men	1
from	1
Jericho	1
to	1
Ai,	1
which	1
is	1
beside	1
Bethaven,	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
up	1
and	1
view	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
viewed	1
Ai.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
go	1
up;	1
but	1
let	1
about	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
thousand	1
men	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
smite	1
Ai;	1
and	1
make	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
labour	1
thither;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
but	1
few.	1
	1
7:4	1
So	1
there	1
went	1
up	1
thither	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
men:	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
before	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ai.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ai	1
smote	1
of	1
them	1
about	1
thirty	1
and	1
six	1
men:	1
for	1
they	1
chased	1
them	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
gate	1
even	1
unto	1
Shebarim,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
going	1
down:	1
wherefore	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
melted,	1
and	1
became	1
as	1
water.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
Joshua	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
until	1
the	1
eventide,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
put	1
dust	1
upon	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said,	1
Alas,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God,	1
wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
at	1
all	1
brought	1
this	1
people	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
to	1
destroy	1
us?	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
content,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan!	1
	1
7:8	1
O	1
LORD,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say,	1
when	1
Israel	1
turneth	1
their	1
backs	1
before	1
their	1
enemies!	1
	1
7:9	1
For	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
shall	1
environ	1
us	1
round,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
our	1
name	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
do	1
unto	1
thy	1
great	1
name?	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Get	1
thee	1
up;	1
wherefore	1
liest	1
thou	1
thus	1
upon	1
thy	1
face?	1
	1
7:11	1
Israel	1
hath	1
sinned,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
also	1
transgressed	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
even	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
accursed	1
thing,	1
and	1
have	1
also	1
stolen,	1
and	1
dissembled	1
also,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
put	1
it	1
even	1
among	1
their	1
own	1
stuff.	1
	1
7:12	1
Therefore	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
but	1
turned	1
their	1
backs	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
accursed:	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
any	1
more,	1
except	1
ye	1
destroy	1
the	1
accursed	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
7:13	1
Up,	1
sanctify	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
say,	1
Sanctify	1
yourselves	1
against	1
to	1
morrow:	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
There	1
is	1
an	1
accursed	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
stand	1
before	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
until	1
ye	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
accursed	1
thing	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
7:14	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
tribes:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
the	1
tribe	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
taketh	1
shall	1
come	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
families	1
thereof;	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
take	1
shall	1
come	1
by	1
households;	1
and	1
the	1
household	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
take	1
shall	1
come	1
man	1
by	1
man.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
accursed	1
thing	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath:	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
transgressed	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
wrought	1
folly	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:16	1
So	1
Joshua	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
brought	1
Israel	1
by	1
their	1
tribes;	1
and	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah	1
was	1
taken:	1
7:17	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Judah;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Zarhites:	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Zarhites	1
man	1
by	1
man;	1
and	1
Zabdi	1
was	1
taken:	1
7:18	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
his	1
household	1
man	1
by	1
man;	1
and	1
Achan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Carmi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zabdi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zerah,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah,	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
Achan,	1
My	1
son,	1
give,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
make	1
confession	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
now	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
done;	1
hide	1
it	1
not	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
Achan	1
answered	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
said,	1
Indeed	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
thus	1
and	1
thus	1
have	1
I	1
done:	1
7:21	1
When	1
I	1
saw	1
among	1
the	1
spoils	1
a	1
goodly	1
Babylonish	1
garment,	1
and	1
two	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
a	1
wedge	1
of	1
gold	1
of	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
weight,	1
then	1
I	1
coveted	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
them;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
tent,	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
under	1
it.	1
	1
7:22	1
So	1
Joshua	1
sent	1
messengers,	1
and	1
they	1
ran	1
unto	1
the	1
tent;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
hid	1
in	1
his	1
tent,	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
under	1
it.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
took	1
Achan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zerah,	1
and	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
garment,	1
and	1
the	1
wedge	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
daughters,	1
and	1
his	1
oxen,	1
and	1
his	1
asses,	1
and	1
his	1
sheep,	1
and	1
his	1
tent,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Achor.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
troubled	1
us?	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
trouble	1
thee	1
this	1
day.	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
stoned	1
him	1
with	1
stones,	1
and	1
burned	1
them	1
with	1
fire,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
stoned	1
them	1
with	1
stones.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
they	1
raised	1
over	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
stones	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
anger.	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
was	1
called,	1
The	1
valley	1
of	1
Achor,	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
thou	1
dismayed:	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
war	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
arise,	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Ai:	1
see,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
into	1
thy	1
hand	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Ai,	1
and	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
his	1
city,	1
and	1
his	1
land:	1
8:2	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
to	1
Ai	1
and	1
her	1
king	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
unto	1
Jericho	1
and	1
her	1
king:	1
only	1
the	1
spoil	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
cattle	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
ye	1
take	1
for	1
a	1
prey	1
unto	1
yourselves:	1
lay	1
thee	1
an	1
ambush	1
for	1
the	1
city	1
behind	1
it.	1
	1
8:3	1
So	1
Joshua	1
arose,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
war,	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
Ai:	1
and	1
Joshua	1
chose	1
out	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
away	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
shall	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
even	1
behind	1
the	1
city:	1
go	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
but	1
be	1
ye	1
all	1
ready:	1
8:5	1
And	1
I,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
will	1
approach	1
unto	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
us,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
flee	1
before	1
them,	1
8:6	1
(For	1
they	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
after	1
us)	1
till	1
we	1
have	1
drawn	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
city;	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
say,	1
They	1
flee	1
before	1
us,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first:	1
therefore	1
we	1
will	1
flee	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
8:7	1
Then	1
ye	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
ambush,	1
and	1
seize	1
upon	1
the	1
city:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
will	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
city,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
set	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
fire:	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
ye	1
do.	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you.	1
	1
8:9	1
Joshua	1
therefore	1
sent	1
them	1
forth:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
ambush,	1
and	1
abode	1
between	1
Bethel	1
and	1
Ai,	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
side	1
of	1
Ai:	1
but	1
Joshua	1
lodged	1
that	1
night	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
Joshua	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
numbered	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
went	1
up,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
before	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
Ai.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
war	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
and	1
came	1
before	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
pitched	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
Ai:	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
valley	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
Ai.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
ambush	1
between	1
Bethel	1
and	1
Ai,	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
their	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
Joshua	1
went	1
that	1
night	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Ai	1
saw	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
hasted	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
Israel	1
to	1
battle,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
appointed,	1
before	1
the	1
plain;	1
but	1
he	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
liers	1
in	1
ambush	1
against	1
him	1
behind	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
Joshua	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
made	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
beaten	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
fled	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Ai	1
were	1
called	1
together	1
to	1
pursue	1
after	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
pursued	1
after	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
were	1
drawn	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
left	1
in	1
Ai	1
or	1
Bethel,	1
that	1
went	1
not	1
out	1
after	1
Israel:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
city	1
open,	1
and	1
pursued	1
after	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
the	1
spear	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
hand	1
toward	1
Ai;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
Joshua	1
stretched	1
out	1
the	1
spear	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
toward	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
the	1
ambush	1
arose	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
place,	1
and	1
they	1
ran	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
hasted	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
fire.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ai	1
looked	1
behind	1
them,	1
they	1
saw,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
flee	1
this	1
way	1
or	1
that	1
way:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
turned	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
pursuers.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
when	1
Joshua	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
ambush	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
ascended,	1
then	1
they	1
turned	1
again,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ai.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
issued	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
against	1
them;	1
so	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Israel,	1
some	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
some	1
on	1
that	1
side:	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
remain	1
or	1
escape.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Ai	1
they	1
took	1
alive,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Joshua.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Israel	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
slaying	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Ai	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
wherein	1
they	1
chased	1
them,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
consumed,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
returned	1
unto	1
Ai,	1
and	1
smote	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
fell	1
that	1
day,	1
both	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
were	1
twelve	1
thousand,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ai.	1
	1
8:26	1
For	1
Joshua	1
drew	1
not	1
his	1
hand	1
back,	1
wherewith	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
the	1
spear,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Ai.	1
	1
8:27	1
Only	1
the	1
cattle	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
Israel	1
took	1
for	1
a	1
prey	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
Joshua.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
Joshua	1
burnt	1
Ai,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
an	1
heap	1
for	1
ever,	1
even	1
a	1
desolation	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Ai	1
he	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree	1
until	1
eventide:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
down,	1
Joshua	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
carcase	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
raise	1
thereon	1
a	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
stones,	1
that	1
remaineth	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
8:30	1
Then	1
Joshua	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
mount	1
Ebal,	1
8:31	1
As	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
an	1
altar	1
of	1
whole	1
stones,	1
over	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
lift	1
up	1
any	1
iron:	1
and	1
they	1
offered	1
thereon	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
there	1
upon	1
the	1
stones	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:33	1
And	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
their	1
elders,	1
and	1
officers,	1
and	1
their	1
judges,	1
stood	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
ark	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
before	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites,	1
which	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
well	1
the	1
stranger,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
among	1
them;	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
over	1
against	1
mount	1
Gerizim,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
over	1
against	1
mount	1
Ebal;	1
as	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
before,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bless	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
afterward	1
he	1
read	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
the	1
blessings	1
and	1
cursings,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
8:35	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
which	1
Joshua	1
read	1
not	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
with	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
were	1
conversant	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
in	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
valleys,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
sea	1
over	1
against	1
Lebanon,	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
the	1
Perizzite,	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusite,	1
heard	1
thereof;	1
9:2	1
That	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
Joshua	1
and	1
with	1
Israel,	1
with	1
one	1
accord.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gibeon	1
heard	1
what	1
Joshua	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
Jericho	1
and	1
to	1
Ai,	1
9:4	1
They	1
did	1
work	1
wilily,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
made	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
ambassadors,	1
and	1
took	1
old	1
sacks	1
upon	1
their	1
asses,	1
and	1
wine	1
bottles,	1
old,	1
and	1
rent,	1
and	1
bound	1
up;	1
9:5	1
And	1
old	1
shoes	1
and	1
clouted	1
upon	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
old	1
garments	1
upon	1
them;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
their	1
provision	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
mouldy.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Joshua	1
unto	1
the	1
camp	1
at	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
We	1
be	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country:	1
now	1
therefore	1
make	1
ye	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
Peradventure	1
ye	1
dwell	1
among	1
us;	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
make	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
you?	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
We	1
are	1
thy	1
servants.	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Who	1
are	1
ye?	1
and	1
from	1
whence	1
come	1
ye?	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
From	1
a	1
very	1
far	1
country	1
thy	1
servants	1
are	1
come	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
9:10	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
that	1
were	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
to	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
to	1
Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Ashtaroth.	1
	1
9:11	1
Wherefore	1
our	1
elders	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
our	1
country	1
spake	1
to	1
us,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
victuals	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
journey,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
We	1
are	1
your	1
servants:	1
therefore	1
now	1
make	1
ye	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
9:12	1
This	1
our	1
bread	1
we	1
took	1
hot	1
for	1
our	1
provision	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
houses	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
go	1
unto	1
you;	1
but	1
now,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
dry,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
mouldy:	1
9:13	1
And	1
these	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine,	1
which	1
we	1
filled,	1
were	1
new;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
be	1
rent:	1
and	1
these	1
our	1
garments	1
and	1
our	1
shoes	1
are	1
become	1
old	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
long	1
journey.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
took	1
of	1
their	1
victuals,	1
and	1
asked	1
not	1
counsel	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
Joshua	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
them,	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
live:	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
sware	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
their	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
dwelt	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
their	1
cities	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
Now	1
their	1
cities	1
were	1
Gibeon,	1
and	1
Chephirah,	1
and	1
Beeroth,	1
and	1
Kirjathjearim.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
smote	1
them	1
not,	1
because	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
had	1
sworn	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
murmured	1
against	1
the	1
princes.	1
	1
9:19	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation,	1
We	1
have	1
sworn	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel:	1
now	1
therefore	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
touch	1
them.	1
	1
9:20	1
This	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
them;	1
we	1
will	1
even	1
let	1
them	1
live,	1
lest	1
wrath	1
be	1
upon	1
us,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
we	1
sware	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
them	1
live;	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
hewers	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
drawers	1
of	1
water	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation;	1
as	1
the	1
princes	1
had	1
promised	1
them.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
Joshua	1
called	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
beguiled	1
us,	1
saying,	1
We	1
are	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
you;	1
when	1
ye	1
dwell	1
among	1
us?	1
	1
9:23	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
cursed,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
freed	1
from	1
being	1
bondmen,	1
and	1
hewers	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
drawers	1
of	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
said,	1
Because	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
told	1
thy	1
servants,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
commanded	1
his	1
servant	1
Moses	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
before	1
you,	1
therefore	1
we	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid	1
of	1
our	1
lives	1
because	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
thine	1
hand:	1
as	1
it	1
seemeth	1
good	1
and	1
right	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
us,	1
do.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
so	1
did	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
slew	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
Joshua	1
made	1
them	1
that	1
day	1
hewers	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
drawers	1
of	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
choose.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Adonizedec	1
king	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
had	1
heard	1
how	1
Joshua	1
had	1
taken	1
Ai,	1
and	1
had	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
it;	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Jericho	1
and	1
her	1
king,	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Ai	1
and	1
her	1
king;	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gibeon	1
had	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
Israel,	1
and	1
were	1
among	1
them;	1
10:2	1
That	1
they	1
feared	1
greatly,	1
because	1
Gibeon	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
city,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
royal	1
cities,	1
and	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
greater	1
than	1
Ai,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
thereof	1
were	1
mighty.	1
	1
10:3	1
Wherefore	1
Adonizedec	1
king	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
sent	1
unto	1
Hoham	1
king	1
of	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
unto	1
Piram	1
king	1
of	1
Jarmuth,	1
and	1
unto	1
Japhia	1
king	1
of	1
Lachish,	1
and	1
unto	1
Debir	1
king	1
of	1
Eglon,	1
saying,	1
10:4	1
Come	1
up	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
help	1
me,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
smite	1
Gibeon:	1
for	1
it	1
hath	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
Joshua	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:5	1
Therefore	1
the	1
five	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Hebron,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Jarmuth,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Lachish,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Eglon,	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
up,	1
they	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
hosts,	1
and	1
encamped	1
before	1
Gibeon,	1
and	1
made	1
war	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gibeon	1
sent	1
unto	1
Joshua	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
saying,	1
Slack	1
not	1
thy	1
hand	1
from	1
thy	1
servants;	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
us	1
quickly,	1
and	1
save	1
us,	1
and	1
help	1
us:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
us.	1
	1
10:7	1
So	1
Joshua	1
ascended	1
from	1
Gilgal,	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
war	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Fear	1
them	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
thine	1
hand;	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
them	1
stand	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
10:9	1
Joshua	1
therefore	1
came	1
unto	1
them	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Gilgal	1
all	1
night.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
discomfited	1
them	1
before	1
Israel,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
at	1
Gibeon,	1
and	1
chased	1
them	1
along	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
goeth	1
up	1
to	1
Bethhoron,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
to	1
Azekah,	1
and	1
unto	1
Makkedah.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
Israel,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
Bethhoron,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
cast	1
down	1
great	1
stones	1
from	1
heaven	1
upon	1
them	1
unto	1
Azekah,	1
and	1
they	1
died:	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
which	1
died	1
with	1
hailstones	1
than	1
they	1
whom	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
slew	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
10:12	1
Then	1
spake	1
Joshua	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
Amorites	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Sun,	1
stand	1
thou	1
still	1
upon	1
Gibeon;	1
and	1
thou,	1
Moon,	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Ajalon.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
the	1
sun	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
stayed,	1
until	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
avenged	1
themselves	1
upon	1
their	1
enemies.	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Jasher?	1
So	1
the	1
sun	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
hasted	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
about	1
a	1
whole	1
day.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
day	1
like	1
that	1
before	1
it	1
or	1
after	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
man:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
fought	1
for	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
Joshua	1
returned,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
unto	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
10:16	1
But	1
these	1
five	1
kings	1
fled,	1
and	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
cave	1
at	1
Makkedah.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
The	1
five	1
kings	1
are	1
found	1
hid	1
in	1
a	1
cave	1
at	1
Makkedah.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said,	1
Roll	1
great	1
stones	1
upon	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
and	1
set	1
men	1
by	1
it	1
for	1
to	1
keep	1
them:	1
10:19	1
And	1
stay	1
ye	1
not,	1
but	1
pursue	1
after	1
your	1
enemies,	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
hindmost	1
of	1
them;	1
suffer	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
their	1
cities:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Joshua	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
slaying	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
slaughter,	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
consumed,	1
that	1
the	1
rest	1
which	1
remained	1
of	1
them	1
entered	1
into	1
fenced	1
cities.	1
	1
10:21	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
Joshua	1
at	1
Makkedah	1
in	1
peace:	1
none	1
moved	1
his	1
tongue	1
against	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:22	1
Then	1
said	1
Joshua,	1
Open	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
and	1
bring	1
out	1
those	1
five	1
kings	1
unto	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cave.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
those	1
five	1
kings	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Hebron,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Jarmuth,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Lachish,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Eglon.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
brought	1
out	1
those	1
kings	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
that	1
Joshua	1
called	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
which	1
went	1
with	1
him,	1
Come	1
near,	1
put	1
your	1
feet	1
upon	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
these	1
kings.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
put	1
their	1
feet	1
upon	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
nor	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
be	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
courage:	1
for	1
thus	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
to	1
all	1
your	1
enemies	1
against	1
whom	1
ye	1
fight.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
afterward	1
Joshua	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
slew	1
them,	1
and	1
hanged	1
them	1
on	1
five	1
trees:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
hanging	1
upon	1
the	1
trees	1
until	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
that	1
Joshua	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
them	1
down	1
off	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
cave	1
wherein	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
hid,	1
and	1
laid	1
great	1
stones	1
in	1
the	1
cave's	1
mouth,	1
which	1
remain	1
until	1
this	1
very	1
day.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
that	1
day	1
Joshua	1
took	1
Makkedah,	1
and	1
smote	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
thereof	1
he	1
utterly	1
destroyed,	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
were	1
therein;	1
he	1
let	1
none	1
remain:	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Makkedah	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Jericho.	1
	1
10:29	1
Then	1
Joshua	1
passed	1
from	1
Makkedah,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
unto	1
Libnah,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
Libnah:	1
10:30	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
it	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
thereof,	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
were	1
therein;	1
he	1
let	1
none	1
remain	1
in	1
it;	1
but	1
did	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
thereof	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Jericho.	1
	1
10:31	1
And	1
Joshua	1
passed	1
from	1
Libnah,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
unto	1
Lachish,	1
and	1
encamped	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
it:	1
10:32	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
Lachish	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
took	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
day,	1
and	1
smote	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
were	1
therein,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Libnah.	1
	1
10:33	1
Then	1
Horam	1
king	1
of	1
Gezer	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
help	1
Lachish;	1
and	1
Joshua	1
smote	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
people,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
none	1
remaining.	1
	1
10:34	1
And	1
from	1
Lachish	1
Joshua	1
passed	1
unto	1
Eglon,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
encamped	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
it:	1
10:35	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
it	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
smote	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
were	1
therein	1
he	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
that	1
day,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Lachish.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
Joshua	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Eglon,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
unto	1
Hebron;	1
and	1
they	1
fought	1
against	1
it:	1
10:37	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
were	1
therein;	1
he	1
left	1
none	1
remaining,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Eglon;	1
but	1
destroyed	1
it	1
utterly,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
were	1
therein.	1
	1
10:38	1
And	1
Joshua	1
returned,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
Debir;	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
it:	1
10:39	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof;	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
were	1
therein;	1
he	1
left	1
none	1
remaining:	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
Debir,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
thereof;	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
also	1
to	1
Libnah,	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
king.	1
	1
10:40	1
So	1
Joshua	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
vale,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
springs,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
kings:	1
he	1
left	1
none	1
remaining,	1
but	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
that	1
breathed,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
commanded.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
Joshua	1
smote	1
them	1
from	1
Kadeshbarnea	1
even	1
unto	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
even	1
unto	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
kings	1
and	1
their	1
land	1
did	1
Joshua	1
take	1
at	1
one	1
time,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
fought	1
for	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:43	1
And	1
Joshua	1
returned,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
unto	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jabin	1
king	1
of	1
Hazor	1
had	1
heard	1
those	1
things,	1
that	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
Jobab	1
king	1
of	1
Madon,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Shimron,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Achshaph,	1
11:2	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
plains	1
south	1
of	1
Chinneroth,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Dor	1
on	1
the	1
west,	1
11:3	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzite,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusite	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Hivite	1
under	1
Hermon	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
they	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
hosts	1
with	1
them,	1
much	1
people,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
shore	1
in	1
multitude,	1
with	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots	1
very	1
many.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
kings	1
were	1
met	1
together,	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
pitched	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Merom,	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
because	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
them	1
up	1
all	1
slain	1
before	1
Israel:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hough	1
their	1
horses,	1
and	1
burn	1
their	1
chariots	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
11:7	1
So	1
Joshua	1
came,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
war	1
with	1
him,	1
against	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Merom	1
suddenly;	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
chased	1
them	1
unto	1
great	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
unto	1
Misrephothmaim,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Mizpeh	1
eastward;	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
them,	1
until	1
they	1
left	1
them	1
none	1
remaining.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
Joshua	1
did	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
bade	1
him:	1
he	1
houghed	1
their	1
horses,	1
and	1
burnt	1
their	1
chariots	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
Joshua	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
took	1
Hazor,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
king	1
thereof	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
for	1
Hazor	1
beforetime	1
was	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
kingdoms.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
were	1
therein	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
utterly	1
destroying	1
them:	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
left	1
to	1
breathe:	1
and	1
he	1
burnt	1
Hazor	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
those	1
kings,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
them,	1
did	1
Joshua	1
take,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
he	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
as	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded.	1
	1
11:13	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
their	1
strength,	1
Israel	1
burned	1
none	1
of	1
them,	1
save	1
Hazor	1
only;	1
that	1
did	1
Joshua	1
burn.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
these	1
cities,	1
and	1
the	1
cattle,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
took	1
for	1
a	1
prey	1
unto	1
themselves;	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
they	1
smote	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
neither	1
left	1
they	1
any	1
to	1
breathe.	1
	1
11:15	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
his	1
servant,	1
so	1
did	1
Moses	1
command	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
Joshua;	1
he	1
left	1
nothing	1
undone	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
11:16	1
So	1
Joshua	1
took	1
all	1
that	1
land,	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
south	1
country,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
and	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
same;	1
11:17	1
Even	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
Halak,	1
that	1
goeth	1
up	1
to	1
Seir,	1
even	1
unto	1
Baalgad	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
under	1
mount	1
Hermon:	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
kings	1
he	1
took,	1
and	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
slew	1
them.	1
	1
11:18	1
Joshua	1
made	1
war	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
all	1
those	1
kings.	1
	1
11:19	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
city	1
that	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
save	1
the	1
Hivites	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gibeon:	1
all	1
other	1
they	1
took	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
11:20	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
against	1
Israel	1
in	1
battle,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
them	1
utterly,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
no	1
favour,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
them,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
came	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
Anakims	1
from	1
the	1
mountains,	1
from	1
Hebron,	1
from	1
Debir,	1
from	1
Anab,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel:	1
Joshua	1
destroyed	1
them	1
utterly	1
with	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
11:22	1
There	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
Anakims	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
only	1
in	1
Gaza,	1
in	1
Gath,	1
and	1
in	1
Ashdod,	1
there	1
remained.	1
	1
11:23	1
So	1
Joshua	1
took	1
the	1
whole	1
land,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses;	1
and	1
Joshua	1
gave	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
Israel	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
divisions	1
by	1
their	1
tribes.	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
rested	1
from	1
war.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
smote,	1
and	1
possessed	1
their	1
land	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan	1
toward	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
Arnon	1
unto	1
mount	1
Hermon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
plain	1
on	1
the	1
east:	1
12:2	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
who	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
ruled	1
from	1
Aroer,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Arnon,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
from	1
half	1
Gilead,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
Jabbok,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon;	1
12:3	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
plain	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Chinneroth	1
on	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
even	1
the	1
salt	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
east,	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Bethjeshimoth;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
south,	1
under	1
Ashdothpisgah:	1
12:4	1
And	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
giants,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Ashtaroth	1
and	1
at	1
Edrei,	1
12:5	1
And	1
reigned	1
in	1
mount	1
Hermon,	1
and	1
in	1
Salcah,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
Bashan,	1
unto	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
Geshurites	1
and	1
the	1
Maachathites,	1
and	1
half	1
Gilead,	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon.	1
	1
12:6	1
Them	1
did	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
smite:	1
and	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
unto	1
the	1
Reubenites,	1
and	1
the	1
Gadites,	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
Joshua	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
smote	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
on	1
the	1
west,	1
from	1
Baalgad	1
in	1
the	1

even	1
unto	1
the	1

Halak,	1
that	1
goeth	1
up	1
to	1

which	1
Joshua	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
divisions;	1

In	1

	1
13:1	1
Now	1
Joshua	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
stricken	1
in	1
years;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
old	1

stricken	1
in	1
years,	1
and	1
there	1
remaineth	1
yet	1
very	1
much	1
land	1
to	1

	1
13:2	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
yet	1
remaineth:	1

13:3	1
From	1

And	1

Baalgad	1
under	1

	1
13:6	1
All	1
the	1

country	1
from	1
Lebanon	1
unto	1
Misrephothmaim,	1

the	1

them	1
will	1
I	1
drive	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
only	1
divide	1
thou	1
it	1
by	1
lot	1
unto	1
the	1
Israelites	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee.	1
	1
13:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
divide	1
this	1
land	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
the	1
nine	1
tribes,	1
and	1
the	1
half	1

of	1
Manasseh,	1
13:8	1
With	1
whom	1
the	1
Reubenites	1
and	1
the	1
Gadites	1
have	1
received	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
which	1
Moses	1
gave	1
them,	1
beyond	1
Jordan	1
eastward,	1
even	1
as	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
them;	1
13:9	1
From	1
Aroer,	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1

13:10	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
reigned	1
in	1
Heshbon,	1
unto	1
the	1

the	1

of	1
Ammon;	1
13:11	1
And	1

and	1
Maachathites,	1
and	1
all	1
mount	1
Hermon,	1
and	1
all	1
Bashan	1
unto	1
Salcah;	1
13:12	1
All	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Og	1
in	1
Bashan,	1
which	1
reigned	1
in	1
Ashtaroth	1
and	1
in	1
Edrei,	1
who	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
giants:	1
for	1
these	1
did	1
Moses	1
smite,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
13:13	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
expelled	1
not	1
the	1
Geshurites,	1
nor	1
the	1
Maachathites:	1
but	1
the	1
Geshurites	1
and	1
the	1
Maachathites	1
dwell	1
among	1
the	1
Israelites	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
13:14	1
Only	1
unto	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Levi	1
he	1
gave	1
none	1
inheritance;	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
are	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
inheritance	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
their	1
coast	1
was	1
from	1
Aroer,	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Arnon,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
plain	1
by	1
Medeba;	1
13:17	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
cities	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
plain;	1
Dibon,	1
and	1
Bamothbaal,	1
and	1
Bethbaalmeon,	1
13:18	1
And	1
Jahaza,	1
and	1
Kedemoth,	1
and	1
Mephaath,	1
13:19	1
And	1
Kirjathaim,	1
and	1
Sibmah,	1
and	1
Zarethshahar	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
13:20	1
And	1
Bethpeor,	1
and	1
Ashdothpisgah,	1
and	1
Bethjeshimoth,	1
13:21	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
reigned	1
in	1
Heshbon,	1
whom	1
Moses	1
smote	1
with	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Evi,	1
and	1
Rekem,	1
and	1
Zur,	1
and	1
Hur,	1
and	1
Reba,	1
which	1
were	1
dukes	1
of	1
Sihon,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
13:22	1
Balaam	1
also	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor,	1
the	1
soothsayer,	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
slay	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
was	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
thereof.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
after	1
their	1
families,	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof.	1
	1
13:24	1
And	1
Moses	1
gave	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Gad,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
their	1
coast	1
was	1
Jazer,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
unto	1
Aroer	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
Rabbah;	1
13:26	1
And	1
from	1
Heshbon	1
unto	1
Ramathmizpeh,	1
and	1
Betonim;	1
and	1
from	1
Mahanaim	1
unto	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Debir;	1
13:27	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
Betharam,	1
and	1
Bethnimrah,	1
and	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
Zaphon,	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
Jordan	1
and	1
his	1
border,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Chinnereth	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan	1
eastward.	1
	1
13:28	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
after	1
their	1
families,	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
their	1
villages.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
gave	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh:	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
by	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
13:30	1
And	1
their	1
coast	1
was	1
from	1
Mahanaim,	1
all	1
Bashan,	1
all	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
towns	1
of	1
Jair,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Bashan,	1
threescore	1
cities:	1
13:31	1
And	1
half	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
Ashtaroth,	1
and	1
Edrei,	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Og	1
in	1
Bashan,	1
were	1
pertaining	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Machir	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Machir	1
by	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
13:32	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
countries	1
which	1
Moses	1
did	1
distribute	1
for	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moab,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
by	1
Jericho,	1
eastward.	1
	1
13:33	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi	1
Moses	1
gave	1
not	1
any	1
inheritance:	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
countries	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
inherited	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
which	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
distributed	1
for	1
inheritance	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
14:2	1
By	1
lot	1
was	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses,	1
for	1
the	1
nine	1
tribes,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
half	1
tribe.	1
	1
14:3	1
For	1
Moses	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
two	1
tribes	1
and	1
an	1
half	1
tribe	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan:	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites	1
he	1
gave	1
none	1
inheritance	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
14:4	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Joseph	1
were	1
two	1
tribes,	1
Manasseh	1
and	1
Ephraim:	1
therefore	1
they	1
gave	1
no	1
part	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
save	1
cities	1
to	1
dwell	1
in,	1
with	1
their	1
suburbs	1
for	1
their	1
cattle	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
substance.	1
	1
14:5	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did,	1
and	1
they	1
divided	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
14:6	1
Then	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
unto	1
Joshua	1
in	1
Gilgal:	1
and	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh	1
the	1
Kenezite	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
concerning	1
me	1
and	1
thee	1
in	1
Kadeshbarnea.	1
	1
14:7	1
Forty	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
I	1
when	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
me	1
from	1
Kadeshbarnea	1
to	1
espy	1
out	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
word	1
again	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
mine	1
heart.	1
	1
14:8	1
Nevertheless	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
me	1
made	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
melt:	1
but	1
I	1
wholly	1
followed	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
sware	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
saying,	1
Surely	1
the	1
land	1
whereon	1
thy	1
feet	1
have	1
trodden	1
shall	1
be	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
thy	1
children's	1
for	1
ever,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
wholly	1
followed	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
kept	1
me	1
alive,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
these	1
forty	1
and	1
five	1
years,	1
even	1
since	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
while	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and	1
now,	1
lo,	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
day	1
fourscore	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old.	1
	1
14:11	1
As	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
strong	1
this	1
day	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Moses	1
sent	1
me:	1
as	1
my	1
strength	1
was	1
then,	1
even	1
so	1
is	1
my	1
strength	1
now,	1
for	1
war,	1
both	1
to	1
go	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
14:12	1
Now	1
therefore	1
give	1
me	1
this	1
mountain,	1
whereof	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
in	1
that	1
day;	1
for	1
thou	1
heardest	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
how	1
the	1
Anakims	1
were	1
there,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
cities	1
were	1
great	1
and	1
fenced:	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
me,	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
drive	1
them	1
out,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
said.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Joshua	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
unto	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh	1
Hebron	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance.	1
	1
14:14	1
Hebron	1
therefore	1
became	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh	1
the	1
Kenezite	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
because	1
that	1
he	1
wholly	1
followed	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Hebron	1
before	1
was	1
Kirjatharba;	1
which	1
Arba	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
among	1
the	1
Anakims.	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
rest	1
from	1
war.	1
	1
15:1	1
This	1
then	1
was	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
by	1
their	1
families;	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Edom	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Zin	1
southward	1
was	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
coast.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
their	1
south	1
border	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
salt	1
sea,	1
from	1
the	1
bay	1
that	1
looketh	1
southward:	1
15:3	1
And	1
it	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
to	1
Maalehacrabbim,	1
and	1
passed	1
along	1
to	1
Zin,	1
and	1
ascended	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
unto	1
Kadeshbarnea,	1
and	1
passed	1
along	1
to	1
Hezron,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Adar,	1
and	1
fetched	1
a	1
compass	1
to	1
Karkaa:	1
15:4	1
From	1
thence	1
it	1
passed	1
toward	1
Azmon,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
the	1
goings	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
coast	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
sea:	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
south	1
coast.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
the	1
east	1
border	1
was	1
the	1
salt	1
sea,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
Jordan.	1
	1
And	1
their	1
border	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
quarter	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
bay	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
at	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
Jordan:	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Bethhogla,	1
and	1
passed	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
Betharabah;	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
stone	1
of	1
Bohan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Reuben:	1
15:7	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
up	1
toward	1
Debir	1
from	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Achor,	1
and	1
so	1
northward,	1
looking	1
toward	1
Gilgal,	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
the	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Adummim,	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river:	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
passed	1
toward	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Enshemesh,	1
and	1
the	1
goings	1
out	1
thereof	1
were	1
at	1
Enrogel:	1
15:8	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom	1
unto	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Jebusite;	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
that	1
lieth	1
before	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Hinnom	1
westward,	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
giants	1
northward:	1
15:9	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
was	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
unto	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Nephtoah,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephron;	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
Baalah,	1
which	1
is	1
Kirjathjearim:	1
15:10	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
compassed	1
from	1
Baalah	1
westward	1
unto	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
and	1
passed	1
along	1
unto	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
mount	1
Jearim,	1
which	1
is	1
Chesalon,	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Bethshemesh,	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
to	1
Timnah:	1
15:11	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Ekron	1
northward:	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
Shicron,	1
and	1
passed	1
along	1
to	1
mount	1
Baalah,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
Jabneel;	1
and	1
the	1
goings	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

were	1

	1
15:12	1
And	1
the	1
west	1
border	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
coast	1
thereof.	1
	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
round	1
about	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
unto	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
part	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Joshua,	1
even	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Arba	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Anak,	1
which	1
city	1
is	1
Hebron.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
Caleb	1
drove	1
thence	1
the	1
three	1
sons	1
of	1
Anak,	1
Sheshai,	1
and	1
Ahiman,	1
and	1
Talmai,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Anak.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
thence	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Debir:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Debir	1
before	1
was	1
Kirjathsepher.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
Caleb	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
smiteth	1
Kirjathsepher,	1
and	1
taketh	1
it,	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
Achsah	1
my	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
Othniel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kenaz,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Caleb,	1
took	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
Achsah	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
that	1
she	1
moved	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
a	1
field:	1
and	1
she	1
lighted	1
off	1
her	1
ass;	1
and	1
Caleb	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
wouldest	1
thou?	1
	1
15:19	1
Who	1
answered,	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
blessing;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
south	1
land;	1
give	1
me	1
also	1
springs	1
of	1
water.	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
upper	1
springs,	1
and	1
the	1
nether	1
springs.	1
	1
15:20	1
This	1

the	1

the	1

	1
15:63	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
Jebusites	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
them	1
out;	1
but	1
the	1
Jebusites	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Joseph	1
fell	1
from	1
Jordan	1
by	1
Jericho,	1
unto	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Jericho	1
on	1
the	1
east,	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
goeth	1
up	1
from	1
Jericho	1
throughout	1
mount	1
Bethel,	1
16:2	1
And	1
goeth	1
out	1
from	1
Bethel	1
to	1
Luz,	1
and	1
passeth	1
along	1
unto	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Archi	1
to	1
Ataroth,	1
16:3	1
And	1
goeth	1
down	1
westward	1
to	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Japhleti,	1
unto	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Bethhoron	1
the	1
nether,	1
and	1
to	1
Gezer;	1
and	1
the	1
goings	1
out	1
thereof	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
16:4	1
So	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
Manasseh	1
and	1
Ephraim,	1
took	1
their	1
inheritance.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families	1
was	1
thus:	1
even	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
was	1
Atarothaddar,	1
unto	1
Bethhoron	1
the	1
upper;	1
16:6	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
out	1
toward	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
Michmethah	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side;	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
about	1
eastward	1
unto	1
Taanathshiloh,	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
Janohah;	1
16:7	1
And	1
it	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
Janohah	1
to	1
Ataroth,	1
and	1
to	1
Naarath,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jericho,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
Jordan.	1
	1
16:8	1
The	1
border	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Tappuah	1
westward	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
Kanah;	1
and	1
the	1
goings	1
out	1
thereof	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
sea.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
by	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
the	1
separate	1
cities	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
with	1
their	1
villages.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
they	1
drave	1
not	1
out	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Gezer:	1
but	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
dwell	1
among	1
the	1
Ephraimites	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
serve	1
under	1
tribute.	1
	1
17:1	1
There	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
lot	1
for	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Joseph;	1
to	1
wit,	1
for	1
Machir	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Gilead:	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war,	1
therefore	1
he	1
had	1
Gilead	1
and	1
Bashan.	1
	1
17:2	1
There	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
lot	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
by	1
their	1
families;	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Abiezer,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Helek,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Asriel,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Hepher,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Shemida:	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
male	1
children	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph	1
by	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
17:3	1
But	1
Zelophehad,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hepher,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Machir,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
had	1
no	1
sons,	1
but	1
daughters:	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
daughters,	1
Mahlah,	1
and	1
Noah,	1
Hoglah,	1
Milcah,	1
and	1
Tirzah.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
near	1
before	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
before	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
princes,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
our	1
brethren.	1
Therefore	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
their	1
father.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
there	1
fell	1
ten	1
portions	1
to	1
Manasseh,	1
beside	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead	1
and	1
Bashan,	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan;	1
17:6	1
Because	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
had	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
his	1
sons:	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Manasseh's	1
sons	1
had	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
was	1
from	1
Asher	1
to	1
Michmethah,	1
that	1
lieth	1
before	1
Shechem;	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
along	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Entappuah.	1
	1
17:8	1
Now	1
Manasseh	1
had	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Tappuah:	1
but	1
Tappuah	1
on	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ephraim;	1
17:9	1
And	1
the	1
coast	1
descended	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
Kanah,	1
southward	1
of	1
the	1
river:	1
these	1
cities	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Manasseh:	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
also	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
outgoings	1
of	1
it	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
sea:	1
17:10	1
Southward	1
it	1
was	1
Ephraim's,	1
and	1
northward	1
it	1
was	1
Manasseh's,	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
is	1
his	1
border;	1
and	1
they	1
met	1
together	1
in	1
Asher	1
on	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
in	1
Issachar	1
on	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
Manasseh	1
had	1
in	1
Issachar	1
and	1
in	1
Asher	1
Bethshean	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
Ibleam	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Dor	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Endor	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Taanach	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Megiddo	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
even	1
three	1
countries.	1
	1
17:12	1
Yet	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
those	1
cities;	1
but	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
would	1
dwell	1
in	1
that	1
land.	1
	1
17:13	1
Yet	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
waxen	1
strong,	1
that	1
they	1
put	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
to	1
tribute,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
utterly	1
drive	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Joseph	1
spake	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
given	1
me	1
but	1
one	1
lot	1
and	1
one	1
portion	1
to	1
inherit,	1
seeing	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
great	1
people,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
me	1
hitherto?	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
Joshua	1
answered	1
them,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
people,	1
then	1
get	1
thee	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
wood	1
country,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
for	1
thyself	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Perizzites	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
giants,	1
if	1
mount	1
Ephraim	1
be	1
too	1
narrow	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Joseph	1
said,	1
The	1
hill	1
is	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
us:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
have	1
chariots	1
of	1
iron,	1
both	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
Bethshean	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
Joshua	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
even	1
to	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
to	1
Manasseh,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
great	1
people,	1
and	1
hast	1
great	1
power:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
have	1
one	1
lot	1
only:	1
17:18	1
But	1
the	1
mountain	1
shall	1
be	1
thine;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
wood,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
it	1
down:	1
and	1
the	1
outgoings	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
thine:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
iron	1
chariots,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
assembled	1
together	1
at	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
there.	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
subdued	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
there	1
remained	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
seven	1
tribes,	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
received	1
their	1
inheritance.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
How	1
long	1
are	1
ye	1
slack	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
hath	1
given	1
you?	1
	1
18:4	1
Give	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
three	1
men	1
for	1
each	1
tribe:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
rise,	1
and	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
describe	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
divide	1
it	1
into	1
seven	1
parts:	1
Judah	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
their	1
coast	1
on	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
their	1
coasts	1
on	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
18:6	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
describe	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
seven	1
parts,	1
and	1
bring	1
the	1
description	1
hither	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
you	1
here	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
18:7	1
But	1
the	1
Levites	1
have	1
no	1
part	1
among	1
you;	1
for	1
the	1
priesthood	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
their	1
inheritance:	1
and	1
Gad,	1
and	1
Reuben,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
have	1
received	1
their	1
inheritance	1
beyond	1
Jordan	1
on	1
the	1
east,	1
which	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
them.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
away:	1
and	1
Joshua	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
land,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
describe	1
it,	1
and	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
here	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Shiloh.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
described	1
it	1
by	1
cities	1
into	1
seven	1
parts	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
Joshua	1
to	1
the	1
host	1
at	1
Shiloh.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
Joshua	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
Shiloh	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
there	1
Joshua	1
divided	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
divisions.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
came	1
up	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families:	1
and	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
their	1
lot	1
came	1
forth	1
between	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
their	1
border	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
was	1
from	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

of	1
Jericho	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
through	1
the	1
mountains	1
westward;	1
and	1
the	1
goings	1
out	1
thereof	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Bethaven.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
went	1
over	1
from	1
thence	1
toward	1
Luz,	1
to	1
the	1

of	1
Luz,	1
which	1

the	1

that	1
lieth	1
on	1

	1
18:14	1
And	1

and	1
the	1

Kirjathbaal,	1
which	1
is	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah:	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
west	1
quarter.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
the	1
south	1
quarter	1
was	1
from	1
the	1

of	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
and	1
the	1

and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1

of	1
Nephtoah:	1
18:16	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
that	1
lieth	1
before	1
the	1

and	1
which	1

18:17	1
And	1

and	1
went	1

toward	1
Geliloth,	1
which	1
is	1

descended	1
to	1
the	1

18:18	1
And	1

and	1
went	1

18:19	1
And	1
the	1

	1
18:20	1
And	1
Jordan	1

This	1

their	1

the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
Judah	1
was	1
too	1
much	1

therefore	1
the	1

the	1
coast	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
went	1
out	1
too	1
little	1
for	1
them:	1
therefore	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
went	1
up	1

fight	1
against	1
Leshem,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
it	1
with	1
the	1

Dan,	1
after	1
the	1

	1
19:48	1
This	1

the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families,	1
these	1
cities	1
with	1
their	1
villages.	1
	1
19:49	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
dividing	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
inheritance	1
by	1
their	1
coasts,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
gave	1
an	1
inheritance	1
to	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun	1
among	1
them:	1
19:50	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
he	1
asked,	1
even	1
Timnathserah	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim:	1
and	1
he	1
built	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
therein.	1
	1
19:51	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
inheritances,	1
which	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
divided	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
by	1
lot	1
in	1
Shiloh	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
So	1
they	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
dividing	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
20:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
spake	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
20:2	1
Speak	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Appoint	1
out	1
for	1
you	1
cities	1
of	1
refuge,	1
whereof	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses:	1
20:3	1
That	1
the	1
slayer	1
that	1
killeth	1
any	1
person	1
unawares	1
and	1
unwittingly	1
may	1
flee	1
thither:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
refuge	1
from	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
that	1
doth	1
flee	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
cities	1
shall	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
cause	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
that	1
city,	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
place,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
dwell	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
blood	1
pursue	1
after	1
him,	1
then	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
deliver	1
the	1
slayer	1
up	1
into	1
his	1
hand;	1
because	1
he	1
smote	1
his	1
neighbour	1
unwittingly,	1
and	1
hated	1
him	1
not	1
beforetime.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
that	1
city,	1
until	1
he	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
congregation	1
for	1
judgment,	1
and	1
until	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
those	1
days:	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
slayer	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
city,	1
and	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
fled.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
they	1
appointed	1
Kedesh	1
in	1
Galilee	1
in	1
mount	1
Naphtali,	1
and	1
Shechem	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
Kirjatharba,	1
which	1
is	1
Hebron,	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan	1
by	1
Jericho	1
eastward,	1
they	1
assigned	1
Bezer	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
upon	1
the	1
plain	1
out	1

the	1

These	1
were	1
the	1
cities	1
appointed	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
them,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
killeth	1
any	1
person	1
at	1
unawares	1
might	1
flee	1
thither,	1
and	1
not	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
blood,	1
until	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
21:1	1
Then	1
came	1
near	1

21:2	1
And	1
they	1

at	1
Shiloh	1
in	1
the	1

of	1

saying,	1
The	1

remaining	1

the	1
Levites,	1
were	1
by	1
their	1
lot	1
twelve	1
cities.	1
	1
21:41	1
All	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
within	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
forty	1
and	1
eight	1
cities	1
with	1
their	1
suburbs.	1
	1
21:42	1
These	1
cities	1
were	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
their	1
suburbs	1
round	1
about	1
them:	1
thus	1
were	1
all	1
these	1
cities.	1
	1
21:43	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
unto	1
Israel	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers;	1
and	1
they	1
possessed	1
it,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
therein.	1
	1
21:44	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
them	1
rest	1
round	1
about,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers:	1
and	1
there	1
stood	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
enemies	1
before	1
them;	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
all	1
their	1
enemies	1
into	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
21:45	1
There	1
failed	1
not	1
ought	1
of	1
any	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
all	1
came	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
22:1	1
Then	1
Joshua	1
called	1
the	1
Reubenites,	1
and	1
the	1
Gadites,	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
22:2	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
kept	1
all	1
that	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
commanded	1
you:	1
22:3	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
left	1
your	1
brethren	1
these	1
many	1
days	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
but	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
rest	1
unto	1
your	1
brethren,	1
as	1
he	1
promised	1
them:	1
therefore	1
now	1
return	1
ye,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
unto	1
your	1
tents,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
possession,	1
which	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan.	1
	1
22:5	1
But	1
take	1
diligent	1
heed	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
commandment	1
and	1
the	1
law,	1
which	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
charged	1
you,	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
to	1
cleave	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
soul.	1
	1
22:6	1
So	1
Joshua	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
away:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
unto	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
22:7	1
Now	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
Moses	1
had	1
given	1
possession	1
in	1
Bashan:	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
thereof	1
gave	1
Joshua	1
among	1
their	1
brethren	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
westward.	1
And	1
when	1
Joshua	1
sent	1
them	1
away	1
also	1
unto	1
their	1
tents,	1
then	1
he	1
blessed	1
them,	1
22:8	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Return	1
with	1
much	1
riches	1
unto	1
your	1
tents,	1
and	1
with	1
very	1
much	1
cattle,	1
with	1
silver,	1
and	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
with	1
brass,	1
and	1
with	1
iron,	1
and	1
with	1
very	1
much	1
raiment:	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
with	1
your	1
brethren.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
returned,	1
and	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Shiloh,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
to	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
possession,	1
whereof	1
they	1
were	1
possessed,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
by	1
Jordan,	1
a	1
great	1
altar	1
to	1
see	1
to.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
heard	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
have	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
at	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
at	1
Shiloh,	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
Phinehas	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
22:14	1
And	1
with	1
him	1
ten	1
princes,	1
of	1
each	1
chief	1
house	1
a	1
prince	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
each	1
one	1
was	1
an	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
among	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
with	1
them,	1
saying,	1
22:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
What	1
trespass	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
committed	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
builded	1
you	1
an	1
altar,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
rebel	1
this	1
day	1
against	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
22:17	1
Is	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Peor	1
too	1
little	1
for	1
us,	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
cleansed	1
until	1
this	1
day,	1
although	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
plague	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
22:18	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
turn	1
away	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD?	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
rebel	1
to	1
day	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
to	1
morrow	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:19	1
Notwithstanding,	1
if	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
possession	1
be	1
unclean,	1
then	1
pass	1
ye	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
wherein	1
the	1
LORD's	1
tabernacle	1
dwelleth,	1
and	1
take	1
possession	1
among	1
us:	1
but	1
rebel	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
rebel	1
against	1
us,	1
in	1
building	1
you	1
an	1
altar	1
beside	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
22:20	1
Did	1
not	1
Achan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zerah	1
commit	1
a	1
trespass	1
in	1
the	1
accursed	1
thing,	1
and	1
wrath	1
fell	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel?	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
perished	1
not	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
22:21	1
Then	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
answered,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Israel,	1
22:22	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
he	1
knoweth,	1
and	1
Israel	1
he	1
shall	1
know;	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
rebellion,	1
or	1
if	1
in	1
transgression	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
(save	1
us	1
not	1
this	1
day,)	1
22:23	1
That	1
we	1
have	1
built	1
us	1
an	1
altar	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD,	1
or	1
if	1
to	1
offer	1
thereon	1
burnt	1
offering	1
or	1
meat	1
offering,	1
or	1
if	1
to	1
offer	1
peace	1
offerings	1
thereon,	1
let	1
the	1
LORD	1
himself	1
require	1
it;	1
22:24	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
rather	1
done	1
it	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
this	1
thing,	1
saying,	1
In	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
your	1
children	1
might	1
speak	1
unto	1
our	1
children,	1
saying,	1
What	1
have	1
ye	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
22:25	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
Jordan	1
a	1
border	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
you,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
Gad;	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
so	1
shall	1
your	1
children	1
make	1
our	1
children	1
cease	1
from	1
fearing	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:26	1
Therefore	1
we	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
prepare	1
to	1
build	1
us	1
an	1
altar,	1
not	1
for	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
nor	1
for	1
sacrifice:	1
22:27	1
But	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
between	1
us,	1
and	1
you,	1
and	1
our	1
generations	1
after	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
our	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
peace	1
offerings;	1
that	1
your	1
children	1
may	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
our	1
children	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
Ye	1
have	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:28	1
Therefore	1
said	1
we,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
so	1
say	1
to	1
us	1
or	1
to	1
our	1
generations	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
say	1
again,	1
Behold	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
our	1
fathers	1
made,	1
not	1
for	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
nor	1
for	1
sacrifices;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
witness	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
you.	1
	1
22:29	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
rebel	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
turn	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
altar	1
for	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
for	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
or	1
for	1
sacrifices,	1
beside	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
his	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
22:30	1
And	1
when	1
Phinehas	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Israel	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
spake,	1
it	1
pleased	1
them.	1
	1
22:31	1
And	1
Phinehas	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
This	1
day	1
we	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
among	1
us,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
committed	1
this	1
trespass	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
now	1
ye	1
have	1
delivered	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:32	1
And	1
Phinehas	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
princes,	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
word	1
again.	1
	1
22:33	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
pleased	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
blessed	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
battle,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
Gad	1
dwelt.	1
	1
22:34	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Reuben	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
called	1
the	1
altar	1
Ed:	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
between	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
given	1
rest	1
unto	1
Israel	1
from	1
all	1
their	1
enemies	1
round	1
about,	1
that	1
Joshua	1
waxed	1
old	1
and	1
stricken	1
in	1
age.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
Joshua	1
called	1
for	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
elders,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
judges,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
officers,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
old	1
and	1
stricken	1
in	1
age:	1
23:3	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
done	1
unto	1
all	1
these	1
nations	1
because	1
of	1
you;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
fought	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
23:4	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
divided	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
lot	1
these	1
nations	1
that	1
remain,	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
inheritance	1
for	1
your	1
tribes,	1
from	1
Jordan,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
cut	1
off,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
sea	1
westward.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
he	1
shall	1
expel	1
them	1
from	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
drive	1
them	1
from	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
sight;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
possess	1
their	1
land,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
promised	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
23:6	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
very	1
courageous	1
to	1
keep	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
that	1
ye	1
turn	1
not	1
aside	1
therefrom	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left;	1
23:7	1
That	1
ye	1
come	1
not	1
among	1
these	1
nations,	1
these	1
that	1
remain	1
among	1
you;	1
neither	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
their	1
gods,	1
nor	1
cause	1
to	1
swear	1
by	1
them,	1
neither	1
serve	1
them,	1
nor	1
bow	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
them:	1
23:8	1
But	1
cleave	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
23:9	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
driven	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
you	1
great	1
nations	1
and	1
strong:	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
you	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
23:10	1
One	1
man	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
chase	1
a	1
thousand:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
fighteth	1
for	1
you,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
you.	1
	1
23:11	1
Take	1
good	1
heed	1
therefore	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
23:12	1
Else	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
go	1
back,	1
and	1
cleave	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
these	1
nations,	1
even	1
these	1
that	1
remain	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
marriages	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
to	1
you:	1
23:13	1
Know	1
for	1
a	1
certainty	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
drive	1
out	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
nations	1
from	1
before	1
you;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
snares	1
and	1
traps	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
scourges	1
in	1
your	1
sides,	1
and	1
thorns	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
until	1
ye	1
perish	1
from	1
off	1
this	1
good	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
you.	1
	1
23:14	1
And,	1
behold,	1
this	1
day	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
souls,	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
thing	1
hath	1
failed	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
spake	1
concerning	1
you;	1
all	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
thing	1
hath	1
failed	1
thereof.	1
	1
23:15	1
Therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
all	1
good	1
things	1
are	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
promised	1
you;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
bring	1
upon	1
you	1
all	1
evil	1
things,	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
destroyed	1
you	1
from	1
off	1
this	1
good	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
you.	1
	1
23:16	1
When	1
ye	1
have	1
transgressed	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
gone	1
and	1
served	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
bowed	1
yourselves	1
to	1
them;	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
kindled	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
perish	1
quickly	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
good	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
Joshua	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
judges,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
officers;	1
and	1
they	1
presented	1
themselves	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Your	1
fathers	1
dwelt	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
flood	1
in	1
old	1
time,	1
even	1
Terah,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Nachor:	1
and	1
they	1
served	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
your	1
father	1
Abraham	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
flood,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
multiplied	1
his	1
seed,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
Isaac.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
unto	1
Isaac	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Esau:	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
unto	1
Esau	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
to	1
possess	1
it;	1
but	1
Jacob	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
24:5	1
I	1
sent	1
Moses	1
also	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
I	1
plagued	1
Egypt,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
among	1
them:	1
and	1
afterward	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
out.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
I	1
brought	1
your	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
ye	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
pursued	1
after	1
your	1
fathers	1
with	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen	1
unto	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
24:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
put	1
darkness	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
sea	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
covered	1
them;	1
and	1
your	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
ye	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
a	1
long	1
season.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
they	1
fought	1
with	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
into	1
your	1
hand,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
possess	1
their	1
land;	1
and	1
I	1
destroyed	1
them	1
from	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
24:9	1
Then	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor,	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
arose	1
and	1
warred	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
to	1
curse	1
you:	1
24:10	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
Balaam;	1
therefore	1
he	1
blessed	1
you	1
still:	1
so	1
I	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
you	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Jericho:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jericho	1
fought	1
against	1
you,	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Girgashites,	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites;	1
and	1
I	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
I	1
sent	1
the	1
hornet	1
before	1
you,	1
which	1
drave	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
you,	1
even	1
the	1
two	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites;	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
thy	1
sword,	1
nor	1
with	1
thy	1
bow.	1
	1
24:13	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
a	1
land	1
for	1
which	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
labour,	1
and	1
cities	1
which	1
ye	1
built	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
dwell	1
in	1
them;	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards	1
and	1
oliveyards	1
which	1
ye	1
planted	1
not	1
do	1
ye	1
eat.	1
	1
24:14	1
Now	1
therefore	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
in	1
sincerity	1
and	1
in	1
truth:	1
and	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
gods	1
which	1
your	1
fathers	1
served	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
flood,	1
and	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
serve	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
seem	1
evil	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD,	1
choose	1
you	1
this	1
day	1
whom	1
ye	1
will	1
serve;	1
whether	1
the	1
gods	1
which	1
your	1
fathers	1
served	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
flood,	1
or	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
in	1
whose	1
land	1
ye	1
dwell:	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
house,	1
we	1
will	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
forsake	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
serve	1
other	1
gods;	1
24:17	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage,	1
and	1
which	1
did	1
those	1
great	1
signs	1
in	1
our	1
sight,	1
and	1
preserved	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
wherein	1
we	1
went,	1
and	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
through	1
whom	1
we	1
passed:	1
24:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
drave	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
the	1
Amorites	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
therefore	1
will	1
we	1
also	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
holy	1
God;	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
jealous	1
God;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
forgive	1
your	1
transgressions	1
nor	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
24:20	1
If	1
ye	1
forsake	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
serve	1
strange	1
gods,	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
turn	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
hurt,	1
and	1
consume	1
you,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
you	1
good.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
are	1
witnesses	1
against	1
yourselves	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
chosen	1
you	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
serve	1
him.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
24:23	1
Now	1
therefore	1
put	1
away,	1
said	1
he,	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
incline	1
your	1
heart	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
The	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
will	1
we	1
serve,	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
will	1
we	1
obey.	1
	1
24:25	1
So	1
Joshua	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
a	1
statute	1
and	1
an	1
ordinance	1
in	1
Shechem.	1
	1
24:26	1
And	1
Joshua	1
wrote	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
great	1
stone,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
there	1
under	1
an	1
oak,	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:27	1
And	1
Joshua	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
us;	1
for	1
it	1
hath	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
us:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
therefore	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
you,	1
lest	1
ye	1
deny	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
24:28	1
So	1
Joshua	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
depart,	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
24:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
died,	1
being	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
ten	1
years	1
old.	1
	1
24:30	1
And	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
in	1
Timnathserah,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Gaash.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
Israel	1
served	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
that	1
overlived	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
known	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
Israel.	1
	1
24:32	1
And	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
brought	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
buried	1
they	1
in	1
Shechem,	1
in	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
ground	1
which	1
Jacob	1
bought	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Hamor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Shechem	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver:	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
24:33	1
And	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
died;	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
hill	1
that	1
pertained	1
to	1
Phinehas	1
his	1
son,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Judges	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Joshua	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
asked	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
for	1
us	1
against	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
first,	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
them?	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Judah	1
shall	1
go	1
up:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
Judah	1
said	1
unto	1
Simeon	1
his	1
brother,	1
Come	1
up	1
with	1
me	1
into	1
my	1
lot,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
Canaanites;	1
and	1
I	1
likewise	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
thee	1
into	1
thy	1
lot.	1
So	1
Simeon	1
went	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
Judah	1
went	1
up;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites	1
into	1
their	1
hand:	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
Bezek	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
Adonibezek	1
in	1
Bezek:	1
and	1
they	1
fought	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites.	1
	1
1:6	1
But	1
Adonibezek	1
fled;	1
and	1
they	1
pursued	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
thumbs	1
and	1
his	1
great	1
toes.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
Adonibezek	1
said,	1
Threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
kings,	1
having	1
their	1
thumbs	1
and	1
their	1
great	1
toes	1
cut	1
off,	1
gathered	1
their	1
meat	1
under	1
my	1
table:	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done,	1
so	1
God	1
hath	1
requited	1
me.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
1:8	1
Now	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
fought	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
it,	1
and	1
smitten	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
fire.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
afterward	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
Judah	1
went	1
against	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Hebron:	1
(now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Hebron	1
before	1
was	1
Kirjatharba:)	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
Sheshai,	1
and	1
Ahiman,	1
and	1
Talmai.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
he	1
went	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Debir:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Debir	1
before	1
was	1
Kirjathsepher:	1
1:12	1
And	1
Caleb	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
smiteth	1
Kirjathsepher,	1
and	1
taketh	1
it,	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
Achsah	1
my	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
Othniel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kenaz,	1
Caleb's	1
younger	1
brother,	1
took	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
Achsah	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
she	1
moved	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
a	1
field:	1
and	1
she	1
lighted	1
from	1
off	1
her	1
ass;	1
and	1
Caleb	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou?	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
blessing:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
south	1
land;	1
give	1
me	1
also	1
springs	1
of	1
water.	1
And	1
Caleb	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
upper	1
springs	1
and	1
the	1
nether	1
springs.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Kenite,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
palm	1
trees	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
lieth	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Arad;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
dwelt	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
Judah	1
went	1
with	1
Simeon	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
that	1
inhabited	1
Zephath,	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
it.	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
called	1
Hormah.	1
	1
1:18	1
Also	1
Judah	1
took	1
Gaza	1
with	1
the	1
coast	1
thereof,	1
and	1
Askelon	1
with	1
the	1
coast	1
thereof,	1
and	1
Ekron	1
with	1
the	1
coast	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
Judah;	1
and	1
he	1
drave	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
mountain;	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
chariots	1
of	1
iron.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
Hebron	1
unto	1
Caleb,	1
as	1
Moses	1
said:	1
and	1
he	1
expelled	1
thence	1
the	1
three	1
sons	1
of	1
Anak.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
did	1
not	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
Jebusites	1
that	1
inhabited	1
Jerusalem;	1
but	1
the	1
Jebusites	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
they	1
also	1
went	1
up	1
against	1
Bethel:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
sent	1
to	1
descry	1
Bethel.	1
(Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
before	1
was	1
Luz.)	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
the	1
spies	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Shew	1
us,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
the	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
mercy.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
shewed	1
them	1
the	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
they	1
smote	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
but	1
they	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
family.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
thereof	1
Luz:	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
thereof	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
1:27	1
Neither	1
did	1
Manasseh	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Bethshean	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
nor	1
Taanach	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
nor	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Dor	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
nor	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Ibleam	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
nor	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Megiddo	1
and	1
her	1
towns:	1
but	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
would	1
dwell	1
in	1
that	1
land.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Israel	1
was	1
strong,	1
that	1
they	1
put	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
to	1
tribute,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
utterly	1
drive	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
1:29	1
Neither	1
did	1
Ephraim	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Gezer;	1
but	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Gezer	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
1:30	1
Neither	1
did	1
Zebulun	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Kitron,	1
nor	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Nahalol;	1
but	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
dwelt	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
became	1
tributaries.	1
	1
1:31	1
Neither	1
did	1
Asher	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Accho,	1
nor	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
nor	1
of	1
Ahlab,	1
nor	1
of	1
Achzib,	1
nor	1
of	1
Helbah,	1
nor	1
of	1
Aphik,	1
nor	1
of	1
Rehob:	1
1:32	1
But	1
the	1
Asherites	1
dwelt	1
among	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
drive	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
1:33	1
Neither	1
did	1
Naphtali	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Bethshemesh,	1
nor	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Bethanath;	1
but	1
he	1
dwelt	1
among	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Bethshemesh	1
and	1
of	1
Bethanath	1
became	1
tributaries	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:34	1
And	1
the	1
Amorites	1
forced	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
into	1
the	1
mountain:	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
valley:	1
1:35	1
But	1
the	1
Amorites	1
would	1
dwell	1
in	1
mount	1
Heres	1
in	1
Aijalon,	1
and	1
in	1
Shaalbim:	1
yet	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
prevailed,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
became	1
tributaries.	1
	1
1:36	1
And	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Akrabbim,	1
from	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
upward.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
Gilgal	1
to	1
Bochim,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
made	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers;	1
and	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
break	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
make	1
no	1
league	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
land;	1
ye	1
shall	1
throw	1
down	1
their	1
altars:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice:	1
why	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
this?	1
	1
2:3	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
also	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
you;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
thorns	1
in	1
your	1
sides,	1
and	1
their	1
gods	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Bochim:	1
and	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
there	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
when	1
Joshua	1
had	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
inheritance	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
served	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Joshua,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
that	1
outlived	1
Joshua,	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
for	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
died,	1
being	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
ten	1
years	1
old.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
in	1
Timnathheres,	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
Gaash.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
also	1
all	1
that	1
generation	1
were	1
gathered	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers:	1
and	1
there	1
arose	1
another	1
generation	1
after	1
them,	1
which	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
served	1
Baalim:	1
2:12	1
And	1
they	1
forsook	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
which	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
followed	1
other	1
gods,	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
round	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
bowed	1
themselves	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
provoked	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
they	1
forsook	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
served	1
Baal	1
and	1
Ashtaroth.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
hot	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
spoilers	1
that	1
spoiled	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
sold	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
round	1
about,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
any	1
longer	1
stand	1
before	1
their	1
enemies.	1
	1
2:15	1
Whithersoever	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
against	1
them	1
for	1
evil,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
sworn	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
greatly	1
distressed.	1
	1
2:16	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
LORD	1
raised	1
up	1
judges,	1
which	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
spoiled	1
them.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
yet	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
their	1
judges,	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
bowed	1
themselves	1
unto	1
them:	1
they	1
turned	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
their	1
fathers	1
walked	1
in,	1
obeying	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
so.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
raised	1
them	1
up	1
judges,	1
then	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
judge:	1
for	1
it	1
repented	1
the	1
LORD	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
groanings	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
oppressed	1
them	1
and	1
vexed	1
them.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
judge	1
was	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
returned,	1
and	1
corrupted	1
themselves	1
more	1
than	1
their	1
fathers,	1
in	1
following	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
unto	1
them;	1
they	1
ceased	1
not	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
doings,	1
nor	1
from	1
their	1
stubborn	1
way.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
hot	1
against	1
Israel;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Because	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
hath	1
transgressed	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
my	1
voice;	1
2:21	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
not	1
henceforth	1
drive	1
out	1
any	1
from	1
before	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
Joshua	1
left	1
when	1
he	1
died:	1
2:22	1
That	1
through	1
them	1
I	1
may	1
prove	1
Israel,	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
walk	1
therein,	1
as	1
their	1
fathers	1
did	1
keep	1
it,	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
2:23	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
left	1
those	1
nations,	1
without	1
driving	1
them	1
out	1
hastily;	1
neither	1
delivered	1
he	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Joshua.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
left,	1
to	1
prove	1
Israel	1
by	1
them,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
Israel	1
as	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
all	1
the	1
wars	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
3:2	1
Only	1
that	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
might	1
know,	1
to	1
teach	1
them	1
war,	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
such	1
as	1
before	1
knew	1
nothing	1
thereof;	1
3:3	1
Namely,	1
five	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Sidonians,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
mount	1
Lebanon,	1
from	1
mount	1
Baalhermon	1
unto	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
Hamath.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
prove	1
Israel	1
by	1
them,	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
their	1
fathers	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
among	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
Jebusites:	1
3:6	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
daughters	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
gave	1
their	1
daughters	1
to	1
their	1
sons,	1
and	1
served	1
their	1
gods.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
forgat	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
served	1
Baalim	1
and	1
the	1
groves.	1
	1
3:8	1
Therefore	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
hot	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
sold	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Chushanrishathaim	1
king	1
of	1
Mesopotamia:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
served	1
Chushanrishathaim	1
eight	1
years.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
LORD	1
raised	1
up	1
a	1
deliverer	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
delivered	1
them,	1
even	1
Othniel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kenaz,	1
Caleb's	1
younger	1
brother.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
war:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
Chushanrishathaim	1
king	1
of	1
Mesopotamia	1
into	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
prevailed	1
against	1
Chushanrishathaim.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
rest	1
forty	1
years.	1
And	1
Othniel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kenaz	1
died.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
strengthened	1
Eglon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
against	1
Israel,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
smote	1
Israel,	1
and	1
possessed	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
palm	1
trees.	1
	1
3:14	1
So	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
served	1
Eglon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
eighteen	1
years.	1
	1
3:15	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
LORD	1
raised	1
them	1
up	1
a	1
deliverer,	1
Ehud	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gera,	1
a	1
Benjamite,	1
a	1
man	1
lefthanded:	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
sent	1
a	1
present	1
unto	1
Eglon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
3:16	1
But	1
Ehud	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
dagger	1
which	1
had	1
two	1
edges,	1
of	1
a	1
cubit	1
length;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
gird	1
it	1
under	1
his	1
raiment	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
thigh.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
present	1
unto	1
Eglon	1
king	1
of	1
Moab:	1
and	1
Eglon	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
fat	1
man.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
present,	1
he	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
present.	1
	1
3:19	1
But	1
he	1
himself	1
turned	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
quarries	1
that	1
were	1
by	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
secret	1
errand	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
king:	1
who	1
said,	1
Keep	1
silence.	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
Ehud	1
came	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
summer	1
parlour,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
himself	1
alone.	1
And	1
Ehud	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
God	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
seat.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
Ehud	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
dagger	1
from	1
his	1
right	1
thigh,	1
and	1
thrust	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
belly:	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
haft	1
also	1
went	1
in	1
after	1
the	1
blade;	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
closed	1
upon	1
the	1
blade,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
the	1
dagger	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
belly;	1
and	1
the	1
dirt	1
came	1
out.	1
	1
3:23	1
Then	1
Ehud	1
went	1
forth	1
through	1
the	1
porch,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
parlour	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
locked	1
them.	1
	1
3:24	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out,	1
his	1
servants	1
came;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that,	1
behold,	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
parlour	1
were	1
locked,	1
they	1
said,	1
Surely	1
he	1
covereth	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
his	1
summer	1
chamber.	1
	1
3:25	1
And	1
they	1
tarried	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
ashamed:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
opened	1
not	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
parlour;	1
therefore	1
they	1
took	1
a	1
key,	1
and	1
opened	1
them:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
their	1
lord	1
was	1
fallen	1
down	1
dead	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
Ehud	1
escaped	1
while	1
they	1
tarried,	1
and	1
passed	1
beyond	1
the	1
quarries,	1
and	1
escaped	1
unto	1
Seirath.	1
	1
3:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
that	1
he	1
blew	1
a	1
trumpet	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
he	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
3:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Follow	1
after	1
me:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
your	1
enemies	1
the	1
Moabites	1
into	1
your	1
hand.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
fords	1
of	1
Jordan	1
toward	1
Moab,	1
and	1
suffered	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
pass	1
over.	1
	1
3:29	1
And	1
they	1
slew	1
of	1
Moab	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
about	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men,	1
all	1
lusty,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
valour;	1
and	1
there	1
escaped	1
not	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
3:30	1
So	1
Moab	1
was	1
subdued	1
that	1
day	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel.	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
rest	1
fourscore	1
years.	1
	1
3:31	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
was	1
Shamgar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Anath,	1
which	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
with	1
an	1
ox	1
goad:	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
delivered	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
again	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
Ehud	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sold	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Jabin	1
king	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
that	1
reigned	1
in	1
Hazor;	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
whose	1
host	1
was	1
Sisera,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Harosheth	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
nine	1
hundred	1
chariots	1
of	1
iron;	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
he	1
mightily	1
oppressed	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Deborah,	1
a	1
prophetess,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Lapidoth,	1
she	1
judged	1
Israel	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
she	1
dwelt	1
under	1
the	1
palm	1
tree	1
of	1
Deborah	1
between	1
Ramah	1
and	1
Bethel	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
judgment.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
she	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
Barak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abinoam	1
out	1
of	1
Kedeshnaphtali,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
draw	1
toward	1
mount	1
Tabor,	1
and	1
take	1
with	1
thee	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Naphtali	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Zebulun?	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
Kishon	1
Sisera,	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
Jabin's	1
army,	1
with	1
his	1
chariots	1
and	1
his	1
multitude;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
Barak	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
go	1
with	1
me,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
go:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
go	1
with	1
me,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
go	1
with	1
thee:	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
journey	1
that	1
thou	1
takest	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
thine	1
honour;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
sell	1
Sisera	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
woman.	1
And	1
Deborah	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
Barak	1
to	1
Kedesh.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
Barak	1
called	1
Zebulun	1
and	1
Naphtali	1
to	1
Kedesh;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
at	1
his	1
feet:	1
and	1
Deborah	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
4:11	1
Now	1
Heber	1
the	1
Kenite,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Hobab	1
the	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
had	1
severed	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
Kenites,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
unto	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Zaanaim,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
Kedesh.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
they	1
shewed	1
Sisera	1
that	1
Barak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abinoam	1
was	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
mount	1
Tabor.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
Sisera	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
his	1
chariots,	1
even	1
nine	1
hundred	1
chariots	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
from	1
Harosheth	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Kishon.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
Deborah	1
said	1
unto	1
Barak,	1
Up;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
Sisera	1
into	1
thine	1
hand:	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
gone	1
out	1
before	1
thee?	1
So	1
Barak	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
mount	1
Tabor,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
discomfited	1
Sisera,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
host,	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
before	1
Barak;	1
so	1
that	1
Sisera	1
lighted	1
down	1
off	1
his	1
chariot,	1
and	1
fled	1
away	1
on	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
4:16	1
But	1
Barak	1
pursued	1
after	1
the	1
chariots,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
host,	1
unto	1
Harosheth	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Sisera	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
left.	1
	1
4:17	1
Howbeit	1
Sisera	1
fled	1
away	1
on	1
his	1
feet	1
to	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
Jael	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Heber	1
the	1
Kenite:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
between	1
Jabin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Hazor	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Heber	1
the	1
Kenite.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
Jael	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
Sisera,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Turn	1
in,	1
my	1
lord,	1
turn	1
in	1
to	1
me;	1
fear	1
not.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
in	1
unto	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
tent,	1
she	1
covered	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
mantle.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Give	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
to	1
drink;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thirsty.	1
And	1
she	1
opened	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
drink,	1
and	1
covered	1
him.	1
	1
4:20	1
Again	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Stand	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
any	1
man	1
doth	1
come	1
and	1
enquire	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
say,	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
man	1
here?	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
No.	1
	1
4:21	1
Then	1
Jael	1
Heber's	1
wife	1
took	1
a	1
nail	1
of	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
hammer	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
went	1
softly	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
nail	1
into	1
his	1
temples,	1
and	1
fastened	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
ground:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep	1
and	1
weary.	1
So	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
4:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
as	1
Barak	1
pursued	1
Sisera,	1
Jael	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
thou	1
seekest.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
tent,	1
behold,	1
Sisera	1
lay	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
nail	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
temples.	1
	1
4:23	1
So	1
God	1
subdued	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
Jabin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Canaan	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
prospered,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
Jabin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
destroyed	1
Jabin	1
king	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
5:1	1
Then	1
sang	1
Deborah	1
and	1
Barak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abinoam	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
saying,	1
5:2	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
the	1
avenging	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
willingly	1
offered	1
themselves.	1
	1
5:3	1
Hear,	1
O	1
ye	1
kings;	1
give	1
ear,	1
O	1
ye	1
princes;	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praise	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
LORD,	1
when	1
thou	1
wentest	1
out	1
of	1
Seir,	1
when	1
thou	1
marchedst	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Edom,	1
the	1
earth	1
trembled,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
dropped,	1
the	1
clouds	1
also	1
dropped	1
water.	1
	1
5:5	1
The	1
mountains	1
melted	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
that	1
Sinai	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:6	1
In	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Shamgar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Anath,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jael,	1
the	1
highways	1
were	1
unoccupied,	1
and	1
the	1
travellers	1
walked	1
through	1
byways.	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
villages	1
ceased,	1
they	1
ceased	1
in	1
Israel,	1
until	1
that	1
I	1
Deborah	1
arose,	1
that	1
I	1
arose	1
a	1
mother	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:8	1
They	1
chose	1
new	1
gods;	1
then	1
was	1
war	1
in	1
the	1
gates:	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
shield	1
or	1
spear	1
seen	1
among	1
forty	1
thousand	1
in	1
Israel?	1
	1
5:9	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
toward	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
offered	1
themselves	1
willingly	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
Bless	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:10	1
Speak,	1
ye	1
that	1
ride	1
on	1
white	1
asses,	1
ye	1
that	1
sit	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
5:11	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
archers	1
in	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
drawing	1
water,	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
rehearse	1
the	1
righteous	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
the	1
righteous	1
acts	1
toward	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
his	1
villages	1
in	1
Israel:	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
gates.	1
	1
5:12	1
Awake,	1
awake,	1
Deborah:	1
awake,	1
awake,	1
utter	1
a	1
song:	1
arise,	1
Barak,	1
and	1
lead	1
thy	1
captivity	1
captive,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
Abinoam.	1
	1
5:13	1
Then	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
that	1
remaineth	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
nobles	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
me	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
5:14	1
Out	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
root	1
of	1
them	1
against	1
Amalek;	1
after	1
thee,	1
Benjamin,	1
among	1
thy	1
people;	1
out	1
of	1
Machir	1
came	1
down	1
governors,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Zebulun	1
they	1
that	1
handle	1
the	1
pen	1
of	1
the	1
writer.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Issachar	1
were	1
with	1
Deborah;	1
even	1
Issachar,	1
and	1
also	1
Barak:	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
on	1
foot	1
into	1
the	1
valley.	1
For	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
Reuben	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
thoughts	1
of	1
heart.	1
	1
5:16	1
Why	1
abodest	1
thou	1
among	1
the	1
sheepfolds,	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
bleatings	1
of	1
the	1
flocks?	1
For	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
Reuben	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
searchings	1
of	1
heart.	1
	1
5:17	1
Gilead	1
abode	1
beyond	1
Jordan:	1
and	1
why	1
did	1
Dan	1
remain	1
in	1
ships?	1
Asher	1
continued	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
shore,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
his	1
breaches.	1
	1
5:18	1
Zebulun	1
and	1
Naphtali	1
were	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
jeoparded	1
their	1
lives	1
unto	1
the	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
5:19	1
The	1
kings	1
came	1
and	1
fought,	1
then	1
fought	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Canaan	1
in	1
Taanach	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Megiddo;	1
they	1
took	1
no	1
gain	1
of	1
money.	1
	1
5:20	1
They	1
fought	1
from	1
heaven;	1
the	1
stars	1
in	1
their	1
courses	1
fought	1
against	1
Sisera.	1
	1
5:21	1
The	1
river	1
of	1
Kishon	1
swept	1
them	1
away,	1
that	1
ancient	1
river,	1
the	1
river	1
Kishon.	1
O	1
my	1
soul,	1
thou	1
hast	1
trodden	1
down	1
strength.	1
	1
5:22	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
horsehoofs	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
pransings,	1
the	1
pransings	1
of	1
their	1
mighty	1
ones.	1
	1
5:23	1
Curse	1
ye	1
Meroz,	1
said	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
curse	1
ye	1
bitterly	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
5:24	1
Blessed	1
above	1
women	1
shall	1
Jael	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Heber	1
the	1
Kenite	1
be,	1
blessed	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
above	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
5:25	1
He	1
asked	1
water,	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
milk;	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
butter	1
in	1
a	1
lordly	1
dish.	1
	1
5:26	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
nail,	1
and	1
her	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
workmen's	1
hammer;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
hammer	1
she	1
smote	1
Sisera,	1
she	1
smote	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
pierced	1
and	1
stricken	1
through	1
his	1
temples.	1
	1
5:27	1
At	1
her	1
feet	1
he	1
bowed,	1
he	1
fell,	1
he	1
lay	1
down:	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
he	1
bowed,	1
he	1
fell:	1
where	1
he	1
bowed,	1
there	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
dead.	1
	1
5:28	1
The	1
mother	1
of	1
Sisera	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
cried	1
through	1
the	1
lattice,	1
Why	1
is	1
his	1
chariot	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
coming?	1
why	1
tarry	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
his	1
chariots?	1
	1
5:29	1
Her	1
wise	1
ladies	1
answered	1
her,	1
yea,	1
she	1
returned	1
answer	1
to	1
herself,	1
5:30	1
Have	1
they	1
not	1
sped?	1
have	1
they	1
not	1
divided	1
the	1
prey;	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
damsel	1
or	1
two;	1
to	1
Sisera	1
a	1
prey	1
of	1
divers	1
colours,	1
a	1
prey	1
of	1
divers	1
colours	1
of	1
needlework,	1
of	1
divers	1
colours	1
of	1
needlework	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
take	1
the	1
spoil?	1
	1
5:31	1
So	1
let	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
perish,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
when	1
he	1
goeth	1
forth	1
in	1
his	1
might.	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
rest	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Midian	1
seven	1
years.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Midian	1
prevailed	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
made	1
them	1
the	1
dens	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
caves,	1
and	1
strong	1
holds.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
Israel	1
had	1
sown,	1
that	1
the	1
Midianites	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
even	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
them;	1
6:4	1
And	1
they	1
encamped	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
till	1
thou	1
come	1
unto	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
left	1
no	1
sustenance	1
for	1
Israel,	1
neither	1
sheep,	1
nor	1
ox,	1
nor	1
ass.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
their	1
cattle	1
and	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
as	1
grasshoppers	1
for	1
multitude;	1
for	1
both	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
camels	1
were	1
without	1
number:	1
and	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
Israel	1
was	1
greatly	1
impoverished	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites;	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
6:8	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
a	1
prophet	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage;	1
6:9	1
And	1
I	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
oppressed	1
you,	1
and	1
drave	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
gave	1
you	1
their	1
land;	1
6:10	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
fear	1
not	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
in	1
whose	1
land	1
ye	1
dwell:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
sat	1
under	1
an	1
oak	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Ophrah,	1
that	1
pertained	1
unto	1
Joash	1
the	1
Abiezrite:	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
Gideon	1
threshed	1
wheat	1
by	1
the	1
winepress,	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
Midianites.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Oh	1
my	1
Lord,	1
if	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
us,	1
why	1
then	1
is	1
all	1
this	1
befallen	1
us?	1
and	1
where	1
be	1
all	1
his	1
miracles	1
which	1
our	1
fathers	1
told	1
us	1
of,	1
saying,	1
Did	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
bring	1
us	1
up	1
from	1
Egypt?	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
us,	1
and	1
delivered	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
in	1
this	1
thy	1
might,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites:	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
sent	1
thee?	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Oh	1
my	1
Lord,	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
I	1
save	1
Israel?	1
	1
behold,	1
my	1
family	1
is	1
poor	1
in	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
least	1
in	1
my	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
the	1
Midianites	1
as	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
then	1
shew	1
me	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
thou	1
talkest	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
6:18	1
Depart	1
not	1
hence,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
my	1
present,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
tarry	1
until	1
thou	1
come	1
again.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
Gideon	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
made	1
ready	1
a	1
kid,	1
and	1
unleavened	1
cakes	1
of	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
flour:	1
the	1
flesh	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
basket,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
broth	1
in	1
a	1
pot,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
unto	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
oak,	1
and	1
presented	1
it.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
unleavened	1
cakes,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
upon	1
this	1
rock,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
broth.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
unleavened	1
cakes;	1
and	1
there	1
rose	1
up	1
fire	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
consumed	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
unleavened	1
cakes.	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
6:22	1
And	1
when	1
Gideon	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Gideon	1
said,	1
Alas,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God!	1
for	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
face	1
to	1
face.	1
	1
6:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
thee;	1
fear	1
not:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
6:24	1
Then	1
Gideon	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
there	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
Jehovahshalom:	1
unto	1
this	1
day	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
in	1
Ophrah	1
of	1
the	1
Abiezrites.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
thy	1
father's	1
young	1
bullock,	1
even	1
the	1
second	1
bullock	1
of	1
seven	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
throw	1
down	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
Baal	1
that	1
thy	1
father	1
hath,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
grove	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
it:	1
6:26	1
And	1
build	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
this	1
rock,	1
in	1
the	1
ordered	1
place,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
second	1
bullock,	1
and	1
offer	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
the	1
grove	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
down.	1
	1
6:27	1
Then	1
Gideon	1
took	1
ten	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
because	1
he	1
feared	1
his	1
father's	1
household,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
by	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
Baal	1
was	1
cast	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
grove	1
was	1
cut	1
down	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
bullock	1
was	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
was	1
built.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Who	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
thing?	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
enquired	1
and	1
asked,	1
they	1
said,	1
Gideon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
6:30	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
said	1
unto	1
Joash,	1
Bring	1
out	1
thy	1
son,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die:	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
Baal,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
grove	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
Joash	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
stood	1
against	1
him,	1
Will	1
ye	1
plead	1
for	1
Baal?	1
will	1
ye	1
save	1
him?	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
plead	1
for	1
him,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
whilst	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
morning:	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
god,	1
let	1
him	1
plead	1
for	1
himself,	1
because	1
one	1
hath	1
cast	1
down	1
his	1
altar.	1
	1
6:32	1
Therefore	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
Jerubbaal,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
Baal	1
plead	1
against	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
thrown	1
down	1
his	1
altar.	1
	1
6:33	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
Midianites	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
over,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
6:34	1
But	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
Gideon,	1
and	1
he	1
blew	1
a	1
trumpet;	1
and	1
Abiezer	1
was	1
gathered	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
throughout	1
all	1
Manasseh;	1
who	1
also	1
was	1
gathered	1
after	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Asher,	1
and	1
unto	1
Zebulun,	1
and	1
unto	1
Naphtali;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
	1
6:36	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
save	1
Israel	1
by	1
mine	1
hand,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
6:37	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
fleece	1
of	1
wool	1
in	1
the	1
floor;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
dew	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
fleece	1
only,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
dry	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
beside,	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
save	1
Israel	1
by	1
mine	1
hand,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
6:38	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so:	1
for	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
and	1
thrust	1
the	1
fleece	1
together,	1
and	1
wringed	1
the	1
dew	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fleece,	1
a	1
bowl	1
full	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Let	1
not	1
thine	1
anger	1
be	1
hot	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
but	1
this	1
once:	1
let	1
me	1
prove,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
but	1
this	1
once	1
with	1
the	1
fleece;	1
let	1
it	1
now	1
be	1
dry	1
only	1
upon	1
the	1
fleece,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
ground	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
dew.	1
	1
6:40	1
And	1
God	1
did	1
so	1
that	1
night:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
dry	1
upon	1
the	1
fleece	1
only,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
dew	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
Jerubbaal,	1
who	1
is	1
Gideon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
rose	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
pitched	1
beside	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
Harod:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
them,	1
by	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Moreh,	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
The	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
thee	1
are	1
too	1
many	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Midianites	1
into	1
their	1
hands,	1
lest	1
Israel	1
vaunt	1
themselves	1
against	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Mine	1
own	1
hand	1
hath	1
saved	1
me.	1
	1
7:3	1
Now	1
therefore	1
go	1
to,	1
proclaim	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Whosoever	1
is	1
fearful	1
and	1
afraid,	1
let	1
him	1
return	1
and	1
depart	1
early	1
from	1
mount	1
Gilead.	1
And	1
there	1
returned	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand;	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
ten	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
The	1
people	1
are	1
yet	1
too	1
many;	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
them	1
for	1
thee	1
there:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
This	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
of	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
This	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
not	1
go.	1
	1
7:5	1
So	1
he	1
brought	1
down	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
lappeth	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
his	1
tongue,	1
as	1
a	1
dog	1
lappeth,	1
him	1
shalt	1
thou	1
set	1
by	1
himself;	1
likewise	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
boweth	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
lapped,	1
putting	1
their	1
hand	1
to	1
their	1
mouth,	1
were	1
three	1
hundred	1
men:	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
bowed	1
down	1
upon	1
their	1
knees	1
to	1
drink	1
water.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
By	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
lapped	1
will	1
I	1
save	1
you,	1
and	1
deliver	1
the	1
Midianites	1
into	1
thine	1
hand:	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
people	1
go	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
7:8	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
victuals	1
in	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
their	1
trumpets:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Israel	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
tent,	1
and	1
retained	1
those	1
three	1
hundred	1
men:	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Midian	1
was	1
beneath	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
get	1
thee	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
host;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
it	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
7:10	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
fear	1
to	1
go	1
down,	1
go	1
thou	1
with	1
Phurah	1
thy	1
servant	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
host:	1
7:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
what	1
they	1
say;	1
and	1
afterward	1
shall	1
thine	1
hands	1
be	1
strengthened	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
host.	1
Then	1
went	1
he	1
down	1
with	1
Phurah	1
his	1
servant	1
unto	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
armed	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
the	1
Midianites	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
lay	1
along	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
like	1
grasshoppers	1
for	1
multitude;	1
and	1
their	1
camels	1
were	1
without	1
number,	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
when	1
Gideon	1
was	1
come,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
a	1
dream	1
unto	1
his	1
fellow,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
barley	1
bread	1
tumbled	1
into	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Midian,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
tent,	1
and	1
smote	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
fell,	1
and	1
overturned	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
tent	1
lay	1
along.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
his	1
fellow	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
nothing	1
else	1
save	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Gideon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
hath	1
God	1
delivered	1
Midian,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
Gideon	1
heard	1
the	1
telling	1
of	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
that	1
he	1
worshipped,	1
and	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Arise;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
into	1
your	1
hand	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
men	1
into	1
three	1
companies,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
trumpet	1
in	1
every	1
man's	1
hand,	1
with	1
empty	1
pitchers,	1
and	1
lamps	1
within	1
the	1
pitchers.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Look	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
do	1
likewise:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
7:18	1
When	1
I	1
blow	1
with	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
I	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
then	1
blow	1
ye	1
the	1
trumpets	1
also	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
say,	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
Gideon.	1
	1
7:19	1
So	1
Gideon,	1
and	1
the	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
watch;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
but	1
newly	1
set	1
the	1
watch:	1
and	1
they	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
pitchers	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
companies	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
pitchers,	1
and	1
held	1
the	1
lamps	1
in	1
their	1
left	1
hands,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpets	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
hands	1
to	1
blow	1
withal:	1
and	1
they	1
cried,	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
Gideon.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
they	1
stood	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
ran,	1
and	1
cried,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
set	1
every	1
man's	1
sword	1
against	1
his	1
fellow,	1
even	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
host:	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
fled	1
to	1
Bethshittah	1
in	1
Zererath,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Abelmeholah,	1
unto	1
Tabbath.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
Naphtali,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Asher,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
pursued	1
after	1
the	1
Midianites.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
Gideon	1
sent	1
messengers	1
throughout	1
all	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
saying,	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
and	1
take	1
before	1
them	1
the	1
waters	1
unto	1
Bethbarah	1
and	1
Jordan.	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
waters	1
unto	1
Bethbarah	1
and	1
Jordan.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
two	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
Oreb	1
and	1
Zeeb;	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
Oreb	1
upon	1
the	1
rock	1
Oreb,	1
and	1
Zeeb	1
they	1
slew	1
at	1
the	1
winepress	1
of	1
Zeeb,	1
and	1
pursued	1
Midian,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
Oreb	1
and	1
Zeeb	1
to	1
Gideon	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
served	1
us	1
thus,	1
that	1
thou	1
calledst	1
us	1
not,	1
when	1
thou	1
wentest	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
Midianites?	1
	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
chide	1
with	1
him	1
sharply.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
now	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
you?	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
gleaning	1
of	1
the	1
grapes	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
vintage	1
of	1
Abiezer?	1
	1
8:3	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Oreb	1
and	1
Zeeb:	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
you?	1
Then	1
their	1
anger	1
was	1
abated	1
toward	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
Gideon	1
came	1
to	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
passed	1
over,	1
he,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
faint,	1
yet	1
pursuing	1
them.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth,	1
Give,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
follow	1
me;	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
faint,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
pursuing	1
after	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
kings	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Succoth	1
said,	1
Are	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
now	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
give	1
bread	1
unto	1
thine	1
army?	1
8:7	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said,	1
Therefore	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
into	1
mine	1
hand,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
tear	1
your	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
thorns	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
with	1
briers.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
thence	1
to	1
Penuel,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
likewise:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Penuel	1
answered	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth	1
had	1
answered	1
him.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Penuel,	1
saying,	1
When	1
I	1
come	1
again	1
in	1
peace,	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
down	1
this	1
tower.	1
	1
8:10	1
Now	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
were	1
in	1
Karkor,	1
and	1
their	1
hosts	1
with	1
them,	1
about	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
men,	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east:	1
for	1
there	1
fell	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
sword.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
Gideon	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
tents	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Nobah	1
and	1
Jogbehah,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
host;	1
for	1
the	1
host	1
was	1
secure.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
when	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
fled,	1
he	1
pursued	1
after	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
kings	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
and	1
discomfited	1
all	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
Gideon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
returned	1
from	1
battle	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up,	1
8:14	1
And	1
caught	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
enquired	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
described	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
thereof,	1
even	1
threescore	1
and	1
seventeen	1
men.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
with	1
whom	1
ye	1
did	1
upbraid	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Are	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
now	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
give	1
bread	1
unto	1
thy	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
weary?	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thorns	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
briers,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
taught	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
he	1
beat	1
down	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Penuel,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
8:18	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
were	1
they	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
at	1
Tabor?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
As	1
thou	1
art,	1
so	1
were	1
they;	1
each	1
one	1
resembled	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
They	1
were	1
my	1
brethren,	1
even	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
my	1
mother:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
saved	1
them	1
alive,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
slay	1
you.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Jether	1
his	1
firstborn,	1
Up,	1
and	1
slay	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
youth	1
drew	1
not	1
his	1
sword:	1
for	1
he	1
feared,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
youth.	1
	1
8:21	1
Then	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
said,	1
Rise	1
thou,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
us:	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
is,	1
so	1
is	1
his	1
strength.	1
And	1
Gideon	1
arose,	1
and	1
slew	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
ornaments	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
camels'	1
necks.	1
	1
8:22	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
Rule	1
thou	1
over	1
us,	1
both	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
thy	1
son's	1
son	1
also:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
neither	1
shall	1
my	1
son	1
rule	1
over	1
you:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
you.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
would	1
desire	1
a	1
request	1
of	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
earrings	1
of	1
his	1
prey.	1
(For	1
they	1
had	1
golden	1
earrings,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
Ishmaelites.)	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
We	1
will	1
willingly	1
give	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
spread	1
a	1
garment,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
therein	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
earrings	1
of	1
his	1
prey.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
earrings	1
that	1
he	1
requested	1
was	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
gold;	1
beside	1
ornaments,	1
and	1
collars,	1
and	1
purple	1
raiment	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Midian,	1
and	1
beside	1
the	1
chains	1
that	1
were	1
about	1
their	1
camels'	1
necks.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
Gideon	1
made	1
an	1
ephod	1
thereof,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
city,	1
even	1
in	1
Ophrah:	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
went	1
thither	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
it:	1
which	1
thing	1
became	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
8:28	1
Thus	1
was	1
Midian	1
subdued	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
heads	1
no	1
more.	1
And	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
in	1
quietness	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Gideon.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
Jerubbaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
went	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Gideon	1
had	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
sons	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
begotten:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
many	1
wives.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
his	1
concubine	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Shechem,	1
she	1
also	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son,	1
whose	1
name	1
he	1
called	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
Gideon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
died	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
old	1
age,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
Joash	1
his	1
father,	1
in	1
Ophrah	1
of	1
the	1
Abiezrites.	1
	1
8:33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Gideon	1
was	1
dead,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
turned	1
again,	1
and	1
went	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
Baalim,	1
and	1
made	1
Baalberith	1
their	1
god.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
remembered	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
who	1
had	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
enemies	1
on	1
every	1
side:	1
8:35	1
Neither	1
shewed	1
they	1
kindness	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jerubbaal,	1
namely,	1
Gideon,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
goodness	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
shewed	1
unto	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbaal	1
went	1
to	1
Shechem	1
unto	1
his	1
mother's	1
brethren,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
mother's	1
father,	1
saying,	1
9:2	1
Speak,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
Whether	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
you,	1
either	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jerubbaal,	1
which	1
are	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
persons,	1
reign	1
over	1
you,	1
or	1
that	1
one	1
reign	1
over	1
you?	1
remember	1
also	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
bone	1
and	1
your	1
flesh.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
brethren	1
spake	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
all	1
these	1
words:	1
and	1
their	1
hearts	1
inclined	1
to	1
follow	1
Abimelech;	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
our	1
brother.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baalberith,	1
wherewith	1
Abimelech	1
hired	1
vain	1
and	1
light	1
persons,	1
which	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
at	1
Ophrah,	1
and	1
slew	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jerubbaal,	1
being	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
persons,	1
upon	1
one	1
stone:	1
notwithstanding	1
yet	1
Jotham	1
the	1
youngest	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbaal	1
was	1
left;	1
for	1
he	1
hid	1
himself.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Millo,	1
and	1
went,	1
and	1
made	1
Abimelech	1
king,	1
by	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
the	1
pillar	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Shechem.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
Jotham,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
mount	1
Gerizim,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
cried,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
that	1
God	1
may	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
trees	1
went	1
forth	1
on	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
anoint	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
olive	1
tree,	1
Reign	1
thou	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
9:9	1
But	1
the	1
olive	1
tree	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Should	1
I	1
leave	1
my	1
fatness,	1
wherewith	1
by	1
me	1
they	1
honour	1
God	1
and	1
man,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
be	1
promoted	1
over	1
the	1
trees?	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
the	1
trees	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
Come	1
thou,	1
and	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
9:11	1
But	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Should	1
I	1
forsake	1
my	1
sweetness,	1
and	1
my	1
good	1
fruit,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
be	1
promoted	1
over	1
the	1
trees?	1
	1
9:12	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
trees	1
unto	1
the	1
vine,	1
Come	1
thou,	1
and	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
vine	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Should	1
I	1
leave	1
my	1
wine,	1
which	1
cheereth	1
God	1
and	1
man,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
be	1
promoted	1
over	1
the	1
trees?	1
	1
9:14	1
Then	1
said	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
unto	1
the	1
bramble,	1
Come	1
thou,	1
and	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
the	1
bramble	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
trees,	1
If	1
in	1
truth	1
ye	1
anoint	1
me	1
king	1
over	1
you,	1
then	1
come	1
and	1
put	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
my	1
shadow:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
let	1
fire	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bramble,	1
and	1
devour	1
the	1
cedars	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
9:16	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
truly	1
and	1
sincerely,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
Abimelech	1
king,	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
Jerubbaal	1
and	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
deserving	1
of	1
his	1
hands;	1
9:17	1
(For	1
my	1
father	1
fought	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
adventured	1
his	1
life	1
far,	1
and	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Midian:	1
9:18	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
risen	1
up	1
against	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
have	1
slain	1
his	1
sons,	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
persons,	1
upon	1
one	1
stone,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
Abimelech,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
maidservant,	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
brother;)	1
9:19	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
have	1
dealt	1
truly	1
and	1
sincerely	1
with	1
Jerubbaal	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
house	1
this	1
day,	1
then	1
rejoice	1
ye	1
in	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
also	1
rejoice	1
in	1
you:	1
9:20	1
But	1
if	1
not,	1
let	1
fire	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
devour	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Millo;	1
and	1
let	1
fire	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Millo,	1
and	1
devour	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
Jotham	1
ran	1
away,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Beer,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
there,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Abimelech	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
9:22	1
When	1
Abimelech	1
had	1
reigned	1
three	1
years	1
over	1
Israel,	1
9:23	1
Then	1
God	1
sent	1
an	1
evil	1
spirit	1
between	1
Abimelech	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem;	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
with	1
Abimelech:	1
9:24	1
That	1
the	1
cruelty	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
sons	1
of	1
Jerubbaal	1
might	1
come,	1
and	1
their	1
blood	1
be	1
laid	1
upon	1
Abimelech	1
their	1
brother,	1
which	1
slew	1
them;	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
which	1
aided	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
killing	1
of	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
set	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
they	1
robbed	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
along	1
that	1
way	1
by	1
them:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
Shechem:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
put	1
their	1
confidence	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
fields,	1
and	1
gathered	1
their	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
trode	1
the	1
grapes,	1
and	1
made	1
merry,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
god,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
cursed	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
Shechem,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
him?	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbaal?	1
and	1
Zebul	1
his	1
officer?	1
serve	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Hamor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Shechem:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
we	1
serve	1
him?	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
this	1
people	1
were	1
under	1
my	1
hand!	1
then	1
would	1
I	1
remove	1
Abimelech.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Abimelech,	1
Increase	1
thine	1
army,	1
and	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
when	1
Zebul	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed,	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled.	1
	1
9:31	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Abimelech	1
privily,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
be	1
come	1
to	1
Shechem;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
fortify	1
the	1
city	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
9:32	1
Now	1
therefore	1
up	1
by	1
night,	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
9:33	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
up,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rise	1
early,	1
and	1
set	1
upon	1
the	1
city:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
when	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
him	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
thee,	1
then	1
mayest	1
thou	1
do	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
occasion.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
they	1
laid	1
wait	1
against	1
Shechem	1
in	1
four	1
companies.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
Abimelech	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
from	1
lying	1
in	1
wait.	1
	1
9:36	1
And	1
when	1
Gaal	1
saw	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Zebul,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
come	1
people	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains.	1
And	1
Zebul	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
men.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
Gaal	1
spake	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
See	1
there	1
come	1
people	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
another	1
company	1
come	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Meonenim.	1
	1
9:38	1
Then	1
said	1
Zebul	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
now	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
Who	1
is	1
Abimelech,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
him?	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
despised?	1
go	1
out,	1
I	1
pray	1
now,	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:39	1
And	1
Gaal	1
went	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
chased	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
fled	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
many	1
were	1
overthrown	1
and	1
wounded,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Arumah:	1
and	1
Zebul	1
thrust	1
out	1
Gaal	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
Shechem.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
divided	1
them	1
into	1
three	1
companies,	1
and	1
laid	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
smote	1
them.	1
	1
9:44	1
And	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
the	1
company	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
rushed	1
forward,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
other	1
companies	1
ran	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
and	1
slew	1
them.	1
	1
9:45	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
all	1
that	1
day;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
was	1
therein,	1
and	1
beat	1
down	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
sowed	1
it	1
with	1
salt.	1
	1
9:46	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Shechem	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
an	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
god	1
Berith.	1
	1
9:47	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Abimelech,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Shechem	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
9:48	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
gat	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
mount	1
Zalmon,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
Abimelech	1
took	1
an	1
axe	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
a	1
bough	1
from	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
What	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
me	1
do,	1
make	1
haste,	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done.	1
	1
9:49	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
likewise	1
cut	1
down	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
bough,	1
and	1
followed	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
hold,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
hold	1
on	1
fire	1
upon	1
them;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Shechem	1
died	1
also,	1
about	1
a	1
thousand	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
9:50	1
Then	1
went	1
Abimelech	1
to	1
Thebez,	1
and	1
encamped	1
against	1
Thebez,	1
and	1
took	1
it.	1
	1
9:51	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
tower	1
within	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thither	1
fled	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
shut	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
gat	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
tower.	1
	1
9:52	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
tower,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
hard	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
to	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
9:53	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
cast	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
millstone	1
upon	1
Abimelech's	1
head,	1
and	1
all	1
to	1
brake	1
his	1
skull.	1
	1
9:54	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
hastily	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Draw	1
thy	1
sword,	1
and	1
slay	1
me,	1
that	1
men	1
say	1
not	1
of	1
me,	1
A	1
women	1
slew	1
him.	1
And	1
his	1
young	1
man	1
thrust	1
him	1
through,	1
and	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
9:55	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
Abimelech	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
departed	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
9:56	1
Thus	1
God	1
rendered	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
Abimelech,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
in	1
slaying	1
his	1
seventy	1
brethren:	1
9:57	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
did	1
God	1
render	1
upon	1
their	1
heads:	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
came	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
Jotham	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbaal.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
after	1
Abimelech	1
there	1
arose	1
to	1
defend	1
Israel	1
Tola	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Puah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Dodo,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Issachar;	1
and	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Shamir	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
twenty	1
and	1
three	1
years,	1
and	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Shamir.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
arose	1
Jair,	1
a	1
Gileadite,	1
and	1
judged	1
Israel	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
years.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
thirty	1
sons	1
that	1
rode	1
on	1
thirty	1
ass	1
colts,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
thirty	1
cities,	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
Havothjair	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
Jair	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Camon.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
served	1
Baalim,	1
and	1
Ashtaroth,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
forsook	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
served	1
not	1
him.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
hot	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
sold	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
that	1
year	1
they	1
vexed	1
and	1
oppressed	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
eighteen	1
years,	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Gilead.	1
	1
10:9	1
Moreover	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
fight	1
also	1
against	1
Judah,	1
and	1
against	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ephraim;	1
so	1
that	1
Israel	1
was	1
sore	1
distressed.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee,	1
both	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
also	1
served	1
Baalim.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
deliver	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
	1
10:12	1
The	1
Zidonians	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
the	1
Maonites,	1
did	1
oppress	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
cried	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
10:13	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
served	1
other	1
gods:	1
wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
you	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
10:14	1
Go	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
gods	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
chosen;	1
let	1
them	1
deliver	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
your	1
tribulation.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned:	1
do	1
thou	1
unto	1
us	1
whatsoever	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
thee;	1
deliver	1
us	1
only,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:17	1
Then	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
encamped	1
in	1
Gilead.	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
encamped	1
in	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
princes	1
of	1
Gilead	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
begin	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon?	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
head	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
Jephthah	1
the	1
Gileadite	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
valour,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
an	1
harlot:	1
and	1
Gilead	1
begat	1
Jephthah.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
Gilead's	1
wife	1
bare	1
him	1
sons;	1
and	1
his	1
wife's	1
sons	1
grew	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
thrust	1
out	1
Jephthah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
inherit	1
in	1
our	1
father's	1
house;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
woman.	1
	1
11:3	1
Then	1
Jephthah	1
fled	1
from	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Tob:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
gathered	1
vain	1
men	1
to	1
Jephthah,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
made	1
war	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
made	1
war	1
against	1
Israel,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead	1
went	1
to	1
fetch	1
Jephthah	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Tob:	1
11:6	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Jephthah,	1
Come,	1
and	1
be	1
our	1
captain,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
Did	1
not	1
ye	1
hate	1
me,	1
and	1
expel	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house?	1
and	1
why	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
now	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
distress?	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead	1
said	1
unto	1
Jephthah,	1
Therefore	1
we	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
thee	1
now,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
go	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
be	1
our	1
head	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
If	1
ye	1
bring	1
me	1
home	1
again	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
deliver	1
them	1
before	1
me,	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
your	1
head?	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead	1
said	1
unto	1
Jephthah,	1
The	1
LORD	1
be	1
witness	1
between	1
us,	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
11:11	1
Then	1
Jephthah	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
made	1
him	1
head	1
and	1
captain	1
over	1
them:	1
and	1
Jephthah	1
uttered	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
saying,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
against	1
me	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
my	1
land?	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
answered	1
unto	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
Jephthah,	1
Because	1
Israel	1
took	1
away	1
my	1
land,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
Arnon	1
even	1
unto	1
Jabbok,	1
and	1
unto	1
Jordan:	1
now	1
therefore	1
restore	1
those	1
lands	1
again	1
peaceably.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
sent	1
messengers	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon:	1
11:15	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Jephthah,	1
Israel	1
took	1
not	1
away	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
nor	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon:	1
11:16	1
But	1
when	1
Israel	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Kadesh;	1
11:17	1
Then	1
Israel	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
pass	1
through	1
thy	1
land:	1
but	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
thereto.	1
And	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab:	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
consent:	1
and	1
Israel	1
abode	1
in	1
Kadesh.	1
	1
11:18	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
along	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
compassed	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
pitched	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
but	1
came	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Moab:	1
for	1
Arnon	1
was	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
Israel	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon;	1
and	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
us	1
pass,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
through	1
thy	1
land	1
into	1
my	1
place.	1
	1
11:20	1
But	1
Sihon	1
trusted	1
not	1
Israel	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
his	1
coast:	1
but	1
Sihon	1
gathered	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Jahaz,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
delivered	1
Sihon	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
them:	1
so	1
Israel	1
possessed	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
that	1
country.	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
they	1
possessed	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
from	1
Arnon	1
even	1
unto	1
Jabbok,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
even	1
unto	1
Jordan.	1
	1
11:23	1
So	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
dispossessed	1
the	1
Amorites	1
from	1
before	1
his	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
possess	1
it?	1
	1
11:24	1
Wilt	1
not	1
thou	1
possess	1
that	1
which	1
Chemosh	1
thy	1
god	1
giveth	1
thee	1
to	1
possess?	1
So	1
whomsoever	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
us,	1
them	1
will	1
we	1
possess.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
now	1
art	1
thou	1
any	1
thing	1
better	1
than	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor,	1
king	1
of	1
Moab?	1
did	1
he	1
ever	1
strive	1
against	1
Israel,	1
or	1
did	1
he	1
ever	1
fight	1
against	1
them,	1
11:26	1
While	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Heshbon	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
in	1
Aroer	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
be	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
three	1
hundred	1
years?	1
why	1
therefore	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
recover	1
them	1
within	1
that	1
time?	1
	1
11:27	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee,	1
but	1
thou	1
doest	1
me	1
wrong	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
me:	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
Judge	1
be	1
judge	1
this	1
day	1
between	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:28	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jephthah	1
which	1
he	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
11:29	1
Then	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
Jephthah,	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
Mizpeh	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
from	1
Mizpeh	1
of	1
Gilead	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:30	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
without	1
fail	1
deliver	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
into	1
mine	1
hands,	1
11:31	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
cometh	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
my	1
house	1
to	1
meet	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
return	1
in	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
offer	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
11:32	1
So	1
Jephthah	1
passed	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
them	1
from	1
Aroer,	1
even	1
till	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
Minnith,	1
even	1
twenty	1
cities,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
slaughter.	1
Thus	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
were	1
subdued	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
came	1
to	1
Mizpeh	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
his	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
timbrels	1
and	1
with	1
dances:	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
only	1
child;	1
beside	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
neither	1
son	1
nor	1
daughter.	1
	1
11:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
said,	1
Alas,	1
my	1
daughter!	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
me	1
very	1
low,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
trouble	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
back.	1
	1
11:36	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
father,	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
opened	1
thy	1
mouth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
do	1
to	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
hath	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth;	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
taken	1
vengeance	1
for	1
thee	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
father,	1
Let	1
this	1
thing	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
me:	1
let	1
me	1
alone	1
two	1
months,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
bewail	1
my	1
virginity,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
fellows.	1
	1
11:38	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go.	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
her	1
away	1
for	1
two	1
months:	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
companions,	1
and	1
bewailed	1
her	1
virginity	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
months,	1
that	1
she	1
returned	1
unto	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
did	1
with	1
her	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
vow	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
vowed:	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
no	1
man.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
custom	1
in	1
Israel,	1
11:40	1
That	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
yearly	1
to	1
lament	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jephthah	1
the	1
Gileadite	1
four	1
days	1
in	1
a	1
year.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
northward,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jephthah,	1
Wherefore	1
passedst	1
thou	1
over	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
didst	1
not	1
call	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
thee?	1
we	1
will	1
burn	1
thine	1
house	1
upon	1
thee	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
were	1
at	1
great	1
strife	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
called	1
you,	1
ye	1
delivered	1
me	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
ye	1
delivered	1
me	1
not,	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
my	1
hand:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
me?	1
	1
12:4	1
Then	1
Jephthah	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Ephraim:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gilead	1
smote	1
Ephraim,	1
because	1
they	1
said,	1
Ye	1
Gileadites	1
are	1
fugitives	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
among	1
the	1
Ephraimites,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
Manassites.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
the	1
Gileadites	1
took	1
the	1
passages	1
of	1
Jordan	1
before	1
the	1
Ephraimites:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
those	1
Ephraimites	1
which	1
were	1
escaped	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
go	1
over;	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gilead	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
an	1
Ephraimite?	1
If	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
12:6	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
now	1
Shibboleth:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
Sibboleth:	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
frame	1
to	1
pronounce	1
it	1
right.	1
Then	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
passages	1
of	1
Jordan:	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
Ephraimites	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
judged	1
Israel	1
six	1
years.	1
Then	1
died	1
Jephthah	1
the	1
Gileadite,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
Ibzan	1
of	1
Bethlehem	1
judged	1
Israel.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
thirty	1
sons,	1
and	1
thirty	1
daughters,	1
whom	1
he	1
sent	1
abroad,	1
and	1
took	1
in	1
thirty	1
daughters	1
from	1
abroad	1
for	1
his	1
sons.	1
And	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
seven	1
years.	1
	1
12:10	1
Then	1
died	1
Ibzan,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
at	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
Elon,	1
a	1
Zebulonite,	1
judged	1
Israel;	1
and	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
ten	1
years.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
Elon	1
the	1
Zebulonite	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Aijalon	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Zebulun.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
Abdon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hillel,	1
a	1
Pirathonite,	1
judged	1
Israel.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
forty	1
sons	1
and	1
thirty	1
nephews,	1
that	1
rode	1
on	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
ass	1
colts:	1
and	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
eight	1
years.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
Abdon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hillel	1
the	1
Pirathonite	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Pirathon	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
Zorah,	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Danites,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Manoah;	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
barren,	1
and	1
bare	1
not.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
thou	1
art	1
barren,	1
and	1
bearest	1
not:	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
13:4	1
Now	1
therefore	1
beware,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
drink	1
not	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink,	1
and	1
eat	1
not	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing:	1
13:5	1
For,	1
lo,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
no	1
razor	1
shall	1
come	1
on	1
his	1
head:	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
Nazarite	1
unto	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
womb:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
deliver	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
13:6	1
Then	1
the	1
woman	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
husband,	1
saying,	1
A	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
very	1
terrible:	1
but	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
not	1
whence	1
he	1
was,	1
neither	1
told	1
he	1
me	1
his	1
name:	1
13:7	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
now	1
drink	1
no	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink,	1
neither	1
eat	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing:	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
Nazarite	1
to	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
womb	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
13:8	1
Then	1
Manoah	1
intreated	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
Lord,	1
let	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
thou	1
didst	1
send	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
teach	1
us	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
born.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
God	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Manoah;	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
woman	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
but	1
Manoah	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
ran,	1
and	1
shewed	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
man	1
hath	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
day.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
Manoah	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
spakest	1
unto	1
the	1
woman?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
Manoah	1
said,	1
Now	1
let	1
thy	1
words	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
order	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Manoah,	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman	1
let	1
her	1
beware.	1
	1
13:14	1
She	1
may	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
cometh	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
neither	1
let	1
her	1
drink	1
wine	1
or	1
strong	1
drink,	1
nor	1
eat	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing:	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
commanded	1
her	1
let	1
her	1
observe.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
Manoah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
us	1
detain	1
thee,	1
until	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
made	1
ready	1
a	1
kid	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Manoah,	1
Though	1
thou	1
detain	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
thy	1
bread:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
offer	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
thou	1
must	1
offer	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
For	1
Manoah	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
Manoah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name,	1
that	1
when	1
thy	1
sayings	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
we	1
may	1
do	1
thee	1
honour?	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
askest	1
thou	1
thus	1
after	1
my	1
name,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
secret?	1
	1
13:19	1
So	1
Manoah	1
took	1
a	1
kid	1
with	1
a	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
upon	1
a	1
rock	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
did	1
wonderously;	1
and	1
Manoah	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
looked	1
on.	1
	1
13:20	1
For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
flame	1
went	1
up	1
toward	1
heaven	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar,	1
that	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
ascended	1
in	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
And	1
Manoah	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
looked	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
13:21	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
no	1
more	1
appear	1
to	1
Manoah	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
Then	1
Manoah	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
Manoah	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
wife,	1
We	1
shall	1
surely	1
die,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
God.	1
	1
13:23	1
But	1
his	1
wife	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
kill	1
us,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
at	1
our	1
hands,	1
neither	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
shewed	1
us	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
nor	1
would	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
have	1
told	1
us	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
these.	1
	1
13:24	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Samson:	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
him	1
at	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Dan	1
between	1
Zorah	1
and	1
Eshtaol.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
Samson	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Timnath,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
Timnath	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
told	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
Timnath	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
now	1
therefore	1
get	1
her	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
14:3	1
Then	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
there	1
never	1
a	1
woman	1
among	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
or	1
among	1
all	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
Philistines?	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Get	1
her	1
for	1
me;	1
for	1
she	1
pleaseth	1
me	1
well.	1
	1
14:4	1
But	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
sought	1
an	1
occasion	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
for	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
dominion	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:5	1
Then	1
went	1
Samson	1
down,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
to	1
Timnath,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
vineyards	1
of	1
Timnath:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
roared	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
mightily	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
rent	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
rent	1
a	1
kid,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
not	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
woman;	1
and	1
she	1
pleased	1
Samson	1
well.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
take	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
the	1
lion:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
bees	1
and	1
honey	1
in	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
the	1
lion.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
thereof	1
in	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
eating,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat:	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
honey	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
the	1
lion.	1
	1
14:10	1
So	1
his	1
father	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
woman:	1
and	1
Samson	1
made	1
there	1
a	1
feast;	1
for	1
so	1
used	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
thirty	1
companions	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
put	1
forth	1
a	1
riddle	1
unto	1
you:	1
if	1
ye	1
can	1
certainly	1
declare	1
it	1
me	1
within	1
the	1
seven	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
feast,	1
and	1
find	1
it	1
out,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
thirty	1
sheets	1
and	1
thirty	1
change	1
of	1
garments:	1
14:13	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
cannot	1
declare	1
it	1
me,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
give	1
me	1
thirty	1
sheets	1
and	1
thirty	1
change	1
of	1
garments.	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Put	1
forth	1
thy	1
riddle,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
eater	1
came	1
forth	1
meat,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
strong	1
came	1
forth	1
sweetness.	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
expound	1
the	1
riddle.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Samson's	1
wife,	1
Entice	1
thy	1
husband,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
declare	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
riddle,	1
lest	1
we	1
burn	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
father's	1
house	1
with	1
fire:	1
have	1
ye	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
we	1
have?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so?	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
Samson's	1
wife	1
wept	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
dost	1
but	1
hate	1
me,	1
and	1
lovest	1
me	1
not:	1
thou	1
hast	1
put	1
forth	1
a	1
riddle	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
told	1
it	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
told	1
it	1
my	1
father	1
nor	1
my	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
I	1
tell	1
it	1
thee?	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
she	1
wept	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
seven	1
days,	1
while	1
their	1
feast	1
lasted:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
her,	1
because	1
she	1
lay	1
sore	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
riddle	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
her	1
people.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down,	1
What	1
is	1
sweeter	1
than	1
honey?	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
a	1
lion?	1
	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
not	1
plowed	1
with	1
my	1
heifer,	1
ye	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
out	1
my	1
riddle.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Ashkelon,	1
and	1
slew	1
thirty	1
men	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
spoil,	1
and	1
gave	1
change	1
of	1
garments	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
expounded	1
the	1
riddle.	1
And	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
14:20	1
But	1
Samson's	1
wife	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
his	1
companion,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
as	1
his	1
friend.	1
	1
15:1	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
within	1
a	1
while	1
after,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
wheat	1
harvest,	1
that	1
Samson	1
visited	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
kid;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
into	1
the	1
chamber.	1
But	1
her	1
father	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
in.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
her	1
father	1
said,	1
I	1
verily	1
thought	1
that	1
thou	1
hadst	1
utterly	1
hated	1
her;	1
therefore	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
thy	1
companion:	1
is	1
not	1
her	1
younger	1
sister	1
fairer	1
than	1
she?	1
take	1
her,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
instead	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
concerning	1
them,	1
Now	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
more	1
blameless	1
than	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
though	1
I	1
do	1
them	1
a	1
displeasure.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Samson	1
went	1
and	1
caught	1
three	1
hundred	1
foxes,	1
and	1
took	1
firebrands,	1
and	1
turned	1
tail	1
to	1
tail,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
firebrand	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
between	1
two	1
tails.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
the	1
brands	1
on	1
fire,	1
he	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
standing	1
corn	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
burnt	1
up	1
both	1
the	1
shocks,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
standing	1
corn,	1
with	1
the	1
vineyards	1
and	1
olives.	1
	1
15:6	1
Then	1
the	1
Philistines	1
said,	1
Who	1
hath	1
done	1
this?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
Samson,	1
the	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Timnite,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
burnt	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Though	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
this,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
avenged	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cease.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
them	1
hip	1
and	1
thigh	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
Etam.	1
	1
15:9	1
Then	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
spread	1
themselves	1
in	1
Lehi.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
said,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
To	1
bind	1
Samson	1
are	1
we	1
come	1
up,	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
15:11	1
Then	1
three	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
Etam,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Samson,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
are	1
rulers	1
over	1
us?	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
us?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
As	1
they	1
did	1
unto	1
me,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
bind	1
thee,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Swear	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
fall	1
upon	1
me	1
yourselves.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
No;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
bind	1
thee	1
fast,	1
and	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
their	1
hand:	1
but	1
surely	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
kill	1
thee.	1
And	1
they	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
two	1
new	1
cords,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
rock.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
Lehi,	1
the	1
Philistines	1
shouted	1
against	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
mightily	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
cords	1
that	1
were	1
upon	1
his	1
arms	1
became	1
as	1
flax	1
that	1
was	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
bands	1
loosed	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
new	1
jawbone	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
slew	1
a	1
thousand	1
men	1
therewith.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
Samson	1
said,	1
With	1
the	1
jawbone	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
heaps	1
upon	1
heaps,	1
with	1
the	1
jaw	1
of	1
an	1
ass	1
have	1
I	1
slain	1
a	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking,	1
that	1
he	1
cast	1
away	1
the	1
jawbone	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
called	1
that	1
place	1
Ramathlehi.	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
athirst,	1
and	1
called	1
on	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
given	1
this	1
great	1
deliverance	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thy	1
servant:	1
and	1
now	1
shall	1
I	1
die	1
for	1
thirst,	1
and	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised?	1
	1
15:19	1
But	1
God	1
clave	1
an	1
hollow	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
jaw,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
water	1
thereout;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
drunk,	1
his	1
spirit	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
he	1
revived:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
thereof	1
Enhakkore,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Lehi	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
twenty	1
years.	1
	1
16:1	1
Then	1
went	1
Samson	1
to	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
saw	1
there	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
Gazites,	1
saying,	1
Samson	1
is	1
come	1
hither.	1
And	1
they	1
compassed	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
were	1
quiet	1
all	1
the	1
night,	1
saying,	1
In	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
day,	1
we	1
shall	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
Samson	1
lay	1
till	1
midnight,	1
and	1
arose	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
posts,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
them,	1
bar	1
and	1
all,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
an	1
hill	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
Hebron.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Sorek,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Delilah.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Entice	1
him,	1
and	1
see	1
wherein	1
his	1
great	1
strength	1
lieth,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
we	1
may	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
bind	1
him	1
to	1
afflict	1
him;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
eleven	1
hundred	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
Delilah	1
said	1
to	1
Samson,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
wherein	1
thy	1
great	1
strength	1
lieth,	1
and	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
bound	1
to	1
afflict	1
thee.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
they	1
bind	1
me	1
with	1
seven	1
green	1
withs	1
that	1
were	1
never	1
dried,	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
weak,	1
and	1
be	1
as	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
16:8	1
Then	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
brought	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
seven	1
green	1
withs	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
dried,	1
and	1
she	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
16:9	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
men	1
lying	1
in	1
wait,	1
abiding	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
chamber.	1
	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Samson.	1
And	1
he	1
brake	1
the	1
withs,	1
as	1
a	1
thread	1
of	1
tow	1
is	1
broken	1
when	1
it	1
toucheth	1
the	1
fire.	1
So	1
his	1
strength	1
was	1
not	1
known.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
Delilah	1
said	1
unto	1
Samson,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
mocked	1
me,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
lies:	1
now	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
bound.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
they	1
bind	1
me	1
fast	1
with	1
new	1
ropes	1
that	1
never	1
were	1
occupied,	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
weak,	1
and	1
be	1
as	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
16:12	1
Delilah	1
therefore	1
took	1
new	1
ropes,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
therewith,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Samson.	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
abiding	1
in	1
the	1
chamber.	1
And	1
he	1
brake	1
them	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
arms	1
like	1
a	1
thread.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
Delilah	1
said	1
unto	1
Samson,	1
Hitherto	1
thou	1
hast	1
mocked	1
me,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
lies:	1
tell	1
me	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
bound.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
thou	1
weavest	1
the	1
seven	1
locks	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
web.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
she	1
fastened	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
pin,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Samson.	1
And	1
he	1
awaked	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
pin	1
of	1
the	1
beam,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
web.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
canst	1
thou	1
say,	1
I	1
love	1
thee,	1
when	1
thine	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me?	1
thou	1
hast	1
mocked	1
me	1
these	1
three	1
times,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
told	1
me	1
wherein	1
thy	1
great	1
strength	1
lieth.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
pressed	1
him	1
daily	1
with	1
her	1
words,	1
and	1
urged	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
vexed	1
unto	1
death;	1
16:17	1
That	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
There	1
hath	1
not	1
come	1
a	1
razor	1
upon	1
mine	1
head;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
Nazarite	1
unto	1
God	1
from	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb:	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
shaven,	1
then	1
my	1
strength	1
will	1
go	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
become	1
weak,	1
and	1
be	1
like	1
any	1
other	1
man.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
when	1
Delilah	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
she	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
up	1
this	1
once,	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
all	1
his	1
heart.	1
Then	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
brought	1
money	1
in	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
she	1
made	1
him	1
sleep	1
upon	1
her	1
knees;	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
she	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
shave	1
off	1
the	1
seven	1
locks	1
of	1
his	1
head;	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
afflict	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
strength	1
went	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Samson.	1
And	1
he	1
awoke	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
out	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
before,	1
and	1
shake	1
myself.	1
And	1
he	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
16:21	1
But	1
the	1
Philistines	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
fetters	1
of	1
brass;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
grind	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
house.	1
	1
16:22	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
again	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
shaven.	1
	1
16:23	1
Then	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
offer	1
a	1
great	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
Dagon	1
their	1
god,	1
and	1
to	1
rejoice:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Our	1
god	1
hath	1
delivered	1
Samson	1
our	1
enemy	1
into	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
16:24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
praised	1
their	1
god:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Our	1
god	1
hath	1
delivered	1
into	1
our	1
hands	1
our	1
enemy,	1
and	1
the	1
destroyer	1
of	1
our	1
country,	1
which	1
slew	1
many	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
merry,	1
that	1
they	1
said,	1
Call	1
for	1
Samson,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
make	1
us	1
sport.	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
for	1
Samson	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
sport:	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
him	1
between	1
the	1
pillars.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
lad	1
that	1
held	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
Suffer	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
feel	1
the	1
pillars	1
whereupon	1
the	1
house	1
standeth,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
lean	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
16:27	1
Now	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
there;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
roof	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
that	1
beheld	1
while	1
Samson	1
made	1
sport.	1
	1
16:28	1
And	1
Samson	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord	1
God,	1
remember	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
only	1
this	1
once,	1
O	1
God,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
once	1
avenged	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
for	1
my	1
two	1
eyes.	1
	1
16:29	1
And	1
Samson	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
middle	1
pillars	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
house	1
stood,	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
borne	1
up,	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
16:30	1
And	1
Samson	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
die	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
lords,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
therein.	1
So	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
he	1
slew	1
at	1
his	1
death	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
which	1
he	1
slew	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
16:31	1
Then	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
came	1
down,	1
and	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
between	1
Zorah	1
and	1
Eshtaol	1
in	1
the	1
buryingplace	1
of	1
Manoah	1
his	1
father.	1
And	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
twenty	1
years.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Micah.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
mother,	1
The	1
eleven	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
from	1
thee,	1
about	1
which	1
thou	1
cursedst,	1
and	1
spakest	1
of	1
also	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
behold,	1
the	1
silver	1
is	1
with	1
me;	1
I	1
took	1
it.	1
And	1
his	1
mother	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
the	1
eleven	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver	1
to	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
mother	1
said,	1
I	1
had	1
wholly	1
dedicated	1
the	1
silver	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
my	1
hand	1
for	1
my	1
son,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
and	1
a	1
molten	1
image:	1
now	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
it	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
17:4	1
Yet	1
he	1
restored	1
the	1
money	1
unto	1
his	1
mother;	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
took	1
two	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
founder,	1
who	1
made	1
thereof	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
and	1
a	1
molten	1
image:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
Micah	1
had	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
ephod,	1
and	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
consecrated	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
who	1
became	1
his	1
priest.	1
	1
17:6	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Israel,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Judah,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
Levite,	1
and	1
he	1
sojourned	1
there.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
from	1
Bethlehemjudah	1
to	1
sojourn	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
place:	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
mount	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
Micah	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Levite	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah,	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
sojourn	1
where	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
a	1
place.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
Micah	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dwell	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
unto	1
me	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
a	1
priest,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
ten	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver	1
by	1
the	1
year,	1
and	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
apparel,	1
and	1
thy	1
victuals.	1
So	1
the	1
Levite	1
went	1
in.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
the	1
Levite	1
was	1
content	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
Micah	1
consecrated	1
the	1
Levite;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
became	1
his	1
priest,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah.	1
	1
17:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Micah,	1
Now	1
know	1
I	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
good,	1
seeing	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
Levite	1
to	1
my	1
priest.	1
	1
18:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Israel:	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
Danites	1
sought	1
them	1
an	1
inheritance	1
to	1
dwell	1
in;	1
for	1
unto	1
that	1
day	1
all	1
their	1
inheritance	1
had	1
not	1
fallen	1
unto	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
sent	1
of	1
their	1
family	1
five	1
men	1
from	1
their	1
coasts,	1
men	1
of	1
valour,	1
from	1
Zorah,	1
and	1
from	1
Eshtaol,	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
search	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go,	1
search	1
the	1
land:	1
who	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
they	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
18:3	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
they	1
knew	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
the	1
Levite:	1
and	1
they	1
turned	1
in	1
thither,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
brought	1
thee	1
hither?	1
and	1
what	1
makest	1
thou	1
in	1
this	1
place?	1
and	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
here?	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
and	1
thus	1
dealeth	1
Micah	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
hired	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
his	1
priest.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Ask	1
counsel,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
whether	1
our	1
way	1
which	1
we	1
go	1
shall	1
be	1
prosperous.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace:	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
your	1
way	1
wherein	1
ye	1
go.	1
	1
18:7	1
Then	1
the	1
five	1
men	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Laish,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
therein,	1
how	1
they	1
dwelt	1
careless,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
quiet	1
and	1
secure;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
magistrate	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
might	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
shame	1
in	1
any	1
thing;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
with	1
any	1
man.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
to	1
Zorah	1
and	1
Eshtaol:	1
and	1
their	1
brethren	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
say	1
ye?	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
them:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
land,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
good:	1
and	1
are	1
ye	1
still?	1
be	1
not	1
slothful	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
to	1
enter	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
18:10	1
When	1
ye	1
go,	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
a	1
people	1
secure,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
land:	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
hands;	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
from	1
thence	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Danites,	1
out	1
of	1
Zorah	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Eshtaol,	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
appointed	1
with	1
weapons	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
in	1
Judah:	1
wherefore	1
they	1
called	1
that	1
place	1
Mahanehdan	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
behind	1
Kirjathjearim.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
they	1
passed	1
thence	1
unto	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah.	1
	1
18:14	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
five	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Laish,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren,	1
Do	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
these	1
houses	1
an	1
ephod,	1
and	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
a	1
molten	1
image?	1
now	1
therefore	1
consider	1
what	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
thitherward,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
the	1
Levite,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
and	1
saluted	1
him.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
the	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
appointed	1
with	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan,	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
the	1
five	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
thither,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
the	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
image:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
with	1
the	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
appointed	1
with	1
weapons	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
these	1
went	1
into	1
Micah's	1
house,	1
and	1
fetched	1
the	1
carved	1
image,	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
the	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
image.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
do	1
ye?	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
lay	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
be	1
to	1
us	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
a	1
priest:	1
is	1
it	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
priest	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
or	1
that	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
priest	1
unto	1
a	1
tribe	1
and	1
a	1
family	1
in	1
Israel?	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
the	1
priest's	1
heart	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
the	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
the	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:21	1
So	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
little	1
ones	1
and	1
the	1
cattle	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
near	1
to	1
Micah's	1
house	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan.	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Micah,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
comest	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
company?	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
gods	1
which	1
I	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
gone	1
away:	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
more?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee?	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
not	1
thy	1
voice	1
be	1
heard	1
among	1
us,	1
lest	1
angry	1
fellows	1
run	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
lose	1
thy	1
life,	1
with	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
thy	1
household.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
went	1
their	1
way:	1
and	1
when	1
Micah	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
unto	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Micah	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
which	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Laish,	1
unto	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
quiet	1
and	1
secure:	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
burnt	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
18:28	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
deliverer,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
with	1
any	1
man;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
that	1
lieth	1
by	1
Bethrehob.	1
And	1
they	1
built	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
therein.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Dan,	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Dan	1
their	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
born	1
unto	1
Israel:	1
howbeit	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
Laish	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
graven	1
image:	1
and	1
Jonathan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gershom,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
priests	1
to	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Dan	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
18:31	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
them	1
up	1
Micah's	1
graven	1
image,	1
which	1
he	1
made,	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
in	1
Shiloh.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
Levite	1
sojourning	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
who	1
took	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
concubine	1
out	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
his	1
concubine	1
played	1
the	1
whore	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
unto	1
her	1
father's	1
house	1
to	1
Bethlehemjudah,	1
and	1
was	1
there	1
four	1
whole	1
months.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
her	1
husband	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
her,	1
to	1
speak	1
friendly	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
again,	1
having	1
his	1
servant	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
asses:	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
father's	1
house:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
damsel	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father,	1
retained	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
three	1
days:	1
so	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
depart:	1
and	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
law,	1
Comfort	1
thine	1
heart	1
with	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
afterward	1
go	1
your	1
way.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
together:	1
for	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
Be	1
content,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
tarry	1
all	1
night,	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
heart	1
be	1
merry.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
depart,	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
urged	1
him:	1
therefore	1
he	1
lodged	1
there	1
again.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
on	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
to	1
depart;	1
and	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father	1
said,	1
Comfort	1
thine	1
heart,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee.	1
And	1
they	1
tarried	1
until	1
afternoon,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
depart,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
concubine,	1
and	1
his	1
servant,	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father,	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
now	1
the	1
day	1
draweth	1
toward	1
evening,	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
tarry	1
all	1
night:	1
behold,	1
the	1
day	1
groweth	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
lodge	1
here,	1
that	1
thine	1
heart	1
may	1
be	1
merry;	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
get	1
you	1
early	1
on	1
your	1
way,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
go	1
home.	1
	1
19:10	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
tarry	1
that	1
night,	1
but	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
against	1
Jebus,	1
which	1
is	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
asses	1
saddled,	1
his	1
concubine	1
also	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
Jebus,	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
far	1
spent;	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
master,	1
Come,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
turn	1
in	1
into	1
this	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
and	1
lodge	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
his	1
master	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
aside	1
hither	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
a	1
stranger,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
we	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
to	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servant,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
draw	1
near	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
places	1
to	1
lodge	1
all	1
night,	1
in	1
Gibeah,	1
or	1
in	1
Ramah.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
they	1
passed	1
on	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
Gibeah,	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
aside	1
thither,	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
to	1
lodge	1
in	1
Gibeah:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
he	1
sat	1
him	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
took	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
lodging.	1
	1
19:16	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
even,	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim;	1
and	1
he	1
sojourned	1
in	1
Gibeah:	1
but	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
were	1
Benjamites.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
wayfaring	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
said,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
and	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
passing	1
from	1
Bethlehemjudah	1
toward	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim;	1
from	1
thence	1
am	1
I:	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Bethlehemjudah,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
to	1
house.	1
	1
19:19	1
Yet	1
there	1
is	1
both	1
straw	1
and	1
provender	1
for	1
our	1
asses;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
bread	1
and	1
wine	1
also	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
with	1
thy	1
servants:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
any	1
thing.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
said,	1
Peace	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
howsoever	1
let	1
all	1
thy	1
wants	1
lie	1
upon	1
me;	1
only	1
lodge	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
19:21	1
So	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
gave	1
provender	1
unto	1
the	1
asses:	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
19:22	1
Now	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
their	1
hearts	1
merry,	1
behold,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
certain	1
sons	1
of	1
Belial,	1
beset	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
beat	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
saying,	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
the	1
man,	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
nay,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
wickedly;	1
seeing	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
mine	1
house,	1
do	1
not	1
this	1
folly.	1
	1
19:24	1
Behold,	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
daughter	1
a	1
maiden,	1
and	1
his	1
concubine;	1
them	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
out	1
now,	1
and	1
humble	1
ye	1
them,	1
and	1
do	1
with	1
them	1
what	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
you:	1
but	1
unto	1
this	1
man	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
vile	1
a	1
thing.	1
	1
19:25	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
him:	1
so	1
the	1
man	1
took	1
his	1
concubine,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
forth	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
her,	1
and	1
abused	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
night	1
until	1
the	1
morning:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
began	1
to	1
spring,	1
they	1
let	1
her	1
go.	1
	1
19:26	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
dawning	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
house	1
where	1
her	1
lord	1
was,	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
light.	1
	1
19:27	1
And	1
her	1
lord	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
go	1
his	1
way:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
woman	1
his	1
concubine	1
was	1
fallen	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
threshold.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Up,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
going.	1
But	1
none	1
answered.	1
	1
Then	1
the	1
man	1
took	1
her	1
up	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
gat	1
him	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
knife,	1
and	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
his	1
concubine,	1
and	1
divided	1
her,	1
together	1
with	1
her	1
bones,	1
into	1
twelve	1
pieces,	1
and	1
sent	1
her	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
said,	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
deed	1
done	1
nor	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
consider	1
of	1
it,	1
take	1
advice,	1
and	1
speak	1
your	1
minds.	1
	1
20:1	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
gathered	1
together	1
as	1
one	1
man,	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
with	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
presented	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God,	1
four	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
footmen	1
that	1
drew	1
sword.	1
	1
20:3	1
(Now	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
Mizpeh.)	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
how	1
was	1
this	1
wickedness?	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
the	1
Levite,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
that	1
was	1
slain,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Gibeah	1
that	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Benjamin,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
concubine,	1
to	1
lodge.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gibeah	1
rose	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
beset	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
me	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
thought	1
to	1
have	1
slain	1
me:	1
and	1
my	1
concubine	1
have	1
they	1
forced,	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
concubine,	1
and	1
cut	1
her	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
sent	1
her	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
lewdness	1
and	1
folly	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:7	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
give	1
here	1
your	1
advice	1
and	1
counsel.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
arose	1
as	1
one	1
man,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
tent,	1
neither	1
will	1
we	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
turn	1
into	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
20:9	1
But	1
now	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
Gibeah;	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
by	1
lot	1
against	1
it;	1
20:10	1
And	1
we	1
will	1
take	1
ten	1
men	1
of	1
an	1
hundred	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
of	1
a	1
thousand,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
out	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
to	1
fetch	1
victual	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do,	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
folly	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
wrought	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:11	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gathered	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
knit	1
together	1
as	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
sent	1
men	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
saying,	1
What	1
wickedness	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
among	1
you?	1
20:13	1
Now	1
therefore	1
deliver	1
us	1
the	1
men,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Belial,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Gibeah,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
put	1
away	1
evil	1
from	1
Israel.	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:14	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
unto	1
Gibeah,	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
were	1
numbered	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
twenty	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
sword,	1
beside	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gibeah,	1
which	1
were	1
numbered	1
seven	1
hundred	1
chosen	1
men.	1
	1
20:16	1
Among	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
hundred	1
chosen	1
men	1
lefthanded;	1
every	1
one	1
could	1
sling	1
stones	1
at	1
an	1
hair	1
breadth,	1
and	1
not	1
miss.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
beside	1
Benjamin,	1
were	1
numbered	1
four	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
sword:	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
asked	1
counsel	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
Which	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Judah	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
first.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
encamped	1
against	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
Benjamin;	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
at	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Gibeah,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
Israelites	1
that	1
day	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
encouraged	1
themselves,	1
and	1
set	1
their	1
battle	1
again	1
in	1
array	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
the	1
first	1
day.	1
	1
20:23	1
(And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
wept	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
until	1
even,	1
and	1
asked	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
my	1
brother?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Go	1
up	1
against	1
him.)	1
	1
20:24	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
near	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
the	1
second	1
day.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
Benjamin	1
went	1
forth	1
against	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Gibeah	1
the	1
second	1
day,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
again	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
men;	1
all	1
these	1
drew	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:26	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
wept,	1
and	1
sat	1
there	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
fasted	1
that	1
day	1
until	1
even,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:27	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
(for	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
20:28	1
And	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
stood	1
before	1
it	1
in	1
those	1
days,)	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
yet	1
again	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
my	1
brother,	1
or	1
shall	1
I	1
cease?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Go	1
up;	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
Israel	1
set	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
round	1
about	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
Gibeah,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
were	1
drawn	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
smite	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
kill,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
in	1
the	1
highways,	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
goeth	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
Gibeah	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
about	1
thirty	1
men	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
said,	1
They	1
are	1
smitten	1
down	1
before	1
us,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
flee,	1
and	1
draw	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
unto	1
the	1
highways.	1
	1
20:33	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
rose	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
place,	1
and	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
at	1
Baaltamar:	1
and	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
places,	1
even	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
meadows	1
of	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:34	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
against	1
Gibeah	1
ten	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
sore:	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
evil	1
was	1
near	1
them.	1
	1
20:35	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
Benjamin	1
before	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
destroyed	1
of	1
the	1
Benjamites	1
that	1
day	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
thousand	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
men:	1
all	1
these	1
drew	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:36	1
So	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
smitten:	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
Benjamites,	1
because	1
they	1
trusted	1
unto	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
beside	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
hasted,	1
and	1
rushed	1
upon	1
Gibeah;	1
and	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
drew	1
themselves	1
along,	1
and	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:38	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
appointed	1
sign	1
between	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
flame	1
with	1
smoke	1
rise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
20:39	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
retired	1
in	1
the	1
battle,	1
Benjamin	1
began	1
to	1
smite	1
and	1
kill	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
about	1
thirty	1
persons:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Surely	1
they	1
are	1
smitten	1
down	1
before	1
us,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
battle.	1
	1
20:40	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
flame	1
began	1
to	1
arise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
smoke,	1
the	1
Benjamites	1
looked	1
behind	1
them,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven.	1
	1
20:41	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
turned	1
again,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
were	1
amazed:	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
evil	1
was	1
come	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:42	1
Therefore	1
they	1
turned	1
their	1
backs	1
before	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
but	1
the	1
battle	1
overtook	1
them;	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
they	1
destroyed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
20:43	1
Thus	1
they	1
inclosed	1
the	1
Benjamites	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
chased	1
them,	1
and	1
trode	1
them	1
down	1
with	1
ease	1
over	1
against	1
Gibeah	1
toward	1
the	1
sunrising.	1
	1
20:44	1
And	1
there	1
fell	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
men;	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
20:45	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
toward	1
the	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
Rimmon:	1
and	1
they	1
gleaned	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
highways	1
five	1
thousand	1
men;	1
and	1
pursued	1
hard	1
after	1
them	1
unto	1
Gidom,	1
and	1
slew	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
20:46	1
So	1
that	1
all	1
which	1
fell	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
were	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
the	1
sword;	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
20:47	1
But	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
the	1
rock	1
Rimmon,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
rock	1
Rimmon	1
four	1
months.	1
	1
20:48	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
turned	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
as	1
well	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
every	1
city,	1
as	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
hand:	1
also	1
they	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
to.	1
	1
21:1	1
Now	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
sworn	1
in	1
Mizpeh,	1
saying,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
give	1
his	1
daughter	1
unto	1
Benjamin	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
abode	1
there	1
till	1
even	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
wept	1
sore;	1
21:3	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
why	1
is	1
this	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
day	1
one	1
tribe	1
lacking	1
in	1
Israel?	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
rose	1
early,	1
and	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
came	1
not	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
congregation	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD?	1
For	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
oath	1
concerning	1
him	1
that	1
came	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Mizpeh,	1
saying,	1
He	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
repented	1
them	1
for	1
Benjamin	1
their	1
brother,	1
and	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
tribe	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Israel	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
21:7	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
for	1
wives	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
remain,	1
seeing	1
we	1
have	1
sworn	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
of	1
our	1
daughters	1
to	1
wives?	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
one	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
came	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
Mizpeh	1
to	1
the	1
LORD?	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
none	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
from	1
Jabeshgilead	1
to	1
the	1
assembly.	1
	1
21:9	1
For	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
numbered,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
there.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
the	1
congregation	1
sent	1
thither	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
valiantest,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
with	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
do,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
every	1
male,	1
and	1
every	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
lain	1
by	1
man.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
four	1
hundred	1
young	1
virgins,	1
that	1
had	1
known	1
no	1
man	1
by	1
lying	1
with	1
any	1
male:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
Shiloh,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
sent	1
some	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
rock	1
Rimmon,	1
and	1
to	1
call	1
peaceably	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
Benjamin	1
came	1
again	1
at	1
that	1
time;	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
wives	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
saved	1
alive	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead:	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
they	1
sufficed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
repented	1
them	1
for	1
Benjamin,	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
breach	1
in	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:16	1
Then	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
said,	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
for	1
wives	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
remain,	1
seeing	1
the	1
women	1
are	1
destroyed	1
out	1
of	1
Benjamin?	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
inheritance	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
escaped	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
that	1
a	1
tribe	1
be	1
not	1
destroyed	1
out	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:18	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
wives	1
of	1
our	1
daughters:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
sworn,	1
saying,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
a	1
wife	1
to	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
21:19	1
Then	1
they	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Shiloh	1
yearly	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
Bethel,	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
highway	1
that	1
goeth	1
up	1
from	1
Bethel	1
to	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Lebonah.	1
	1
21:20	1
Therefore	1
they	1
commanded	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
vineyards;	1
21:21	1
And	1
see,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Shiloh	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
dances,	1
then	1
come	1
ye	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
catch	1
you	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
their	1
fathers	1
or	1
their	1
brethren	1
come	1
unto	1
us	1
to	1
complain,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
favourable	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
our	1
sakes:	1
because	1
we	1
reserved	1
not	1
to	1
each	1
man	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
war:	1
for	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
guilty.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
wives,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
number,	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
danced,	1
whom	1
they	1
caught:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
returned	1
unto	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
repaired	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
departed	1
thence	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tribe	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
thence	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
21:25	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Israel:	1
every	1
man	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Ruth	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
the	1
judges	1
ruled,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah	1
went	1
to	1
sojourn	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
sons.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
Elimelech,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
Naomi,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
sons	1
Mahlon	1
and	1
Chilion,	1
Ephrathites	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
continued	1
there.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
Elimelech	1
Naomi's	1
husband	1
died;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
left,	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
sons.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
them	1
wives	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
Moab;	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Orpah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Ruth:	1
and	1
they	1
dwelled	1
there	1
about	1
ten	1
years.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
Mahlon	1
and	1
Chilion	1
died	1
also	1
both	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
sons	1
and	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
1:6	1
Then	1
she	1
arose	1
with	1
her	1
daughters	1
in	1
law,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab:	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
visited	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
giving	1
them	1
bread.	1
	1
1:7	1
Wherefore	1
she	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
daughters	1
in	1
law	1
with	1
her;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
two	1
daughters	1
in	1
law,	1
Go,	1
return	1
each	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
house:	1
the	1
LORD	1
deal	1
kindly	1
with	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
dealt	1
with	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
1:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
grant	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
find	1
rest,	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
Then	1
she	1
kissed	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Surely	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
with	1
thee	1
unto	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said,	1
Turn	1
again,	1
my	1
daughters:	1
why	1
will	1
ye	1
go	1
with	1
me?	1
are	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
more	1
sons	1
in	1
my	1
womb,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
your	1
husbands?	1
	1
1:12	1
Turn	1
again,	1
my	1
daughters,	1
go	1
your	1
way;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
old	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
husband.	1
If	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
hope,	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
an	1
husband	1
also	1
to	1
night,	1
and	1
should	1
also	1
bear	1
sons;	1
1:13	1
Would	1
ye	1
tarry	1
for	1
them	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
grown?	1
would	1
ye	1
stay	1
for	1
them	1
from	1
having	1
husbands?	1
nay,	1
my	1
daughters;	1
for	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
much	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept	1
again:	1
and	1
Orpah	1
kissed	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law;	1
but	1
Ruth	1
clave	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
is	1
gone	1
back	1
unto	1
her	1
people,	1
and	1
unto	1
her	1
gods:	1
return	1
thou	1
after	1
thy	1
sister	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
Ruth	1
said,	1
Intreat	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
thee,	1
or	1
to	1
return	1
from	1
following	1
after	1
thee:	1
for	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest,	1
I	1
will	1
go;	1
and	1
where	1
thou	1
lodgest,	1
I	1
will	1
lodge:	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
thy	1
God	1
my	1
God:	1
1:17	1
Where	1
thou	1
diest,	1
will	1
I	1
die,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
buried:	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
so	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
ought	1
but	1
death	1
part	1
thee	1
and	1
me.	1
	1
1:18	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
stedfastly	1
minded	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
her,	1
then	1
she	1
left	1
speaking	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
1:19	1
So	1
they	1
two	1
went	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Bethlehem.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Bethlehem,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Is	1
this	1
Naomi?	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Call	1
me	1
not	1
Naomi,	1
call	1
me	1
Mara:	1
for	1
the	1
Almighty	1
hath	1
dealt	1
very	1
bitterly	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
1:21	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
full	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
brought	1
me	1
home	1
again	1
empty:	1
why	1
then	1
call	1
ye	1
me	1
Naomi,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
testified	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
Almighty	1
hath	1
afflicted	1
me?	1
	1
1:22	1
So	1
Naomi	1
returned,	1
and	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess,	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
with	1
her,	1
which	1
returned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Bethlehem	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
barley	1
harvest.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
Naomi	1
had	1
a	1
kinsman	1
of	1
her	1
husband's,	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
wealth,	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Elimelech;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Boaz.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess	1
said	1
unto	1
Naomi,	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
glean	1
ears	1
of	1
corn	1
after	1
him	1
in	1
whose	1
sight	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
grace.	1
	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Go,	1
my	1
daughter.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
came,	1
and	1
gleaned	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
after	1
the	1
reapers:	1
and	1
her	1
hap	1
was	1
to	1
light	1
on	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
belonging	1
unto	1
Boaz,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
kindred	1
of	1
Elimelech.	1
	1
2:4	1
And,	1
behold,	1
Boaz	1
came	1
from	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
reapers,	1
The	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
bless	1
thee.	1
	1
2:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Boaz	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
reapers,	1
Whose	1
damsel	1
is	1
this?	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
reapers	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
Moabitish	1
damsel	1
that	1
came	1
back	1
with	1
Naomi	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab:	1
2:7	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
let	1
me	1
glean	1
and	1
gather	1
after	1
the	1
reapers	1
among	1
the	1
sheaves:	1
so	1
she	1
came,	1
and	1
hath	1
continued	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
morning	1
until	1
now,	1
that	1
she	1
tarried	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
2:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Boaz	1
unto	1
Ruth,	1
Hearest	1
thou	1
not,	1
my	1
daughter?	1
Go	1
not	1
to	1
glean	1
in	1
another	1
field,	1
neither	1
go	1
from	1
hence,	1
but	1
abide	1
here	1
fast	1
by	1
my	1
maidens:	1
2:9	1
Let	1
thine	1
eyes	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
reap,	1
and	1
go	1
thou	1
after	1
them:	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
charged	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
touch	1
thee?	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
athirst,	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
vessels,	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
drawn.	1
	1
2:10	1
Then	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
bowed	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
have	1
I	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
me,	1
seeing	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
stranger?	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
Boaz	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
It	1
hath	1
fully	1
been	1
shewed	1
me,	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
thy	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
thine	1
husband:	1
and	1
how	1
thou	1
hast	1
left	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
nativity,	1
and	1
art	1
come	1
unto	1
a	1
people	1
which	1
thou	1
knewest	1
not	1
heretofore.	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
recompense	1
thy	1
work,	1
and	1
a	1
full	1
reward	1
be	1
given	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
under	1
whose	1
wings	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
to	1
trust.	1
	1
2:13	1
Then	1
she	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
find	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
my	1
lord;	1
for	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
comforted	1
me,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
friendly	1
unto	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
like	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaidens.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
Boaz	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
At	1
mealtime	1
come	1
thou	1
hither,	1
and	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
bread,	1
and	1
dip	1
thy	1
morsel	1
in	1
the	1
vinegar.	1
And	1
she	1
sat	1
beside	1
the	1
reapers:	1
and	1
he	1
reached	1
her	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
was	1
sufficed,	1
and	1
left.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
risen	1
up	1
to	1
glean,	1
Boaz	1
commanded	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
her	1
glean	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
sheaves,	1
and	1
reproach	1
her	1
not:	1
2:16	1
And	1
let	1
fall	1
also	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
handfuls	1
of	1
purpose	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
leave	1
them,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
glean	1
them,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
her	1
not.	1
	1
2:17	1
So	1
she	1
gleaned	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
until	1
even,	1
and	1
beat	1
out	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
gleaned:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
barley.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
she	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
saw	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
gleaned:	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
forth,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
reserved	1
after	1
she	1
was	1
sufficed.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Where	1
hast	1
thou	1
gleaned	1
to	1
day?	1
	1
and	1
where	1
wroughtest	1
thou?	1
blessed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
did	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
thee.	1
And	1
she	1
shewed	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
wrought,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
man's	1
name	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
wrought	1
to	1
day	1
is	1
Boaz.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
off	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
the	1
living	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
dead.	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
man	1
is	1
near	1
of	1
kin	1
unto	1
us,	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
next	1
kinsmen.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess	1
said,	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
also,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
fast	1
by	1
my	1
young	1
men,	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
ended	1
all	1
my	1
harvest.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said	1
unto	1
Ruth	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
It	1
is	1
good,	1
my	1
daughter,	1
that	1
thou	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
maidens,	1
that	1
they	1
meet	1
thee	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
field.	1
	1
2:23	1
So	1
she	1
kept	1
fast	1
by	1
the	1
maidens	1
of	1
Boaz	1
to	1
glean	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
barley	1
harvest	1
and	1
of	1
wheat	1
harvest;	1
and	1
dwelt	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
3:1	1
Then	1
Naomi	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
My	1
daughter,	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
seek	1
rest	1
for	1
thee,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
now	1
is	1
not	1
Boaz	1
of	1
our	1
kindred,	1
with	1
whose	1
maidens	1
thou	1
wast?	1
	1
Behold,	1
he	1
winnoweth	1
barley	1
to	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
threshingfloor.	1
	1
3:3	1
Wash	1
thyself	1
therefore,	1
and	1
anoint	1
thee,	1
and	1
put	1
thy	1
raiment	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor:	1
but	1
make	1
not	1
thyself	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
until	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
he	1
lieth	1
down,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
mark	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
shall	1
lie,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
in,	1
and	1
uncover	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
lay	1
thee	1
down;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
All	1
that	1
thou	1
sayest	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
do.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
bade	1
her.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
when	1
Boaz	1
had	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunk,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
merry,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
corn:	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
softly,	1
and	1
uncovered	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
down.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
midnight,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
turned	1
himself:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman	1
lay	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
she	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
Ruth	1
thine	1
handmaid:	1
spread	1
therefore	1
thy	1
skirt	1
over	1
thine	1
handmaid;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
near	1
kinsman.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
my	1
daughter:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
more	1
kindness	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
than	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
followedst	1
not	1
young	1
men,	1
whether	1
poor	1
or	1
rich.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
now,	1
my	1
daughter,	1
fear	1
not;	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
thee	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
requirest:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
doth	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
virtuous	1
woman.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
near	1
kinsman:	1
howbeit	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
kinsman	1
nearer	1
than	1
I.	1
	1
3:13	1
Tarry	1
this	1
night,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
perform	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
kinsman,	1
well;	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
the	1
kinsman's	1
part:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
kinsman	1
to	1
thee,	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
kinsman	1
to	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth:	1
lie	1
down	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
she	1
lay	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
until	1
the	1
morning:	1
and	1
she	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
one	1
could	1
know	1
another.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
3:15	1
Also	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
the	1
vail	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
hold	1
it.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
held	1
it,	1
he	1
measured	1
six	1
measures	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law,	1
she	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
my	1
daughter?	1
And	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
These	1
six	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
gave	1
he	1
me;	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
Go	1
not	1
empty	1
unto	1
thy	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
3:18	1
Then	1
said	1
she,	1
Sit	1
still,	1
my	1
daughter,	1
until	1
thou	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
will	1
fall:	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
rest,	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
finished	1
the	1
thing	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:1	1
Then	1
went	1
Boaz	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
sat	1
him	1
down	1
there:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
kinsman	1
of	1
whom	1
Boaz	1
spake	1
came	1
by;	1
unto	1
whom	1
he	1
said,	1
Ho,	1
such	1
a	1
one!	1
turn	1
aside,	1
sit	1
down	1
here.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
aside,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
ten	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sit	1
ye	1
down	1
here.	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
kinsman,	1
Naomi,	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab,	1
selleth	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
land,	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
brother	1
Elimelech's:	1
4:4	1
And	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
advertise	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Buy	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
redeem	1
it,	1
redeem	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
tell	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
redeem	1
it	1
beside	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
after	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
it.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Boaz,	1
What	1
day	1
thou	1
buyest	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Naomi,	1
thou	1
must	1
buy	1
it	1
also	1
of	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
upon	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
kinsman	1
said,	1
I	1
cannot	1
redeem	1
it	1
for	1
myself,	1
lest	1
I	1
mar	1
mine	1
own	1
inheritance:	1
redeem	1
thou	1
my	1
right	1
to	1
thyself;	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
redeem	1
it.	1
	1
4:7	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
former	1
time	1
in	1
Israel	1
concerning	1
redeeming	1
and	1
concerning	1
changing,	1
for	1
to	1
confirm	1
all	1
things;	1
a	1
man	1
plucked	1
off	1
his	1
shoe,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
testimony	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:8	1
Therefore	1
the	1
kinsman	1
said	1
unto	1
Boaz,	1
Buy	1
it	1
for	1
thee.	1
So	1
he	1
drew	1
off	1
his	1
shoe.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
Boaz	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
are	1
witnesses	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
Elimelech's,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
Chilion's	1
and	1
Mahlon's,	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Naomi.	1
	1
4:10	1
Moreover	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Mahlon,	1
have	1
I	1
purchased	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
wife,	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
upon	1
his	1
inheritance,	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
be	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
place:	1
ye	1
are	1
witnesses	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
said,	1
We	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
The	1
LORD	1
make	1
the	1
woman	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
thine	1
house	1
like	1
Rachel	1
and	1
like	1
Leah,	1
which	1
two	1
did	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
do	1
thou	1
worthily	1
in	1
Ephratah,	1
and	1
be	1
famous	1
in	1
Bethlehem:	1
4:12	1
And	1
let	1
thy	1
house	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pharez,	1
whom	1
Tamar	1
bare	1
unto	1
Judah,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
woman.	1
	1
4:13	1
So	1
Boaz	1
took	1
Ruth,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
her	1
conception,	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
said	1
unto	1
Naomi,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
without	1
a	1
kinsman,	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
may	1
be	1
famous	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
restorer	1
of	1
thy	1
life,	1
and	1
a	1
nourisher	1
of	1
thine	1
old	1
age:	1
for	1
thy	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
which	1
loveth	1
thee,	1
which	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
thee	1
than	1
seven	1
sons,	1
hath	1
born	1
him.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
Naomi	1
took	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
bosom,	1
and	1
became	1
nurse	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
her	1
neighbours	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
name,	1
saying,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
born	1
to	1
Naomi;	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Obed:	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
4:18	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Pharez:	1
Pharez	1
begat	1
Hezron,	1
4:19	1
And	1
Hezron	1
begat	1
Ram,	1
and	1
Ram	1
begat	1
Amminadab,	1
4:20	1
And	1
Amminadab	1
begat	1
Nahshon,	1
and	1
Nahshon	1
begat	1
Salmon,	1
4:21	1
And	1
Salmon	1
begat	1
Boaz,	1
and	1
Boaz	1
begat	1
Obed,	1
4:22	1
And	1
Obed	1
begat	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
Jesse	1
begat	1
David.	1

The	1
First	1
Book	1
of	1
Samuel	1
	1
Otherwise	1
Called:	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
Ramathaimzophim,	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Elkanah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeroham,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Elihu,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tohu,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zuph,	1
an	1
Ephrathite:	1
1:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
wives;	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Hannah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Peninnah:	1
and	1
Peninnah	1
had	1
children,	1
but	1
Hannah	1
had	1
no	1
children.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
this	1
man	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
city	1
yearly	1
to	1
worship	1
and	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
Shiloh.	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Eli,	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
were	1
there.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
that	1
Elkanah	1
offered,	1
he	1
gave	1
to	1
Peninnah	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
sons	1
and	1
her	1
daughters,	1
portions:	1
1:5	1
But	1
unto	1
Hannah	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
worthy	1
portion;	1
for	1
he	1
loved	1
Hannah:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
shut	1
up	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
her	1
adversary	1
also	1
provoked	1
her	1
sore,	1
for	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
fret,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
shut	1
up	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
year	1
by	1
year,	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
so	1
she	1
provoked	1
her;	1
therefore	1
she	1
wept,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
eat.	1
	1
1:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Elkanah	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
her,	1
Hannah,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
and	1
why	1
eatest	1
thou	1
not?	1
and	1
why	1
is	1
thy	1
heart	1
grieved?	1
am	1
not	1
I	1
better	1
to	1
thee	1
than	1
ten	1
sons?	1
	1
1:9	1
So	1
Hannah	1
rose	1
up	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
in	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
drunk.	1
Now	1
Eli	1
the	1
priest	1
sat	1
upon	1
a	1
seat	1
by	1
a	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
bitterness	1
of	1
soul,	1
and	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
wept	1
sore.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
she	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
indeed	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
remember	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
forget	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
but	1
wilt	1
give	1
unto	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
a	1
man	1
child,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
razor	1
come	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
she	1
continued	1
praying	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
Eli	1
marked	1
her	1
mouth.	1
	1
1:13	1
Now	1
Hannah,	1
she	1
spake	1
in	1
her	1
heart;	1
only	1
her	1
lips	1
moved,	1
but	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
not	1
heard:	1
therefore	1
Eli	1
thought	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
drunken.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
Eli	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
drunken?	1
put	1
away	1
thy	1
wine	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
Hannah	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
No,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
spirit:	1
I	1
have	1
drunk	1
neither	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink,	1
but	1
have	1
poured	1
out	1
my	1
soul	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:16	1
Count	1
not	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
for	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
Belial:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
my	1
complaint	1
and	1
grief	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
hitherto.	1
	1
1:17	1
Then	1
Eli	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
grant	1
thee	1
thy	1
petition	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
asked	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Let	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
So	1
the	1
woman	1
went	1
her	1
way,	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
her	1
countenance	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
sad.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
early,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
returned,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
house	1
to	1
Ramah:	1
and	1
Elkanah	1
knew	1
Hannah	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
remembered	1
her.	1
	1
1:20	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come	1
about	1
after	1
Hannah	1
had	1
conceived,	1
that	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Samuel,	1
saying,	1
Because	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
Elkanah,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
yearly	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
his	1
vow.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
Hannah	1
went	1
not	1
up;	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
husband,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
until	1
the	1
child	1
be	1
weaned,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
there	1
abide	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
Elkanah	1
her	1
husband	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Do	1
what	1
seemeth	1
thee	1
good;	1
tarry	1
until	1
thou	1
have	1
weaned	1
him;	1
only	1
the	1
LORD	1
establish	1
his	1
word.	1
So	1
the	1
woman	1
abode,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
son	1
suck	1
until	1
she	1
weaned	1
him.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
weaned	1
him,	1
she	1
took	1
him	1
up	1
with	1
her,	1
with	1
three	1
bullocks,	1
and	1
one	1
ephah	1
of	1
flour,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Shiloh:	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
young.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
they	1
slew	1
a	1
bullock,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
child	1
to	1
Eli.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Oh	1
my	1
lord,	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
woman	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
thee	1
here,	1
praying	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:27	1
For	1
this	1
child	1
I	1
prayed;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
my	1
petition	1
which	1
I	1
asked	1
of	1
him:	1
1:28	1
Therefore	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
lent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
lent	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
he	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD	1
there.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
Hannah	1
prayed,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
heart	1
rejoiceth	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
mine	1
horn	1
is	1
exalted	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
my	1
mouth	1
is	1
enlarged	1
over	1
mine	1
enemies;	1
because	1
I	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
salvation.	1
	1
2:2	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
holy	1
as	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
thee:	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
rock	1
like	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
2:3	1
Talk	1
no	1
more	1
so	1
exceeding	1
proudly;	1
let	1
not	1
arrogancy	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
actions	1
are	1
weighed.	1
	1
2:4	1
The	1
bows	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
are	1
broken,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
stumbled	1
are	1
girded	1
with	1
strength.	1
	1
2:5	1
They	1
that	1
were	1
full	1
have	1
hired	1
out	1
themselves	1
for	1
bread;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
hungry	1
ceased:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
barren	1
hath	1
born	1
seven;	1
and	1
she	1
that	1
hath	1
many	1
children	1
is	1
waxed	1
feeble.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
killeth,	1
and	1
maketh	1
alive:	1
he	1
bringeth	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
up.	1
	1
2:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
maketh	1
poor,	1
and	1
maketh	1
rich:	1
he	1
bringeth	1
low,	1
and	1
lifteth	1
up.	1
	1
2:8	1
He	1
raiseth	1
up	1
the	1
poor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
lifteth	1
up	1
the	1
beggar	1
from	1
the	1
dunghill,	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
among	1
princes,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
inherit	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
glory:	1
for	1
the	1
pillars	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
the	1
LORD's,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
the	1
world	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
2:9	1
He	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
his	1
saints,	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
silent	1
in	1
darkness;	1
for	1
by	1
strength	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
prevail.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
to	1
pieces;	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
he	1
thunder	1
upon	1
them:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
strength	1
unto	1
his	1
king,	1
and	1
exalt	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
his	1
anointed.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
Elkanah	1
went	1
to	1
Ramah	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
Eli	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
2:12	1
Now	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eli	1
were	1
sons	1
of	1
Belial;	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
priest's	1
custom	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
was,	1
that,	1
when	1
any	1
man	1
offered	1
sacrifice,	1
the	1
priest's	1
servant	1
came,	1
while	1
the	1
flesh	1
was	1
in	1
seething,	1
with	1
a	1
fleshhook	1
of	1
three	1
teeth	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
2:14	1
And	1
he	1
struck	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pan,	1
or	1
kettle,	1
or	1
caldron,	1
or	1
pot;	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
fleshhook	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
for	1
himself.	1
So	1
they	1
did	1
in	1
Shiloh	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
that	1
came	1
thither.	1
	1
2:15	1
Also	1
before	1
they	1
burnt	1
the	1
fat,	1
the	1
priest's	1
servant	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
sacrificed,	1
Give	1
flesh	1
to	1
roast	1
for	1
the	1
priest;	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
sodden	1
flesh	1
of	1
thee,	1
but	1
raw.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
them	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
fat	1
presently,	1
and	1
then	1
take	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
desireth;	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
answer	1
him,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
it	1
me	1
now:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
force.	1
	1
2:17	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
was	1
very	1
great	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
men	1
abhorred	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:18	1
But	1
Samuel	1
ministered	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
being	1
a	1
child,	1
girded	1
with	1
a	1
linen	1
ephod.	1
	1
2:19	1
Moreover	1
his	1
mother	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
coat,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year,	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
yearly	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
Eli	1
blessed	1
Elkanah	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
give	1
thee	1
seed	1
of	1
this	1
woman	1
for	1
the	1
loan	1
which	1
is	1
lent	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
visited	1
Hannah,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
three	1
sons	1
and	1
two	1
daughters.	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
Samuel	1
grew	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:22	1
Now	1
Eli	1
was	1
very	1
old,	1
and	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
sons	1
did	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel;	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
lay	1
with	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
assembled	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
such	1
things?	1
for	1
I	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
evil	1
dealings	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
2:24	1
Nay,	1
my	1
sons;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
report	1
that	1
I	1
hear:	1
ye	1
make	1
the	1
LORD's	1
people	1
to	1
transgress.	1
	1
2:25	1
If	1
one	1
man	1
sin	1
against	1
another,	1
the	1
judge	1
shall	1
judge	1
him:	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
shall	1
intreat	1
for	1
him?	1
Notwithstanding	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
their	1
father,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
slay	1
them.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
Samuel	1
grew	1
on,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
favour	1
both	1
with	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
men.	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
Eli,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Did	1
I	1
plainly	1
appear	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
Egypt	1
in	1
Pharaoh's	1
house?	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
did	1
I	1
choose	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
priest,	1
to	1
offer	1
upon	1
mine	1
altar,	1
to	1
burn	1
incense,	1
to	1
wear	1
an	1
ephod	1
before	1
me?	1
and	1
did	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
all	1
the	1
offerings	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
2:29	1
Wherefore	1
kick	1
ye	1
at	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
at	1
mine	1
offering,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
in	1
my	1
habitation;	1
and	1
honourest	1
thy	1
sons	1
above	1
me,	1
to	1
make	1
yourselves	1
fat	1
with	1
the	1
chiefest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
Israel	1
my	1
people?	1
	1
2:30	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
saith,	1
I	1
said	1
indeed	1
that	1
thy	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
should	1
walk	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith,	1
Be	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
honour	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
honour,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
despise	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
lightly	1
esteemed.	1
	1
2:31	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
thine	1
arm,	1
and	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
2:32	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
an	1
enemy	1
in	1
my	1
habitation,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wealth	1
which	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
Israel:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:33	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
thine,	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
mine	1
altar,	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
consume	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
grieve	1
thine	1
heart:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
thine	1
house	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
their	1
age.	1
	1
2:34	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thy	1
two	1
sons,	1
on	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas;	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
they	1
shall	1
die	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:35	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
me	1
up	1
a	1
faithful	1
priest,	1
that	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
mind:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
him	1
a	1
sure	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
walk	1
before	1
mine	1
anointed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:36	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
crouch	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
shall	1
say,	1
Put	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests'	1
offices,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
Samuel	1
ministered	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
Eli.	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
precious	1
in	1
those	1
days;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
open	1
vision.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
Eli	1
was	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
began	1
to	1
wax	1
dim,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see;	1
3:3	1
And	1
ere	1
the	1
lamp	1
of	1
God	1
went	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
where	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was,	1
and	1
Samuel	1
was	1
laid	1
down	1
to	1
sleep;	1
3:4	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
Samuel:	1
and	1
he	1
answered,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
unto	1
Eli,	1
and	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
for	1
thou	1
calledst	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
called	1
not;	1
lie	1
down	1
again.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
lay	1
down.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
yet	1
again,	1
Samuel.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Eli,	1
and	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
for	1
thou	1
didst	1
call	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
called	1
not,	1
my	1
son;	1
lie	1
down	1
again.	1
	1
3:7	1
Now	1
Samuel	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
yet	1
revealed	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
Samuel	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
time.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Eli,	1
and	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
for	1
thou	1
didst	1
call	1
me.	1
And	1
Eli	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
child.	1
	1
3:9	1
Therefore	1
Eli	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Go,	1
lie	1
down:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
he	1
call	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
Speak,	1
LORD;	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
heareth.	1
So	1
Samuel	1
went	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came,	1
and	1
stood,	1
and	1
called	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
Samuel,	1
Samuel.	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
answered,	1
Speak;	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
heareth.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Samuel,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
Israel,	1
at	1
which	1
both	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
heareth	1
it	1
shall	1
tingle.	1
	1
3:12	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
I	1
will	1
perform	1
against	1
Eli	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
his	1
house:	1
when	1
I	1
begin,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
make	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
3:13	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
his	1
house	1
for	1
ever	1
for	1
the	1
iniquity	1
which	1
he	1
knoweth;	1
because	1
his	1
sons	1
made	1
themselves	1
vile,	1
and	1
he	1
restrained	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Eli,	1
that	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Eli's	1
house	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
purged	1
with	1
sacrifice	1
nor	1
offering	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
Samuel	1
lay	1
until	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
feared	1
to	1
shew	1
Eli	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
3:16	1
Then	1
Eli	1
called	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Samuel,	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee?	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
hide	1
it	1
not	1
from	1
me:	1
God	1
do	1
so	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
thou	1
hide	1
any	1
thing	1
from	1
me	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
Samuel	1
told	1
him	1
every	1
whit,	1
and	1
hid	1
nothing	1
from	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
LORD:	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
seemeth	1
him	1
good.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
Samuel	1
grew,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
did	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba	1
knew	1
that	1
Samuel	1
was	1
established	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
again	1
in	1
Shiloh:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
revealed	1
himself	1
to	1
Samuel	1
in	1
Shiloh	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Samuel	1
came	1
to	1
all	1
Israel.	1
Now	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines	1
to	1
battle,	1
and	1
pitched	1
beside	1
Ebenezer:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
pitched	1
in	1
Aphek.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
joined	1
battle,	1
Israel	1
was	1
smitten	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
about	1
four	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
smitten	1
us	1
to	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
Let	1
us	1
fetch	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
Shiloh	1
unto	1
us,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
cometh	1
among	1
us,	1
it	1
may	1
save	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies.	1
	1
4:4	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
sent	1
to	1
Shiloh,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
from	1
thence	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims:	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Eli,	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas,	1
were	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
all	1
Israel	1
shouted	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
shout,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
rang	1
again.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
shout,	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
shout	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews?	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
afraid,	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Woe	1
unto	1
us!	1
for	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
heretofore.	1
	1
4:8	1
Woe	1
unto	1
us!	1
who	1
shall	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
these	1
mighty	1
Gods?	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
Gods	1
that	1
smote	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
plagues	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
4:9	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
quit	1
yourselves	1
like	1
men,	1
O	1
ye	1
Philistines,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
servants	1
unto	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
you:	1
quit	1
yourselves	1
like	1
men,	1
and	1
fight.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fought,	1
and	1
Israel	1
was	1
smitten,	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
every	1
man	1
into	1
his	1
tent:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
slaughter;	1
for	1
there	1
fell	1
of	1
Israel	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
footmen.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
taken;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Eli,	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas,	1
were	1
slain.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
there	1
ran	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Shiloh	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
with	1
his	1
clothes	1
rent,	1
and	1
with	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
lo,	1
Eli	1
sat	1
upon	1
a	1
seat	1
by	1
the	1
wayside	1
watching:	1
for	1
his	1
heart	1
trembled	1
for	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
told	1
it,	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
cried	1
out.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
when	1
Eli	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
crying,	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
this	1
tumult?	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
came	1
in	1
hastily,	1
and	1
told	1
Eli.	1
	1
4:15	1
Now	1
Eli	1
was	1
ninety	1
and	1
eight	1
years	1
old;	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
dim,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
Eli,	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
I	1
fled	1
to	1
day	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
done,	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
the	1
messenger	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Israel	1
is	1
fled	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
there	1
hath	1
been	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
thy	1
two	1
sons	1
also,	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas,	1
are	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
taken.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
seat	1
backward	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
his	1
neck	1
brake,	1
and	1
he	1
died:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
heavy.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
judged	1
Israel	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
Phinehas'	1
wife,	1
was	1
with	1
child,	1
near	1
to	1
be	1
delivered:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
tidings	1
that	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
were	1
dead,	1
she	1
bowed	1
herself	1
and	1
travailed;	1
for	1
her	1
pains	1
came	1
upon	1
her.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
death	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
her	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
born	1
a	1
son.	1
But	1
she	1
answered	1
not,	1
neither	1
did	1
she	1
regard	1
it.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
she	1
named	1
the	1
child	1
Ichabod,	1
saying,	1
The	1
glory	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
Israel:	1
because	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
The	1
glory	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
taken.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
took	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
from	1
Ebenezer	1
unto	1
Ashdod.	1
	1
5:2	1
When	1
the	1
Philistines	1
took	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
brought	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Dagon,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
by	1
Dagon.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
of	1
Ashdod	1
arose	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
behold,	1
Dagon	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Dagon,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
again.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
arose	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
Dagon	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Dagon	1
and	1
both	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
upon	1
the	1
threshold;	1
only	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
Dagon	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
5:5	1
Therefore	1
neither	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
Dagon,	1
nor	1
any	1
that	1
come	1
into	1
Dagon's	1
house,	1
tread	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
Dagon	1
in	1
Ashdod	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
heavy	1
upon	1
them	1
of	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
he	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
emerods,	1
even	1
Ashdod	1
and	1
the	1
coasts	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ashdod	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
not	1
abide	1
with	1
us:	1
for	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
sore	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
upon	1
Dagon	1
our	1
god.	1
	1
5:8	1
They	1
sent	1
therefore	1
and	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
Let	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
carried	1
about	1
unto	1
Gath.	1
And	1
they	1
carried	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
about	1
thither.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
carried	1
it	1
about,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
destruction:	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
emerods	1
in	1
their	1
secret	1
parts.	1
	1
5:10	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sent	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
Ekron.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
Ekron,	1
that	1
the	1
Ekronites	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
They	1
have	1
brought	1
about	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
us,	1
to	1
slay	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
people.	1
	1
5:11	1
So	1
they	1
sent	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
said,	1
Send	1
away	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
place,	1
that	1
it	1
slay	1
us	1
not,	1
and	1
our	1
people:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deadly	1
destruction	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
city;	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
very	1
heavy	1
there.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
died	1
not	1
were	1
smitten	1
with	1
the	1
emerods:	1
and	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
seven	1
months.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
diviners,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
to	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
tell	1
us	1
wherewith	1
we	1
shall	1
send	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
If	1
ye	1
send	1
away	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
send	1
it	1
not	1
empty;	1
but	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
return	1
him	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
healed,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
why	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
not	1
removed	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
6:4	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
him?	1
They	1
answered,	1
Five	1
golden	1
emerods,	1
and	1
five	1
golden	1
mice,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
for	1
one	1
plague	1
was	1
on	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
on	1
your	1
lords.	1
	1
6:5	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
make	1
images	1
of	1
your	1
emerods,	1
and	1
images	1
of	1
your	1
mice	1
that	1
mar	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
glory	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel:	1
peradventure	1
he	1
will	1
lighten	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
off	1
you,	1
and	1
from	1
off	1
your	1
gods,	1
and	1
from	1
off	1
your	1
land.	1
	1
6:6	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
do	1
ye	1
harden	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
Pharaoh	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts?	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
wrought	1
wonderfully	1
among	1
them,	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go,	1
and	1
they	1
departed?	1
	1
6:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
cart,	1
and	1
take	1
two	1
milch	1
kine,	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
hath	1
come	1
no	1
yoke,	1
and	1
tie	1
the	1
kine	1
to	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
bring	1
their	1
calves	1
home	1
from	1
them:	1
6:8	1
And	1
take	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
cart;	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
which	1
ye	1
return	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering,	1
in	1
a	1
coffer	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
thereof;	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
away,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
go.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
see,	1
if	1
it	1
goeth	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
coast	1
to	1
Bethshemesh,	1
then	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
us	1
this	1
great	1
evil:	1
but	1
if	1
not,	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
smote	1
us:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
chance	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
did	1
so;	1
and	1
took	1
two	1
milch	1
kine,	1
and	1
tied	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
shut	1
up	1
their	1
calves	1
at	1
home:	1
6:11	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
upon	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
the	1
coffer	1
with	1
the	1
mice	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
the	1
images	1
of	1
their	1
emerods.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
kine	1
took	1
the	1
straight	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Bethshemesh,	1
and	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
highway,	1
lowing	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
turned	1
not	1
aside	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left;	1
and	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
after	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Bethshemesh.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
Bethshemesh	1
were	1
reaping	1
their	1
wheat	1
harvest	1
in	1
the	1
valley:	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
cart	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Joshua,	1
a	1
Bethshemite,	1
and	1
stood	1
there,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
stone:	1
and	1
they	1
clave	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
offered	1
the	1
kine	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
took	1
down	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
coffer	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
it,	1
wherein	1
the	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold	1
were,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
stone:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Bethshemesh	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
sacrifices	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
five	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Ekron	1
the	1
same	1
day.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
golden	1
emerods	1
which	1
the	1
Philistines	1
returned	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
Ashdod	1
one,	1
for	1
Gaza	1
one,	1
for	1
Askelon	1
one,	1
for	1
Gath	1
one,	1
for	1
Ekron	1
one;	1
6:18	1
And	1
the	1
golden	1
mice,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
five	1
lords,	1
both	1
of	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
of	1
country	1
villages,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
stone	1
of	1
Abel,	1
whereon	1
they	1
set	1
down	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
which	1
stone	1
remaineth	1
unto	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Joshua,	1
the	1
Bethshemite.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Bethshemesh,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
he	1
smote	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
men:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
lamented,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
smitten	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Bethshemesh	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
this	1
holy	1
LORD	1
God?	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
shall	1
he	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
us?	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
have	1
brought	1
again	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
come	1
ye	1
down,	1
and	1
fetch	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Kirjathjearim	1
came,	1
and	1
fetched	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abinadab	1
in	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
the	1
ark	1
abode	1
in	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
long;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
twenty	1
years:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
lamented	1
after	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
Samuel	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
If	1
ye	1
do	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
hearts,	1
then	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
and	1
Ashtaroth	1
from	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
prepare	1
your	1
hearts	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
only:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
put	1
away	1
Baalim	1
and	1
Ashtaroth,	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
LORD	1
only.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
Gather	1
all	1
Israel	1
to	1
Mizpeh,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
for	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
Mizpeh,	1
and	1
drew	1
water,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
fasted	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
said	1
there,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
judged	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
Mizpeh,	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
up	1
against	1
Israel.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
to	1
Samuel,	1
Cease	1
not	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
save	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
Samuel	1
took	1
a	1
sucking	1
lamb,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
wholly	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
Samuel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
Israel;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
him.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
as	1
Samuel	1
was	1
offering	1
up	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
the	1
Philistines	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
Israel:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
thundered	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
thunder	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
upon	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
discomfited	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
before	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Mizpeh,	1
and	1
pursued	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
smote	1
them,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
under	1
Bethcar.	1
	1
7:12	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
took	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
between	1
Mizpeh	1
and	1
Shen,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Ebenezer,	1
saying,	1
Hitherto	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
helped	1
us.	1
	1
7:13	1
So	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
subdued,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
no	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Samuel.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
Israel	1
were	1
restored	1
to	1
Israel,	1
from	1
Ekron	1
even	1
unto	1
Gath;	1
and	1
the	1
coasts	1
thereof	1
did	1
Israel	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
between	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
Samuel	1
judged	1
Israel	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year	1
in	1
circuit	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
Mizpeh,	1
and	1
judged	1
Israel	1
in	1
all	1
those	1
places.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
his	1
return	1
was	1
to	1
Ramah;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Samuel	1
was	1
old,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
sons	1
judges	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:2	1
Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
firstborn	1
was	1
Joel;	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
second,	1
Abiah:	1
they	1
were	1
judges	1
in	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
his	1
sons	1
walked	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
but	1
turned	1
aside	1
after	1
lucre,	1
and	1
took	1
bribes,	1
and	1
perverted	1
judgment.	1
	1
8:4	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Samuel	1
unto	1
Ramah,	1
8:5	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
old,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
walk	1
not	1
in	1
thy	1
ways:	1
now	1
make	1
us	1
a	1
king	1
to	1
judge	1
us	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
8:6	1
But	1
the	1
thing	1
displeased	1
Samuel,	1
when	1
they	1
said,	1
Give	1
us	1
a	1
king	1
to	1
judge	1
us.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
rejected	1
thee,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
rejected	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
reign	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
8:8	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
served	1
other	1
gods,	1
so	1
do	1
they	1
also	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
8:9	1
Now	1
therefore	1
hearken	1
unto	1
their	1
voice:	1
howbeit	1
yet	1
protest	1
solemnly	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
shew	1
them	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
Samuel	1
told	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
you:	1
He	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
appoint	1
them	1
for	1
himself,	1
for	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
horsemen;	1
and	1
some	1
shall	1
run	1
before	1
his	1
chariots.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
appoint	1
him	1
captains	1
over	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
fifties;	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
ear	1
his	1
ground,	1
and	1
to	1
reap	1
his	1
harvest,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
instruments	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
instruments	1
of	1
his	1
chariots.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
daughters	1
to	1
be	1
confectionaries,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
cooks,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
bakers.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
fields,	1
and	1
your	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
your	1
oliveyards,	1
even	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
your	1
seed,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
his	1
officers,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
menservants,	1
and	1
your	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
your	1
goodliest	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
your	1
asses,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
8:17	1
He	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
your	1
sheep:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
cry	1
out	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
king	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
chosen	1
you;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
8:19	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
refused	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Samuel;	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
us;	1
8:20	1
That	1
we	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
nations;	1
and	1
that	1
our	1
king	1
may	1
judge	1
us,	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
before	1
us,	1
and	1
fight	1
our	1
battles.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
Samuel	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
rehearsed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Samuel,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
a	1
king.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Go	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
city.	1
	1
9:1	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Kish,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiel,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeror,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bechorath,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aphiah,	1
a	1
Benjamite,	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
power.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
son,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Saul,	1
a	1
choice	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
goodly:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
a	1
goodlier	1
person	1
than	1
he:	1
from	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
upward	1
he	1
was	1
higher	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
the	1
asses	1
of	1
Kish	1
Saul's	1
father	1
were	1
lost.	1
And	1
Kish	1
said	1
to	1
Saul	1
his	1
son,	1
Take	1
now	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
arise,	1
go	1
seek	1
the	1
asses.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shalisha,	1
but	1
they	1
found	1
them	1
not:	1
then	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shalim,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
not:	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Benjamites,	1
but	1
they	1
found	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zuph,	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servant	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
return;	1
lest	1
my	1
father	1
leave	1
caring	1
for	1
the	1
asses,	1
and	1
take	1
thought	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
honourable	1
man;	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
cometh	1
surely	1
to	1
pass:	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
thither;	1
peradventure	1
he	1
can	1
shew	1
us	1
our	1
way	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
go.	1
	1
9:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
But,	1
behold,	1
if	1
we	1
go,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
bring	1
the	1
man?	1
for	1
the	1
bread	1
is	1
spent	1
in	1
our	1
vessels,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God:	1
what	1
have	1
we?	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
answered	1
Saul	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
at	1
hand	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
shekel	1
of	1
silver:	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
our	1
way.	1
	1
9:9	1
(Beforetime	1
in	1
Israel,	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
went	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
God,	1
thus	1
he	1
spake,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
seer:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
now	1
called	1
a	1
Prophet	1
was	1
beforetime	1
called	1
a	1
Seer.)	1
	1
9:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
Well	1
said;	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
go.	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
was.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
they	1
found	1
young	1
maidens	1
going	1
out	1
to	1
draw	1
water,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
the	1
seer	1
here?	1
9:12	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
is;	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
before	1
you:	1
make	1
haste	1
now,	1
for	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
city;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
place:	1
9:13	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
ye	1
shall	1
straightway	1
find	1
him,	1
before	1
he	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
to	1
eat:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
not	1
eat	1
until	1
he	1
come,	1
because	1
he	1
doth	1
bless	1
the	1
sacrifice;	1
and	1
afterwards	1
they	1
eat	1
that	1
be	1
bidden.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
get	1
you	1
up;	1
for	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
him.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
behold,	1
Samuel	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
them,	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
place.	1
	1
9:15	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
told	1
Samuel	1
in	1
his	1
ear	1
a	1
day	1
before	1
Saul	1
came,	1
saying,	1
9:16	1
To	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
a	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
save	1
my	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
upon	1
my	1
people,	1
because	1
their	1
cry	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
when	1
Samuel	1
saw	1
Saul,	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
spake	1
to	1
thee	1
of!	1
this	1
same	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
9:18	1
Then	1
Saul	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
Samuel	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
said,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
where	1
the	1
seer's	1
house	1
is.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
Samuel	1
answered	1
Saul,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
seer:	1
go	1
up	1
before	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
place;	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
thee	1
go,	1
and	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
thine	1
asses	1
that	1
were	1
lost	1
three	1
days	1
ago,	1
set	1
not	1
thy	1
mind	1
on	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
found.	1
And	1
on	1
whom	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
Israel?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
on	1
thee,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
thy	1
father's	1
house?	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
Saul	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Am	1
not	1
I	1
a	1
Benjamite,	1
of	1
the	1
smallest	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel?	1
and	1
my	1
family	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin?	1
wherefore	1
then	1
speakest	1
thou	1
so	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
Samuel	1
took	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
parlour,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
chiefest	1
place	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
bidden,	1
which	1
were	1
about	1
thirty	1
persons.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
cook,	1
Bring	1
the	1
portion	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
thee,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Set	1
it	1
by	1
thee.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
the	1
cook	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
Saul.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
Behold	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
left!	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
eat:	1
for	1
unto	1
this	1
time	1
hath	1
it	1
been	1
kept	1
for	1
thee	1
since	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
invited	1
the	1
people.	1
So	1
Saul	1
did	1
eat	1
with	1
Samuel	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
Samuel	1
communed	1
with	1
Saul	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
they	1
arose	1
early:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
that	1
Samuel	1
called	1
Saul	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Up,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
send	1
thee	1
away.	1
And	1
Saul	1
arose,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
and	1
Samuel,	1
abroad.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
Samuel	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Bid	1
the	1
servant	1
pass	1
on	1
before	1
us,	1
(and	1
he	1
passed	1
on),	1
but	1
stand	1
thou	1
still	1
a	1
while,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:1	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
took	1
a	1
vial	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
anointed	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
over	1
his	1
inheritance?	1
	1
10:2	1
When	1
thou	1
art	1
departed	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
day,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
two	1
men	1
by	1
Rachel's	1
sepulchre	1
in	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
at	1
Zelzah;	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
The	1
asses	1
which	1
thou	1
wentest	1
to	1
seek	1
are	1
found:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
thy	1
father	1
hath	1
left	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
asses,	1
and	1
sorroweth	1
for	1
you,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
10:3	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go	1
on	1
forward	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Tabor,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
meet	1
thee	1
three	1
men	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
one	1
carrying	1
three	1
kids,	1
and	1
another	1
carrying	1
three	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
another	1
carrying	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine:	1
10:4	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
salute	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
two	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread;	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
receive	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
10:5	1
After	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
God,	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
thither	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
meet	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
prophets	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
with	1
a	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
a	1
tabret,	1
and	1
a	1
pipe,	1
and	1
a	1
harp,	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy:	1
10:6	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prophesy	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
let	1
it	1
be,	1
when	1
these	1
signs	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
do	1
as	1
occasion	1
serve	1
thee;	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
down	1
before	1
me	1
to	1
Gilgal;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings:	1
seven	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
tarry,	1
till	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
shew	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
go	1
from	1
Samuel,	1
God	1
gave	1
him	1
another	1
heart:	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
signs	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
thither	1
to	1
the	1
hill,	1
behold,	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
prophets	1
met	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
prophesied	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
that	1
knew	1
him	1
beforetime	1
saw	1
that,	1
behold,	1
he	1
prophesied	1
among	1
the	1
prophets,	1
then	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kish?	1
Is	1
Saul	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
prophets?	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
But	1
who	1
is	1
their	1
father?	1
Therefore	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
proverb,	1
Is	1
Saul	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
prophets?	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
prophesying,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
place.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
Saul's	1
uncle	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
Whither	1
went	1
ye?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
To	1
seek	1
the	1
asses:	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
where,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Samuel.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
Saul's	1
uncle	1
said,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
what	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
uncle,	1
He	1
told	1
us	1
plainly	1
that	1
the	1
asses	1
were	1
found.	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
whereof	1
Samuel	1
spake,	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
Samuel	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Mizpeh;	1
10:18	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
oppressed	1
you:	1
10:19	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
this	1
day	1
rejected	1
your	1
God,	1
who	1
himself	1
saved	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
adversities	1
and	1
your	1
tribulations;	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Nay,	1
but	1
set	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
us.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
present	1
yourselves	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
your	1
tribes,	1
and	1
by	1
your	1
thousands.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
when	1
Samuel	1
had	1
caused	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
come	1
near,	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
10:21	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
by	1
their	1
families,	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Matri	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
Saul	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kish	1
was	1
taken:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
sought	1
him,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
10:22	1
Therefore	1
they	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
further,	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
should	1
yet	1
come	1
thither.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered,	1
Behold	1
he	1
hath	1
hid	1
himself	1
among	1
the	1
stuff.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
they	1
ran	1
and	1
fetched	1
him	1
thence:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
was	1
higher	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
upward.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
See	1
ye	1
him	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chosen,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
him	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people?	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shouted,	1
and	1
said,	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
10:25	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
told	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
wrote	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
sent	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
away,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
Saul	1
also	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
Gibeah;	1
and	1
there	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
men,	1
whose	1
hearts	1
God	1
had	1
touched.	1
	1
10:27	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Belial	1
said,	1
How	1
shall	1
this	1
man	1
save	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
despised	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
no	1
presents.	1
But	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
11:1	1
Then	1
Nahash	1
the	1
Ammonite	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
encamped	1
against	1
Jabeshgilead:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
said	1
unto	1
Nahash,	1
Make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
serve	1
thee.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
Nahash	1
the	1
Ammonite	1
answered	1
them,	1
On	1
this	1
condition	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
thrust	1
out	1
all	1
your	1
right	1
eyes,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
reproach	1
upon	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
us	1
seven	1
days'	1
respite,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
send	1
messengers	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
then,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
save	1
us,	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
thee.	1
	1
11:4	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
messengers	1
to	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
tidings	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
11:5	1
And,	1
behold,	1
Saul	1
came	1
after	1
the	1
herd	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
Saul	1
said,	1
What	1
aileth	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
weep?	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
tidings	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabesh.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
Saul	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
those	1
tidings,	1
and	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
greatly.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
hewed	1
them	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
messengers,	1
saying,	1
Whosoever	1
cometh	1
not	1
forth	1
after	1
Saul	1
and	1
after	1
Samuel,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
his	1
oxen.	1
And	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
one	1
consent.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
numbered	1
them	1
in	1
Bezek,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
thirty	1
thousand.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
messengers	1
that	1
came,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead,	1
To	1
morrow,	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
hot,	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
help.	1
And	1
the	1
messengers	1
came	1
and	1
shewed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabesh;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
glad.	1
	1
11:10	1
Therefore	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
said,	1
To	1
morrow	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
with	1
us	1
all	1
that	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Saul	1
put	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
three	1
companies;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
watch,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
Ammonites	1
until	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
remained	1
were	1
scattered,	1
so	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
not	1
left	1
together.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
said,	1
Shall	1
Saul	1
reign	1
over	1
us?	1
bring	1
the	1
men,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
this	1
day:	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
wrought	1
salvation	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Samuel	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
renew	1
the	1
kingdom	1
there.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
to	1
Gilgal;	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
made	1
Saul	1
king	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Gilgal;	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
there	1
Saul	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
rejoiced	1
greatly.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
your	1
voice	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
ye	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
you.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
the	1
king	1
walketh	1
before	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
old	1
and	1
grayheaded;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
my	1
sons	1
are	1
with	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
before	1
you	1
from	1
my	1
childhood	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
12:3	1
Behold,	1
here	1
I	1
am:	1
witness	1
against	1
me	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
anointed:	1
whose	1
ox	1
have	1
I	1
taken?	1
or	1
whose	1
ass	1
have	1
I	1
taken?	1
or	1
whom	1
have	1
I	1
defrauded?	1
whom	1
have	1
I	1
oppressed?	1
or	1
of	1
whose	1
hand	1
have	1
I	1
received	1
any	1
bribe	1
to	1
blind	1
mine	1
eyes	1
therewith?	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
not	1
defrauded	1
us,	1
nor	1
oppressed	1
us,	1
neither	1
hast	1
thou	1
taken	1
ought	1
of	1
any	1
man's	1
hand.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
his	1
anointed	1
is	1
witness	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
ought	1
in	1
my	1
hand.	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
He	1
is	1
witness.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
advanced	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
that	1
brought	1
your	1
fathers	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
stand	1
still,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
reason	1
with	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
righteous	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
12:8	1
When	1
Jacob	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
your	1
fathers	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
which	1
brought	1
forth	1
your	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
dwell	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
forgat	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
he	1
sold	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Sisera,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hazor,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
they	1
fought	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
served	1
Baalim	1
and	1
Ashtaroth:	1
but	1
now	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
serve	1
thee.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
Jerubbaal,	1
and	1
Bedan,	1
and	1
Jephthah,	1
and	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
and	1
ye	1
dwelled	1
safe.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
saw	1
that	1
Nahash	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
came	1
against	1
you,	1
ye	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
a	1
king	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
us:	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
was	1
your	1
king.	1
	1
12:13	1
Now	1
therefore	1
behold	1
the	1
king	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
chosen,	1
and	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
desired!	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
set	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
you.	1
	1
12:14	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
obey	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
not	1
rebel	1
against	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
shall	1
both	1
ye	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
reigneth	1
over	1
you	1
continue	1
following	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
12:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
rebel	1
against	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
against	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
against	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
12:16	1
Now	1
therefore	1
stand	1
and	1
see	1
this	1
great	1
thing,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
before	1
your	1
eyes.	1
	1
12:17	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
wheat	1
harvest	1
to	1
day?	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
thunder	1
and	1
rain;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
perceive	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
wickedness	1
is	1
great,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
asking	1
you	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
12:18	1
So	1
Samuel	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
thunder	1
and	1
rain	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
greatly	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
Samuel.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Pray	1
for	1
thy	1
servants	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
die	1
not:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
added	1
unto	1
all	1
our	1
sins	1
this	1
evil,	1
to	1
ask	1
us	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
this	1
wickedness:	1
yet	1
turn	1
not	1
aside	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart;	1
12:21	1
And	1
turn	1
ye	1
not	1
aside:	1
for	1
then	1
should	1
ye	1
go	1
after	1
vain	1
things,	1
which	1
cannot	1
profit	1
nor	1
deliver;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
vain.	1
	1
12:22	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
his	1
people	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
name's	1
sake:	1
because	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
12:23	1
Moreover	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
ceasing	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
you:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
way:	1
12:24	1
Only	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
in	1
truth	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart:	1
for	1
consider	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
12:25	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
still	1
do	1
wickedly,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed,	1
both	1
ye	1
and	1
your	1
king.	1
	1
13:1	1
Saul	1
reigned	1
one	1
year;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
reigned	1
two	1
years	1
over	1
Israel,	1
13:2	1
Saul	1
chose	1
him	1
three	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
Israel;	1
whereof	1
two	1
thousand	1
were	1
with	1
Saul	1
in	1
Michmash	1
and	1
in	1
mount	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
were	1
with	1
Jonathan	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
sent	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
smote	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Geba,	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
Saul	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpet	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
hear.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
Saul	1
had	1
smitten	1
a	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
that	1
Israel	1
also	1
was	1
had	1
in	1
abomination	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
called	1
together	1
after	1
Saul	1
to	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
Israel,	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
chariots,	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
people	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
shore	1
in	1
multitude:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Michmash,	1
eastward	1
from	1
Bethaven.	1
	1
13:6	1
When	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
strait,	1
(for	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
distressed,)	1
then	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
hide	1
themselves	1
in	1
caves,	1
and	1
in	1
thickets,	1
and	1
in	1
rocks,	1
and	1
in	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
in	1
pits.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
Gilead.	1
As	1
for	1
Saul,	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
followed	1
him	1
trembling.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
he	1
tarried	1
seven	1
days,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
set	1
time	1
that	1
Samuel	1
had	1
appointed:	1
but	1
Samuel	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
Gilgal;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
scattered	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Bring	1
hither	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
And	1
he	1
offered	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
offering	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
behold,	1
Samuel	1
came;	1
and	1
Saul	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
salute	1
him.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Because	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
scattered	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
camest	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
days	1
appointed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
at	1
Michmash;	1
13:12	1
Therefore	1
said	1
I,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
now	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
supplication	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
forced	1
myself	1
therefore,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
done	1
foolishly:	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
for	1
now	1
would	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
established	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
now	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
not	1
continue:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sought	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
over	1
his	1
people,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
kept	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
thee.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
Samuel	1
arose,	1
and	1
gat	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
Gilgal	1
unto	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
And	1
Saul	1
numbered	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
with	1
him,	1
about	1
six	1
hundred	1
men.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
Saul,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
with	1
them,	1
abode	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
but	1
the	1
Philistines	1
encamped	1
in	1
Michmash.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
the	1
spoilers	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
in	1
three	1
companies:	1
one	1
company	1
turned	1
unto	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
leadeth	1
to	1
Ophrah,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shual:	1
13:18	1
And	1
another	1
company	1
turned	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Bethhoron:	1
and	1
another	1
company	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
border	1
that	1
looketh	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Zeboim	1
toward	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:19	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
smith	1
found	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
Philistines	1
said,	1
Lest	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
make	1
them	1
swords	1
or	1
spears:	1
13:20	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
to	1
sharpen	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
share,	1
and	1
his	1
coulter,	1
and	1
his	1
axe,	1
and	1
his	1
mattock.	1
	1
13:21	1
Yet	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
file	1
for	1
the	1
mattocks,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
coulters,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
forks,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
axes,	1
and	1
to	1
sharpen	1
the	1
goads.	1
	1
13:22	1
So	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1
sword	1
nor	1
spear	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan:	1
but	1
with	1
Saul	1
and	1
with	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
there	1
found.	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
Michmash.	1
	1
14:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
upon	1
a	1
day,	1
that	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
bare	1
his	1
armour,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Philistines'	1
garrison,	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
But	1
he	1
told	1
not	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
Saul	1
tarried	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
Gibeah	1
under	1
a	1
pomegranate	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Migron:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
about	1
six	1
hundred	1
men;	1
14:3	1
And	1
Ahiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
Ichabod's	1
brother,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eli,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
priest	1
in	1
Shiloh,	1
wearing	1
an	1
ephod.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
Jonathan	1
was	1
gone.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
between	1
the	1
passages,	1
by	1
which	1
Jonathan	1
sought	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
Philistines'	1
garrison,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sharp	1
rock	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
a	1
sharp	1
rock	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Bozez,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Seneh.	1
	1
14:5	1
The	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
situate	1
northward	1
over	1
against	1
Michmash,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
southward	1
over	1
against	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
bare	1
his	1
armour,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
these	1
uncircumcised:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
work	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
restraint	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
save	1
by	1
many	1
or	1
by	1
few.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Do	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
heart:	1
turn	1
thee;	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
heart.	1
	1
14:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Jonathan,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
unto	1
these	1
men,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
discover	1
ourselves	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:9	1
If	1
they	1
say	1
thus	1
unto	1
us,	1
Tarry	1
until	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
you;	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
stand	1
still	1
in	1
our	1
place,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
say	1
thus,	1
Come	1
up	1
unto	1
us;	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
up:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
our	1
hand:	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
discovered	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holes	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
hid	1
themselves.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
garrison	1
answered	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
and	1
said,	1
Come	1
up	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
thing.	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
Come	1
up	1
after	1
me:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
climbed	1
up	1
upon	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
after	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
before	1
Jonathan;	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
slew	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
that	1
first	1
slaughter,	1
which	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
made,	1
was	1
about	1
twenty	1
men,	1
within	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
an	1
half	1
acre	1
of	1
land,	1
which	1
a	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen	1
might	1
plow.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
trembling	1
in	1
the	1
host,	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
the	1
garrison,	1
and	1
the	1
spoilers,	1
they	1
also	1
trembled,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
quaked:	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
trembling.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
the	1
watchmen	1
of	1
Saul	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
looked;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
multitude	1
melted	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
beating	1
down	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
14:17	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
Number	1
now,	1
and	1
see	1
who	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
us.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
numbered,	1
behold,	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
were	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahiah,	1
Bring	1
hither	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God.	1
For	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
Saul	1
talked	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
the	1
noise	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
increased:	1
and	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
Withdraw	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
Saul	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
assembled	1
themselves,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
battle:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
every	1
man's	1
sword	1
was	1
against	1
his	1
fellow,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
discomfiture.	1
	1
14:21	1
Moreover	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines	1
before	1
that	1
time,	1
which	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
camp	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
even	1
they	1
also	1
turned	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
Israelites	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan.	1
	1
14:22	1
Likewise	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
which	1
had	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fled,	1
even	1
they	1
also	1
followed	1
hard	1
after	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
14:23	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
saved	1
Israel	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
passed	1
over	1
unto	1
Bethaven.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
distressed	1
that	1
day:	1
for	1
Saul	1
had	1
adjured	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
eateth	1
any	1
food	1
until	1
evening,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
So	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
tasted	1
any	1
food.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
wood;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
honey	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
wood,	1
behold,	1
the	1
honey	1
dropped;	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
mouth:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
feared	1
the	1
oath.	1
	1
14:27	1
But	1
Jonathan	1
heard	1
not	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
charged	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
oath:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rod	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
dipped	1
it	1
in	1
an	1
honeycomb,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
mouth;	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
enlightened.	1
	1
14:28	1
Then	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thy	1
father	1
straitly	1
charged	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
saying,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
eateth	1
any	1
food	1
this	1
day.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
faint.	1
	1
14:29	1
Then	1
said	1
Jonathan,	1
My	1
father	1
hath	1
troubled	1
the	1
land:	1
see,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
how	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
been	1
enlightened,	1
because	1
I	1
tasted	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
this	1
honey.	1
	1
14:30	1
How	1
much	1
more,	1
if	1
haply	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
eaten	1
freely	1
to	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
which	1
they	1
found?	1
for	1
had	1
there	1
not	1
been	1
now	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
slaughter	1
among	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
	1
14:31	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines	1
that	1
day	1
from	1
Michmash	1
to	1
Aijalon:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
very	1
faint.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
flew	1
upon	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
took	1
sheep,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
calves,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
eat	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
blood.	1
	1
14:33	1
Then	1
they	1
told	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
eat	1
with	1
the	1
blood.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
have	1
transgressed:	1
roll	1
a	1
great	1
stone	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
14:34	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Disperse	1
yourselves	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Bring	1
me	1
hither	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
ox,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sheep,	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
here,	1
and	1
eat;	1
and	1
sin	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
eating	1
with	1
the	1
blood.	1
	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
brought	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
ox	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
Saul	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
altar	1
that	1
he	1
built	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:36	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
after	1
the	1
Philistines	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
spoil	1
them	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
light,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
leave	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Do	1
whatsoever	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
thee.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
priest,	1
Let	1
us	1
draw	1
near	1
hither	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
14:37	1
And	1
Saul	1
asked	1
counsel	1
of	1
God,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
down	1
after	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel?	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
not	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
14:38	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Draw	1
ye	1
near	1
hither,	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
know	1
and	1
see	1
wherein	1
this	1
sin	1
hath	1
been	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
14:39	1
For,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
which	1
saveth	1
Israel,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
Jonathan	1
my	1
son,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
die.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
answered	1
him.	1
	1
14:40	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
Be	1
ye	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
my	1
son	1
will	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Do	1
what	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
14:41	1
Therefore	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Give	1
a	1
perfect	1
lot.	1
	1
And	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
were	1
taken:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
escaped.	1
	1
14:42	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Cast	1
lots	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
14:43	1
Then	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
Jonathan,	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
done.	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
did	1
but	1
taste	1
a	1
little	1
honey	1
with	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rod	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
I	1
must	1
die.	1
	1
14:44	1
And	1
Saul	1
answered,	1
God	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
more	1
also:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die,	1
Jonathan.	1
	1
14:45	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Shall	1
Jonathan	1
die,	1
who	1
hath	1
wrought	1
this	1
great	1
salvation	1
in	1
Israel?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
one	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
wrought	1
with	1
God	1
this	1
day.	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
rescued	1
Jonathan,	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
not.	1
	1
14:46	1
Then	1
Saul	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
place.	1
	1
14:47	1
So	1
Saul	1
took	1
the	1
kingdom	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
all	1
his	1
enemies	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
against	1
Moab,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
against	1
Edom,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Zobah,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
turned	1
himself,	1
he	1
vexed	1
them.	1
	1
14:48	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
an	1
host,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
delivered	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
spoiled	1
them.	1
	1
14:49	1
Now	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Saul	1
were	1
Jonathan,	1
and	1
Ishui,	1
and	1
Melchishua:	1
and	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
daughters	1
were	1
these;	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn	1
Merab,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
Michal:	1
14:50	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Saul's	1
wife	1
was	1
Ahinoam,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Ahimaaz:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
host	1
was	1
Abner,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
Saul's	1
uncle.	1
	1
14:51	1
And	1
Kish	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Saul;	1
and	1
Ner	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Abner	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiel.	1
	1
14:52	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
sore	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Saul:	1
and	1
when	1
Saul	1
saw	1
any	1
strong	1
man,	1
or	1
any	1
valiant	1
man,	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:1	1
Samuel	1
also	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
The	1
LORD	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
anoint	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
his	1
people,	1
over	1
Israel:	1
now	1
therefore	1
hearken	1
thou	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
remember	1
that	1
which	1
Amalek	1
did	1
to	1
Israel,	1
how	1
he	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
Egypt.	1
	1
15:3	1
Now	1
go	1
and	1
smite	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have,	1
and	1
spare	1
them	1
not;	1
but	1
slay	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
woman,	1
infant	1
and	1
suckling,	1
ox	1
and	1
sheep,	1
camel	1
and	1
ass.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Saul	1
gathered	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
numbered	1
them	1
in	1
Telaim,	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
footmen,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
Saul	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
laid	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Kenites,	1
Go,	1
depart,	1
get	1
you	1
down	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
lest	1
I	1
destroy	1
you	1
with	1
them:	1
for	1
ye	1
shewed	1
kindness	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
So	1
the	1
Kenites	1
departed	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Amalekites.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
Saul	1
smote	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
from	1
Havilah	1
until	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
Shur,	1
that	1
is	1
over	1
against	1
Egypt.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
Agag	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
alive,	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
15:9	1
But	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
spared	1
Agag,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fatlings,	1
and	1
the	1
lambs,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
good,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them:	1
but	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
vile	1
and	1
refuse,	1
that	1
they	1
destroyed	1
utterly.	1
	1
15:10	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
saying,	1
15:11	1
It	1
repenteth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
up	1
Saul	1
to	1
be	1
king:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
following	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
performed	1
my	1
commandments.	1
And	1
it	1
grieved	1
Samuel;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
night.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
when	1
Samuel	1
rose	1
early	1
to	1
meet	1
Saul	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Samuel,	1
saying,	1
Saul	1
came	1
to	1
Carmel,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
set	1
him	1
up	1
a	1
place,	1
and	1
is	1
gone	1
about,	1
and	1
passed	1
on,	1
and	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
Samuel	1
came	1
to	1
Saul:	1
and	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
have	1
performed	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
then	1
this	1
bleating	1
of	1
the	1
sheep	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
and	1
the	1
lowing	1
of	1
the	1
oxen	1
which	1
I	1
hear?	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
They	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Amalekites:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
spared	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
sheep	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
oxen,	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
we	1
have	1
utterly	1
destroyed.	1
	1
15:16	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Stay,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
night.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
on.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
When	1
thou	1
wast	1
little	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
sight,	1
wast	1
thou	1
not	1
made	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
anointed	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
Israel?	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
thee	1
on	1
a	1
journey,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
the	1
sinners	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
until	1
they	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
15:19	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
didst	1
fly	1
upon	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
didst	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
15:20	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Yea,	1
I	1
have	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
gone	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
Agag	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
have	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
the	1
Amalekites.	1
	1
15:21	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
spoil,	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
utterly	1
destroyed,	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
Hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
as	1
great	1
delight	1
in	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices,	1
as	1
in	1
obeying	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
Behold,	1
to	1
obey	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
to	1
hearken	1
than	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
rams.	1
	1
15:23	1
For	1
rebellion	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
witchcraft,	1
and	1
stubbornness	1
is	1
as	1
iniquity	1
and	1
idolatry.	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
rejected	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
hath	1
also	1
rejected	1
thee	1
from	1
being	1
king.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
transgressed	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thy	1
words:	1
because	1
I	1
feared	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
obeyed	1
their	1
voice.	1
	1
15:25	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
pardon	1
my	1
sin,	1
and	1
turn	1
again	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
return	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
rejected	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rejected	1
thee	1
from	1
being	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
as	1
Samuel	1
turned	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
he	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
mantle,	1
and	1
it	1
rent.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rent	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
thine,	1
that	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
thou.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
Strength	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
not	1
lie	1
nor	1
repent:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
repent.	1
	1
15:30	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned:	1
yet	1
honour	1
me	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
before	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
before	1
Israel,	1
and	1
turn	1
again	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
15:31	1
So	1
Samuel	1
turned	1
again	1
after	1
Saul;	1
and	1
Saul	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:32	1
Then	1
said	1
Samuel,	1
Bring	1
ye	1
hither	1
to	1
me	1
Agag	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites.	1
And	1
Agag	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
delicately.	1
And	1
Agag	1
said,	1
Surely	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
past.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
sword	1
hath	1
made	1
women	1
childless,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
mother	1
be	1
childless	1
among	1
women.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
hewed	1
Agag	1
in	1
pieces	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
15:34	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
went	1
to	1
Ramah;	1
and	1
Saul	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
Samuel	1
came	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
see	1
Saul	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death:	1
nevertheless	1
Samuel	1
mourned	1
for	1
Saul:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
repented	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
Saul	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
mourn	1
for	1
Saul,	1
seeing	1
I	1
have	1
rejected	1
him	1
from	1
reigning	1
over	1
Israel?	1
fill	1
thine	1
horn	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
go,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
to	1
Jesse	1
the	1
Bethlehemite:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
provided	1
me	1
a	1
king	1
among	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
go?	1
if	1
Saul	1
hear	1
it,	1
he	1
will	1
kill	1
me.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Take	1
an	1
heifer	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
call	1
Jesse	1
to	1
the	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
unto	1
me	1
him	1
whom	1
I	1
name	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
Samuel	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Bethlehem.	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
trembled	1
at	1
his	1
coming,	1
and	1
said,	1
Comest	1
thou	1
peaceably?	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Peaceably:	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
sanctify	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
sacrifice.	1
And	1
he	1
sanctified	1
Jesse	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
Eliab,	1
and	1
said,	1
Surely	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed	1
is	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
16:7	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Look	1
not	1
on	1
his	1
countenance,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
stature;	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
refused	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
seeth	1
not	1
as	1
man	1
seeth;	1
for	1
man	1
looketh	1
on	1
the	1
outward	1
appearance,	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
looketh	1
on	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
16:8	1
Then	1
Jesse	1
called	1
Abinadab,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
pass	1
before	1
Samuel.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Neither	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
chosen	1
this.	1
	1
16:9	1
Then	1
Jesse	1
made	1
Shammah	1
to	1
pass	1
by.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Neither	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
chosen	1
this.	1
	1
16:10	1
Again,	1
Jesse	1
made	1
seven	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
to	1
pass	1
before	1
Samuel.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesse,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
chosen	1
these.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesse,	1
Are	1
here	1
all	1
thy	1
children?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
There	1
remaineth	1
yet	1
the	1
youngest,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sheep.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesse,	1
Send	1
and	1
fetch	1
him:	1
for	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
till	1
he	1
come	1
hither.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
he	1
sent,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
in.	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
ruddy,	1
and	1
withal	1
of	1
a	1
beautiful	1
countenance,	1
and	1
goodly	1
to	1
look	1
to.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
anoint	1
him:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
he.	1
	1
16:13	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
took	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
anointed	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
David	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forward.	1
So	1
Samuel	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Ramah.	1
	1
16:14	1
But	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
departed	1
from	1
Saul,	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
troubled	1
him.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
Saul's	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
an	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
God	1
troubleth	1
thee.	1
	1
16:16	1
Let	1
our	1
lord	1
now	1
command	1
thy	1
servants,	1
which	1
are	1
before	1
thee,	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
a	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
cunning	1
player	1
on	1
an	1
harp:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
God	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
play	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
well.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Provide	1
me	1
now	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
can	1
play	1
well,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
16:18	1
Then	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
the	1
Bethlehemite,	1
that	1
is	1
cunning	1
in	1
playing,	1
and	1
a	1
mighty	1
valiant	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
prudent	1
in	1
matters,	1
and	1
a	1
comely	1
person,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
16:19	1
Wherefore	1
Saul	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
said,	1
Send	1
me	1
David	1
thy	1
son,	1
which	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
Jesse	1
took	1
an	1
ass	1
laden	1
with	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
a	1
kid,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
by	1
David	1
his	1
son	1
unto	1
Saul.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Saul,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
him	1
greatly;	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
his	1
armourbearer.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
Saul	1
sent	1
to	1
Jesse,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
David,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
stand	1
before	1
me;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
Saul,	1
that	1
David	1
took	1
an	1
harp,	1
and	1
played	1
with	1
his	1
hand:	1
so	1
Saul	1
was	1
refreshed,	1
and	1
was	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
17:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
together	1
their	1
armies	1
to	1
battle,	1
and	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
Shochoh,	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Judah,	1
and	1
pitched	1
between	1
Shochoh	1
and	1
Azekah,	1
in	1
Ephesdammim.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
pitched	1
by	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Elah,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
mountain	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
Israel	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
mountain	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
valley	1
between	1
them.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
champion	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
named	1
Goliath,	1
of	1
Gath,	1
whose	1
height	1
was	1
six	1
cubits	1
and	1
a	1
span.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
helmet	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
mail;	1
and	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
was	1
five	1
thousand	1
shekels	1
of	1
brass.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
greaves	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
legs,	1
and	1
a	1
target	1
of	1
brass	1
between	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
his	1
spear	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
weaver's	1
beam;	1
and	1
his	1
spear's	1
head	1
weighed	1
six	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
one	1
bearing	1
a	1
shield	1
went	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
set	1
your	1
battle	1
in	1
array?	1
am	1
not	1
I	1
a	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
ye	1
servants	1
to	1
Saul?	1
choose	1
you	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
17:9	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
then	1
will	1
we	1
be	1
your	1
servants:	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
kill	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
our	1
servants,	1
and	1
serve	1
us.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
said,	1
I	1
defy	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Israel	1
this	1
day;	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
fight	1
together.	1
	1
17:11	1
When	1
Saul	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
heard	1
those	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
they	1
were	1
dismayed,	1
and	1
greatly	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:12	1
Now	1
David	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
that	1
Ephrathite	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Jesse;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
eight	1
sons:	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
went	1
among	1
men	1
for	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
eldest	1
sons	1
of	1
Jesse	1
went	1
and	1
followed	1
Saul	1
to	1
the	1
battle:	1
and	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
three	1
sons	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
were	1
Eliab	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
and	1
next	1
unto	1
him	1
Abinadab,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
Shammah.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
the	1
youngest:	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
eldest	1
followed	1
Saul.	1
	1
17:15	1
But	1
David	1
went	1
and	1
returned	1
from	1
Saul	1
to	1
feed	1
his	1
father's	1
sheep	1
at	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
drew	1
near	1
morning	1
and	1
evening,	1
and	1
presented	1
himself	1
forty	1
days.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
Jesse	1
said	1
unto	1
David	1
his	1
son,	1
Take	1
now	1
for	1
thy	1
brethren	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
this	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
these	1
ten	1
loaves,	1
and	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren;	1
17:18	1
And	1
carry	1
these	1
ten	1
cheeses	1
unto	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
thousand,	1
and	1
look	1
how	1
thy	1
brethren	1
fare,	1
and	1
take	1
their	1
pledge.	1
	1
17:19	1
Now	1
Saul,	1
and	1
they,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Elah,	1
fighting	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
David	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
sheep	1
with	1
a	1
keeper,	1
and	1
took,	1
and	1
went,	1
as	1
Jesse	1
had	1
commanded	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
trench,	1
as	1
the	1
host	1
was	1
going	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
fight,	1
and	1
shouted	1
for	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
17:21	1
For	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array,	1
army	1
against	1
army.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
David	1
left	1
his	1
carriage	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
saluted	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
them,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
champion,	1
the	1
Philistine	1
of	1
Gath,	1
Goliath	1
by	1
name,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
spake	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
words:	1
and	1
David	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
man,	1
fled	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:25	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Have	1
ye	1
seen	1
this	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
up?	1
	1
surely	1
to	1
defy	1
Israel	1
is	1
he	1
come	1
up:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
killeth	1
him,	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
enrich	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
riches,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
free	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
David	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
killeth	1
this	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
reproach	1
from	1
Israel?	1
for	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
uncircumcised	1
Philistine,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
defy	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God?	1
	1
17:27	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
him	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
saying,	1
So	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
killeth	1
him.	1
	1
17:28	1
And	1
Eliab	1
his	1
eldest	1
brother	1
heard	1
when	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
men;	1
and	1
Eliab's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
David,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Why	1
camest	1
thou	1
down	1
hither?	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
left	1
those	1
few	1
sheep	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
pride,	1
and	1
the	1
naughtiness	1
of	1
thine	1
heart;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
down	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
see	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
17:29	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
now	1
done?	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
a	1
cause?	1
17:30	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
from	1
him	1
toward	1
another,	1
and	1
spake	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
manner:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
him	1
again	1
after	1
the	1
former	1
manner.	1
	1
17:31	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
heard	1
which	1
David	1
spake,	1
they	1
rehearsed	1
them	1
before	1
Saul:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
17:32	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Let	1
no	1
man's	1
heart	1
fail	1
because	1
of	1
him;	1
thy	1
servant	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
this	1
Philistine.	1
	1
17:33	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
this	1
Philistine	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
but	1
a	1
youth,	1
and	1
he	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war	1
from	1
his	1
youth.	1
	1
17:34	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
kept	1
his	1
father's	1
sheep,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
lamb	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock:	1
17:35	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
delivered	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
arose	1
against	1
me,	1
I	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
beard,	1
and	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
17:36	1
Thy	1
servant	1
slew	1
both	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
bear:	1
and	1
this	1
uncircumcised	1
Philistine	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
seeing	1
he	1
hath	1
defied	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
17:37	1
David	1
said	1
moreover,	1
The	1
LORD	1
that	1
delivered	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
paw	1
of	1
the	1
lion,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
paw	1
of	1
the	1
bear,	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
this	1
Philistine.	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Go,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
17:38	1
And	1
Saul	1
armed	1
David	1
with	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
an	1
helmet	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
head;	1
also	1
he	1
armed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
mail.	1
	1
17:39	1
And	1
David	1
girded	1
his	1
sword	1
upon	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
he	1
assayed	1
to	1
go;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
proved	1
it.	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
with	1
these;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
proved	1
them.	1
And	1
David	1
put	1
them	1
off	1
him.	1
	1
17:40	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
chose	1
him	1
five	1
smooth	1
stones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
brook,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
shepherd's	1
bag	1
which	1
he	1
had,	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
scrip;	1
and	1
his	1
sling	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
Philistine.	1
	1
17:41	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
came	1
on	1
and	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
shield	1
went	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
17:42	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistine	1
looked	1
about,	1
and	1
saw	1
David,	1
he	1
disdained	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
youth,	1
and	1
ruddy,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
countenance.	1
	1
17:43	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
dog,	1
that	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
staves?	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
cursed	1
David	1
by	1
his	1
gods.	1
	1
17:44	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
flesh	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
17:45	1
Then	1
said	1
David	1
to	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
Thou	1
comest	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
spear,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
shield:	1
but	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
defied.	1
	1
17:46	1
This	1
day	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
mine	1
hand;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
thee,	1
and	1
take	1
thine	1
head	1
from	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:47	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
assembly	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
saveth	1
not	1
with	1
sword	1
and	1
spear:	1
for	1
the	1
battle	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
into	1
our	1
hands.	1
	1
17:48	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
Philistine	1
arose,	1
and	1
came,	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
to	1
meet	1
David,	1
that	1
David	1
hastened,	1
and	1
ran	1
toward	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Philistine.	1
	1
17:49	1
And	1
David	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
bag,	1
and	1
took	1
thence	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
slang	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistine	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
sunk	1
into	1
his	1
forehead;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
17:50	1
So	1
David	1
prevailed	1
over	1
the	1
Philistine	1
with	1
a	1
sling	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
slew	1
him;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
17:51	1
Therefore	1
David	1
ran,	1
and	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sheath	1
thereof,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
therewith.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
saw	1
their	1
champion	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
fled.	1
	1
17:52	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
of	1
Judah	1
arose,	1
and	1
shouted,	1
and	1
pursued	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
until	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Ekron.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
wounded	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fell	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Shaaraim,	1
even	1
unto	1
Gath,	1
and	1
unto	1
Ekron.	1
	1
17:53	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
returned	1
from	1
chasing	1
after	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
they	1
spoiled	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
17:54	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
but	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
17:55	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
saw	1
David	1
go	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Abner,	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
Abner,	1
whose	1
son	1
is	1
this	1
youth?	1
And	1
Abner	1
said,	1
As	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
O	1
king,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
	1
17:56	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Enquire	1
thou	1
whose	1
son	1
the	1
stripling	1
is.	1
	1
17:57	1
And	1
as	1
David	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
Abner	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
before	1
Saul	1
with	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
17:58	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Whose	1
son	1
art	1
thou,	1
thou	1
young	1
man?	1
And	1
David	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
Jesse	1
the	1
Bethlehemite.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
was	1
knit	1
with	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
loved	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Saul	1
took	1
him	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
18:3	1
Then	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
David	1
made	1
a	1
covenant,	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
stripped	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
robe	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
his	1
garments,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
bow,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
girdle.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
out	1
whithersoever	1
Saul	1
sent	1
him,	1
and	1
behaved	1
himself	1
wisely:	1
and	1
Saul	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Saul's	1
servants.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
they	1
came,	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
that	1
the	1
women	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel,	1
singing	1
and	1
dancing,	1
to	1
meet	1
king	1
Saul,	1
with	1
tabrets,	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
with	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
answered	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
they	1
played,	1
and	1
said,	1
Saul	1
hath	1
slain	1
his	1
thousands,	1
and	1
David	1
his	1
ten	1
thousands.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
very	1
wroth,	1
and	1
the	1
saying	1
displeased	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
They	1
have	1
ascribed	1
unto	1
David	1
ten	1
thousands,	1
and	1
to	1
me	1
they	1
have	1
ascribed	1
but	1
thousands:	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
he	1
have	1
more	1
but	1
the	1
kingdom?	1
18:9	1
And	1
Saul	1
eyed	1
David	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
forward.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
Saul,	1
and	1
he	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
David	1
played	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
javelin	1
in	1
Saul's	1
hand.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
Saul	1
cast	1
the	1
javelin;	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
David	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
it.	1
And	1
David	1
avoided	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
twice.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
David,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
departed	1
from	1
Saul.	1
	1
18:13	1
Therefore	1
Saul	1
removed	1
him	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
his	1
captain	1
over	1
a	1
thousand;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
David	1
behaved	1
himself	1
wisely	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
18:15	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
Saul	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
behaved	1
himself	1
very	1
wisely,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
all	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah	1
loved	1
David,	1
because	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Behold	1
my	1
elder	1
daughter	1
Merab,	1
her	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
to	1
wife:	1
only	1
be	1
thou	1
valiant	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
fight	1
the	1
LORD's	1
battles.	1
	1
For	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Let	1
not	1
mine	1
hand	1
be	1
upon	1
him,	1
but	1
let	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Who	1
am	1
I?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
life,	1
or	1
my	1
father's	1
family	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
the	1
king?	1
18:19	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
Merab	1
Saul's	1
daughter	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
David,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
Adriel	1
the	1
Meholathite	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
Michal	1
Saul's	1
daughter	1
loved	1
David:	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
Saul,	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
pleased	1
him.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
snare	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
may	1
be	1
against	1
him.	1
Wherefore	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
this	1
day	1
be	1
my	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twain.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
Saul	1
commanded	1
his	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Commune	1
with	1
David	1
secretly,	1
and	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
delight	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
love	1
thee:	1
now	1
therefore	1
be	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
Saul's	1
servants	1
spake	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Seemeth	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
light	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law,	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
poor	1
man,	1
and	1
lightly	1
esteemed?	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
On	1
this	1
manner	1
spake	1
David.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
David,	1
The	1
king	1
desireth	1
not	1
any	1
dowry,	1
but	1
an	1
hundred	1
foreskins	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
to	1
be	1
avenged	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
enemies.	1
But	1
Saul	1
thought	1
to	1
make	1
David	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
servants	1
told	1
David	1
these	1
words,	1
it	1
pleased	1
David	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law:	1
and	1
the	1
days	1
were	1
not	1
expired.	1
	1
18:27	1
Wherefore	1
David	1
arose	1
and	1
went,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
and	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
two	1
hundred	1
men;	1
and	1
David	1
brought	1
their	1
foreskins,	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
in	1
full	1
tale	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law.	1
And	1
Saul	1
gave	1
him	1
Michal	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
18:28	1
And	1
Saul	1
saw	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
that	1
Michal	1
Saul's	1
daughter	1
loved	1
him.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
yet	1
the	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
Saul	1
became	1
David's	1
enemy	1
continually.	1
	1
18:30	1
Then	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
forth:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
that	1
David	1
behaved	1
himself	1
more	1
wisely	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul;	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
much	1
set	1
by.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
Saul	1
spake	1
to	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
kill	1
David.	1
	1
19:2	1
But	1
Jonathan	1
Saul's	1
son	1
delighted	1
much	1
in	1
David:	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Saul	1
my	1
father	1
seeketh	1
to	1
kill	1
thee:	1
now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself	1
until	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
place,	1
and	1
hide	1
thyself:	1
19:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
stand	1
beside	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
where	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
commune	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
see,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
spake	1
good	1
of	1
David	1
unto	1
Saul	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
sin	1
against	1
his	1
servant,	1
against	1
David;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
because	1
his	1
works	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
thee-ward	1
very	1
good:	1
19:5	1
For	1
he	1
did	1
put	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
wrought	1
a	1
great	1
salvation	1
for	1
all	1
Israel:	1
thou	1
sawest	1
it,	1
and	1
didst	1
rejoice:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
wilt	1
thou	1
sin	1
against	1
innocent	1
blood,	1
to	1
slay	1
David	1
without	1
a	1
cause?	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
Saul	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Jonathan:	1
and	1
Saul	1
sware,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
called	1
David,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
shewed	1
him	1
all	1
those	1
things.	1
	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
brought	1
David	1
to	1
Saul,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
presence,	1
as	1
in	1
times	1
past.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
again:	1
and	1
David	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter;	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
Saul,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
with	1
his	1
javelin	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
David	1
played	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
Saul	1
sought	1
to	1
smite	1
David	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
the	1
javelin:	1
but	1
he	1
slipped	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
Saul's	1
presence,	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
javelin	1
into	1
the	1
wall:	1
and	1
David	1
fled,	1
and	1
escaped	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
19:11	1
Saul	1
also	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
David's	1
house,	1
to	1
watch	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
and	1
Michal	1
David's	1
wife	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
save	1
not	1
thy	1
life	1
to	1
night,	1
to	1
morrow	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
19:12	1
So	1
Michal	1
let	1
David	1
down	1
through	1
a	1
window:	1
and	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
escaped.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
Michal	1
took	1
an	1
image,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
pillow	1
of	1
goats'	1
hair	1
for	1
his	1
bolster,	1
and	1
covered	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
cloth.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
take	1
David,	1
she	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
sick.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
Saul	1
sent	1
the	1
messengers	1
again	1
to	1
see	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Bring	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
messengers	1
were	1
come	1
in,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
image	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
with	1
a	1
pillow	1
of	1
goats'	1
hair	1
for	1
his	1
bolster.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Michal,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
deceived	1
me	1
so,	1
and	1
sent	1
away	1
mine	1
enemy,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
escaped?	1
And	1
Michal	1
answered	1
Saul,	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Let	1
me	1
go;	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
kill	1
thee?	1
	1
19:18	1
So	1
David	1
fled,	1
and	1
escaped,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Samuel	1
to	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
Saul	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
and	1
Samuel	1
went	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Naioth.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
David	1
is	1
at	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
Saul	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
take	1
David:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
prophesying,	1
and	1
Samuel	1
standing	1
as	1
appointed	1
over	1
them,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
prophesied.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul,	1
he	1
sent	1
other	1
messengers,	1
and	1
they	1
prophesied	1
likewise.	1
And	1
Saul	1
sent	1
messengers	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
and	1
they	1
prophesied	1
also.	1
	1
19:22	1
Then	1
went	1
he	1
also	1
to	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
well	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Sechu:	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
and	1
said,	1
Where	1
are	1
Samuel	1
and	1
David?	1
And	1
one	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
they	1
be	1
at	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
thither	1
to	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah:	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
prophesied,	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
he	1
stripped	1
off	1
his	1
clothes	1
also,	1
and	1
prophesied	1
before	1
Samuel	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
naked	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
night.	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
say,	1
Is	1
Saul	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
prophets?	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
David	1
fled	1
from	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
said	1
before	1
Jonathan,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
what	1
is	1
mine	1
iniquity?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
sin	1
before	1
thy	1
father,	1
that	1
he	1
seeketh	1
my	1
life?	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
God	1
forbid;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die:	1
behold,	1
my	1
father	1
will	1
do	1
nothing	1
either	1
great	1
or	1
small,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
it	1
me:	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
my	1
father	1
hide	1
this	1
thing	1
from	1
me?	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
David	1
sware	1
moreover,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thy	1
father	1
certainly	1
knoweth	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes;	1
and	1
he	1
saith,	1
Let	1
not	1
Jonathan	1
know	1
this,	1
lest	1
he	1
be	1
grieved:	1
but	1
truly	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
step	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
death.	1
	1
20:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Jonathan	1
unto	1
David,	1
Whatsoever	1
thy	1
soul	1
desireth,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Jonathan,	1
Behold,	1
to	1
morrow	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
moon,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
at	1
meat:	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
hide	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
at	1
even.	1
	1
20:6	1
If	1
thy	1
father	1
at	1
all	1
miss	1
me,	1
then	1
say,	1
David	1
earnestly	1
asked	1
leave	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
run	1
to	1
Bethlehem	1
his	1
city:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
yearly	1
sacrifice	1
there	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
family.	1
	1
20:7	1
If	1
he	1
say	1
thus,	1
It	1
is	1
well;	1
thy	1
servant	1
shall	1
have	1
peace:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
very	1
wroth,	1
then	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
evil	1
is	1
determined	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
20:8	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deal	1
kindly	1
with	1
thy	1
servant;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
thy	1
servant	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
thee:	1
notwithstanding,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
me	1
iniquity,	1
slay	1
me	1
thyself;	1
for	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
bring	1
me	1
to	1
thy	1
father?	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said,	1
Far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
knew	1
certainly	1
that	1
evil	1
were	1
determined	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
then	1
would	1
not	1
I	1
tell	1
it	1
thee?	1
	1
20:10	1
Then	1
said	1
David	1
to	1
Jonathan,	1
Who	1
shall	1
tell	1
me?	1
or	1
what	1
if	1
thy	1
father	1
answer	1
thee	1
roughly?	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
sounded	1
my	1
father	1
about	1
to	1
morrow	1
any	1
time,	1
or	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
good	1
toward	1
David,	1
and	1
I	1
then	1
send	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
shew	1
it	1
thee;	1
20:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
Jonathan:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
please	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
do	1
thee	1
evil,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
it	1
thee,	1
and	1
send	1
thee	1
away,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
go	1
in	1
peace:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
only	1
while	1
yet	1
I	1
live	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
die	1
not:	1
20:15	1
But	1
also	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
thy	1
kindness	1
from	1
my	1
house	1
for	1
ever:	1
no,	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
David	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
20:16	1
So	1
Jonathan	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
the	1
LORD	1
even	1
require	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
David's	1
enemies.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
caused	1
David	1
to	1
swear	1
again,	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
loved	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
loved	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
20:18	1
Then	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
To	1
morrow	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
moon:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
missed,	1
because	1
thy	1
seat	1
will	1
be	1
empty.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
stayed	1
three	1
days,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
down	1
quickly,	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
didst	1
hide	1
thyself	1
when	1
the	1
business	1
was	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
shalt	1
remain	1
by	1
the	1
stone	1
Ezel.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shoot	1
three	1
arrows	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
thereof,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
shot	1
at	1
a	1
mark.	1
	1
20:21	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
lad,	1
saying,	1
Go,	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
arrows.	1
If	1
I	1
expressly	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
lad,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
arrows	1
are	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
thee,	1
take	1
them;	1
then	1
come	1
thou:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
peace	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
hurt;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth.	1
	1
20:22	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
thus	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
arrows	1
are	1
beyond	1
thee;	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
thee	1
away.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
matter	1
which	1
thou	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
of,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
me	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
20:24	1
So	1
David	1
hid	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
king	1
sat	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
meat.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
seat,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
even	1
upon	1
a	1
seat	1
by	1
the	1
wall:	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
arose,	1
and	1
Abner	1
sat	1
by	1
Saul's	1
side,	1
and	1
David's	1
place	1
was	1
empty.	1
	1
20:26	1
Nevertheless	1
Saul	1
spake	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
day:	1
for	1
he	1
thought,	1
Something	1
hath	1
befallen	1
him,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
clean;	1
surely	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
clean.	1
	1
20:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
David's	1
place	1
was	1
empty:	1
and	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son,	1
Wherefore	1
cometh	1
not	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
to	1
meat,	1
neither	1
yesterday,	1
nor	1
to	1
day?	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
answered	1
Saul,	1
David	1
earnestly	1
asked	1
leave	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Bethlehem:	1
20:29	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
go,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee;	1
for	1
our	1
family	1
hath	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
my	1
brother,	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
there:	1
and	1
now,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
let	1
me	1
get	1
away,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
brethren.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
cometh	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
table.	1
	1
20:30	1
Then	1
Saul's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Jonathan,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
perverse	1
rebellious	1
woman,	1
do	1
not	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
confusion,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
thy	1
mother's	1
nakedness?	1
	1
20:31	1
For	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
liveth	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
established,	1
nor	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
send	1
and	1
fetch	1
him	1
unto	1
me,	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
answered	1
Saul	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
slain?	1
what	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
	1
20:33	1
And	1
Saul	1
cast	1
a	1
javelin	1
at	1
him	1
to	1
smite	1
him:	1
whereby	1
Jonathan	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
determined	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
slay	1
David.	1
	1
20:34	1
So	1
Jonathan	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
no	1
meat	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
grieved	1
for	1
David,	1
because	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
done	1
him	1
shame.	1
	1
20:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
Jonathan	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
lad	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
20:36	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
lad,	1
Run,	1
find	1
out	1
now	1
the	1
arrows	1
which	1
I	1
shoot.	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
lad	1
ran,	1
he	1
shot	1
an	1
arrow	1
beyond	1
him.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
arrow	1
which	1
Jonathan	1
had	1
shot,	1
Jonathan	1
cried	1
after	1
the	1
lad,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
arrow	1
beyond	1
thee?	1
	1
20:38	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
cried	1
after	1
the	1
lad,	1
Make	1
speed,	1
haste,	1
stay	1
not.	1
And	1
Jonathan's	1
lad	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
arrows,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
20:39	1
But	1
the	1
lad	1
knew	1
not	1
any	1
thing:	1
only	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
David	1
knew	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
20:40	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
gave	1
his	1
artillery	1
unto	1
his	1
lad,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
carry	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
20:41	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
gone,	1
David	1
arose	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
three	1
times:	1
and	1
they	1
kissed	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
wept	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
until	1
David	1
exceeded.	1
	1
20:42	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
sworn	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
be	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
between	1
my	1
seed	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
departed:	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
21:1	1
Then	1
came	1
David	1
to	1
Nob	1
to	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
priest:	1
and	1
Ahimelech	1
was	1
afraid	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
art	1
thou	1
alone,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
priest,	1
The	1
king	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
a	1
business,	1
and	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
whereabout	1
I	1
send	1
thee,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
appointed	1
my	1
servants	1
to	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
place.	1
	1
21:3	1
Now	1
therefore	1
what	1
is	1
under	1
thine	1
hand?	1
give	1
me	1
five	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
or	1
what	1
there	1
is	1
present.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
answered	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
common	1
bread	1
under	1
mine	1
hand,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
hallowed	1
bread;	1
if	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
kept	1
themselves	1
at	1
least	1
from	1
women.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
David	1
answered	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
women	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
from	1
us	1
about	1
these	1
three	1
days,	1
since	1
I	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
are	1
holy,	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
common,	1
yea,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
sanctified	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
vessel.	1
	1
21:6	1
So	1
the	1
priest	1
gave	1
him	1
hallowed	1
bread:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
bread	1
there	1
but	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
that	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
put	1
hot	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
21:7	1
Now	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul	1
was	1
there	1
that	1
day,	1
detained	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Doeg,	1
an	1
Edomite,	1
the	1
chiefest	1
of	1
the	1
herdmen	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
Saul.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahimelech,	1
And	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
here	1
under	1
thine	1
hand	1
spear	1
or	1
sword?	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
brought	1
my	1
sword	1
nor	1
my	1
weapons	1
with	1
me,	1
because	1
the	1
king's	1
business	1
required	1
haste.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
said,	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
Goliath	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
whom	1
thou	1
slewest	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Elah,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
here	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
cloth	1
behind	1
the	1
ephod:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
take	1
that,	1
take	1
it:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
save	1
that	1
here.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
that;	1
give	1
it	1
me.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
David	1
arose	1
and	1
fled	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Achish	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Gath.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Achish	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
David	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
land?	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
sing	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
dances,	1
saying,	1
Saul	1
hath	1
slain	1
his	1
thousands,	1
and	1
David	1
his	1
ten	1
thousands?	1
21:12	1
And	1
David	1
laid	1
up	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid	1
of	1
Achish	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Gath.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
behaviour	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
feigned	1
himself	1
mad	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
scrabbled	1
on	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
spittle	1
fall	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
beard.	1
	1
21:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Achish	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Lo,	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
mad:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
have	1
ye	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
21:15	1
Have	1
I	1
need	1
of	1
mad	1
men,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
this	1
fellow	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
mad	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
presence?	1
shall	1
this	1
fellow	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
house?	1
	1
22:1	1
David	1
therefore	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
escaped	1
to	1
the	1
cave	1
Adullam:	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
thither	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
distress,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
debt,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
discontented,	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
captain	1
over	1
them:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
four	1
hundred	1
men.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
thence	1
to	1
Mizpeh	1
of	1
Moab:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
Let	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
mother,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
till	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
God	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab:	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
with	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hold.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
the	1
prophet	1
Gad	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Abide	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
hold;	1
depart,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
Then	1
David	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
Hareth.	1
	1
22:6	1
When	1
Saul	1
heard	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
discovered,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
(now	1
Saul	1
abode	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
under	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
Ramah,	1
having	1
his	1
spear	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
were	1
standing	1
about	1
him;)	1
22:7	1
Then	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
stood	1
about	1
him,	1
Hear	1
now,	1
ye	1
Benjamites;	1
will	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
give	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
fields	1
and	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
all	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds;	1
22:8	1
That	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
have	1
conspired	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
sheweth	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
hath	1
made	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
is	1
sorry	1
for	1
me,	1
or	1
sheweth	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
hath	1
stirred	1
up	1
my	1
servant	1
against	1
me,	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day?	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
answered	1
Doeg	1
the	1
Edomite,	1
which	1
was	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
coming	1
to	1
Nob,	1
to	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
victuals,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Goliath	1
the	1
Philistine.	1
	1
22:11	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
to	1
call	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
priest,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Nob:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Hear	1
now,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Here	1
I	1
am,	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
conspired	1
against	1
me,	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
hast	1
enquired	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
rise	1
against	1
me,	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day?	1
	1
22:14	1
Then	1
Ahimelech	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
faithful	1
among	1
all	1
thy	1
servants	1
as	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
goeth	1
at	1
thy	1
bidding,	1
and	1
is	1
honourable	1
in	1
thine	1
house?	1
	1
22:15	1
Did	1
I	1
then	1
begin	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
him?	1
be	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
me:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
impute	1
any	1
thing	1
unto	1
his	1
servant,	1
nor	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
father:	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
less	1
or	1
more.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die,	1
Ahimelech,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
footmen	1
that	1
stood	1
about	1
him,	1
Turn,	1
and	1
slay	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
because	1
their	1
hand	1
also	1
is	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
when	1
he	1
fled,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
shew	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
But	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
would	1
not	1
put	1
forth	1
their	1
hand	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:18	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
Doeg,	1
Turn	1
thou,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
priests.	1
And	1
Doeg	1
the	1
Edomite	1
turned,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
slew	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
fourscore	1
and	1
five	1
persons	1
that	1
did	1
wear	1
a	1
linen	1
ephod.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
Nob,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
smote	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
children	1
and	1
sucklings,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
asses,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
named	1
Abiathar,	1
escaped,	1
and	1
fled	1
after	1
David.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
Abiathar	1
shewed	1
David	1
that	1
Saul	1
had	1
slain	1
the	1
LORD's	1
priests.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Abiathar,	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
that	1
day,	1
when	1
Doeg	1
the	1
Edomite	1
was	1
there,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
surely	1
tell	1
Saul:	1
I	1
have	1
occasioned	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
thy	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
22:23	1
Abide	1
thou	1
with	1
me,	1
fear	1
not:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
my	1
life	1
seeketh	1
thy	1
life:	1
but	1
with	1
me	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
in	1
safeguard.	1
	1
23:1	1
Then	1
they	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fight	1
against	1
Keilah,	1
and	1
they	1
rob	1
the	1
threshingfloors.	1
	1
23:2	1
Therefore	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
smite	1
these	1
Philistines?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Go,	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
save	1
Keilah.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
David's	1
men	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
be	1
afraid	1
here	1
in	1
Judah:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
then	1
if	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
Keilah	1
against	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
	1
23:4	1
Then	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
yet	1
again.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Keilah;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
the	1
Philistines	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
23:5	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
Keilah,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
brought	1
away	1
their	1
cattle,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter.	1
So	1
David	1
saved	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Keilah.	1
	1
23:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahimelech	1
fled	1
to	1
David	1
to	1
Keilah,	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
an	1
ephod	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Keilah.	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
him	1
into	1
mine	1
hand;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
shut	1
in,	1
by	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
town	1
that	1
hath	1
gates	1
and	1
bars.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
called	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
together	1
to	1
war,	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Keilah,	1
to	1
besiege	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
David	1
knew	1
that	1
Saul	1
secretly	1
practised	1
mischief	1
against	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest,	1
Bring	1
hither	1
the	1
ephod.	1
	1
23:10	1
Then	1
said	1
David,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
certainly	1
heard	1
that	1
Saul	1
seeketh	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Keilah,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
city	1
for	1
my	1
sake.	1
	1
23:11	1
Will	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Keilah	1
deliver	1
me	1
up	1
into	1
his	1
hand?	1
will	1
Saul	1
come	1
down,	1
as	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
heard?	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
tell	1
thy	1
servant.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
He	1
will	1
come	1
down.	1
	1
23:12	1
Then	1
said	1
David,	1
Will	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Keilah	1
deliver	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
men	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
They	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
up.	1
	1
23:13	1
Then	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
about	1
six	1
hundred,	1
arose	1
and	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
Keilah,	1
and	1
went	1
whithersoever	1
they	1
could	1
go.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
escaped	1
from	1
Keilah;	1
and	1
he	1
forbare	1
to	1
go	1
forth.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
David	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
in	1
strong	1
holds,	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
a	1
mountain	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Ziph.	1
And	1
Saul	1
sought	1
him	1
every	1
day,	1
but	1
God	1
delivered	1
him	1
not	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
23:15	1
And	1
David	1
saw	1
that	1
Saul	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
seek	1
his	1
life:	1
and	1
David	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Ziph	1
in	1
a	1
wood.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
Saul's	1
son	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
David	1
into	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul	1
my	1
father	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
next	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
that	1
also	1
Saul	1
my	1
father	1
knoweth.	1
	1
23:18	1
And	1
they	1
two	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
David	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
23:19	1
Then	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
Ziphites	1
to	1
Saul	1
to	1
Gibeah,	1
saying,	1
Doth	1
not	1
David	1
hide	1
himself	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
strong	1
holds	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Hachilah,	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Jeshimon?	1
	1
23:20	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
king,	1
come	1
down	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
thy	1
soul	1
to	1
come	1
down;	1
and	1
our	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
hand.	1
	1
23:21	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
23:22	1
Go,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
prepare	1
yet,	1
and	1
know	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
place	1
where	1
his	1
haunt	1
is,	1
and	1
who	1
hath	1
seen	1
him	1
there:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
dealeth	1
very	1
subtilly.	1
	1
23:23	1
See	1
therefore,	1
and	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
lurking	1
places	1
where	1
he	1
hideth	1
himself,	1
and	1
come	1
ye	1
again	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
certainty,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
him	1
out	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
23:24	1
And	1
they	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Ziph	1
before	1
Saul:	1
but	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Maon,	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Jeshimon.	1
	1
23:25	1
Saul	1
also	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
seek	1
him.	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
David;	1
wherefore	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
rock,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Maon.	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
pursued	1
after	1
David	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Maon.	1
	1
23:26	1
And	1
Saul	1
went	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountain:	1
and	1
David	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Saul;	1
for	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
compassed	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
them.	1
	1
23:27	1
But	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
messenger	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
Haste	1
thee,	1
and	1
come;	1
for	1
the	1
Philistines	1
have	1
invaded	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:28	1
Wherefore	1
Saul	1
returned	1
from	1
pursuing	1
after	1
David,	1
and	1
went	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
therefore	1
they	1
called	1
that	1
place	1
Selahammahlekoth.	1
	1
23:29	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
strong	1
holds	1
at	1
Engedi.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
returned	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
David	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Engedi.	1
	1
24:2	1
Then	1
Saul	1
took	1
three	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
seek	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
upon	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
goats.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
sheepcotes	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
cave;	1
and	1
Saul	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
feet:	1
and	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
cave.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thine	1
enemy	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
shall	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
thee.	1
Then	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
Saul's	1
robe	1
privily.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
David's	1
heart	1
smote	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
cut	1
off	1
Saul's	1
skirt.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
men,	1
The	1
LORD	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
my	1
master,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed,	1
to	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
him,	1
seeing	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
anointed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:7	1
So	1
David	1
stayed	1
his	1
servants	1
with	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
suffered	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
rise	1
against	1
Saul.	1
But	1
Saul	1
rose	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
24:8	1
David	1
also	1
arose	1
afterward,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
and	1
cried	1
after	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
My	1
lord	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
looked	1
behind	1
him,	1
David	1
stooped	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Wherefore	1
hearest	1
thou	1
men's	1
words,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
David	1
seeketh	1
thy	1
hurt?	1
	1
24:10	1
Behold,	1
this	1
day	1
thine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
delivered	1
thee	1
to	1
day	1
into	1
mine	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
cave:	1
and	1
some	1
bade	1
me	1
kill	1
thee:	1
but	1
mine	1
eye	1
spared	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
put	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
my	1
lord;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed.	1
	1
24:11	1
Moreover,	1
my	1
father,	1
see,	1
yea,	1
see	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
thy	1
robe	1
in	1
my	1
hand:	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
thy	1
robe,	1
and	1
killed	1
thee	1
not,	1
know	1
thou	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
evil	1
nor	1
transgression	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee;	1
yet	1
thou	1
huntest	1
my	1
soul	1
to	1
take	1
it.	1
	1
24:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
judge	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
avenge	1
me	1
of	1
thee:	1
but	1
mine	1
hand	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
24:13	1
As	1
saith	1
the	1
proverb	1
of	1
the	1
ancients,	1
Wickedness	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
wicked:	1
but	1
mine	1
hand	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
24:14	1
After	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
come	1
out?	1
after	1
whom	1
dost	1
thou	1
pursue?	1
after	1
a	1
dead	1
dog,	1
after	1
a	1
flea.	1
	1
24:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
therefore	1
be	1
judge,	1
and	1
judge	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
see,	1
and	1
plead	1
my	1
cause,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
David	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
that	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Is	1
this	1
thy	1
voice,	1
my	1
son	1
David?	1
And	1
Saul	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
art	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
I:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
rewarded	1
me	1
good,	1
whereas	1
I	1
have	1
rewarded	1
thee	1
evil.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
this	1
day	1
how	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
me:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
delivered	1
me	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
thou	1
killedst	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
24:19	1
For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
find	1
his	1
enemy,	1
will	1
he	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
well	1
away?	1
wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
reward	1
thee	1
good	1
for	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
24:20	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
be	1
king,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
24:21	1
Swear	1
now	1
therefore	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
my	1
seed	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
destroy	1
my	1
name	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
David	1
sware	1
unto	1
Saul.	1
And	1
Saul	1
went	1
home;	1
but	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
gat	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
hold.	1
	1
25:1	1
And	1
Samuel	1
died;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
lamented	1
him,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
Ramah.	1
And	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Maon,	1
whose	1
possessions	1
were	1
in	1
Carmel;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
very	1
great,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
three	1
thousand	1
sheep,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
goats:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
shearing	1
his	1
sheep	1
in	1
Carmel.	1
	1
25:3	1
Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
Nabal;	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
Abigail:	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
good	1
understanding,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
beautiful	1
countenance:	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
churlish	1
and	1
evil	1
in	1
his	1
doings;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Caleb.	1
	1
25:4	1
And	1
David	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
Nabal	1
did	1
shear	1
his	1
sheep.	1
	1
25:5	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
out	1
ten	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
Get	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
Carmel,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Nabal,	1
and	1
greet	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
25:6	1
And	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
in	1
prosperity,	1
Peace	1
be	1
both	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
to	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shearers:	1
now	1
thy	1
shepherds	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
us,	1
we	1
hurt	1
them	1
not,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
ought	1
missing	1
unto	1
them,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
Carmel.	1
	1
25:8	1
Ask	1
thy	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
shew	1
thee.	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
find	1
favour	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes:	1
for	1
we	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
day:	1
give,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
whatsoever	1
cometh	1
to	1
thine	1
hand	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
son	1
David.	1
	1
25:9	1
And	1
when	1
David's	1
young	1
men	1
came,	1
they	1
spake	1
to	1
Nabal	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
ceased.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
Nabal	1
answered	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
David?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse?	1
there	1
be	1
many	1
servants	1
now	1
a	1
days	1
that	1
break	1
away	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
25:11	1
Shall	1
I	1
then	1
take	1
my	1
bread,	1
and	1
my	1
water,	1
and	1
my	1
flesh	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
killed	1
for	1
my	1
shearers,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
men,	1
whom	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whence	1
they	1
be?	1
	1
25:12	1
So	1
David's	1
young	1
men	1
turned	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
went	1
again,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
those	1
sayings.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
men,	1
Gird	1
ye	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sword.	1
And	1
they	1
girded	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sword;	1
and	1
David	1
also	1
girded	1
on	1
his	1
sword:	1
and	1
there	1
went	1
up	1
after	1
David	1
about	1
four	1
hundred	1
men;	1
and	1
two	1
hundred	1
abode	1
by	1
the	1
stuff.	1
	1
25:14	1
But	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
told	1
Abigail,	1
Nabal's	1
wife,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
salute	1
our	1
master;	1
and	1
he	1
railed	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
25:15	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
very	1
good	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
hurt,	1
neither	1
missed	1
we	1
any	1
thing,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
conversant	1
with	1
them,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fields:	1
25:16	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
wall	1
unto	1
us	1
both	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
them	1
keeping	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
25:17	1
Now	1
therefore	1
know	1
and	1
consider	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do;	1
for	1
evil	1
is	1
determined	1
against	1
our	1
master,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
his	1
household:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Belial,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
cannot	1
speak	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
25:18	1
Then	1
Abigail	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
took	1
two	1
hundred	1
loaves,	1
and	1
two	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
five	1
sheep	1
ready	1
dressed,	1
and	1
five	1
measures	1
of	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
clusters	1
of	1
raisins,	1
and	1
two	1
hundred	1
cakes	1
of	1
figs,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
asses.	1
	1
25:19	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
servants,	1
Go	1
on	1
before	1
me;	1
behold,	1
I	1
come	1
after	1
you.	1
But	1
she	1
told	1
not	1
her	1
husband	1
Nabal.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
as	1
she	1
rode	1
on	1
the	1
ass,	1
that	1
she	1
came	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
covert	1
on	1
the	1
hill,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
came	1
down	1
against	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
met	1
them.	1
	1
25:21	1
Now	1
David	1
had	1
said,	1
Surely	1
in	1
vain	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
all	1
that	1
this	1
fellow	1
hath	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
so	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
missed	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
pertained	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
requited	1
me	1
evil	1
for	1
good.	1
	1
25:22	1
So	1
and	1
more	1
also	1
do	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
David,	1
if	1
I	1
leave	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
pertain	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
any	1
that	1
pisseth	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
when	1
Abigail	1
saw	1
David,	1
she	1
hasted,	1
and	1
lighted	1
off	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
fell	1
before	1
David	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
bowed	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
25:24	1
And	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Upon	1
me,	1
my	1
lord,	1
upon	1
me	1
let	1
this	1
iniquity	1
be:	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
speak	1
in	1
thine	1
audience,	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid.	1
	1
25:25	1
Let	1
not	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
regard	1
this	1
man	1
of	1
Belial,	1
even	1
Nabal:	1
for	1
as	1
his	1
name	1
is,	1
so	1
is	1
he;	1
Nabal	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
folly	1
is	1
with	1
him:	1
but	1
I	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
whom	1
thou	1
didst	1
send.	1
	1
25:26	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
my	1
lord,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
withholden	1
thee	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
shed	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
avenging	1
thyself	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
hand,	1
now	1
let	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
evil	1
to	1
my	1
lord,	1
be	1
as	1
Nabal.	1
	1
25:27	1
And	1
now	1
this	1
blessing	1
which	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
hath	1
brought	1
unto	1
my	1
lord,	1
let	1
it	1
even	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
follow	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
25:28	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
forgive	1
the	1
trespass	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
certainly	1
make	1
my	1
lord	1
a	1
sure	1
house;	1
because	1
my	1
lord	1
fighteth	1
the	1
battles	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
evil	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
thee	1
all	1
thy	1
days.	1
	1
25:29	1
Yet	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
risen	1
to	1
pursue	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
seek	1
thy	1
soul:	1
but	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
bundle	1
of	1
life	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
them	1
shall	1
he	1
sling	1
out,	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
sling.	1
	1
25:30	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
my	1
lord	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
appointed	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
Israel;	1
25:31	1
That	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
grief	1
unto	1
thee,	1
nor	1
offence	1
of	1
heart	1
unto	1
my	1
lord,	1
either	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shed	1
blood	1
causeless,	1
or	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
hath	1
avenged	1
himself:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
have	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
my	1
lord,	1
then	1
remember	1
thine	1
handmaid.	1
	1
25:32	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abigail,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
sent	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
to	1
meet	1
me:	1
25:33	1
And	1
blessed	1
be	1
thy	1
advice,	1
and	1
blessed	1
be	1
thou,	1
which	1
hast	1
kept	1
me	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
shed	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
avenging	1
myself	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
25:34	1
For	1
in	1
very	1
deed,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
liveth,	1
which	1
hath	1
kept	1
me	1
back	1
from	1
hurting	1
thee,	1
except	1
thou	1
hadst	1
hasted	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
meet	1
me,	1
surely	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
left	1
unto	1
Nabal	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
any	1
that	1
pisseth	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
25:35	1
So	1
David	1
received	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Go	1
up	1
in	1
peace	1
to	1
thine	1
house;	1
see,	1
I	1
have	1
hearkened	1
to	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
have	1
accepted	1
thy	1
person.	1
	1
25:36	1
And	1
Abigail	1
came	1
to	1
Nabal;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
feast	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
like	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
a	1
king;	1
and	1
Nabal's	1
heart	1
was	1
merry	1
within	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
drunken:	1
wherefore	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
nothing,	1
less	1
or	1
more,	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
light.	1
	1
25:37	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
the	1
wine	1
was	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
Nabal,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
died	1
within	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
as	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
25:38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
ten	1
days	1
after,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
Nabal,	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
25:39	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
heard	1
that	1
Nabal	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
hath	1
pleaded	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
reproach	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nabal,	1
and	1
hath	1
kept	1
his	1
servant	1
from	1
evil:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
returned	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
Nabal	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head.	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
Abigail,	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
25:40	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Abigail	1
to	1
Carmel,	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
her,	1
saying,	1
David	1
sent	1
us	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
take	1
thee	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
25:41	1
And	1
she	1
arose,	1
and	1
bowed	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
let	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
be	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
wash	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
25:42	1
And	1
Abigail	1
hasted,	1
and	1
arose	1
and	1
rode	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
with	1
five	1
damsels	1
of	1
hers	1
that	1
went	1
after	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
after	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
became	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
25:43	1
David	1
also	1
took	1
Ahinoam	1
of	1
Jezreel;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
his	1
wives.	1
	1
25:44	1
But	1
Saul	1
had	1
given	1
Michal	1
his	1
daughter,	1
David's	1
wife,	1
to	1
Phalti	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Laish,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Gallim.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
the	1
Ziphites	1
came	1
unto	1
Saul	1
to	1
Gibeah,	1
saying,	1
Doth	1
not	1
David	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Hachilah,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Jeshimon?	1
	1
26:2	1
Then	1
Saul	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Ziph,	1
having	1
three	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
seek	1
David	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Ziph.	1
	1
26:3	1
And	1
Saul	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Hachilah,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Jeshimon,	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
But	1
David	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
Saul	1
came	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
26:4	1
David	1
therefore	1
sent	1
out	1
spies,	1
and	1
understood	1
that	1
Saul	1
was	1
come	1
in	1
very	1
deed.	1
	1
26:5	1
And	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Saul	1
had	1
pitched:	1
and	1
David	1
beheld	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Saul	1
lay,	1
and	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
host:	1
and	1
Saul	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
trench,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
pitched	1
round	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
26:6	1
Then	1
answered	1
David	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
to	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
brother	1
to	1
Joab,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Saul	1
to	1
the	1
camp?	1
And	1
Abishai	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
26:7	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
Abishai	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
night:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Saul	1
lay	1
sleeping	1
within	1
the	1
trench,	1
and	1
his	1
spear	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
his	1
bolster:	1
but	1
Abner	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
lay	1
round	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
26:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Abishai	1
to	1
David,	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
thine	1
enemy	1
into	1
thine	1
hand	1
this	1
day:	1
now	1
therefore	1
let	1
me	1
smite	1
him,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
with	1
the	1
spear	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
smite	1
him	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
26:9	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abishai,	1
Destroy	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
who	1
can	1
stretch	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed,	1
and	1
be	1
guiltless?	1
	1
26:10	1
David	1
said	1
furthermore,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
smite	1
him;	1
or	1
his	1
day	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
die;	1
or	1
he	1
shall	1
descend	1
into	1
battle,	1
and	1
perish.	1
	1
26:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed:	1
but,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
take	1
thou	1
now	1
the	1
spear	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
bolster,	1
and	1
the	1
cruse	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go.	1
	1
26:12	1
So	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
spear	1
and	1
the	1
cruse	1
of	1
water	1
from	1
Saul's	1
bolster;	1
and	1
they	1
gat	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
saw	1
it,	1
nor	1
knew	1
it,	1
neither	1
awaked:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
asleep;	1
because	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
26:13	1
Then	1
David	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
and	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
an	1
hill	1
afar	1
off;	1
a	1
great	1
space	1
being	1
between	1
them:	1
26:14	1
And	1
David	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
not,	1
Abner?	1
Then	1
Abner	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
criest	1
to	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
26:15	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abner,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
a	1
valiant	1
man?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
Israel?	1
wherefore	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
kept	1
thy	1
lord	1
the	1
king?	1
for	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
king	1
thy	1
lord.	1
	1
26:16	1
This	1
thing	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done.	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
ye	1
are	1
worthy	1
to	1
die,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
your	1
master,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed.	1
	1
And	1
now	1
see	1
where	1
the	1
king's	1
spear	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
cruse	1
of	1
water	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
bolster.	1
	1
26:17	1
And	1
Saul	1
knew	1
David's	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
this	1
thy	1
voice,	1
my	1
son	1
David?	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
voice,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
doth	1
my	1
lord	1
thus	1
pursue	1
after	1
his	1
servant?	1
	1
for	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
or	1
what	1
evil	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
hand?	1
	1
26:19	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
servant.	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
stirred	1
thee	1
up	1
against	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
accept	1
an	1
offering:	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men,	1
cursed	1
be	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
driven	1
me	1
out	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
abiding	1
in	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Go,	1
serve	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
26:20	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
let	1
not	1
my	1
blood	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
seek	1
a	1
flea,	1
as	1
when	1
one	1
doth	1
hunt	1
a	1
partridge	1
in	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
26:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned:	1
return,	1
my	1
son	1
David:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
do	1
thee	1
harm,	1
because	1
my	1
soul	1
was	1
precious	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes	1
this	1
day:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
played	1
the	1
fool,	1
and	1
have	1
erred	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
26:22	1
And	1
David	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
king's	1
spear!	1
and	1
let	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
come	1
over	1
and	1
fetch	1
it.	1
	1
26:23	1
The	1
LORD	1
render	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
righteousness	1
and	1
his	1
faithfulness;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
thee	1
into	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
day,	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed.	1
	1
26:24	1
And,	1
behold,	1
as	1
thy	1
life	1
was	1
much	1
set	1
by	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
so	1
let	1
my	1
life	1
be	1
much	1
set	1
by	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
tribulation.	1
	1
26:25	1
Then	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou,	1
my	1
son	1
David:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
both	1
do	1
great	1
things,	1
and	1
also	1
shalt	1
still	1
prevail.	1
So	1
David	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
Saul	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
perish	1
one	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul:	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
than	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
speedily	1
escape	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines;	1
and	1
Saul	1
shall	1
despair	1
of	1
me,	1
to	1
seek	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
any	1
coast	1
of	1
Israel:	1
so	1
shall	1
I	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
unto	1
Achish,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maoch,	1
king	1
of	1
Gath.	1
	1
27:3	1
And	1
David	1
dwelt	1
with	1
Achish	1
at	1
Gath,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
household,	1
even	1
David	1
with	1
his	1
two	1
wives,	1
Ahinoam	1
the	1
Jezreelitess,	1
and	1
Abigail	1
the	1
Carmelitess,	1
Nabal's	1
wife.	1
	1
27:4	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
fled	1
to	1
Gath:	1
and	1
he	1
sought	1
no	1
more	1
again	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Achish,	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
let	1
them	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
some	1
town	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
dwell	1
there:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
thy	1
servant	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
royal	1
city	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
27:6	1
Then	1
Achish	1
gave	1
him	1
Ziklag	1
that	1
day:	1
wherefore	1
Ziklag	1
pertaineth	1
unto	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
David	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
was	1
a	1
full	1
year	1
and	1
four	1
months.	1
	1
27:8	1
And	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
invaded	1
the	1
Geshurites,	1
and	1
the	1
Gezrites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites:	1
for	1
those	1
nations	1
were	1
of	1
old	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
as	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
Shur,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
27:9	1
And	1
David	1
smote	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
left	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
woman	1
alive,	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
the	1
asses,	1
and	1
the	1
camels,	1
and	1
the	1
apparel,	1
and	1
returned,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Achish.	1
	1
27:10	1
And	1
Achish	1
said,	1
Whither	1
have	1
ye	1
made	1
a	1
road	1
to	1
day?	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Against	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
Jerahmeelites,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
Kenites.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
David	1
saved	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
woman	1
alive,	1
to	1
bring	1
tidings	1
to	1
Gath,	1
saying,	1
Lest	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
on	1
us,	1
saying,	1
So	1
did	1
David,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
manner	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
Achish	1
believed	1
David,	1
saying,	1
He	1
hath	1
made	1
his	1
people	1
Israel	1
utterly	1
to	1
abhor	1
him;	1
therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
servant	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
their	1
armies	1
together	1
for	1
warfare,	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
Israel.	1
And	1
Achish	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Know	1
thou	1
assuredly,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
battle,	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
men.	1
	1
28:2	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Achish,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
what	1
thy	1
servant	1
can	1
do.	1
And	1
Achish	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
keeper	1
of	1
mine	1
head	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
28:3	1
Now	1
Samuel	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
had	1
lamented	1
him,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
Ramah,	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
city.	1
And	1
Saul	1
had	1
put	1
away	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
the	1
wizards,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
28:4	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Shunem:	1
and	1
Saul	1
gathered	1
all	1
Israel	1
together,	1
and	1
they	1
pitched	1
in	1
Gilboa.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
saw	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
greatly	1
trembled.	1
	1
28:6	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
him	1
not,	1
neither	1
by	1
dreams,	1
nor	1
by	1
Urim,	1
nor	1
by	1
prophets.	1
	1
28:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Seek	1
me	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
enquire	1
of	1
her.	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit	1
at	1
Endor.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
disguised	1
himself,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
other	1
raiment,	1
and	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
two	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
by	1
night:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
divine	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
him	1
up,	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
name	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
28:9	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
what	1
Saul	1
hath	1
done,	1
how	1
he	1
hath	1
cut	1
off	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
the	1
wizards,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
layest	1
thou	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
my	1
life,	1
to	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
die?	1
	1
28:10	1
And	1
Saul	1
sware	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
punishment	1
happen	1
to	1
thee	1
for	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
28:11	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
woman,	1
Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
bring	1
up	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
me	1
up	1
Samuel.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
Samuel,	1
she	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice:	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
spake	1
to	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
deceived	1
me?	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
Saul.	1
	1
28:13	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid:	1
for	1
what	1
sawest	1
thou?	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
I	1
saw	1
gods	1
ascending	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
28:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
form	1
is	1
he	1
of?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
An	1
old	1
man	1
cometh	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
mantle.	1
And	1
Saul	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
he	1
stooped	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself.	1
	1
28:15	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
disquieted	1
me,	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
up?	1
And	1
Saul	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
sore	1
distressed;	1
for	1
the	1
Philistines	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
God	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
answereth	1
me	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
by	1
prophets,	1
nor	1
by	1
dreams:	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
do.	1
	1
28:16	1
Then	1
said	1
Samuel,	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
dost	1
thou	1
ask	1
of	1
me,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
is	1
become	1
thine	1
enemy?	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
me:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rent	1
the	1
kingdom	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
even	1
to	1
David:	1
28:18	1
Because	1
thou	1
obeyedst	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
executedst	1
his	1
fierce	1
wrath	1
upon	1
Amalek,	1
therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
done	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
thee	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
28:19	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
also	1
deliver	1
Israel	1
with	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
shalt	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
be	1
with	1
me:	1
the	1
LORD	1
also	1
shall	1
deliver	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Israel	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
28:20	1
Then	1
Saul	1
fell	1
straightway	1
all	1
along	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Samuel:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
strength	1
in	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
no	1
bread	1
all	1
the	1
day,	1
nor	1
all	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
28:21	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
came	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
troubled,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
hath	1
obeyed	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
thy	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
spakest	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
28:22	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
hearken	1
thou	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
set	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
eat,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
have	1
strength,	1
when	1
thou	1
goest	1
on	1
thy	1
way.	1
	1
28:23	1
But	1
he	1
refused,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
eat.	1
But	1
his	1
servants,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
woman,	1
compelled	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
their	1
voice.	1
So	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
28:24	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
a	1
fat	1
calf	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
she	1
hasted,	1
and	1
killed	1
it,	1
and	1
took	1
flour,	1
and	1
kneaded	1
it,	1
and	1
did	1
bake	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
thereof:	1
28:25	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
it	1
before	1
Saul,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
servants;	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat.	1
Then	1
they	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
29:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
their	1
armies	1
to	1
Aphek:	1
and	1
the	1
Israelites	1
pitched	1
by	1
a	1
fountain	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
29:2	1
And	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
passed	1
on	1
by	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
by	1
thousands:	1
but	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
passed	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
rereward	1
with	1
Achish.	1
	1
29:3	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
What	1
do	1
these	1
Hebrews	1
here?	1
	1
And	1
Achish	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
David,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Saul	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
these	1
days,	1
or	1
these	1
years,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him	1
since	1
he	1
fell	1
unto	1
me	1
unto	1
this	1
day?	1
	1
29:4	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
wroth	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Make	1
this	1
fellow	1
return,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
appointed	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
battle,	1
lest	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
he	1
be	1
an	1
adversary	1
to	1
us:	1
for	1
wherewith	1
should	1
he	1
reconcile	1
himself	1
unto	1
his	1
master?	1
should	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
these	1
men?	1
	1
29:5	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
David,	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
sang	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
dances,	1
saying,	1
Saul	1
slew	1
his	1
thousands,	1
and	1
David	1
his	1
ten	1
thousands?	1
	1
29:6	1
Then	1
Achish	1
called	1
David,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Surely,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
upright,	1
and	1
thy	1
going	1
out	1
and	1
thy	1
coming	1
in	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
host	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
my	1
sight:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
evil	1
in	1
thee	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
coming	1
unto	1
me	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
lords	1
favour	1
thee	1
not.	1
	1
29:7	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
return,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
peace,	1
that	1
thou	1
displease	1
not	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
29:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Achish,	1
But	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
and	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
found	1
in	1
thy	1
servant	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
thee	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
go	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king?	1
29:9	1
And	1
Achish	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
good	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God:	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
have	1
said,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
29:10	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
rise	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
thy	1
master's	1
servants	1
that	1
are	1
come	1
with	1
thee:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
be	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
have	1
light,	1
depart.	1
	1
29:11	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
to	1
depart	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
30:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Ziklag	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
had	1
invaded	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
Ziklag,	1
and	1
smitten	1
Ziklag,	1
and	1
burned	1
it	1
with	1
fire;	1
30:2	1
And	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
women	1
captives,	1
that	1
were	1
therein:	1
they	1
slew	1
not	1
any,	1
either	1
great	1
or	1
small,	1
but	1
carried	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
30:3	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
burned	1
with	1
fire;	1
and	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
their	1
sons,	1
and	1
their	1
daughters,	1
were	1
taken	1
captives.	1
	1
30:4	1
Then	1
David	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
and	1
wept,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
power	1
to	1
weep.	1
	1
30:5	1
And	1
David's	1
two	1
wives	1
were	1
taken	1
captives,	1
Ahinoam	1
the	1
Jezreelitess,	1
and	1
Abigail	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Nabal	1
the	1
Carmelite.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
greatly	1
distressed;	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
spake	1
of	1
stoning	1
him,	1
because	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
grieved,	1
every	1
man	1
for	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
daughters:	1
but	1
David	1
encouraged	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest,	1
Ahimelech's	1
son,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
bring	1
me	1
hither	1
the	1
ephod.	1
And	1
Abiathar	1
brought	1
thither	1
the	1
ephod	1
to	1
David.	1
	1
30:8	1
And	1
David	1
enquired	1
at	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
pursue	1
after	1
this	1
troop?	1
shall	1
I	1
overtake	1
them?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
Pursue:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
overtake	1
them,	1
and	1
without	1
fail	1
recover	1
all.	1
	1
30:9	1
So	1
David	1
went,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
Besor,	1
where	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
behind	1
stayed.	1
	1
30:10	1
But	1
David	1
pursued,	1
he	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
men:	1
for	1
two	1
hundred	1
abode	1
behind,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
faint	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Besor.	1
	1
30:11	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
bread,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat;	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
drink	1
water;	1
30:12	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
figs,	1
and	1
two	1
clusters	1
of	1
raisins:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
eaten,	1
his	1
spirit	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
no	1
bread,	1
nor	1
drunk	1
any	1
water,	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights.	1
	1
30:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
To	1
whom	1
belongest	1
thou?	1
and	1
whence	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
servant	1
to	1
an	1
Amalekite;	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
left	1
me,	1
because	1
three	1
days	1
agone	1
I	1
fell	1
sick.	1
	1
30:14	1
We	1
made	1
an	1
invasion	1
upon	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
Cherethites,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
coast	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Judah,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Caleb;	1
and	1
we	1
burned	1
Ziklag	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
30:15	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Canst	1
thou	1
bring	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
this	1
company?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Swear	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
neither	1
kill	1
me,	1
nor	1
deliver	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
my	1
master,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
down	1
to	1
this	1
company.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
down,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
spread	1
abroad	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
and	1
dancing,	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
spoil	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
30:17	1
And	1
David	1
smote	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
twilight	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day:	1
and	1
there	1
escaped	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
them,	1
save	1
four	1
hundred	1
young	1
men,	1
which	1
rode	1
upon	1
camels,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
30:18	1
And	1
David	1
recovered	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
had	1
carried	1
away:	1
and	1
David	1
rescued	1
his	1
two	1
wives.	1
	1
30:19	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
lacking	1
to	1
them,	1
neither	1
small	1
nor	1
great,	1
neither	1
sons	1
nor	1
daughters,	1
neither	1
spoil,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
them:	1
David	1
recovered	1
all.	1
	1
30:20	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
the	1
herds,	1
which	1
they	1
drave	1
before	1
those	1
other	1
cattle,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
David's	1
spoil.	1
	1
30:21	1
And	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
faint	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
follow	1
David,	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
also	1
to	1
abide	1
at	1
the	1
brook	1
Besor:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
David,	1
and	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
David	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
saluted	1
them.	1
	1
30:22	1
Then	1
answered	1
all	1
the	1
wicked	1
men	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
Belial,	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
went	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
Because	1
they	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
us,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
recovered,	1
save	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
children,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
lead	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
depart.	1
	1
30:23	1
Then	1
said	1
David,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
so,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
with	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
us,	1
who	1
hath	1
preserved	1
us,	1
and	1
delivered	1
the	1
company	1
that	1
came	1
against	1
us	1
into	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
30:24	1
For	1
who	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
matter?	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
part	1
is	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
battle,	1
so	1
shall	1
his	1
part	1
be	1
that	1
tarrieth	1
by	1
the	1
stuff:	1
they	1
shall	1
part	1
alike.	1
	1
30:25	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forward,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
statute	1
and	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
Israel	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
30:26	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Ziklag,	1
he	1
sent	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Judah,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
a	1
present	1
for	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
30:27	1
To	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
south	1
Ramoth,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Jattir,	1
30:28	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Aroer,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Siphmoth,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Eshtemoa,	1
30:29	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Rachal,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Jerahmeelites,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Kenites,	1
30:30	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Hormah,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Chorashan,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Athach,	1
30:31	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
where	1
David	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
haunt.	1
	1
31:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
slain	1
in	1
mount	1
Gilboa.	1
	1
31:2	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
followed	1
hard	1
upon	1
Saul	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons;	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
slew	1
Jonathan,	1
and	1
Abinadab,	1
and	1
Melchishua,	1
Saul's	1
sons.	1
	1
31:3	1
And	1
the	1
battle	1
went	1
sore	1
against	1
Saul,	1
and	1
the	1
archers	1
hit	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
wounded	1
of	1
the	1
archers.	1
	1
31:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
unto	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
Draw	1
thy	1
sword,	1
and	1
thrust	1
me	1
through	1
therewith;	1
lest	1
these	1
uncircumcised	1
come	1
and	1
thrust	1
me	1
through,	1
and	1
abuse	1
me.	1
But	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
would	1
not;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
Therefore	1
Saul	1
took	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
31:5	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
saw	1
that	1
Saul	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
fell	1
likewise	1
upon	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
died	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
31:6	1
So	1
Saul	1
died,	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
men,	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
together.	1
	1
31:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
fled,	1
and	1
that	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
dead,	1
they	1
forsook	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
fled;	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
31:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
to	1
strip	1
the	1
slain,	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
sons	1
fallen	1
in	1
mount	1
Gilboa.	1
	1
31:9	1
And	1
they	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
stripped	1
off	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
round	1
about,	1
to	1
publish	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
idols,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
31:10	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ashtaroth:	1
and	1
they	1
fastened	1
his	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Bethshan.	1
	1
31:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
heard	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Saul;	1
31:12	1
All	1
the	1
valiant	1
men	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
all	1
night,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Bethshan,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jabesh,	1
and	1
burnt	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
31:13	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
bones,	1
and	1
buried	1
them	1
under	1
a	1
tree	1
at	1
Jabesh,	1
and	1
fasted	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Book	1
of	1
Samuel	1
	1
Otherwise	1
Called:	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Saul,	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
David	1
had	1
abode	1
two	1
days	1
in	1
Ziklag;	1
1:2	1
It	1
came	1
even	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
from	1
Saul	1
with	1
his	1
clothes	1
rent,	1
and	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
head:	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
David,	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
did	1
obeisance.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
From	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel	1
am	1
I	1
escaped.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
went	1
the	1
matter?	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
tell	1
me.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
That	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
are	1
fallen	1
and	1
dead;	1
and	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son	1
are	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
How	1
knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son	1
be	1
dead?	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
him	1
said,	1
As	1
I	1
happened	1
by	1
chance	1
upon	1
mount	1
Gilboa,	1
behold,	1
Saul	1
leaned	1
upon	1
his	1
spear;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen	1
followed	1
hard	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
behind	1
him,	1
he	1
saw	1
me,	1
and	1
called	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
answered	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
Amalekite.	1
	1
1:9	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
Stand,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
slay	1
me:	1
for	1
anguish	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
me,	1
because	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
yet	1
whole	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
1:10	1
So	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
fallen:	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
crown	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
bracelet	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
hither	1
unto	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
David	1
took	1
hold	1
on	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
rent	1
them;	1
and	1
likewise	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him:	1
1:12	1
And	1
they	1
mourned,	1
and	1
wept,	1
and	1
fasted	1
until	1
even,	1
for	1
Saul,	1
and	1
for	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
Whence	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
stranger,	1
an	1
Amalekite.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
wast	1
thou	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed?	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
David	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
near,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
blood	1
be	1
upon	1
thy	1
head;	1
for	1
thy	1
mouth	1
hath	1
testified	1
against	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
slain	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
David	1
lamented	1
with	1
this	1
lamentation	1
over	1
Saul	1
and	1
over	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son:	1
1:18	1
(Also	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
teach	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
bow:	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Jasher.)	1
1:19	1
The	1
beauty	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
slain	1
upon	1
thy	1
high	1
places:	1
how	1
are	1
the	1
mighty	1
fallen!	1
	1
1:20	1
Tell	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
Gath,	1
publish	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Askelon;	1
lest	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
rejoice,	1
lest	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
triumph.	1
	1
1:21	1
Ye	1
mountains	1
of	1
Gilboa,	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
dew,	1
neither	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
rain,	1
upon	1
you,	1
nor	1
fields	1
of	1
offerings:	1
for	1
there	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
is	1
vilely	1
cast	1
away,	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
Saul,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
anointed	1
with	1
oil.	1
	1
1:22	1
From	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
slain,	1
from	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
mighty,	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
turned	1
not	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Saul	1
returned	1
not	1
empty.	1
	1
1:23	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
were	1
lovely	1
and	1
pleasant	1
in	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
death	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
divided:	1
they	1
were	1
swifter	1
than	1
eagles,	1
they	1
were	1
stronger	1
than	1
lions.	1
	1
1:24	1
Ye	1
daughters	1
of	1
Israel,	1
weep	1
over	1
Saul,	1
who	1
clothed	1
you	1
in	1
scarlet,	1
with	1
other	1
delights,	1
who	1
put	1
on	1
ornaments	1
of	1
gold	1
upon	1
your	1
apparel.	1
	1
1:25	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
mighty	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
battle!	1
O	1
Jonathan,	1
thou	1
wast	1
slain	1
in	1
thine	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
1:26	1
I	1
am	1
distressed	1
for	1
thee,	1
my	1
brother	1
Jonathan:	1
very	1
pleasant	1
hast	1
thou	1
been	1
unto	1
me:	1
thy	1
love	1
to	1
me	1
was	1
wonderful,	1
passing	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
women.	1
	1
1:27	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
mighty	1
fallen,	1
and	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
perished!	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
into	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
up.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Whither	1
shall	1
I	1
go	1
up?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Unto	1
Hebron.	1
	1
2:2	1
So	1
David	1
went	1
up	1
thither,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
wives	1
also,	1
Ahinoam	1
the	1
Jezreelitess,	1
and	1
Abigail	1
Nabal's	1
wife	1
the	1
Carmelite.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
his	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
did	1
David	1
bring	1
up,	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
household:	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Hebron.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
came,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
anointed	1
David	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah.	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
That	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
were	1
they	1
that	1
buried	1
Saul.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
shewed	1
this	1
kindness	1
unto	1
your	1
lord,	1
even	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
and	1
have	1
buried	1
him.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
shew	1
kindness	1
and	1
truth	1
unto	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
requite	1
you	1
this	1
kindness,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
2:7	1
Therefore	1
now	1
let	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
strengthened,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
valiant:	1
for	1
your	1
master	1
Saul	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
anointed	1
me	1
king	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
captain	1
of	1
Saul's	1
host,	1
took	1
Ishbosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
Mahanaim;	1
2:9	1
And	1
made	1
him	1
king	1
over	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
Ashurites,	1
and	1
over	1
Jezreel,	1
and	1
over	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
over	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:10	1
Ishbosheth	1
Saul's	1
son	1
was	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
reigned	1
two	1
years.	1
But	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
followed	1
David.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
king	1
in	1
Hebron	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
was	1
seven	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Ishbosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Mahanaim	1
to	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David,	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
met	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Gibeon:	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
down,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pool,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pool.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
Abner	1
said	1
to	1
Joab,	1
Let	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
now	1
arise,	1
and	1
play	1
before	1
us.	1
And	1
Joab	1
said,	1
Let	1
them	1
arise.	1
	1
2:15	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
by	1
number	1
twelve	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
which	1
pertained	1
to	1
Ishbosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
twelve	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
they	1
caught	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
fellow	1
by	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
thrust	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
fellow's	1
side;	1
so	1
they	1
fell	1
down	1
together:	1
wherefore	1
that	1
place	1
was	1
called	1
Helkathhazzurim,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
sore	1
battle	1
that	1
day;	1
and	1
Abner	1
was	1
beaten,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
before	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
sons	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
there,	1
Joab,	1
and	1
Abishai,	1
and	1
Asahel:	1
and	1
Asahel	1
was	1
as	1
light	1
of	1
foot	1
as	1
a	1
wild	1
roe.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
Asahel	1
pursued	1
after	1
Abner;	1
and	1
in	1
going	1
he	1
turned	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
following	1
Abner.	1
	1
2:20	1
Then	1
Abner	1
looked	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Art	1
thou	1
Asahel?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
Abner	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Turn	1
thee	1
aside	1
to	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
thy	1
left,	1
and	1
lay	1
thee	1
hold	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
take	1
thee	1
his	1
armour.	1
	1
But	1
Asahel	1
would	1
not	1
turn	1
aside	1
from	1
following	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
Abner	1
said	1
again	1
to	1
Asahel,	1
Turn	1
thee	1
aside	1
from	1
following	1
me:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
I	1
smite	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
ground?	1
how	1
then	1
should	1
I	1
hold	1
up	1
my	1
face	1
to	1
Joab	1
thy	1
brother?	1
	1
2:23	1
Howbeit	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
turn	1
aside:	1
wherefore	1
Abner	1
with	1
the	1
hinder	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
spear	1
smote	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
fifth	1
rib,	1
that	1
the	1
spear	1
came	1
out	1
behind	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
there,	1
and	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Asahel	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
died	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
2:24	1
Joab	1
also	1
and	1
Abishai	1
pursued	1
after	1
Abner:	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Ammah,	1
that	1
lieth	1
before	1
Giah	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
after	1
Abner,	1
and	1
became	1
one	1
troop,	1
and	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
an	1
hill.	1
	1
2:26	1
Then	1
Abner	1
called	1
to	1
Joab,	1
and	1
said,	1
Shall	1
the	1
sword	1
devour	1
for	1
ever?	1
	1
knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
bitterness	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
then,	1
ere	1
thou	1
bid	1
the	1
people	1
return	1
from	1
following	1
their	1
brethren?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
Joab	1
said,	1
As	1
God	1
liveth,	1
unless	1
thou	1
hadst	1
spoken,	1
surely	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
following	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
2:28	1
So	1
Joab	1
blew	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
pursued	1
after	1
Israel	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
fought	1
they	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
2:29	1
And	1
Abner	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
walked	1
all	1
that	1
night	1
through	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
all	1
Bithron,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Mahanaim.	1
	1
2:30	1
And	1
Joab	1
returned	1
from	1
following	1
Abner:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
there	1
lacked	1
of	1
David's	1
servants	1
nineteen	1
men	1
and	1
Asahel.	1
	1
2:31	1
But	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
had	1
smitten	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
of	1
Abner's	1
men,	1
so	1
that	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
men	1
died.	1
	1
2:32	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
Asahel,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Bethlehem.	1
And	1
Joab	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
all	1
night,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Hebron	1
at	1
break	1
of	1
day.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
long	1
war	1
between	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David:	1
but	1
David	1
waxed	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
waxed	1
weaker	1
and	1
weaker.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
unto	1
David	1
were	1
sons	1
born	1
in	1
Hebron:	1
and	1
his	1
firstborn	1
was	1
Amnon,	1
of	1
Ahinoam	1
the	1
Jezreelitess;	1
3:3	1
And	1
his	1
second,	1
Chileab,	1
of	1
Abigail	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Nabal	1
the	1
Carmelite;	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
Absalom	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maacah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Talmai	1
king	1
of	1
Geshur;	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
fourth,	1
Adonijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Haggith;	1
and	1
the	1
fifth,	1
Shephatiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abital;	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
sixth,	1
Ithream,	1
by	1
Eglah	1
David's	1
wife.	1
These	1
were	1
born	1
to	1
David	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
between	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
that	1
Abner	1
made	1
himself	1
strong	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
Saul	1
had	1
a	1
concubine,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Rizpah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Aiah:	1
and	1
Ishbosheth	1
said	1
to	1
Abner,	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
gone	1
in	1
unto	1
my	1
father's	1
concubine?	1
	1
3:8	1
Then	1
was	1
Abner	1
very	1
wroth	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Ishbosheth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
dog's	1
head,	1
which	1
against	1
Judah	1
do	1
shew	1
kindness	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
thy	1
father,	1
to	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
delivered	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
David,	1
that	1
thou	1
chargest	1
me	1
to	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
fault	1
concerning	1
this	1
woman?	1
	1
3:9	1
So	1
do	1
God	1
to	1
Abner,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
except,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
to	1
David,	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
him;	1
3:10	1
To	1
translate	1
the	1
kingdom	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David	1
over	1
Israel	1
and	1
over	1
Judah,	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
Abner	1
a	1
word	1
again,	1
because	1
he	1
feared	1
him.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
Abner	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
David	1
on	1
his	1
behalf,	1
saying,	1
Whose	1
is	1
the	1
land?	1
saying	1
also,	1
Make	1
thy	1
league	1
with	1
me,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
my	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
all	1
Israel	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Well;	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
thee:	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
require	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
is,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face,	1
except	1
thou	1
first	1
bring	1
Michal	1
Saul's	1
daughter,	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
Ishbosheth	1
Saul's	1
son,	1
saying,	1
Deliver	1
me	1
my	1
wife	1
Michal,	1
which	1
I	1
espoused	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
foreskins	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
Ishbosheth	1
sent,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
from	1
her	1
husband,	1
even	1
from	1
Phaltiel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Laish.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
her	1
husband	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
along	1
weeping	1
behind	1
her	1
to	1
Bahurim.	1
	1
Then	1
said	1
Abner	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
return.	1
And	1
he	1
returned.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
Abner	1
had	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
sought	1
for	1
David	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
you:	1
3:18	1
Now	1
then	1
do	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
of	1
David,	1
saying,	1
By	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
servant	1
David	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
enemies.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
Abner	1
also	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
and	1
Abner	1
went	1
also	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
David	1
in	1
Hebron	1
all	1
that	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
3:20	1
So	1
Abner	1
came	1
to	1
David	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
twenty	1
men	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
David	1
made	1
Abner	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
feast.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
Abner	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
I	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
go,	1
and	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
Israel	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
make	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
reign	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
thine	1
heart	1
desireth.	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
Abner	1
away;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
3:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
Joab	1
came	1
from	1
pursuing	1
a	1
troop,	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
spoil	1
with	1
them:	1
but	1
Abner	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
David	1
in	1
Hebron;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
3:23	1
When	1
Joab	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
come,	1
they	1
told	1
Joab,	1
saying,	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
3:24	1
Then	1
Joab	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
behold,	1
Abner	1
came	1
unto	1
thee;	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
gone?	1
	1
3:25	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
deceive	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
thy	1
going	1
out	1
and	1
thy	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
doest.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
when	1
Joab	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
David,	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
after	1
Abner,	1
which	1
brought	1
him	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
Sirah:	1
but	1
David	1
knew	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
3:27	1
And	1
when	1
Abner	1
was	1
returned	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
Joab	1
took	1
him	1
aside	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him	1
quietly,	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
there	1
under	1
the	1
fifth	1
rib,	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Asahel	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
3:28	1
And	1
afterward	1
when	1
David	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
kingdom	1
are	1
guiltless	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner:	1
3:29	1
Let	1
it	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joab,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
house;	1
and	1
let	1
there	1
not	1
fail	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joab	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
issue,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
leper,	1
or	1
that	1
leaneth	1
on	1
a	1
staff,	1
or	1
that	1
falleth	1
on	1
the	1
sword,	1
or	1
that	1
lacketh	1
bread.	1
	1
3:30	1
So	1
Joab,	1
and	1
Abishai	1
his	1
brother	1
slew	1
Abner,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
their	1
brother	1
Asahel	1
at	1
Gibeon	1
in	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
3:31	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Joab,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
Rend	1
your	1
clothes,	1
and	1
gird	1
you	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
mourn	1
before	1
Abner.	1
And	1
king	1
David	1
himself	1
followed	1
the	1
bier.	1
	1
3:32	1
And	1
they	1
buried	1
Abner	1
in	1
Hebron:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept	1
at	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
Abner;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
wept.	1
	1
3:33	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
lamented	1
over	1
Abner,	1
and	1
said,	1
Died	1
Abner	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
dieth?	1
	1
3:34	1
Thy	1
hands	1
were	1
not	1
bound,	1
nor	1
thy	1
feet	1
put	1
into	1
fetters:	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
falleth	1
before	1
wicked	1
men,	1
so	1
fellest	1
thou.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
wept	1
again	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
3:35	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
cause	1
David	1
to	1
eat	1
meat	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
day,	1
David	1
sware,	1
saying,	1
So	1
do	1
God	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
I	1
taste	1
bread,	1
or	1
ought	1
else,	1
till	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
down.	1
	1
3:36	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
pleased	1
them:	1
as	1
whatsoever	1
the	1
king	1
did	1
pleased	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:37	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
understood	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
slay	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner.	1
	1
3:38	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
prince	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
fallen	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
Israel?	1
	1
3:39	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
day	1
weak,	1
though	1
anointed	1
king;	1
and	1
these	1
men	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
me:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reward	1
the	1
doer	1
of	1
evil	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
wickedness.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
when	1
Saul's	1
son	1
heard	1
that	1
Abner	1
was	1
dead	1
in	1
Hebron,	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
feeble,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
were	1
troubled.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
Saul's	1
son	1
had	1
two	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
captains	1
of	1
bands:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Baanah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Rechab,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Rimmon	1
a	1
Beerothite,	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
(for	1
Beeroth	1
also	1
was	1
reckoned	1
to	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
the	1
Beerothites	1
fled	1
to	1
Gittaim,	1
and	1
were	1
sojourners	1
there	1
until	1
this	1
day.)	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Jonathan,	1
Saul's	1
son,	1
had	1
a	1
son	1
that	1
was	1
lame	1
of	1
his	1
feet.	1
He	1
was	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
the	1
tidings	1
came	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
out	1
of	1
Jezreel,	1
and	1
his	1
nurse	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
fled:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
she	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
flee,	1
that	1
he	1
fell,	1
and	1
became	1
lame.	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Mephibosheth.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Rimmon	1
the	1
Beerothite,	1
Rechab	1
and	1
Baanah,	1
went,	1
and	1
came	1
about	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ishbosheth,	1
who	1
lay	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
at	1
noon.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
thither	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
fetched	1
wheat;	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
fifth	1
rib:	1
and	1
Rechab	1
and	1
Baanah	1
his	1
brother	1
escaped.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
in	1
his	1
bedchamber,	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
and	1
beheaded	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
gat	1
them	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
plain	1
all	1
night.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ishbosheth	1
unto	1
David	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ishbosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul	1
thine	1
enemy,	1
which	1
sought	1
thy	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
avenged	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
this	1
day	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
seed.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
David	1
answered	1
Rechab	1
and	1
Baanah	1
his	1
brother,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Rimmon	1
the	1
Beerothite,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
who	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
my	1
soul	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
adversity,	1
4:10	1
When	1
one	1
told	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
Saul	1
is	1
dead,	1
thinking	1
to	1
have	1
brought	1
good	1
tidings,	1
I	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
in	1
Ziklag,	1
who	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
reward	1
for	1
his	1
tidings:	1
4:11	1
How	1
much	1
more,	1
when	1
wicked	1
men	1
have	1
slain	1
a	1
righteous	1
person	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
upon	1
his	1
bed?	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
therefore	1
now	1
require	1
his	1
blood	1
of	1
your	1
hand,	1
and	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
David	1
commanded	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
them,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
hanged	1
them	1
up	1
over	1
the	1
pool	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
But	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ishbosheth,	1
and	1
buried	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
Abner	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
	1
5:1	1
Then	1
came	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
David	1
unto	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
are	1
thy	1
bone	1
and	1
thy	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:2	1
Also	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
us,	1
thou	1
wast	1
he	1
that	1
leddest	1
out	1
and	1
broughtest	1
in	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
feed	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
captain	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:3	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Hebron;	1
and	1
king	1
David	1
made	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
Hebron	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
they	1
anointed	1
David	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
David	1
was	1
thirty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
5:5	1
In	1
Hebron	1
he	1
reigned	1
over	1
Judah	1
seven	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months:	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
he	1
reigned	1
thirty	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
over	1
all	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
which	1
spake	1
unto	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Except	1
thou	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
hither:	1
thinking,	1
David	1
cannot	1
come	1
in	1
hither.	1
	1
5:7	1
Nevertheless	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
strong	1
hold	1
of	1
Zion:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
Whosoever	1
getteth	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gutter,	1
and	1
smiteth	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
and	1
the	1
blind	1
that	1
are	1
hated	1
of	1
David's	1
soul,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
chief	1
and	1
captain.	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
5:9	1
So	1
David	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
fort,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
David	1
built	1
round	1
about	1
from	1
Millo	1
and	1
inward.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
grew	1
great,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
Hiram	1
king	1
of	1
Tyre	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
cedar	1
trees,	1
and	1
carpenters,	1
and	1
masons:	1
and	1
they	1
built	1
David	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
David	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
established	1
him	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
exalted	1
his	1
kingdom	1
for	1
his	1
people	1
Israel's	1
sake.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
him	1
more	1
concubines	1
and	1
wives	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
Hebron:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
yet	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
born	1
to	1
David.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
these	1
be	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
Shammuah,	1
and	1
Shobab,	1
and	1
Nathan,	1
and	1
Solomon,	1
5:15	1
Ibhar	1
also,	1
and	1
Elishua,	1
and	1
Nepheg,	1
and	1
Japhia,	1
5:16	1
And	1
Elishama,	1
and	1
Eliada,	1
and	1
Eliphalet.	1
	1
5:17	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
anointed	1
David	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
all	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
seek	1
David;	1
and	1
David	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
hold.	1
	1
5:18	1
The	1
Philistines	1
also	1
came	1
and	1
spread	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
mine	1
hand?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Go	1
up:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
doubtless	1
deliver	1
the	1
Philistines	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Baalperazim,	1
and	1
David	1
smote	1
them	1
there,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
broken	1
forth	1
upon	1
mine	1
enemies	1
before	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
breach	1
of	1
waters.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Baalperazim.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
left	1
their	1
images,	1
and	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
burned	1
them.	1
	1
5:22	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up	1
yet	1
again,	1
and	1
spread	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
up;	1
but	1
fetch	1
a	1
compass	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
mulberry	1
trees.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
let	1
it	1
be,	1
when	1
thou	1
hearest	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
going	1
in	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mulberry	1
trees,	1
that	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bestir	1
thyself:	1
for	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
go	1
out	1
before	1
thee,	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
David	1
did	1
so,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
him;	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines	1
from	1
Geba	1
until	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
Gazer.	1
	1
6:1	1
Again,	1
David	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thirty	1
thousand.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Baale	1
of	1
Judah,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
from	1
thence	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
a	1
new	1
cart,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abinadab	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Gibeah:	1
and	1
Uzzah	1
and	1
Ahio,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Abinadab,	1
drave	1
the	1
new	1
cart.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abinadab	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Gibeah,	1
accompanying	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
Ahio	1
went	1
before	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
played	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
on	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
instruments	1
made	1
of	1
fir	1
wood,	1
even	1
on	1
harps,	1
and	1
on	1
psalteries,	1
and	1
on	1
timbrels,	1
and	1
on	1
cornets,	1
and	1
on	1
cymbals.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Nachon's	1
threshingfloor,	1
Uzzah	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
it;	1
for	1
the	1
oxen	1
shook	1
it.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Uzzah;	1
and	1
God	1
smote	1
him	1
there	1
for	1
his	1
error;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
died	1
by	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
displeased,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
breach	1
upon	1
Uzzah:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Perezuzzah	1
to	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
said,	1
How	1
shall	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
come	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
6:10	1
So	1
David	1
would	1
not	1
remove	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
but	1
David	1
carried	1
it	1
aside	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom	1
the	1
Gittite.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom	1
the	1
Gittite	1
three	1
months:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
Obededom,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
king	1
David,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
pertaineth	1
unto	1
him,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God.	1
So	1
David	1
went	1
and	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
with	1
gladness.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
gone	1
six	1
paces,	1
he	1
sacrificed	1
oxen	1
and	1
fatlings.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
David	1
danced	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might;	1
and	1
David	1
was	1
girded	1
with	1
a	1
linen	1
ephod.	1
	1
6:15	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
shouting,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
Michal	1
Saul's	1
daughter	1
looked	1
through	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
saw	1
king	1
David	1
leaping	1
and	1
dancing	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
she	1
despised	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
that	1
David	1
had	1
pitched	1
for	1
it:	1
and	1
David	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
David	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
offering	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
he	1
blessed	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
he	1
dealt	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
the	1
women	1
as	1
men,	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
piece	1
of	1
flesh,	1
and	1
a	1
flagon	1
of	1
wine.	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
departed	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
6:20	1
Then	1
David	1
returned	1
to	1
bless	1
his	1
household.	1
And	1
Michal	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Saul	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
How	1
glorious	1
was	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
day,	1
who	1
uncovered	1
himself	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
handmaids	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
vain	1
fellows	1
shamelessly	1
uncovereth	1
himself!	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Michal,	1
It	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
chose	1
me	1
before	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
before	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
to	1
appoint	1
me	1
ruler	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
over	1
Israel:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
play	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
yet	1
be	1
more	1
vile	1
than	1
thus,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
base	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
sight:	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
maidservants	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
of,	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
had	1
in	1
honour.	1
	1
6:23	1
Therefore	1
Michal	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Saul	1
had	1
no	1
child	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
her	1
death.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
rest	1
round	1
about	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
enemies;	1
7:2	1
That	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
See	1
now,	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
cedar,	1
but	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
within	1
curtains.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
Nathan	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
Go,	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
heart;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
night,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Nathan,	1
saying,	1
7:5	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
my	1
servant	1
David,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Shalt	1
thou	1
build	1
me	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
dwell	1
in?	1
	1
7:6	1
Whereas	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
dwelt	1
in	1
any	1
house	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
but	1
have	1
walked	1
in	1
a	1
tent	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
7:7	1
In	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
wherein	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
spake	1
I	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
I	1
commanded	1
to	1
feed	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
build	1
ye	1
not	1
me	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
cedar?	1
	1
7:8	1
Now	1
therefore	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
my	1
servant	1
David,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
took	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
sheepcote,	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
sheep,	1
to	1
be	1
ruler	1
over	1
my	1
people,	1
over	1
Israel:	1
7:9	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
wentest,	1
and	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
name,	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:10	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
appoint	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
plant	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
and	1
move	1
no	1
more;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
wickedness	1
afflict	1
them	1
any	1
more,	1
as	1
beforetime,	1
7:11	1
And	1
as	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
commanded	1
judges	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
have	1
caused	1
thee	1
to	1
rest	1
from	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
Also	1
the	1
LORD	1
telleth	1
thee	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
when	1
thy	1
days	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sleep	1
with	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
up	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee,	1
which	1
shall	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
bowels,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
7:13	1
He	1
shall	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stablish	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
7:14	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
son.	1
If	1
he	1
commit	1
iniquity,	1
I	1
will	1
chasten	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
stripes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men:	1
7:15	1
But	1
my	1
mercy	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
as	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
from	1
Saul,	1
whom	1
I	1
put	1
away	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
thine	1
house	1
and	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
thee:	1
thy	1
throne	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
7:17	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
vision,	1
so	1
did	1
Nathan	1
speak	1
unto	1
David.	1
	1
7:18	1
Then	1
went	1
king	1
David	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
am	1
I,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
house,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
me	1
hitherto?	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
also	1
of	1
thy	1
servant's	1
house	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
to	1
come.	1
And	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
man,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD?	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
what	1
can	1
David	1
say	1
more	1
unto	1
thee?	1
for	1
thou,	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
knowest	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
7:21	1
For	1
thy	1
word's	1
sake,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
heart,	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
great	1
things,	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
servant	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
7:22	1
Wherefore	1
thou	1
art	1
great,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
thee,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
God	1
beside	1
thee,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
with	1
our	1
ears.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
what	1
one	1
nation	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
like	1
thy	1
people,	1
even	1
like	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
God	1
went	1
to	1
redeem	1
for	1
a	1
people	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
name,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
terrible,	1
for	1
thy	1
land,	1
before	1
thy	1
people,	1
which	1
thou	1
redeemedst	1
to	1
thee	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
their	1
gods?	1
	1
7:24	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
confirmed	1
to	1
thyself	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
people	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
art	1
become	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God,	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
concerning	1
his	1
house,	1
establish	1
it	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
let	1
thy	1
name	1
be	1
magnified	1
for	1
ever,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
the	1
God	1
over	1
Israel:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
be	1
established	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
7:27	1
For	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hast	1
revealed	1
to	1
thy	1
servant,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
thee	1
an	1
house:	1
therefore	1
hath	1
thy	1
servant	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
pray	1
this	1
prayer	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
God,	1
and	1
thy	1
words	1
be	1
true,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
promised	1
this	1
goodness	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant:	1
7:29	1
Therefore	1
now	1
let	1
it	1
please	1
thee	1
to	1
bless	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
continue	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
hast	1
spoken	1
it:	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
blessing	1
let	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
be	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
David	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
subdued	1
them:	1
and	1
David	1
took	1
Methegammah	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
Moab,	1
and	1
measured	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
line,	1
casting	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
even	1
with	1
two	1
lines	1
measured	1
he	1
to	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
full	1
line	1
to	1
keep	1
alive.	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
Moabites	1
became	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
brought	1
gifts.	1
	1
8:3	1
David	1
smote	1
also	1
Hadadezer,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rehob,	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
border	1
at	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
chariots,	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
footmen:	1
and	1
David	1
houghed	1
all	1
the	1
chariot	1
horses,	1
but	1
reserved	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
chariots.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Damascus	1
came	1
to	1
succour	1
Hadadezer	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah,	1
David	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
two	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
8:6	1
Then	1
David	1
put	1
garrisons	1
in	1
Syria	1
of	1
Damascus:	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
became	1
servants	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
brought	1
gifts.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
preserved	1
David	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
shields	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Hadadezer,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
from	1
Betah,	1
and	1
from	1
Berothai,	1
cities	1
of	1
Hadadezer,	1
king	1
David	1
took	1
exceeding	1
much	1
brass.	1
	1
8:9	1
When	1
Toi	1
king	1
of	1
Hamath	1
heard	1
that	1
David	1
had	1
smitten	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hadadezer,	1
8:10	1
Then	1
Toi	1
sent	1
Joram	1
his	1
son	1
unto	1
king	1
David,	1
to	1
salute	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
bless	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
fought	1
against	1
Hadadezer,	1
and	1
smitten	1
him:	1
for	1
Hadadezer	1
had	1
wars	1
with	1
Toi.	1
And	1
Joram	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
brass:	1
8:11	1
Which	1
also	1
king	1
David	1
did	1
dedicate	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
with	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
gold	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
dedicated	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
which	1
he	1
subdued;	1
8:12	1
Of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
of	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
Hadadezer,	1
son	1
of	1
Rehob,	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
David	1
gat	1
him	1
a	1
name	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
smiting	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
salt,	1
being	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
garrisons	1
in	1
Edom;	1
throughout	1
all	1
Edom	1
put	1
he	1
garrisons,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
of	1
Edom	1
became	1
David's	1
servants.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
preserved	1
David	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
David	1
reigned	1
over	1
all	1
Israel;	1
and	1
David	1
executed	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
host;	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahilud	1
was	1
recorder;	1
8:17	1
And	1
Zadok	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
and	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiathar,	1
were	1
the	1
priests;	1
and	1
Seraiah	1
was	1
the	1
scribe;	1
8:18	1
And	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
was	1
over	1
both	1
the	1
Cherethites	1
and	1
the	1
Pelethites;	1
and	1
David's	1
sons	1
were	1
chief	1
rulers.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Is	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
shew	1
him	1
kindness	1
for	1
Jonathan's	1
sake?	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
a	1
servant	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Ziba.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
him	1
unto	1
David,	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
Ziba?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
is	1
he.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
yet	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
shew	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
him?	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Jonathan	1
hath	1
yet	1
a	1
son,	1
which	1
is	1
lame	1
on	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Machir,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammiel,	1
in	1
Lodebar.	1
	1
9:5	1
Then	1
king	1
David	1
sent,	1
and	1
fetched	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Machir,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammiel,	1
from	1
Lodebar.	1
	1
9:6	1
Now	1
when	1
Mephibosheth,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jonathan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
David,	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
did	1
reverence.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Mephibosheth.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Behold	1
thy	1
servant!	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
shew	1
thee	1
kindness	1
for	1
Jonathan	1
thy	1
father's	1
sake,	1
and	1
will	1
restore	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Saul	1
thy	1
father;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
bread	1
at	1
my	1
table	1
continually.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
servant,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
look	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
dead	1
dog	1
as	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
9:9	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
called	1
to	1
Ziba,	1
Saul's	1
servant,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
thy	1
master's	1
son	1
all	1
that	1
pertained	1
to	1
Saul	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
9:10	1
Thou	1
therefore,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
servants,	1
shall	1
till	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
fruits,	1
that	1
thy	1
master's	1
son	1
may	1
have	1
food	1
to	1
eat:	1
but	1
Mephibosheth	1
thy	1
master's	1
son	1
shall	1
eat	1
bread	1
alway	1
at	1
my	1
table.	1
Now	1
Ziba	1
had	1
fifteen	1
sons	1
and	1
twenty	1
servants.	1
	1
9:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Ziba	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
commanded	1
his	1
servant,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
servant	1
do.	1
As	1
for	1
Mephibosheth,	1
said	1
the	1
king,	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
at	1
my	1
table,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
sons.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
Mephibosheth	1
had	1
a	1
young	1
son,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Micha.	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ziba	1
were	1
servants	1
unto	1
Mephibosheth.	1
	1
9:13	1
So	1
Mephibosheth	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
continually	1
at	1
the	1
king's	1
table;	1
and	1
was	1
lame	1
on	1
both	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
died,	1
and	1
Hanun	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
10:2	1
Then	1
said	1
David,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
kindness	1
unto	1
Hanun	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nahash,	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
shewed	1
kindness	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
to	1
comfort	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
for	1
his	1
father.	1
And	1
David's	1
servants	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
Hanun	1
their	1
lord,	1
Thinkest	1
thou	1
that	1
David	1
doth	1
honour	1
thy	1
father,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
comforters	1
unto	1
thee?	1
hath	1
not	1
David	1
rather	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
to	1
spy	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
overthrow	1
it?	1
10:4	1
Wherefore	1
Hanun	1
took	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
shaved	1
off	1
the	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
their	1
beards,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
even	1
to	1
their	1
buttocks,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
10:5	1
When	1
they	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
David,	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
because	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
greatly	1
ashamed:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Tarry	1
at	1
Jericho	1
until	1
your	1
beards	1
be	1
grown,	1
and	1
then	1
return.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
stank	1
before	1
David,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
sent	1
and	1
hired	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Bethrehob	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Zoba,	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
footmen,	1
and	1
of	1
king	1
Maacah	1
a	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
of	1
Ishtob	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
sent	1
Joab,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
gate:	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Zoba,	1
and	1
of	1
Rehob,	1
and	1
Ishtob,	1
and	1
Maacah,	1
were	1
by	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
10:9	1
When	1
Joab	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
against	1
him	1
before	1
and	1
behind,	1
he	1
chose	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
choice	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
Syrians:	1
10:10	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Abishai	1
his	1
brother,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
the	1
Syrians	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
me,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
help	1
me:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
thee,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
help	1
thee.	1
	1
10:12	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
play	1
the	1
men	1
for	1
our	1
people,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
our	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
seemeth	1
him	1
good.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
Joab	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
unto	1
the	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Syrians:	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Syrians	1
were	1
fled,	1
then	1
fled	1
they	1
also	1
before	1
Abishai,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
So	1
Joab	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Syrians	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
before	1
Israel,	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
Hadarezer	1
sent,	1
and	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
Syrians	1
that	1
were	1
beyond	1
the	1
river:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Helam;	1
and	1
Shobach	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hadarezer	1
went	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
David,	1
he	1
gathered	1
all	1
Israel	1
together,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Helam.	1
And	1
the	1
Syrians	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
David,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
the	1
Syrians	1
fled	1
before	1
Israel;	1
and	1
David	1
slew	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
seven	1
hundred	1
chariots	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
and	1
forty	1
thousand	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
smote	1
Shobach	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
host,	1
who	1
died	1
there.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
servants	1
to	1
Hadarezer	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
before	1
Israel,	1
they	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
Israel,	1
and	1
served	1
them.	1
So	1
the	1
Syrians	1
feared	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
the	1
year	1
was	1
expired,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
kings	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
battle,	1
that	1
David	1
sent	1
Joab,	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel;	1
and	1
they	1
destroyed	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
besieged	1
Rabbah.	1
But	1
David	1
tarried	1
still	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
an	1
eveningtide,	1
that	1
David	1
arose	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
walked	1
upon	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house:	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
roof	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
woman	1
washing	1
herself;	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
very	1
beautiful	1
to	1
look	1
upon.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
and	1
enquired	1
after	1
the	1
woman.	1
And	1
one	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
Bathsheba,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Eliam,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite?	1
11:4	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers,	1
and	1
took	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
with	1
her;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
purified	1
from	1
her	1
uncleanness:	1
and	1
she	1
returned	1
unto	1
her	1
house.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
conceived,	1
and	1
sent	1
and	1
told	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
child.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
to	1
Joab,	1
saying,	1
Send	1
me	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite.	1
And	1
Joab	1
sent	1
Uriah	1
to	1
David.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
when	1
Uriah	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
David	1
demanded	1
of	1
him	1
how	1
Joab	1
did,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
people	1
did,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
war	1
prospered.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Uriah,	1
Go	1
down	1
to	1
thy	1
house,	1
and	1
wash	1
thy	1
feet.	1
And	1
Uriah	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
a	1
mess	1
of	1
meat	1
from	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
Uriah	1
slept	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
his	1
lord,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Uriah	1
went	1
not	1
down	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Uriah,	1
Camest	1
thou	1
not	1
from	1
thy	1
journey?	1
why	1
then	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
unto	1
thine	1
house?	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
Uriah	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
The	1
ark,	1
and	1
Israel,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
abide	1
in	1
tents;	1
and	1
my	1
lord	1
Joab,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
are	1
encamped	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
fields;	1
shall	1
I	1
then	1
go	1
into	1
mine	1
house,	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
lie	1
with	1
my	1
wife?	1
as	1
thou	1
livest,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Uriah,	1
Tarry	1
here	1
to	1
day	1
also,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
thee	1
depart.	1
So	1
Uriah	1
abode	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
morrow.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
had	1
called	1
him,	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
drunk:	1
and	1
at	1
even	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
lie	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
his	1
lord,	1
but	1
went	1
not	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
David	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Joab,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Uriah.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
in	1
the	1
letter,	1
saying,	1
Set	1
ye	1
Uriah	1
in	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
hottest	1
battle,	1
and	1
retire	1
ye	1
from	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
smitten,	1
and	1
die.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Joab	1
observed	1
the	1
city,	1
that	1
he	1
assigned	1
Uriah	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
valiant	1
men	1
were.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Joab:	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
11:18	1
Then	1
Joab	1
sent	1
and	1
told	1
David	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
war;	1
11:19	1
And	1
charged	1
the	1
messenger,	1
saying,	1
When	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
telling	1
the	1
matters	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
11:20	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
king's	1
wrath	1
arise,	1
and	1
he	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Wherefore	1
approached	1
ye	1
so	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
when	1
ye	1
did	1
fight?	1
knew	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
shoot	1
from	1
the	1
wall?	1
	1
11:21	1
Who	1
smote	1
Abimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbesheth?	1
did	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
cast	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
millstone	1
upon	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
wall,	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
Thebez?	1
why	1
went	1
ye	1
nigh	1
the	1
wall?	1
then	1
say	1
thou,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
is	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
11:22	1
So	1
the	1
messenger	1
went,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
shewed	1
David	1
all	1
that	1
Joab	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
for.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
the	1
messenger	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Surely	1
the	1
men	1
prevailed	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
unto	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
upon	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
11:24	1
And	1
the	1
shooters	1
shot	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
wall	1
upon	1
thy	1
servants;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
servants	1
be	1
dead,	1
and	1
thy	1
servant	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
is	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
11:25	1
Then	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
messenger,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
Let	1
not	1
this	1
thing	1
displease	1
thee,	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
devoureth	1
one	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
another:	1
make	1
thy	1
battle	1
more	1
strong	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
overthrow	1
it:	1
and	1
encourage	1
thou	1
him.	1
	1
11:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Uriah	1
heard	1
that	1
Uriah	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
dead,	1
she	1
mourned	1
for	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
mourning	1
was	1
past,	1
David	1
sent	1
and	1
fetched	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son.	1
But	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
David	1
had	1
done	1
displeased	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
Nathan	1
unto	1
David.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
city;	1
the	1
one	1
rich,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
poor.	1
	1
12:2	1
The	1
rich	1
man	1
had	1
exceeding	1
many	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds:	1
12:3	1
But	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
had	1
nothing,	1
save	1
one	1
little	1
ewe	1
lamb,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
and	1
nourished	1
up:	1
and	1
it	1
grew	1
up	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
children;	1
it	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
meat,	1
and	1
drank	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
cup,	1
and	1
lay	1
in	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and	1
was	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
daughter.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
traveller	1
unto	1
the	1
rich	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
spared	1
to	1
take	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
flock	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
herd,	1
to	1
dress	1
for	1
the	1
wayfaring	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
him;	1
but	1
took	1
the	1
poor	1
man's	1
lamb,	1
and	1
dressed	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
David's	1
anger	1
was	1
greatly	1
kindled	1
against	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Nathan,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
thing	1
shall	1
surely	1
die:	1
12:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
restore	1
the	1
lamb	1
fourfold,	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
pity.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
Nathan	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
man.	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
anointed	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
I	1
delivered	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul;	1
12:8	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
thee	1
thy	1
master's	1
house,	1
and	1
thy	1
master's	1
wives	1
into	1
thy	1
bosom,	1
and	1
gave	1
thee	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
of	1
Judah;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
little,	1
I	1
would	1
moreover	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
thee	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
things.	1
	1
12:9	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
despised	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
in	1
his	1
sight?	1
thou	1
hast	1
killed	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
hast	1
taken	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
hast	1
slain	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
12:10	1
Now	1
therefore	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
never	1
depart	1
from	1
thine	1
house;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
despised	1
me,	1
and	1
hast	1
taken	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
wife.	1
	1
12:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
evil	1
against	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
thy	1
wives	1
before	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
unto	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
thy	1
wives	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
sun.	1
	1
12:12	1
For	1
thou	1
didst	1
it	1
secretly:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
before	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Nathan,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Nathan	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
hath	1
put	1
away	1
thy	1
sin;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
12:14	1
Howbeit,	1
because	1
by	1
this	1
deed	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
great	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
blaspheme,	1
the	1
child	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
Nathan	1
departed	1
unto	1
his	1
house.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
struck	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
Uriah's	1
wife	1
bare	1
unto	1
David,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
sick.	1
	1
12:16	1
David	1
therefore	1
besought	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
David	1
fasted,	1
and	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
lay	1
all	1
night	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not,	1
neither	1
did	1
he	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
12:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
died.	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
feared	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
while	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
yet	1
alive,	1
we	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
our	1
voice:	1
how	1
will	1
he	1
then	1
vex	1
himself,	1
if	1
we	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
dead?	1
	1
12:19	1
But	1
when	1
David	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
servants	1
whispered,	1
David	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead:	1
therefore	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Is	1
the	1
child	1
dead?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
12:20	1
Then	1
David	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
anointed	1
himself,	1
and	1
changed	1
his	1
apparel,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
worshipped:	1
then	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
required,	1
they	1
set	1
bread	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
12:21	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
servants	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
thing	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done?	1
thou	1
didst	1
fast	1
and	1
weep	1
for	1
the	1
child,	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
alive;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead,	1
thou	1
didst	1
rise	1
and	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
While	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
yet	1
alive,	1
I	1
fasted	1
and	1
wept:	1
for	1
I	1
said,	1
Who	1
can	1
tell	1
whether	1
GOD	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
may	1
live?	1
	1
12:23	1
But	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
dead,	1
wherefore	1
should	1
I	1
fast?	1
can	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
back	1
again?	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
12:24	1
And	1
David	1
comforted	1
Bathsheba	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Solomon:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
loved	1
him.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Jedidiah,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
Joab	1
fought	1
against	1
Rabbah	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
royal	1
city.	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
Joab	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
against	1
Rabbah,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
waters.	1
	1
12:28	1
Now	1
therefore	1
gather	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
encamp	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
take	1
it:	1
lest	1
I	1
take	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
David	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Rabbah,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
took	1
it.	1
	1
12:30	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
their	1
king's	1
crown	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
the	1
weight	1
whereof	1
was	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
gold	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
stones:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
set	1
on	1
David's	1
head.	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
great	1
abundance.	1
	1
12:31	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
therein,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
under	1
saws,	1
and	1
under	1
harrows	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
under	1
axes	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
brick-kiln:	1
and	1
thus	1
did	1
he	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
returned	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
Absalom	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
had	1
a	1
fair	1
sister,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Tamar;	1
and	1
Amnon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
loved	1
her.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
Amnon	1
was	1
so	1
vexed,	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
sick	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
Tamar;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
virgin;	1
and	1
Amnon	1
thought	1
it	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
13:3	1
But	1
Amnon	1
had	1
a	1
friend,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Jonadab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimeah	1
David's	1
brother:	1
and	1
Jonadab	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
subtil	1
man.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
art	1
thou,	1
being	1
the	1
king's	1
son,	1
lean	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
tell	1
me?	1
And	1
Amnon	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
love	1
Tamar,	1
my	1
brother	1
Absalom's	1
sister.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
Jonadab	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lay	1
thee	1
down	1
on	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
make	1
thyself	1
sick:	1
and	1
when	1
thy	1
father	1
cometh	1
to	1
see	1
thee,	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
my	1
sister	1
Tamar	1
come,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
meat,	1
and	1
dress	1
the	1
meat	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
at	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
13:6	1
So	1
Amnon	1
lay	1
down,	1
and	1
made	1
himself	1
sick:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
Amnon	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
Tamar	1
my	1
sister	1
come,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
cakes	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat	1
at	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
13:7	1
Then	1
David	1
sent	1
home	1
to	1
Tamar,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
now	1
to	1
thy	1
brother	1
Amnon's	1
house,	1
and	1
dress	1
him	1
meat.	1
	1
13:8	1
So	1
Tamar	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
Amnon's	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
laid	1
down.	1
And	1
she	1
took	1
flour,	1
and	1
kneaded	1
it,	1
and	1
made	1
cakes	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
did	1
bake	1
the	1
cakes.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
pan,	1
and	1
poured	1
them	1
out	1
before	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
Amnon	1
said,	1
Have	1
out	1
all	1
men	1
from	1
me.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
Amnon	1
said	1
unto	1
Tamar,	1
Bring	1
the	1
meat	1
into	1
the	1
chamber,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat	1
of	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
Tamar	1
took	1
the	1
cakes	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
to	1
Amnon	1
her	1
brother.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
eat,	1
he	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Come	1
lie	1
with	1
me,	1
my	1
sister.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
she	1
answered	1
him,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
brother,	1
do	1
not	1
force	1
me;	1
for	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
Israel:	1
do	1
not	1
thou	1
this	1
folly.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
I,	1
whither	1
shall	1
I	1
cause	1
my	1
shame	1
to	1
go?	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fools	1
in	1
Israel.	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
king;	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
withhold	1
me	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
13:14	1
Howbeit	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
her	1
voice:	1
but,	1
being	1
stronger	1
than	1
she,	1
forced	1
her,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
13:15	1
Then	1
Amnon	1
hated	1
her	1
exceedingly;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
hatred	1
wherewith	1
he	1
hated	1
her	1
was	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
love	1
wherewith	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
her.	1
And	1
Amnon	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Arise,	1
be	1
gone.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
cause:	1
this	1
evil	1
in	1
sending	1
me	1
away	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
unto	1
me.	1
But	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
13:17	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
servant	1
that	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Put	1
now	1
this	1
woman	1
out	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
bolt	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her.	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
garment	1
of	1
divers	1
colours	1
upon	1
her:	1
for	1
with	1
such	1
robes	1
were	1
the	1
king's	1
daughters	1
that	1
were	1
virgins	1
apparelled.	1
Then	1
his	1
servant	1
brought	1
her	1
out,	1
and	1
bolted	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
Tamar	1
put	1
ashes	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
rent	1
her	1
garment	1
of	1
divers	1
colours	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
crying.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
Absalom	1
her	1
brother	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Hath	1
Amnon	1
thy	1
brother	1
been	1
with	1
thee?	1
but	1
hold	1
now	1
thy	1
peace,	1
my	1
sister:	1
he	1
is	1
thy	1
brother;	1
regard	1
not	1
this	1
thing.	1
So	1
Tamar	1
remained	1
desolate	1
in	1
her	1
brother	1
Absalom's	1
house.	1
	1
13:21	1
But	1
when	1
king	1
David	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
wroth.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
Absalom	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
brother	1
Amnon	1
neither	1
good	1
nor	1
bad:	1
for	1
Absalom	1
hated	1
Amnon,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
forced	1
his	1
sister	1
Tamar.	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
two	1
full	1
years,	1
that	1
Absalom	1
had	1
sheepshearers	1
in	1
Baalhazor,	1
which	1
is	1
beside	1
Ephraim:	1
and	1
Absalom	1
invited	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons.	1
	1
13:24	1
And	1
Absalom	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
sheepshearers;	1
let	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
go	1
with	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
Absalom,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
son,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
all	1
now	1
go,	1
lest	1
we	1
be	1
chargeable	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
pressed	1
him:	1
howbeit	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
go,	1
but	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
13:26	1
Then	1
said	1
Absalom,	1
If	1
not,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
my	1
brother	1
Amnon	1
go	1
with	1
us.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
should	1
he	1
go	1
with	1
thee?	1
13:27	1
But	1
Absalom	1
pressed	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
let	1
Amnon	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
go	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
Absalom	1
had	1
commanded	1
his	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Mark	1
ye	1
now	1
when	1
Amnon's	1
heart	1
is	1
merry	1
with	1
wine,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Smite	1
Amnon;	1
then	1
kill	1
him,	1
fear	1
not:	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
commanded	1
you?	1
be	1
courageous,	1
and	1
be	1
valiant.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Absalom	1
did	1
unto	1
Amnon	1
as	1
Absalom	1
had	1
commanded.	1
	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
arose,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
gat	1
him	1
up	1
upon	1
his	1
mule,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
13:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
that	1
tidings	1
came	1
to	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Absalom	1
hath	1
slain	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
left.	1
	1
13:31	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
arose,	1
and	1
tare	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
stood	1
by	1
with	1
their	1
clothes	1
rent.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
Jonadab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimeah	1
David's	1
brother,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
not	1
my	1
lord	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
slain	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
the	1
king's	1
sons;	1
for	1
Amnon	1
only	1
is	1
dead:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
Absalom	1
this	1
hath	1
been	1
determined	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
forced	1
his	1
sister	1
Tamar.	1
	1
13:33	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
not	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
take	1
the	1
thing	1
to	1
his	1
heart,	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
are	1
dead:	1
for	1
Amnon	1
only	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
13:34	1
But	1
Absalom	1
fled.	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
watch	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
much	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
side	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
13:35	1
And	1
Jonadab	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
come:	1
as	1
thy	1
servant	1
said,	1
so	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
13:36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
came,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
and	1
wept:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
also	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
wept	1
very	1
sore.	1
	1
13:37	1
But	1
Absalom	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Talmai,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammihud,	1
king	1
of	1
Geshur.	1
And	1
David	1
mourned	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
every	1
day.	1
	1
13:38	1
So	1
Absalom	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Geshur,	1
and	1
was	1
there	1
three	1
years.	1
	1
13:39	1
And	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
king	1
David	1
longed	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
Absalom:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
comforted	1
concerning	1
Amnon,	1
seeing	1
he	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
14:1	1
Now	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
king's	1
heart	1
was	1
toward	1
Absalom.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
Joab	1
sent	1
to	1
Tekoah,	1
and	1
fetched	1
thence	1
a	1
wise	1
woman,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
feign	1
thyself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mourner,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
now	1
mourning	1
apparel,	1
and	1
anoint	1
not	1
thyself	1
with	1
oil,	1
but	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
mourned	1
for	1
the	1
dead:	1
14:3	1
And	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
speak	1
on	1
this	1
manner	1
unto	1
him.	1
So	1
Joab	1
put	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
her	1
mouth.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
Tekoah	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
did	1
obeisance,	1
and	1
said,	1
Help,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee?	1
And	1
she	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
indeed	1
a	1
widow	1
woman,	1
and	1
mine	1
husband	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
thy	1
handmaid	1
had	1
two	1
sons,	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
strove	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
part	1
them,	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
smote	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
14:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
is	1
risen	1
against	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Deliver	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
his	1
brother,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
kill	1
him,	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
whom	1
he	1
slew;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
heir	1
also:	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
shall	1
quench	1
my	1
coal	1
which	1
is	1
left,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
to	1
my	1
husband	1
neither	1
name	1
nor	1
remainder	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Go	1
to	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
charge	1
concerning	1
thee.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
Tekoah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
My	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
the	1
iniquity	1
be	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
father's	1
house:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
throne	1
be	1
guiltless.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Whoever	1
saith	1
ought	1
unto	1
thee,	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
touch	1
thee	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
14:11	1
Then	1
said	1
she,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
the	1
king	1
remember	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
revengers	1
of	1
blood	1
to	1
destroy	1
any	1
more,	1
lest	1
they	1
destroy	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
one	1
hair	1
of	1
thy	1
son	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:12	1
Then	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
Let	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
speak	1
one	1
word	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Say	1
on.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
thought	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God?	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
doth	1
speak	1
this	1
thing	1
as	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
faulty,	1
in	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
doth	1
not	1
fetch	1
home	1
again	1
his	1
banished.	1
	1
14:14	1
For	1
we	1
must	1
needs	1
die,	1
and	1
are	1
as	1
water	1
spilt	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
gathered	1
up	1
again;	1
neither	1
doth	1
God	1
respect	1
any	1
person:	1
yet	1
doth	1
he	1
devise	1
means,	1
that	1
his	1
banished	1
be	1
not	1
expelled	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
14:15	1
Now	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
the	1
people	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
afraid:	1
and	1
thy	1
handmaid	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
king;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
perform	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
his	1
handmaid.	1
	1
14:16	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
hear,	1
to	1
deliver	1
his	1
handmaid	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
would	1
destroy	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:17	1
Then	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
said,	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
now	1
be	1
comfortable:	1
for	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
so	1
is	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
discern	1
good	1
and	1
bad:	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:18	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Hide	1
not	1
from	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
ask	1
thee.	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
Let	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
now	1
speak.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Joab	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
this?	1
	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
As	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
none	1
can	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
ought	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
spoken:	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
Joab,	1
he	1
bade	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid:	1
14:20	1
To	1
fetch	1
about	1
this	1
form	1
of	1
speech	1
hath	1
thy	1
servant	1
Joab	1
done	1
this	1
thing:	1
and	1
my	1
lord	1
is	1
wise,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
thing:	1
go	1
therefore,	1
bring	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Absalom	1
again.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
Joab	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself,	1
and	1
thanked	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
Joab	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
thy	1
servant	1
knoweth	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
in	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
14:23	1
So	1
Joab	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Geshur,	1
and	1
brought	1
Absalom	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Let	1
him	1
turn	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face.	1
So	1
Absalom	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
king's	1
face.	1
	1
14:25	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
Israel	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
praised	1
as	1
Absalom	1
for	1
his	1
beauty:	1
from	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
his	1
foot	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
blemish	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
polled	1
his	1
head,	1
(for	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
every	1
year's	1
end	1
that	1
he	1
polled	1
it:	1
because	1
the	1
hair	1
was	1
heavy	1
on	1
him,	1
therefore	1
he	1
polled	1
it:)	1
he	1
weighed	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
two	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
after	1
the	1
king's	1
weight.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
unto	1
Absalom	1
there	1
were	1
born	1
three	1
sons,	1
and	1
one	1
daughter,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Tamar:	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
countenance.	1
	1
14:28	1
So	1
Absalom	1
dwelt	1
two	1
full	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
king's	1
face.	1
	1
14:29	1
Therefore	1
Absalom	1
sent	1
for	1
Joab,	1
to	1
have	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
king;	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
sent	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
14:30	1
Therefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
See,	1
Joab's	1
field	1
is	1
near	1
mine,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
barley	1
there;	1
go	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
on	1
fire.	1
And	1
Absalom's	1
servants	1
set	1
the	1
field	1
on	1
fire.	1
	1
14:31	1
Then	1
Joab	1
arose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Absalom	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
thy	1
servants	1
set	1
my	1
field	1
on	1
fire?	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
Absalom	1
answered	1
Joab,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
hither,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
send	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
to	1
say,	1
Wherefore	1
am	1
I	1
come	1
from	1
Geshur?	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
good	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
still:	1
now	1
therefore	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
the	1
king's	1
face;	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
iniquity	1
in	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
kill	1
me.	1
	1
14:33	1
So	1
Joab	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
told	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
for	1
Absalom,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
before	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
kissed	1
Absalom.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
Absalom	1
prepared	1
him	1
chariots	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
fifty	1
men	1
to	1
run	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
Absalom	1
rose	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
controversy	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
judgment,	1
then	1
Absalom	1
called	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
what	1
city	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
is	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
Absalom	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
See,	1
thy	1
matters	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
right;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
deputed	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
hear	1
thee.	1
	1
15:4	1
Absalom	1
said	1
moreover,	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
were	1
made	1
judge	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
which	1
hath	1
any	1
suit	1
or	1
cause	1
might	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
him	1
justice!	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
any	1
man	1
came	1
nigh	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
obeisance,	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
on	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
Absalom	1
to	1
all	1
Israel	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
judgment:	1
so	1
Absalom	1
stole	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
forty	1
years,	1
that	1
Absalom	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
and	1
pay	1
my	1
vow,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
vowed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
	1
15:8	1
For	1
thy	1
servant	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow	1
while	1
I	1
abode	1
at	1
Geshur	1
in	1
Syria,	1
saying,	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
me	1
again	1
indeed	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace.	1
So	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Hebron.	1
	1
15:10	1
But	1
Absalom	1
sent	1
spies	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Absalom	1
reigneth	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
with	1
Absalom	1
went	1
two	1
hundred	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
were	1
called;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
their	1
simplicity,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
any	1
thing.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
Absalom	1
sent	1
for	1
Ahithophel	1
the	1
Gilonite,	1
David's	1
counsellor,	1
from	1
his	1
city,	1
even	1
from	1
Giloh,	1
while	1
he	1
offered	1
sacrifices.	1
And	1
the	1
conspiracy	1
was	1
strong;	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
increased	1
continually	1
with	1
Absalom.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
messenger	1
to	1
David,	1
saying,	1
The	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
after	1
Absalom.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
flee;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
else	1
escape	1
from	1
Absalom:	1
make	1
speed	1
to	1
depart,	1
lest	1
he	1
overtake	1
us	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
the	1
king's	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
servants	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
appoint.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
after	1
him.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
left	1
ten	1
women,	1
which	1
were	1
concubines,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
tarried	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
far	1
off.	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
passed	1
on	1
beside	1
him;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Cherethites,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Pelethites,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Gittites,	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
which	1
came	1
after	1
him	1
from	1
Gath,	1
passed	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
15:19	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Ittai	1
the	1
Gittite,	1
Wherefore	1
goest	1
thou	1
also	1
with	1
us?	1
return	1
to	1
thy	1
place,	1
and	1
abide	1
with	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
also	1
an	1
exile.	1
	1
15:20	1
Whereas	1
thou	1
camest	1
but	1
yesterday,	1
should	1
I	1
this	1
day	1
make	1
thee	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
us?	1
seeing	1
I	1
go	1
whither	1
I	1
may,	1
return	1
thou,	1
and	1
take	1
back	1
thy	1
brethren:	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
Ittai	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
liveth,	1
surely	1
in	1
what	1
place	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
be,	1
whether	1
in	1
death	1
or	1
life,	1
even	1
there	1
also	1
will	1
thy	1
servant	1
be.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Ittai,	1
Go	1
and	1
pass	1
over.	1
And	1
Ittai	1
the	1
Gittite	1
passed	1
over,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
men,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
ones	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
15:23	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
wept	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
passed	1
over:	1
the	1
king	1
also	1
himself	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
passed	1
over,	1
toward	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
lo	1
Zadok	1
also,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
bearing	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
down	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
went	1
up,	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
done	1
passing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Zadok,	1
Carry	1
back	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
shew	1
me	1
both	1
it,	1
and	1
his	1
habitation:	1
15:26	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
thus	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
delight	1
in	1
thee;	1
behold,	1
here	1
am	1
I,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:27	1
The	1
king	1
said	1
also	1
unto	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
a	1
seer?	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
your	1
two	1
sons	1
with	1
you,	1
Ahimaaz	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiathar.	1
	1
15:28	1
See,	1
I	1
will	1
tarry	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
until	1
there	1
come	1
word	1
from	1
you	1
to	1
certify	1
me.	1
	1
15:29	1
Zadok	1
therefore	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
carried	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
tarried	1
there.	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
ascent	1
of	1
mount	1
Olivet,	1
and	1
wept	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
head	1
covered,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
barefoot:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
covered	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up,	1
weeping	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
up.	1
	1
15:31	1
And	1
one	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Ahithophel	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
conspirators	1
with	1
Absalom.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
turn	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel	1
into	1
foolishness.	1
	1
15:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount,	1
where	1
he	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
behold,	1
Hushai	1
the	1
Archite	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
coat	1
rent,	1
and	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
head:	1
15:33	1
Unto	1
whom	1
David	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
passest	1
on	1
with	1
me,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
burden	1
unto	1
me:	1
15:34	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
servant,	1
O	1
king;	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thy	1
father's	1
servant	1
hitherto,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
now	1
also	1
be	1
thy	1
servant:	1
then	1
mayest	1
thou	1
for	1
me	1
defeat	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
there	1
with	1
thee	1
Zadok	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests?	1
	1
therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
what	1
thing	1
soever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
Zadok	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests.	1
	1
15:36	1
Behold,	1
they	1
have	1
there	1
with	1
them	1
their	1
two	1
sons,	1
Ahimaaz	1
Zadok's	1
son,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
Abiathar's	1
son;	1
and	1
by	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
send	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
hear.	1
	1
15:37	1
So	1
Hushai	1
David's	1
friend	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
Absalom	1
came	1
into	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
past	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
behold,	1
Ziba	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Mephibosheth	1
met	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
asses	1
saddled,	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
two	1
hundred	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
bunches	1
of	1
raisins,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
of	1
summer	1
fruits,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Ziba,	1
What	1
meanest	1
thou	1
by	1
these?	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said,	1
The	1
asses	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
household	1
to	1
ride	1
on;	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
summer	1
fruit	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
eat;	1
and	1
the	1
wine,	1
that	1
such	1
as	1
be	1
faint	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
may	1
drink.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
And	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
master's	1
son?	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
abideth	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
restore	1
me	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
16:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Ziba,	1
Behold,	1
thine	1
are	1
all	1
that	1
pertained	1
unto	1
Mephibosheth.	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said,	1
I	1
humbly	1
beseech	1
thee	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
when	1
king	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Bahurim,	1
behold,	1
thence	1
came	1
out	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Shimei,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gera:	1
he	1
came	1
forth,	1
and	1
cursed	1
still	1
as	1
he	1
came.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
stones	1
at	1
David,	1
and	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
king	1
David:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
were	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
thus	1
said	1
Shimei	1
when	1
he	1
cursed,	1
Come	1
out,	1
come	1
out,	1
thou	1
bloody	1
man,	1
and	1
thou	1
man	1
of	1
Belial:	1
16:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
returned	1
upon	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
in	1
whose	1
stead	1
thou	1
hast	1
reigned;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
the	1
kingdom	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Absalom	1
thy	1
son:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
taken	1
in	1
thy	1
mischief,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
bloody	1
man.	1
	1
16:9	1
Then	1
said	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Why	1
should	1
this	1
dead	1
dog	1
curse	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king?	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
over,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
take	1
off	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Zeruiah?	1
	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
curse,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Curse	1
David.	1
Who	1
shall	1
then	1
say,	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
so?	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abishai,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
son,	1
which	1
came	1
forth	1
of	1
my	1
bowels,	1
seeketh	1
my	1
life:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
now	1
may	1
this	1
Benjamite	1
do	1
it?	1
let	1
him	1
alone,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
curse;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
bidden	1
him.	1
	1
16:12	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
look	1
on	1
mine	1
affliction,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
requite	1
me	1
good	1
for	1
his	1
cursing	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
as	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
Shimei	1
went	1
along	1
on	1
the	1
hill's	1
side	1
over	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
cursed	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
threw	1
stones	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
dust.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
came	1
weary,	1
and	1
refreshed	1
themselves	1
there.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
Absalom,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
Ahithophel	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Hushai	1
the	1
Archite,	1
David's	1
friend,	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
that	1
Hushai	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
king,	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
Absalom	1
said	1
to	1
Hushai,	1
Is	1
this	1
thy	1
kindness	1
to	1
thy	1
friend?	1
why	1
wentest	1
thou	1
not	1
with	1
thy	1
friend?	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
Hushai	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
choose,	1
his	1
will	1
I	1
be,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
abide.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
again,	1
whom	1
should	1
I	1
serve?	1
should	1
I	1
not	1
serve	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
son?	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
in	1
thy	1
father's	1
presence,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
presence.	1
	1
16:20	1
Then	1
said	1
Absalom	1
to	1
Ahithophel,	1
Give	1
counsel	1
among	1
you	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
do.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
Ahithophel	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
Go	1
in	1
unto	1
thy	1
father's	1
concubines,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
left	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
hear	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
abhorred	1
of	1
thy	1
father:	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
thee	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
16:22	1
So	1
they	1
spread	1
Absalom	1
a	1
tent	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
Absalom	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
his	1
father's	1
concubines	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel,	1
which	1
he	1
counselled	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
had	1
enquired	1
at	1
the	1
oracle	1
of	1
God:	1
so	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel	1
both	1
with	1
David	1
and	1
with	1
Absalom.	1
	1
17:1	1
Moreover	1
Ahithophel	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
choose	1
out	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
pursue	1
after	1
David	1
this	1
night:	1
17:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
weary	1
and	1
weak	1
handed,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
afraid:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him	1
shall	1
flee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
king	1
only:	1
17:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
back	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
thee:	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
thou	1
seekest	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
returned:	1
so	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
the	1
saying	1
pleased	1
Absalom	1
well,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Absalom,	1
Call	1
now	1
Hushai	1
the	1
Archite	1
also,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
likewise	1
what	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
Hushai	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Absalom,	1
Absalom	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Ahithophel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
after	1
this	1
manner:	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
after	1
his	1
saying?	1
if	1
not;	1
speak	1
thou.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
Hushai	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
The	1
counsel	1
that	1
Ahithophel	1
hath	1
given	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
at	1
this	1
time.	1
	1
17:8	1
For,	1
said	1
Hushai,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
be	1
chafed	1
in	1
their	1
minds,	1
as	1
a	1
bear	1
robbed	1
of	1
her	1
whelps	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
thy	1
father	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
lodge	1
with	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:9	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
hid	1
now	1
in	1
some	1
pit,	1
or	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
place:	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
overthrown	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
heareth	1
it	1
will	1
say,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
slaughter	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
follow	1
Absalom.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
valiant,	1
whose	1
heart	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
shall	1
utterly	1
melt:	1
for	1
all	1
Israel	1
knoweth	1
that	1
thy	1
father	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
man,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
be	1
with	1
him	1
are	1
valiant	1
men.	1
	1
17:11	1
Therefore	1
I	1
counsel	1
that	1
all	1
Israel	1
be	1
generally	1
gathered	1
unto	1
thee,	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
multitude;	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
go	1
to	1
battle	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
person.	1
	1
17:12	1
So	1
shall	1
we	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
found,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
light	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
dew	1
falleth	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
one.	1
	1
17:13	1
Moreover,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
gotten	1
into	1
a	1
city,	1
then	1
shall	1
all	1
Israel	1
bring	1
ropes	1
to	1
that	1
city,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
draw	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
river,	1
until	1
there	1
be	1
not	1
one	1
small	1
stone	1
found	1
there.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
Absalom	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
The	1
counsel	1
of	1
Hushai	1
the	1
Archite	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel.	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
appointed	1
to	1
defeat	1
the	1
good	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
might	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
Absalom.	1
	1
17:15	1
Then	1
said	1
Hushai	1
unto	1
Zadok	1
and	1
to	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests,	1
Thus	1
and	1
thus	1
did	1
Ahithophel	1
counsel	1
Absalom	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
thus	1
and	1
thus	1
have	1
I	1
counselled.	1
	1
17:16	1
Now	1
therefore	1
send	1
quickly,	1
and	1
tell	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Lodge	1
not	1
this	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
but	1
speedily	1
pass	1
over;	1
lest	1
the	1
king	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:17	1
Now	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
Ahimaaz	1
stayed	1
by	1
Enrogel;	1
for	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
a	1
wench	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
king	1
David.	1
	1
17:18	1
Nevertheless	1
a	1
lad	1
saw	1
them,	1
and	1
told	1
Absalom:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
away	1
quickly,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
man's	1
house	1
in	1
Bahurim,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
well	1
in	1
his	1
court;	1
whither	1
they	1
went	1
down.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
took	1
and	1
spread	1
a	1
covering	1
over	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth,	1
and	1
spread	1
ground	1
corn	1
thereon;	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
not	1
known.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
when	1
Absalom's	1
servants	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
said,	1
Where	1
is	1
Ahimaaz	1
and	1
Jonathan?	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
be	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
water.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sought	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
them,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
17:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
departed,	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
king	1
David,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
pass	1
quickly	1
over	1
the	1
water:	1
for	1
thus	1
hath	1
Ahithophel	1
counselled	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
17:22	1
Then	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan:	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
there	1
lacked	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
gone	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
when	1
Ahithophel	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
counsel	1
was	1
not	1
followed,	1
he	1
saddled	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
arose,	1
and	1
gat	1
him	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
to	1
his	1
city,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
household	1
in	1
order,	1
and	1
hanged	1
himself,	1
and	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
17:24	1
Then	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Mahanaim.	1
And	1
Absalom	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:25	1
And	1
Absalom	1
made	1
Amasa	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
instead	1
of	1
Joab:	1
which	1
Amasa	1
was	1
a	1
man's	1
son,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Ithra	1
an	1
Israelite,	1
that	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
Abigail	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Nahash,	1
sister	1
to	1
Zeruiah	1
Joab's	1
mother.	1
	1
17:26	1
So	1
Israel	1
and	1
Absalom	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
17:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Mahanaim,	1
that	1
Shobi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nahash	1
of	1
Rabbah	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
Machir	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammiel	1
of	1
Lodebar,	1
and	1
Barzillai	1
the	1
Gileadite	1
of	1
Rogelim,	1
17:28	1
Brought	1
beds,	1
and	1
basons,	1
and	1
earthen	1
vessels,	1
and	1
wheat,	1
and	1
barley,	1
and	1
flour,	1
and	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
beans,	1
and	1
lentiles,	1
and	1
parched	1
pulse,	1
17:29	1
And	1
honey,	1
and	1
butter,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
cheese	1
of	1
kine,	1
for	1
David,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
eat:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
people	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
weary,	1
and	1
thirsty,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
David	1
numbered	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
forth	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Joab,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
Joab's	1
brother,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Ittai	1
the	1
Gittite.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
you	1
myself	1
also.	1
	1
18:3	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
forth:	1
for	1
if	1
we	1
flee	1
away,	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
us;	1
neither	1
if	1
half	1
of	1
us	1
die,	1
will	1
they	1
care	1
for	1
us:	1
but	1
now	1
thou	1
art	1
worth	1
ten	1
thousand	1
of	1
us:	1
therefore	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
thou	1
succour	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
seemeth	1
you	1
best	1
I	1
will	1
do.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
gate	1
side,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
out	1
by	1
hundreds	1
and	1
by	1
thousands.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
Joab	1
and	1
Abishai	1
and	1
Ittai,	1
saying,	1
Deal	1
gently	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
even	1
with	1
Absalom.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
gave	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
charge	1
concerning	1
Absalom.	1
	1
18:6	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
Ephraim;	1
18:7	1
Where	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
slain	1
before	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
18:8	1
For	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
there	1
scattered	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
country:	1
and	1
the	1
wood	1
devoured	1
more	1
people	1
that	1
day	1
than	1
the	1
sword	1
devoured.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
Absalom	1
met	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
Absalom	1
rode	1
upon	1
a	1
mule,	1
and	1
the	1
mule	1
went	1
under	1
the	1
thick	1
boughs	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
oak,	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
oak,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
between	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
mule	1
that	1
was	1
under	1
him	1
went	1
away.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
told	1
Joab,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
saw	1
Absalom	1
hanged	1
in	1
an	1
oak.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
Joab	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
sawest	1
him,	1
and	1
why	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
smite	1
him	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
ground?	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
ten	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
a	1
girdle.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
Though	1
I	1
should	1
receive	1
a	1
thousand	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
yet	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
put	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
king's	1
son:	1
for	1
in	1
our	1
hearing	1
the	1
king	1
charged	1
thee	1
and	1
Abishai	1
and	1
Ittai,	1
saying,	1
Beware	1
that	1
none	1
touch	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Absalom.	1
	1
18:13	1
Otherwise	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
wrought	1
falsehood	1
against	1
mine	1
own	1
life:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
matter	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
thou	1
thyself	1
wouldest	1
have	1
set	1
thyself	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
18:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Joab,	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
tarry	1
thus	1
with	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
three	1
darts	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
thrust	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Absalom,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
alive	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
oak.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
ten	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
bare	1
Joab's	1
armour	1
compassed	1
about	1
and	1
smote	1
Absalom,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
Joab	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
returned	1
from	1
pursuing	1
after	1
Israel:	1
for	1
Joab	1
held	1
back	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Absalom,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
great	1
pit	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
laid	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
stones	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
fled	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
18:18	1
Now	1
Absalom	1
in	1
his	1
lifetime	1
had	1
taken	1
and	1
reared	1
up	1
for	1
himself	1
a	1
pillar,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
dale:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
son	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
name	1
in	1
remembrance:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
pillar	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
name:	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
Absalom's	1
place.	1
	1
18:19	1
Then	1
said	1
Ahimaaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zadok,	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
run,	1
and	1
bear	1
the	1
king	1
tidings,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
avenged	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
Joab	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
tidings	1
this	1
day,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bear	1
tidings	1
another	1
day:	1
but	1
this	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bear	1
no	1
tidings,	1
because	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
18:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Joab	1
to	1
Cushi,	1
Go	1
tell	1
the	1
king	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen.	1
And	1
Cushi	1
bowed	1
himself	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
and	1
ran.	1
	1
18:22	1
Then	1
said	1
Ahimaaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zadok	1
yet	1
again	1
to	1
Joab,	1
But	1
howsoever,	1
let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
also	1
run	1
after	1
Cushi.	1
And	1
Joab	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
wilt	1
thou	1
run,	1
my	1
son,	1
seeing	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
tidings	1
ready?	1
	1
18:23	1
But	1
howsoever,	1
said	1
he,	1
let	1
me	1
run.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Run.	1
Then	1
Ahimaaz	1
ran	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
overran	1
Cushi.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
David	1
sat	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
gates:	1
and	1
the	1
watchman	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
over	1
the	1
gate	1
unto	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
running	1
alone.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
the	1
watchman	1
cried,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
alone,	1
there	1
is	1
tidings	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
apace,	1
and	1
drew	1
near.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
the	1
watchman	1
saw	1
another	1
man	1
running:	1
and	1
the	1
watchman	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
porter,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
another	1
man	1
running	1
alone.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
He	1
also	1
bringeth	1
tidings.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
the	1
watchman	1
said,	1
Me	1
thinketh	1
the	1
running	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
running	1
of	1
Ahimaaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zadok.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
cometh	1
with	1
good	1
tidings.	1
	1
18:28	1
And	1
Ahimaaz	1
called,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
All	1
is	1
well.	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
hand	1
against	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Is	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Absalom	1
safe?	1
And	1
Ahimaaz	1
answered,	1
When	1
Joab	1
sent	1
the	1
king's	1
servant,	1
and	1
me	1
thy	1
servant,	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
tumult,	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Turn	1
aside,	1
and	1
stand	1
here.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
aside,	1
and	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
18:31	1
And,	1
behold,	1
Cushi	1
came;	1
and	1
Cushi	1
said,	1
Tidings,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
avenged	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
18:32	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Cushi,	1
Is	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Absalom	1
safe?	1
And	1
Cushi	1
answered,	1
The	1
enemies	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
rise	1
against	1
thee	1
to	1
do	1
thee	1
hurt,	1
be	1
as	1
that	1
young	1
man	1
is.	1
	1
18:33	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
much	1
moved,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chamber	1
over	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
wept:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
thus	1
he	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
Absalom,	1
my	1
son,	1
my	1
son	1
Absalom!	1
would	1
God	1
I	1
had	1
died	1
for	1
thee,	1
O	1
Absalom,	1
my	1
son,	1
my	1
son!	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Joab,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king	1
weepeth	1
and	1
mourneth	1
for	1
Absalom.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
day	1
was	1
turned	1
into	1
mourning	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
day	1
how	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
grieved	1
for	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
gat	1
them	1
by	1
stealth	1
that	1
day	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
as	1
people	1
being	1
ashamed	1
steal	1
away	1
when	1
they	1
flee	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
19:4	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
covered	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
Absalom,	1
O	1
Absalom,	1
my	1
son,	1
my	1
son!	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
Joab	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
shamed	1
this	1
day	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
servants,	1
which	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
saved	1
thy	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
daughters,	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
thy	1
wives,	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
thy	1
concubines;	1
19:6	1
In	1
that	1
thou	1
lovest	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
hatest	1
thy	1
friends.	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
declared	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
thou	1
regardest	1
neither	1
princes	1
nor	1
servants:	1
for	1
this	1
day	1
I	1
perceive,	1
that	1
if	1
Absalom	1
had	1
lived,	1
and	1
all	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
this	1
day,	1
then	1
it	1
had	1
pleased	1
thee	1
well.	1
	1
19:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
arise,	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
speak	1
comfortably	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants:	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
if	1
thou	1
go	1
not	1
forth,	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
tarry	1
one	1
with	1
thee	1
this	1
night:	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
unto	1
thee	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
befell	1
thee	1
from	1
thy	1
youth	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
19:8	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
arose,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
gate.	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king	1
doth	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
gate.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
before	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
Israel	1
had	1
fled	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
at	1
strife	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1
king	1
saved	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines;	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
Absalom.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
Absalom,	1
whom	1
we	1
anointed	1
over	1
us,	1
is	1
dead	1
in	1
battle.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
speak	1
ye	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
bringing	1
the	1
king	1
back?	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
king	1
David	1
sent	1
to	1
Zadok	1
and	1
to	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
king	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
house?	1
seeing	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
all	1
Israel	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
19:12	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
bones	1
and	1
my	1
flesh:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
say	1
ye	1
to	1
Amasa,	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
of	1
my	1
bone,	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
flesh?	1
God	1
do	1
so	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
not	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
before	1
me	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
Joab.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
he	1
bowed	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
one	1
man;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
sent	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Return	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
19:15	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
returned,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jordan.	1
And	1
Judah	1
came	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
king,	1
to	1
conduct	1
the	1
king	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
Shimei	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gera,	1
a	1
Benjamite,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Bahurim,	1
hasted	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
to	1
meet	1
king	1
David.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
Ziba	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
his	1
fifteen	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
twenty	1
servants	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
over	1
a	1
ferry	1
boat	1
to	1
carry	1
over	1
the	1
king's	1
household,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
good.	1
And	1
Shimei	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gera	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
over	1
Jordan;	1
19:19	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
not	1
my	1
lord	1
impute	1
iniquity	1
unto	1
me,	1
neither	1
do	1
thou	1
remember	1
that	1
which	1
thy	1
servant	1
did	1
perversely	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
should	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
19:20	1
For	1
thy	1
servant	1
doth	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sinned:	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
the	1
first	1
this	1
day	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
19:21	1
But	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Shall	1
not	1
Shimei	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
this,	1
because	1
he	1
cursed	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed?	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
this	1
day	1
be	1
adversaries	1
unto	1
me?	1
shall	1
there	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
Israel?	1
for	1
do	1
not	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
day	1
king	1
over	1
Israel?	1
	1
19:23	1
Therefore	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Shimei,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
sware	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
Mephibosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
had	1
neither	1
dressed	1
his	1
feet,	1
nor	1
trimmed	1
his	1
beard,	1
nor	1
washed	1
his	1
clothes,	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
king	1
departed	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
19:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
wentest	1
not	1
thou	1
with	1
me,	1
Mephibosheth?	1
	1
19:26	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
My	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
my	1
servant	1
deceived	1
me:	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
saddle	1
me	1
an	1
ass,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
ride	1
thereon,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
king;	1
because	1
thy	1
servant	1
is	1
lame.	1
	1
19:27	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
slandered	1
thy	1
servant	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king;	1
but	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God:	1
do	1
therefore	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
19:28	1
For	1
all	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
were	1
but	1
dead	1
men	1
before	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king:	1
yet	1
didst	1
thou	1
set	1
thy	1
servant	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
did	1
eat	1
at	1
thine	1
own	1
table.	1
What	1
right	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
yet	1
to	1
cry	1
any	1
more	1
unto	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
speakest	1
thou	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
thy	1
matters?	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
Thou	1
and	1
Ziba	1
divide	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
Mephibosheth	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Yea,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
all,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
come	1
again	1
in	1
peace	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
Barzillai	1
the	1
Gileadite	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Rogelim,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan	1
with	1
the	1
king,	1
to	1
conduct	1
him	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
	1
19:32	1
Now	1
Barzillai	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
aged	1
man,	1
even	1
fourscore	1
years	1
old:	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
provided	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
sustenance	1
while	1
he	1
lay	1
at	1
Mahanaim;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
man.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Barzillai,	1
Come	1
thou	1
over	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
thee	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
19:34	1
And	1
Barzillai	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
How	1
long	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
live,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
unto	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
19:35	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
day	1
fourscore	1
years	1
old:	1
and	1
can	1
I	1
discern	1
between	1
good	1
and	1
evil?	1
can	1
thy	1
servant	1
taste	1
what	1
I	1
eat	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
drink?	1
can	1
I	1
hear	1
any	1
more	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
singing	1
men	1
and	1
singing	1
women?	1
wherefore	1
then	1
should	1
thy	1
servant	1
be	1
yet	1
a	1
burden	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
19:36	1
Thy	1
servant	1
will	1
go	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
over	1
Jordan	1
with	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
king	1
recompense	1
it	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
reward?	1
	1
19:37	1
Let	1
thy	1
servant,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
turn	1
back	1
again,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
die	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
city,	1
and	1
be	1
buried	1
by	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
mother.	1
But	1
behold	1
thy	1
servant	1
Chimham;	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
over	1
with	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king;	1
and	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
shall	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
19:38	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
answered,	1
Chimham	1
shall	1
go	1
over	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
thee:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
require	1
of	1
me,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
come	1
over,	1
the	1
king	1
kissed	1
Barzillai,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
place.	1
	1
19:40	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
Chimham	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah	1
conducted	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
also	1
half	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:41	1
And,	1
behold,	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Why	1
have	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
stolen	1
thee	1
away,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
household,	1
and	1
all	1
David's	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
over	1
Jordan?	1
	1
19:42	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
answered	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Because	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
near	1
of	1
kin	1
to	1
us:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
be	1
ye	1
angry	1
for	1
this	1
matter?	1
have	1
we	1
eaten	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
cost?	1
or	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
us	1
any	1
gift?	1
	1
19:43	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
answered	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
ten	1
parts	1
in	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
also	1
more	1
right	1
in	1
David	1
than	1
ye:	1
why	1
then	1
did	1
ye	1
despise	1
us,	1
that	1
our	1
advice	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
first	1
had	1
in	1
bringing	1
back	1
our	1
king?	1
And	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
fiercer	1
than	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
there	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Belial,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Sheba,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri,	1
a	1
Benjamite:	1
and	1
he	1
blew	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
David,	1
neither	1
have	1
we	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse:	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tents,	1
O	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:2	1
So	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
after	1
David,	1
and	1
followed	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri:	1
but	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
clave	1
unto	1
their	1
king,	1
from	1
Jordan	1
even	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
the	1
ten	1
women	1
his	1
concubines,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
ward,	1
and	1
fed	1
them,	1
but	1
went	1
not	1
in	1
unto	1
them.	1
So	1
they	1
were	1
shut	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
death,	1
living	1
in	1
widowhood.	1
	1
20:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Amasa,	1
Assemble	1
me	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
within	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
here	1
present.	1
	1
20:5	1
So	1
Amasa	1
went	1
to	1
assemble	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah:	1
but	1
he	1
tarried	1
longer	1
than	1
the	1
set	1
time	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
appointed	1
him.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abishai,	1
Now	1
shall	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri	1
do	1
us	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
did	1
Absalom:	1
take	1
thou	1
thy	1
lord's	1
servants,	1
and	1
pursue	1
after	1
him,	1
lest	1
he	1
get	1
him	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
escape	1
us.	1
