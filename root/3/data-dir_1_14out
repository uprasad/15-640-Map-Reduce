CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
"Well,	1
Prince,	1
so	1
Genoa	1
and	1
Lucca	1
are	1
now	1
just	1
family	1
estates	1
of	1
the	1
Buonapartes.	1
But	1
I	1
warn	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
means	1
war,	1
if	1
you	1
still	1
try	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
infamies	1
and	1
horrors	1
perpetrated	1
by	1
that	1
Antichrist--I	1
really	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
Antichrist--I	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
my	1
friend,	1
no	1
longer	1
my	1
'faithful	1
slave,'	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
yourself!	1
But	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
do?	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
have	1
frightened	1
you--sit	1
down	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
news."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
July,	1
1805,	1
and	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
the	1
well-known	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer,	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
favorite	1
of	1
the	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna.	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
greeted	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
high	1
rank	1
and	1
importance,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
her	1
reception.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
cough	1
for	1
some	1
days.	1
She	1
was,	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
suffering	1
from	1
la	1
grippe;	1
grippe	1
being	1
then	1
a	1
new	1
word	1
in	1
St.	1
Petersburg,	1
used	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
elite.	1
	1
All	1
her	1
invitations	1
without	1
exception,	1
written	1
in	1
French,	1
and	1
delivered	1
by	1
a	1
scarlet-liveried	1
footman	1
that	1
morning,	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do,	1
Count	1
(or	1
Prince),	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
spending	1
an	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
terrible,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
charmed	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
tonight	1
between	1
7	1
and	1
10--Annette	1
Scherer."	1
	1
"Heavens!	1
what	1
a	1
virulent	1
attack!"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
this	1
reception.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
entered,	1
wearing	1
an	1
embroidered	1
court	1
uniform,	1
knee	1
breeches,	1
and	1
shoes,	1
and	1
had	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
serene	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
flat	1
face.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
that	1
refined	1
French	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
grandfathers	1
not	1
only	1
spoke	1
but	1
thought,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
gentle,	1
patronizing	1
intonation	1
natural	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
at	1
court.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
presenting	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
bald,	1
scented,	1
and	1
shining	1
head,	1
and	1
complacently	1
seated	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"First	1
of	1
all,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
are.	1
Set	1
your	1
friend's	1
mind	1
at	1
rest,"	1
said	1
he	1
without	1
altering	1
his	1
tone,	1
beneath	1
the	1
politeness	1
and	1
affected	1
sympathy	1
of	1
which	1
indifference	1
and	1
even	1
irony	1
could	1
be	1
discerned.	1
	1
"Can	1
one	1
be	1
well	1
while	1
suffering	1
morally?	1
Can	1
one	1
be	1
calm	1
in	1
times	1
like	1
these	1
if	1
one	1
has	1
any	1
feeling?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
"You	1
are	1
staying	1
the	1
whole	1
evening,	1
I	1
hope?"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
ambassador's?	1
Today	1
is	1
Wednesday.	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
in	1
an	1
appearance	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"My	1
daughter	1
is	1
coming	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
there."	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
today's	1
fete	1
had	1
been	1
canceled.	1
I	1
confess	1
all	1
these	1
festivities	1
and	1
fireworks	1
are	1
becoming	1
wearisome."	1
	1
"If	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
it,	1
the	1
entertainment	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
off,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
who,	1
like	1
a	1
wound-up	1
clock,	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
said	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
believed.	1
	1
"Don't	1
tease!	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
decided	1
about	1
Novosiltsev's	1
dispatch?	1
You	1
know	1
everything."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
about	1
it?"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
listless	1
tone.	1
"What	1
has	1
been	1
decided?	1
They	1
have	1
decided	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
burnt	1
his	1
boats,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
burn	1
ours."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
always	1
spoke	1
languidly,	1
like	1
an	1
actor	1
repeating	1
a	1
stale	1
part.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
despite	1
her	1
forty	1
years,	1
overflowed	1
with	1
animation	1
and	1
impulsiveness.	1
To	1
be	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
had	1
become	1
her	1
social	1
vocation	1
and,	1
sometimes	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
like	1
it,	1
she	1
became	1
enthusiastic	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
disappoint	1
the	1
expectations	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
her.	1
The	1
subdued	1
smile	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
her	1
faded	1
features,	1
always	1
played	1
round	1
her	1
lips	1
expressed,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
spoiled	1
child,	1
a	1
continual	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
charming	1
defect,	1
which	1
she	1
neither	1
wished,	1
nor	1
could,	1
nor	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary,	1
to	1
correct.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
on	1
political	1
matters	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
burst	1
out:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
Austria.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
things,	1
but	1
Austria	1
never	1
has	1
wished,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wish,	1
for	1
war.	1
She	1
is	1
betraying	1
us!	1
Russia	1
alone	1
must	1
save	1
Europe.	1
Our	1
gracious	1
sovereign	1
recognizes	1
his	1
high	1
vocation	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
it.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
faith	1
in!	1
Our	1
good	1
and	1
wonderful	1
sovereign	1
has	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
noblest	1
role	1
on	1
earth,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
virtuous	1
and	1
noble	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
him.	1
He	1
will	1
fulfill	1
his	1
vocation	1
and	1
crush	1
the	1
hydra	1
of	1
revolution,	1
which	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
this	1
murderer	1
and	1
villain!	1
We	1
alone	1
must	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
one....	1
Whom,	1
I	1
ask	1
you,	1
can	1
we	1
rely	1
on?...	1
England	1
with	1
her	1
commercial	1
spirit	1
will	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
loftiness	1
of	1
soul.	1
She	1
has	1
refused	1
to	1
evacuate	1
Malta.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
find,	1
and	1
still	1
seeks,	1
some	1
secret	1
motive	1
in	1
our	1
actions.	1
What	1
answer	1
did	1
Novosiltsev	1
get?	1
None.	1
The	1
English	1
have	1
not	1
understood	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
self-abnegation	1
of	1
our	1
Emperor	1
who	1
wants	1
nothing	1
for	1
himself,	1
but	1
only	1
desires	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
mankind.	1
And	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
promised?	1
Nothing!	1
And	1
what	1
little	1
they	1
have	1
promised	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
perform!	1
Prussia	1
has	1
always	1
declared	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
is	1
invincible,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
Europe	1
is	1
powerless	1
before	1
him....	1
And	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
Hardenburg	1
says,	1
or	1
Haugwitz	1
either.	1
This	1
famous	1
Prussian	1
neutrality	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
trap.	1
I	1
have	1
faith	1
only	1
in	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
lofty	1
destiny	1
of	1
our	1
adored	1
monarch.	1
He	1
will	1
save	1
Europe!"	1
	1
She	1
suddenly	1
paused,	1
smiling	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
impetuosity.	1
	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"that	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
instead	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
Wintzingerode	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
captured	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia's	1
consent	1
by	1
assault.	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
eloquent.	1
Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea?"	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
moment.	1
A	1
propos,"	1
she	1
added,	1
becoming	1
calm	1
again,	1
"I	1
am	1
expecting	1
two	1
very	1
interesting	1
men	1
tonight,	1
le	1
Vicomte	1
de	1
Mortemart,	1
who	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Montmorencys	1
through	1
the	1
Rohans,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
French	1
families.	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
genuine	1
emigres,	1
the	1
good	1
ones.	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Morio.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
profound	1
thinker?	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Had	1
you	1
heard?"	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
meet	1
them,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"But	1
tell	1
me,"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
studied	1
carelessness	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
visit,	1
"is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
wants	1
Baron	1
Funke	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
first	1
secretary	1
at	1
Vienna?	1
The	1
baron	1
by	1
all	1
accounts	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
creature."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
wished	1
to	1
obtain	1
this	1
post	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
but	1
others	1
were	1
trying	1
through	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
baron.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
almost	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
criticize	1
what	1
the	1
Empress	1
desired	1
or	1
was	1
pleased	1
with.	1
	1
"Baron	1
Funke	1
has	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
by	1
her	1
sister,"	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
mournful	1
tone.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
named	1
the	1
Empress,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
face	1
suddenly	1
assumed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
and	1
sincere	1
devotion	1
and	1
respect	1
mingled	1
with	1
sadness,	1
and	1
this	1
occurred	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
mentioned	1
her	1
illustrious	1
patroness.	1
She	1
added	1
that	1
Her	1
Majesty	1
had	1
deigned	1
to	1
show	1
Baron	1
Funke	1
beaucoup	1
d'estime,	1
and	1
again	1
her	1
face	1
clouded	1
over	1
with	1
sadness.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
indifferent.	1
But,	1
with	1
the	1
womanly	1
and	1
courtierlike	1
quickness	1
and	1
tact	1
habitual	1
to	1
her,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
wished	1
both	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him	1
(for	1
daring	1
to	1
speak	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
Empress)	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
console	1
him,	1
so	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"Now	1
about	1
your	1
family.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
your	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
everyone	1
has	1
been	1
enraptured	1
by	1
her?	1
They	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
amazingly	1
beautiful."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
bowed	1
to	1
signify	1
his	1
respect	1
and	1
gratitude.	1
	1
"I	1
often	1
think,"	1
she	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
smiling	1
amiably	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
political	1
and	1
social	1
topics	1
were	1
ended	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
intimate	1
conversation--"I	1
often	1
think	1
how	1
unfairly	1
sometimes	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
distributed.	1
Why	1
has	1
fate	1
given	1
you	1
two	1
such	1
splendid	1
children?	1
I	1
don't	1
speak	1
of	1
Anatole,	1
your	1
youngest.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
him,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
admitting	1
of	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
and	1
raising	1
her	1
eyebrows.	1
"Two	1
such	1
charming	1
children.	1
And	1
really	1
you	1
appreciate	1
them	1
less	1
than	1
anyone,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
don't	1
deserve	1
to	1
have	1
them."	1
	1
And	1
she	1
smiled	1
her	1
ecstatic	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
help	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"Lavater	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
I	1
lack	1
the	1
bump	1
of	1
paternity."	1
	1
"Don't	1
joke;	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
serious	1
talk	1
with	1
you.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
your	1
younger	1
son?	1
Between	1
ourselves"	1
(and	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
its	1
melancholy	1
expression),	1
"he	1
was	1
mentioned	1
at	1
Her	1
Majesty's	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
pitied...."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
answered	1
nothing,	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
significantly,	1
awaiting	1
a	1
reply.	1
He	1
frowned.	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
me	1
do?"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
did	1
all	1
a	1
father	1
could	1
for	1
their	1
education,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
both	1
turned	1
out	1
fools.	1
Hippolyte	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
quiet	1
fool,	1
but	1
Anatole	1
is	1
an	1
active	1
one.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
difference	1
between	1
them."	1
He	1
said	1
this	1
smiling	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
animated	1
than	1
usual,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
round	1
his	1
mouth	1
very	1
clearly	1
revealed	1
something	1
unexpectedly	1
coarse	1
and	1
unpleasant.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
are	1
children	1
born	1
to	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
you?	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
father	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
I	1
could	1
reproach	1
you	1
with,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
looking	1
up	1
pensively.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
your	1
faithful	1
slave	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
I	1
can	1
confess	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
the	1
bane	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
cross	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
bear.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
myself.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
	1
He	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
expressed	1
his	1
resignation	1
to	1
cruel	1
fate	1
by	1
a	1
gesture.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
meditated.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
marrying	1
your	1
prodigal	1
son	1
Anatole?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"They	1
say	1
old	1
maids	1
have	1
a	1
mania	1
for	1
matchmaking,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
don't	1
feel	1
that	1
weakness	1
in	1
myself	1
as	1
yet,	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
little	1
person	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
unhappy	1
with	1
her	1
father.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
yours,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
Bolkonskaya."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
though,	1
with	1
the	1
quickness	1
of	1
memory	1
and	1
perception	1
befitting	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
indicated	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
this	1
information.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
sad	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
"that	1
Anatole	1
is	1
costing	1
me	1
forty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year?	1
And,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"what	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
five	1
years,	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
like	1
this?"	1
Presently	1
he	1
added:	1
"That's	1
what	1
we	1
fathers	1
have	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with....	1
Is	1
this	1
princess	1
of	1
yours	1
rich?"	1
	1
"Her	1
father	1
is	1
very	1
rich	1
and	1
stingy.	1
He	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
well-known	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
under	1
the	1
late	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
was	1
nicknamed	1
'the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia.'	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
clever	1
but	1
eccentric,	1
and	1
a	1
bore.	1
The	1
poor	1
girl	1
is	1
very	1
unhappy.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
brother;	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
him,	1
he	1
married	1
Lise	1
Meinen	1
lately.	1
He	1
is	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
tonight."	1
	1
"Listen,	1
dear	1
Annette,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
suddenly	1
taking	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
hand	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
drawing	1
it	1
downwards.	1
"Arrange	1
that	1
affair	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
your	1
most	1
devoted	1
slave-slafe	1
with	1
an	1
f,	1
as	1
a	1
village	1
elder	1
of	1
mine	1
writes	1
in	1
his	1
reports.	1
She	1
is	1
rich	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
and	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
want."	1
	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
and	1
easy	1
grace	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
the	1
maid	1
of	1
honor's	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
kissed	1
it,	1
and	1
swung	1
it	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
armchair,	1
looking	1
in	1
another	1
direction.	1
	1
"Attendez,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
reflecting,	1
"I'll	1
speak	1
to	1
Lise,	1
young	1
Bolkonski's	1
wife,	1
this	1
very	1
evening,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
thing	1
can	1
be	1
arranged.	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
your	1
family's	1
behalf	1
that	1
I'll	1
start	1
my	1
apprenticeship	1
as	1
old	1
maid."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room	1
was	1
gradually	1
filling.	1
The	1
highest	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
was	1
assembled	1
there:	1
people	1
differing	1
widely	1
in	1
age	1
and	1
character	1
but	1
alike	1
in	1
the	1
social	1
circle	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
belonged.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
daughter,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene,	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador's	1
entertainment;	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
ball	1
dress	1
and	1
her	1
badge	1
as	1
maid	1
of	1
honor.	1
The	1
youthful	1
little	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
known	1
as	1
la	1
femme	1
la	1
plus	1
seduisante	1
de	1
Petersbourg,	1
*	1
was	1
also	1
there.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
during	1
the	1
previous	1
winter,	1
and	1
being	1
pregnant	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
any	1
large	1
gatherings,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
small	1
receptions.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son,	1
Hippolyte,	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
Mortemart,	1
whom	1
he	1
introduced.	1
The	1
Abbe	1
Morio	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
had	1
also	1
come.	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
most	1
fascinating	1
woman	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
To	1
each	1
new	1
arrival	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
said,	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
my	1
aunt,"	1
or	1
"You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
my	1
aunt?"	1
and	1
very	1
gravely	1
conducted	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
lady,	1
wearing	1
large	1
bows	1
of	1
ribbon	1
in	1
her	1
cap,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
sailing	1
in	1
from	1
another	1
room	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
arrive;	1
and	1
slowly	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
visitor	1
to	1
her	1
aunt,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
mentioned	1
each	1
one's	1
name	1
and	1
then	1
left	1
them.	1
	1
Each	1
visitor	1
performed	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
greeting	1
this	1
old	1
aunt	1
whom	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
knew,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
wanted	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
cared	1
about;	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
observed	1
these	1
greetings	1
with	1
mournful	1
and	1
solemn	1
interest	1
and	1
silent	1
approval.	1
The	1
aunt	1
spoke	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
words,	1
about	1
their	1
health	1
and	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Her	1
Majesty,	1
"who,	1
thank	1
God,	1
was	1
better	1
today."	1
And	1
each	1
visitor,	1
though	1
politeness	1
prevented	1
his	1
showing	1
impatience,	1
left	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
at	1
having	1
performed	1
a	1
vexatious	1
duty	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya	1
had	1
brought	1
some	1
work	1
in	1
a	1
gold-	1
embroidered	1
velvet	1
bag.	1
Her	1
pretty	1
little	1
upper	1
lip,	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
delicate	1
dark	1
down	1
was	1
just	1
perceptible,	1
was	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
her	1
teeth,	1
but	1
it	1
lifted	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
sweetly,	1
and	1
was	1
especially	1
charming	1
when	1
she	1
occasionally	1
drew	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
lower	1
lip.	1
As	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
a	1
thoroughly	1
attractive	1
woman,	1
her	1
defect--the	1
shortness	1
of	1
her	1
upper	1
lip	1
and	1
her	1
half-open	1
mouth--seemed	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
own	1
special	1
and	1
peculiar	1
form	1
of	1
beauty.	1
Everyone	1
brightened	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
pretty	1
young	1
woman,	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
mother,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health,	1
and	1
carrying	1
her	1
burden	1
so	1
lightly.	1
Old	1
men	1
and	1
dull	1
dispirited	1
young	1
ones	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
after	1
being	1
in	1
her	1
company	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
becoming,	1
like	1
her,	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health.	1
All	1
who	1
talked	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
at	1
each	1
word	1
saw	1
her	1
bright	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
constant	1
gleam	1
of	1
her	1
white	1
teeth,	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
amiable	1
mood	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
quick,	1
short,	1
swaying	1
steps,	1
her	1
workbag	1
on	1
her	1
arm,	1
and	1
gaily	1
spreading	1
out	1
her	1
dress	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
near	1
the	1
silver	1
samovar,	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
was	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
around	1
her.	1
"I	1
have	1
brought	1
my	1
work,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
French,	1
displaying	1
her	1
bag	1
and	1
addressing	1
all	1
present.	1
"Mind,	1
Annette,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
played	1
a	1
wicked	1
trick	1
on	1
me,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
hostess.	1
"You	1
wrote	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
small	1
reception,	1
and	1
just	1
see	1
how	1
badly	1
I	1
am	1
dressed."	1
And	1
she	1
spread	1
out	1
her	1
arms	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
short-waisted,	1
lace-trimmed,	1
dainty	1
gray	1
dress,	1
girdled	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
ribbon	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
breast.	1
	1
"Soyez	1
tranquille,	1
Lise,	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
prettier	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,"	1
replied	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"You	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
and	1
still	1
in	1
French,	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
general,	1
"my	1
husband	1
is	1
deserting	1
me?	1
He	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
himself	1
killed.	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
this	1
wretched	1
war	1
is	1
for?"	1
she	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
delightful	1
woman	1
this	1
little	1
princess	1
is!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
arrivals	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
heavily	1
built	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
close-cropped	1
hair,	1
spectacles,	1
the	1
light-colored	1
breeches	1
fashionable	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
ruffle,	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
dress	1
coat.	1
This	1
stout	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
a	1
well-known	1
grandee	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
time	1
who	1
now	1
lay	1
dying	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
entered	1
either	1
the	1
military	1
or	1
civil	1
service,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
appearance	1
in	1
society.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
nod	1
she	1
accorded	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
hierarchy	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
lowest-grade	1
greeting,	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
something	1
too	1
large	1
and	1
unsuited	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
enter.	1
Though	1
he	1
was	1
certainly	1
rather	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
her	1
anxiety	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
clever	1
though	1
shy,	1
but	1
observant	1
and	1
natural,	1
expression	1
which	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
everyone	1
else	1
in	1
that	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
exchanging	1
an	1
alarmed	1
glance	1
with	1
her	1
aunt	1
as	1
she	1
conducted	1
him	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
Pierre	1
murmured	1
something	1
unintelligible,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
something.	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
pleased	1
smile,	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
alarm	1
was	1
justified,	1
for	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
aunt	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
speech	1
about	1
Her	1
Majesty's	1
health.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
dismay	1
detained	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Morio?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
man."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
scheme	1
for	1
perpetual	1
peace,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
hardly	1
feasible."	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
so?"	1
rejoined	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
and	1
get	1
away	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
now	1
committed	1
a	1
reverse	1
act	1
of	1
impoliteness.	1
First	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
lady	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
another	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
away.	1
With	1
his	1
head	1
bent,	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
feet	1
spread	1
apart,	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
his	1
reasons	1
for	1
thinking	1
the	1
abbe's	1
plan	1
chimerical.	1
	1
"We	1
will	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
later,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
And	1
having	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave,	1
she	1
resumed	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
watch,	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
at	1
any	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
conversation	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
flag.	1
As	1
the	1
foreman	1
of	1
a	1
spinning	1
mill,	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
set	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
work,	1
goes	1
round	1
and	1
notices	1
here	1
a	1
spindle	1
that	1
has	1
stopped	1
or	1
there	1
one	1
that	1
creaks	1
or	1
makes	1
more	1
noise	1
than	1
it	1
should,	1
and	1
hastens	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
machine	1
or	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
proper	1
motion,	1
so	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
moved	1
about	1
her	1
drawing	1
room,	1
approaching	1
now	1
a	1
silent,	1
now	1
a	1
too-noisy	1
group,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
slight	1
rearrangement	1
kept	1
the	1
conversational	1
machine	1
in	1
steady,	1
proper,	1
and	1
regular	1
motion.	1
But	1
amid	1
these	1
cares	1
her	1
anxiety	1
about	1
Pierre	1
was	1
evident.	1
She	1
kept	1
an	1
anxious	1
watch	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
group	1
round	1
Mortemart	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
there,	1
and	1
again	1
when	1
he	1
passed	1
to	1
another	1
group	1
whose	1
center	1
was	1
the	1
abbe.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
abroad,	1
and	1
this	1
reception	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
attended	1
in	1
Russia.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
intellectual	1
lights	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
were	1
gathered	1
there	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
a	1
toyshop,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look,	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
any	1
clever	1
conversation	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard.	1
Seeing	1
the	1
self-confident	1
and	1
refined	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
very	1
profound.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Morio.	1
Here	1
the	1
conversation	1
seemed	1
interesting	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
own	1
views,	1
as	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
doing.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
swing.	1
The	1
spindles	1
hummed	1
steadily	1
and	1
ceaselessly	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
With	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
aunt,	1
beside	1
whom	1
sat	1
only	1
one	1
elderly	1
lady,	1
who	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
careworn	1
face	1
was	1
rather	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
this	1
brilliant	1
society,	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
had	1
settled	1
into	1
three	1
groups.	1
One,	1
chiefly	1
masculine,	1
had	1
formed	1
round	1
the	1
abbe.	1
Another,	1
of	1
young	1
people,	1
was	1
grouped	1
round	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
rosy,	1
though	1
rather	1
too	1
plump	1
for	1
her	1
age.	1
The	1
third	1
group	1
was	1
gathered	1
round	1
Mortemart	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
was	1
a	1
nice-looking	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
soft	1
features	1
and	1
polished	1
manners,	1
who	1
evidently	1
considered	1
himself	1
a	1
celebrity	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
politeness	1
modestly	1
placed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
obviously	1
serving	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
treat	1
to	1
her	1
guests.	1
As	1
a	1
clever	1
maitre	1
d'hotel	1
serves	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
specially	1
choice	1
delicacy	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
meat	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
would	1
have	1
cared	1
to	1
eat,	1
so	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
guests,	1
first	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
abbe,	1
as	1
peculiarly	1
choice	1
morsels.	1
The	1
group	1
about	1
Mortemart	1
immediately	1
began	1
discussing	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien.	1
The	1
vicomte	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien	1
had	1
perished	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
magnanimity,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
particular	1
reasons	1
for	1
Buonaparte's	1
hatred	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes!	1
Do	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
Vicomte,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
a	1
la	1
Louis	1
XV	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
that	1
sentence:	1
"Contez	1
nous	1
cela,	1
Vicomte."	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
bowed	1
and	1
smiled	1
courteously	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
his	1
willingness	1
to	1
comply.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
arranged	1
a	1
group	1
round	1
him,	1
inviting	1
everyone	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
tale.	1
	1
"The	1
vicomte	1
knew	1
the	1
duc	1
personally,"	1
whispered	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guests.	1
"The	1
vicomte	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
raconteur,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
another.	1
"How	1
evidently	1
he	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
a	1
third;	1
and	1
the	1
vicomte	1
was	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
choicest	1
and	1
most	1
advantageous	1
style,	1
like	1
a	1
well-garnished	1
joint	1
of	1
roast	1
beef	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
dish.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
wished	1
to	1
begin	1
his	1
story	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile.	1
	1
"Come	1
over	1
here,	1
Helene,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
to	1
the	1
beautiful	1
young	1
princess	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
some	1
way	1
off,	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
another	1
group.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
smiled.	1
She	1
rose	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
unchanging	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
first	1
entered	1
the	1
room--the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
perfectly	1
beautiful	1
woman.	1
With	1
a	1
slight	1
rustle	1
of	1
her	1
white	1
dress	1
trimmed	1
with	1
moss	1
and	1
ivy,	1
with	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
white	1
shoulders,	1
glossy	1
hair,	1
and	1
sparkling	1
diamonds,	1
she	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
made	1
way	1
for	1
her,	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
smiling	1
on	1
all,	1
as	1
if	1
graciously	1
allowing	1
each	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
admiring	1
her	1
beautiful	1
figure	1
and	1
shapely	1
shoulders,	1
back,	1
and	1
bosom--which	1
in	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
those	1
days	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
exposed--	1
and	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
glamour	1
of	1
a	1
ballroom	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
moved	1
toward	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
Helene	1
was	1
so	1
lovely	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
she	1
not	1
show	1
any	1
trace	1
of	1
coquetry,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
even	1
appeared	1
shy	1
of	1
her	1
unquestionable	1
and	1
all	1
too	1
victorious	1
beauty.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
wish,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
unable,	1
to	1
diminish	1
its	1
effect.	1
	1
"How	1
lovely!"	1
said	1
everyone	1
who	1
saw	1
her;	1
and	1
the	1
vicomte	1
lifted	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
startled	1
by	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
when	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
seat	1
opposite	1
and	1
beamed	1
upon	1
him	1
also	1
with	1
her	1
unchanging	1
smile.	1
	1
"Madame,	1
I	1
doubt	1
my	1
ability	1
before	1
such	1
an	1
audience,"	1
said	1
he,	1
smilingly	1
inclining	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
rested	1
her	1
bare	1
round	1
arm	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
and	1
considered	1
a	1
reply	1
unnecessary.	1
She	1
smilingly	1
waited.	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
being	1
told	1
she	1
sat	1
upright,	1
glancing	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
beautiful	1
round	1
arm,	1
altered	1
in	1
shape	1
by	1
its	1
pressure	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
beautiful	1
bosom,	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
readjusted	1
a	1
diamond	1
necklace.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
she	1
smoothed	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress,	1
and	1
whenever	1
the	1
story	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
at	1
once	1
adopted	1
just	1
the	1
expression	1
she	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
maid	1
of	1
honor's	1
face,	1
and	1
again	1
relapsed	1
into	1
her	1
radiant	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
also	1
left	1
the	1
tea	1
table	1
and	1
followed	1
Helene.	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
I'll	1
get	1
my	1
work....	1
Now	1
then,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of?"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte.	1
"Fetch	1
me	1
my	1
workbag."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
movement	1
as	1
the	1
princess,	1
smiling	1
and	1
talking	1
merrily	1
to	1
everyone	1
at	1
once,	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
gaily	1
arranged	1
herself	1
in	1
her	1
seat.	1
	1
"Now	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
right,"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
asking	1
the	1
vicomte	1
to	1
begin,	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
work.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
workbag,	1
joined	1
the	1
circle	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
chair	1
close	1
to	1
hers	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
Le	1
charmant	1
Hippolyte	1
was	1
surprising	1
by	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
resemblance	1
to	1
his	1
beautiful	1
sister,	1
but	1
yet	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
resemblance	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
ugly.	1
His	1
features	1
were	1
like	1
his	1
sister's,	1
but	1
while	1
in	1
her	1
case	1
everything	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
joyous,	1
self-	1
satisfied,	1
youthful,	1
and	1
constant	1
smile	1
of	1
animation,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
wonderful	1
classic	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
figure,	1
his	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
dulled	1
by	1
imbecility	1
and	1
a	1
constant	1
expression	1
of	1
sullen	1
self-	1
confidence,	1
while	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
weak.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
nose,	1
and	1
mouth	1
all	1
seemed	1
puckered	1
into	1
a	1
vacant,	1
wearied	1
grimace,	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
always	1
fell	1
into	1
unnatural	1
positions.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ghost	1
story?"	1
said	1
he,	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
hastily	1
adjusting	1
his	1
lorgnette,	1
as	1
if	1
without	1
this	1
instrument	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
"Why	1
no,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
the	1
astonished	1
narrator,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"Because	1
I	1
hate	1
ghost	1
stories,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
spoke	1
with	1
such	1
self-confidence	1
that	1
his	1
hearers	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sure	1
whether	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
very	1
witty	1
or	1
very	1
stupid.	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
dark-green	1
dress	1
coat,	1
knee	1
breeches	1
of	1
the	1
color	1
of	1
cuisse	1
de	1
nymphe	1
effrayee,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it,	1
shoes,	1
and	1
silk	1
stockings.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
told	1
his	1
tale	1
very	1
neatly.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
anecdote,	1
then	1
current,	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien	1
had	1
gone	1
secretly	1
to	1
Paris	1
to	1
visit	1
Mademoiselle	1
George;	1
that	1
at	1
her	1
house	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
Bonaparte,	1
who	1
also	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
famous	1
actress'	1
favors,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
Napoleon	1
happened	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fainting	1
fits	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
subject,	1
and	1
was	1
thus	1
at	1
the	1
duc's	1
mercy.	1
The	1
latter	1
spared	1
him,	1
and	1
this	1
magnanimity	1
Bonaparte	1
subsequently	1
repaid	1
by	1
death.	1
	1
The	1
story	1
was	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
interesting,	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
rivals	1
suddenly	1
recognized	1
one	1
another;	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
looked	1
agitated.	1
	1
"Charming!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
with	1
an	1
inquiring	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
	1
"Charming!"	1
whispered	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
sticking	1
the	1
needle	1
into	1
her	1
work	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
fascination	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
appreciated	1
this	1
silent	1
praise	1
and	1
smiling	1
gratefully	1
prepared	1
to	1
continue,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
who	1
had	1
kept	1
a	1
watchful	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
so	1
alarmed	1
her,	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
too	1
loudly	1
and	1
vehemently	1
with	1
the	1
abbe,	1
so	1
she	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
rescue.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
abbe	1
about	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
latter,	1
evidently	1
interested	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
simple-minded	1
eagerness,	1
was	1
explaining	1
his	1
pet	1
theory.	1
Both	1
were	1
talking	1
and	1
listening	1
too	1
eagerly	1
and	1
too	1
naturally,	1
which	1
was	1
why	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
disapproved.	1
	1
"The	1
means	1
are...	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people,"	1
the	1
abbe	1
was	1
saying.	1
"It	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
for	1
one	1
powerful	1
nation	1
like	1
Russia--barbaric	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be--to	1
place	1
herself	1
disinterestedly	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
an	1
alliance	1
having	1
for	1
its	1
object	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
of	1
Europe,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
save	1
the	1
world!"	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
that	1
balance?"	1
Pierre	1
was	1
beginning.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
came	1
up	1
and,	1
looking	1
severely	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
asked	1
the	1
Italian	1
how	1
he	1
stood	1
Russian	1
climate.	1
The	1
Italian's	1
face	1
instantly	1
changed	1
and	1
assumed	1
an	1
offensively	1
affected,	1
sugary	1
expression,	1
evidently	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
conversing	1
with	1
women.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
enchanted	1
by	1
the	1
brilliancy	1
of	1
the	1
wit	1
and	1
culture	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
more	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
feminine	1
society,	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
being	1
received,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
climate,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Not	1
letting	1
the	1
abbe	1
and	1
Pierre	1
escape,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
the	1
more	1
conveniently	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
under	1
observation,	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
larger	1
circle.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
another	1
visitor	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room:	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski,	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
husband.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
young	1
man,	1
of	1
medium	1
height,	1
with	1
firm,	1
clearcut	1
features.	1
Everything	1
about	1
him,	1
from	1
his	1
weary,	1
bored	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
quiet,	1
measured	1
step,	1
offered	1
a	1
most	1
striking	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
quiet,	1
little	1
wife.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
knew	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
but	1
had	1
found	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
tiresome	1
that	1
it	1
wearied	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
or	1
listen	1
to	1
them.	1
And	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
faces	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
so	1
tedious,	1
none	1
seemed	1
to	1
bore	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
pretty	1
wife.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
grimace	1
that	1
distorted	1
his	1
handsome	1
face,	1
kissed	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
hand,	1
and	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
scanned	1
the	1
whole	1
company.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
Prince?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"General	1
Kutuzov,"	1
said	1
Bolkonski,	1
speaking	1
French	1
and	1
stressing	1
the	1
last	1
syllable	1
of	1
the	1
general's	1
name	1
like	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
"has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
aide-de-camp...."	1
	1
"And	1
Lise,	1
your	1
wife?"	1
	1
"She	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
deprive	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
charming	1
wife?"	1
	1
"Andre,"	1
said	1
his	1
wife,	1
addressing	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
coquettish	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
other	1
men,	1
"the	1
vicomte	1
has	1
been	1
telling	1
us	1
such	1
a	1
tale	1
about	1
Mademoiselle	1
George	1
and	1
Buonaparte!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
glad,	1
affectionate	1
eyes,	1
now	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
arm.	1
Before	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
frowned	1
again,	1
expressing	1
his	1
annoyance	1
with	1
whoever	1
was	1
touching	1
his	1
arm,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Pierre's	1
beaming	1
face	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
unexpectedly	1
kind	1
and	1
pleasant	1
smile.	1
	1
"There	1
now!...	1
So	1
you,	1
too,	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
world?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
here,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
"I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
supper	1
with	1
you.	1
May	1
I?"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
vicomte	1
who	1
was	1
continuing	1
his	1
story.	1
	1
"No,	1
impossible!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
laughing	1
and	1
pressing	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
question.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
more,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
rose	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
pass.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
excuse	1
me,	1
dear	1
Vicomte,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
holding	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
way	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
rising.	1
"This	1
unfortunate	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
ambassador's	1
deprives	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
obliges	1
me	1
to	1
interrupt	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
your	1
enchanting	1
party,"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
His	1
daughter,	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
chairs,	1
lightly	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress,	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
shone	1
still	1
more	1
radiantly	1
on	1
her	1
beautiful	1
face.	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
rapturous,	1
almost	1
frightened,	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
him.	1
	1
"Very	1
lovely,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Very,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
In	1
passing	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
seized	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna:	1
"Educate	1
this	1
bear	1
for	1
me!	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
staying	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
society.	1
Nothing	1
is	1
so	1
necessary	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
clever	1
women."	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
smiled	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
Pierre	1
in	1
hand.	1
She	1
knew	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
connection	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's.	1
The	1
elderly	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
aunt	1
rose	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
overtook	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
All	1
the	1
affectation	1
of	1
interest	1
she	1
had	1
assumed	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
kindly	1
and	1
tear-worn	1
face	1
and	1
it	1
now	1
expressed	1
only	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear.	1
	1
"How	1
about	1
my	1
son	1
Boris,	1
Prince?"	1
said	1
she,	1
hurrying	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
"I	1
can't	1
remain	1
any	1
longer	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
news	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
boy."	1
	1
Although	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
listened	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
politely	1
to	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady,	1
even	1
betraying	1
some	1
impatience,	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
ingratiating	1
and	1
appealing	1
smile,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
go	1
away.	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
it	1
cost	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards	1
at	1
once?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"Believe	1
me,	1
Princess,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
can,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
I	1
should	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
appeal	1
to	1
Rumyantsev	1
through	1
Prince	1
Golitsyn.	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
way."	1
	1
The	1
elderly	1
lady	1
was	1
a	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya,	1
belonging	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
families	1
in	1
Russia,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
poor,	1
and	1
having	1
long	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
society	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
former	1
influential	1
connections.	1
She	1
had	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
procure	1
an	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
Guards	1
for	1
her	1
only	1
son.	1
It	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
solely	1
to	1
meet	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
obtained	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
and	1
had	1
sat	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
vicomte's	1
story.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
words	1
frightened	1
her,	1
an	1
embittered	1
look	1
clouded	1
her	1
once	1
handsome	1
face,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment;	1
then	1
she	1
smiled	1
again	1
and	1
clutched	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
arm	1
more	1
tightly.	1
	1
"Listen	1
to	1
me,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
asked	1
you	1
for	1
anything	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
will	1
again,	1
nor	1
have	1
I	1
ever	1
reminded	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
for	1
God's	1
sake	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
son--and	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
regard	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
benefactor,"	1
she	1
added	1
hurriedly.	1
"No,	1
don't	1
be	1
angry,	1
but	1
promise!	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
Golitsyn	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
refused.	1
Be	1
the	1
kindhearted	1
man	1
you	1
always	1
were,"	1
she	1
said,	1
trying	1
to	1
smile	1
though	1
tears	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Papa,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
late,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
turning	1
her	1
beautiful	1
head	1
and	1
looking	1
over	1
her	1
classically	1
molded	1
shoulder	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
waiting	1
by	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Influence	1
in	1
society,	1
however,	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
which	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
economized	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
last.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
knew	1
this,	1
and	1
having	1
once	1
realized	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
asked	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
begged	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
himself,	1
he	1
became	1
chary	1
of	1
using	1
his	1
influence.	1
But	1
in	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya's	1
case	1
he	1
felt,	1
after	1
her	1
second	1
appeal,	1
something	1
like	1
qualms	1
of	1
conscience.	1
She	1
had	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
quite	1
true;	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
indebted	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
steps	1
in	1
his	1
career.	1
Moreover,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
her	1
manners	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
women--	1
mostly	1
mothers--who,	1
having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds,	1
will	1
not	1
rest	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
gained	1
their	1
end,	1
and	1
are	1
prepared	1
if	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
insisting	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
after	1
hour,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
scenes.	1
This	1
last	1
consideration	1
moved	1
him.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
familiarity	1
and	1
weariness	1
of	1
tone,	1
"it	1
is	1
almost	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
ask;	1
but	1
to	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
respect	1
your	1
father's	1
memory,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
impossible--your	1
son	1
shall	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards.	1
Here	1
is	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
it.	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
benefactor!	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
expected	1
from	1
you--I	1
knew	1
your	1
kindness!"	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
"Wait--just	1
a	1
word!	1
When	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards..."	1
she	1
faltered.	1
"You	1
are	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich	1
Kutuzov...	1
recommend	1
Boris	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
adjutant!	1
Then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
rest,	1
and	1
then..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
smiled.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
won't	1
promise	1
that.	1
You	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
Kutuzov	1
is	1
pestered	1
since	1
his	1
appointment	1
as	1
Commander	1
in	1
Chief.	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Moscow	1
ladies	1
have	1
conspired	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
all	1
their	1
sons	1
as	1
adjutants."	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
do	1
promise!	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
go!	1
My	1
dear	1
benefactor..."	1
	1
"Papa,"	1
said	1
his	1
beautiful	1
daughter	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
as	1
before,	1
"we	1
shall	1
be	1
late."	1
	1
"Well,	1
au	1
revoir!	1
Good-bye!	1
You	1
hear	1
her?"	1
	1
"Then	1
tomorrow	1
you	1
will	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor?"	1
	1
"Certainly;	1
but	1
about	1
Kutuzov,	1
I	1
don't	1
promise."	1
	1
"Do	1
promise,	1
do	1
promise,	1
Vasili!"	1
cried	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
coquettish	1
girl,	1
which	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
probably	1
came	1
naturally	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
was	1
now	1
very	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
her	1
careworn	1
face.	1
	1
Apparently	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
her	1
age	1
and	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
employed	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
feminine	1
arts.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
her	1
face	1
resumed	1
its	1
former	1
cold,	1
artificial	1
expression.	1
She	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
group	1
where	1
the	1
vicomte	1
was	1
still	1
talking,	1
and	1
again	1
pretended	1
to	1
listen,	1
while	1
waiting	1
till	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
time	1
to	1
leave.	1
Her	1
task	1
was	1
accomplished.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
latest	1
comedy,	1
the	1
coronation	1
at	1
Milan?"	1
asked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"and	1
of	1
the	1
comedy	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Genoa	1
and	1
Lucca	1
laying	1
their	1
petitions	1
before	1
Monsieur	1
Buonaparte,	1
and	1
Monsieur	1
Buonaparte	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
throne	1
and	1
granting	1
the	1
petitions	1
of	1
the	1
nations?	1
Adorable!	1
It	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
one's	1
head	1
whirl!	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
had	1
gone	1
crazy."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
"'Dieu	1
me	1
la	1
donne,	1
gare	1
a	1
qui	1
la	1
touche!'	1
*	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
fine	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
that,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
repeating	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
Italian:	1
"'Dio	1
mi	1
l'ha	1
dato.	1
Guai	1
a	1
chi	1
la	1
tocchi!'"	1
	1
	1
*	1
God	1
has	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
who	1
touches	1
it	1
beware!	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
this	1
will	1
prove	1
the	1
last	1
drop	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
glass	1
run	1
over,"	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
continued.	1
"The	1
sovereigns	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
endure	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
menace	1
to	1
everything."	1
	1
"The	1
sovereigns?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
Russia,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
polite	1
but	1
hopeless:	1
"The	1
sovereigns,	1
madame...	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
done	1
for	1
Louis	1
XVII,	1
for	1
the	1
Queen,	1
or	1
for	1
Madame	1
Elizabeth?	1
Nothing!"	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
animated.	1
"And	1
believe	1
me,	1
they	1
are	1
reaping	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
betrayal	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbon	1
cause.	1
The	1
sovereigns!	1
Why,	1
they	1
are	1
sending	1
ambassadors	1
to	1
compliment	1
the	1
usurper."	1
	1
And	1
sighing	1
disdainfully,	1
he	1
again	1
changed	1
his	1
position.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
vicomte	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
through	1
his	1
lorgnette,	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
completely	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
and	1
having	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
needle	1
began	1
tracing	1
the	1
Conde	1
coat	1
of	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
explained	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
gravity	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
"Baton	1
de	1
gueules,	1
engrele	1
de	1
gueules	1
d'azur--maison	1
Conde,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
listened,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"If	1
Buonaparte	1
remains	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
France	1
a	1
year	1
longer,"	1
the	1
vicomte	1
continued,	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
better	1
acquainted	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
does	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
others	1
but	1
follows	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts,	1
"things	1
will	1
have	1
gone	1
too	1
far.	1
By	1
intrigues,	1
violence,	1
exile,	1
and	1
executions,	1
French	1
society--I	1
mean	1
good	1
French	1
society--will	1
have	1
been	1
forever	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
then..."	1
	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands.	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
remark,	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
interested	1
him,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
who	1
had	1
him	1
under	1
observation,	1
interrupted:	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
the	1
melancholy	1
which	1
always	1
accompanied	1
any	1
reference	1
of	1
hers	1
to	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family,	1
"has	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
people	1
themselves	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
own	1
form	1
of	1
government;	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
once	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
usurper,	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
will	1
certainly	1
throw	1
itself	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
its	1
rightful	1
king,"	1
she	1
concluded,	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
amiable	1
to	1
the	1
royalist	1
emigrant.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
doubtful,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Monsieur	1
le	1
Vicomte	1
quite	1
rightly	1
supposes	1
that	1
matters	1
have	1
already	1
gone	1
too	1
far.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
regime."	1
	1
"From	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
heard,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
blushing	1
and	1
breaking	1
into	1
the	1
conversation,	1
"almost	1
all	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
has	1
already	1
gone	1
over	1
to	1
Bonaparte's	1
side."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
Buonapartists	1
who	1
say	1
that,"	1
replied	1
the	1
vicomte	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
"At	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
real	1
state	1
of	1
French	1
public	1
opinion."	1
	1
"Bonaparte	1
has	1
said	1
so,"	1
remarked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
was	1
aiming	1
his	1
remarks	1
at	1
him,	1
though	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"'I	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
glory,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
it,'"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence,	1
again	1
quoting	1
Napoleon's	1
words.	1
"'I	1
opened	1
my	1
antechambers	1
and	1
they	1
crowded	1
in.'	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
he	1
was	1
justified	1
in	1
saying	1
so."	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least,"	1
replied	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
"After	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
partial	1
ceased	1
to	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
hero.	1
If	1
to	1
some	1
people,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"he	1
ever	1
was	1
a	1
hero,	1
after	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
martyr	1
more	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
one	1
hero	1
less	1
on	1
earth."	1
	1
Before	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
smile	1
their	1
appreciation	1
of	1
the	1
vicomte's	1
epigram,	1
Pierre	1
again	1
broke	1
into	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
though	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
something	1
inappropriate,	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
stop	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien,"	1
declared	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
"was	1
a	1
political	1
necessity,	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
showed	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
by	1
not	1
fearing	1
to	1
take	1
on	1
himself	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
of	1
that	1
deed."	1
	1
"Dieu!	1
Mon	1
Dieu!"	1
muttered	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
a	1
terrified	1
whisper.	1
	1
"What,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre...	1
Do	1
you	1
consider	1
that	1
assassination	1
shows	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
smiling	1
and	1
drawing	1
her	1
work	1
nearer	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
exclaimed	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"Capital!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
English,	1
and	1
began	1
slapping	1
his	1
knee	1
with	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
solemnly	1
at	1
his	1
audience	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
continued.	1
	1
"I	1
say	1
so,"	1
he	1
continued	1
desperately,	1
"because	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
Revolution	1
leaving	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
anarchy,	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
alone	1
understood	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
quelled	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
good,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
short	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
one	1
man's	1
life."	1
	1
"Won't	1
you	1
come	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
table?"	1
suggested	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
But	1
Pierre	1
continued	1
his	1
speech	1
without	1
heeding	1
her.	1
	1
"No,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
eager,	1
"Napoleon	1
is	1
great	1
because	1
he	1
rose	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
suppressed	1
its	1
abuses,	1
preserved	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
it--equality	1
of	1
citizenship	1
and	1
freedom	1
of	1
speech	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
press--and	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
did	1
he	1
obtain	1
power."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
if	1
having	1
obtained	1
power,	1
without	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
commit	1
murder	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
rightful	1
king,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
man,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
	1
"He	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
that.	1
The	1
people	1
only	1
gave	1
him	1
power	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
rid	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
man.	1
The	1
Revolution	1
was	1
a	1
grand	1
thing!"	1
continued	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
betraying	1
by	1
this	1
desperate	1
and	1
provocative	1
proposition	1
his	1
extreme	1
youth	1
and	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
express	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"What?	1
Revolution	1
and	1
regicide	1
a	1
grand	1
thing?...	1
Well,	1
after	1
that...	1
But	1
won't	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
other	1
table?"	1
repeated	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"Rousseau's	1
Contrat	1
Social,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte	1
with	1
a	1
tolerant	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
regicide,	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
about	1
ideas."	1
	1
"Yes:	1
ideas	1
of	1
robbery,	1
murder,	1
and	1
regicide,"	1
again	1
interjected	1
an	1
ironical	1
voice.	1
	1
"Those	1
were	1
extremes,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
important.	1
What	1
is	1
important	1
are	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
man,	1
emancipation	1
from	1
prejudices,	1
and	1
equality	1
of	1
citizenship,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
ideas	1
Napoleon	1
has	1
retained	1
in	1
full	1
force."	1
	1
"Liberty	1
and	1
equality,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte	1
contemptuously,	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
last	1
deciding	1
seriously	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
this	1
youth	1
how	1
foolish	1
his	1
words	1
were,	1
"high-sounding	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
discredited.	1
Who	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
liberty	1
and	1
equality?	1
Even	1
our	1
Saviour	1
preached	1
liberty	1
and	1
equality.	1
Have	1
people	1
since	1
the	1
Revolution	1
become	1
happier?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary.	1
We	1
wanted	1
liberty,	1
but	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
destroyed	1
it."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
kept	1
looking	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
smile	1
from	1
Pierre	1
to	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
vicomte	1
to	1
their	1
hostess.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
outburst	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
despite	1
her	1
social	1
experience,	1
was	1
horror-struck.	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
Pierre's	1
sacrilegious	1
words	1
had	1
not	1
exasperated	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
and	1
had	1
convinced	1
herself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
stop	1
him,	1
she	1
rallied	1
her	1
forces	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
vicomte	1
in	1
a	1
vigorous	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
orator.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"how	1
do	1
you	1
explain	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
executing	1
a	1
duc--or	1
even	1
an	1
ordinary	1
man	1
who--is	1
innocent	1
and	1
untried?"	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
"to	1
ask	1
how	1
monsieur	1
explains	1
the	1
18th	1
Brumaire;	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
an	1
imposture?	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
swindle,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
man!"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
prisoners	1
he	1
killed	1
in	1
Africa?	1
That	1
was	1
horrible!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
shrugging	1
her	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
low	1
fellow,	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will,"	1
remarked	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whom	1
to	1
answer,	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
smiled.	1
His	1
smile	1
was	1
unlike	1
the	1
half-smile	1
of	1
other	1
people.	1
When	1
he	1
smiled,	1
his	1
grave,	1
even	1
rather	1
gloomy,	1
look	1
was	1
instantaneously	1
replaced	1
by	1
another-	1
-a	1
childlike,	1
kindly,	1
even	1
rather	1
silly	1
look,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
ask	1
forgiveness.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
who	1
was	1
meeting	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
this	1
young	1
Jacobin	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
terrible	1
as	1
his	1
words	1
suggested.	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
him	1
to	1
answer	1
you	1
all	1
at	1
once?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Besides,	1
in	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
a	1
statesman	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
distinguish	1
between	1
his	1
acts	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
person,	1
as	1
a	1
general,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
emperor.	1
So	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course!"	1
Pierre	1
chimed	1
in,	1
pleased	1
at	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
this	1
reinforcement.	1
	1
"One	1
must	1
admit,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"that	1
Napoleon	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
great	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
Arcola,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
at	1
Jaffa	1
where	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
plague-stricken;	1
but...	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
acts	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
justify."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
tone	1
down	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
remarks,	1
rose	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
started	1
up	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
everyone	1
to	1
attend,	1
and	1
asking	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
seated	1
began:	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
told	1
a	1
charming	1
Moscow	1
story	1
today	1
and	1
must	1
treat	1
you	1
to	1
it.	1
Excuse	1
me,	1
Vicomte--I	1
must	1
tell	1
it	1
in	1
Russian	1
or	1
the	1
point	1
will	1
be	1
lost...."	1
And	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
story	1
in	1
such	1
Russian	1
as	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
would	1
speak	1
after	1
spending	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
Russia.	1
Everyone	1
waited,	1
so	1
emphatically	1
and	1
eagerly	1
did	1
he	1
demand	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
story.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
in	1
Moscow	1
a	1
lady,	1
une	1
dame,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
stingy.	1
She	1
must	1
have	1
two	1
footmen	1
behind	1
her	1
carriage,	1
and	1
very	1
big	1
ones.	1
That	1
was	1
her	1
taste.	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
lady's	1
maid,	1
also	1
big.	1
She	1
said..."	1
	1
Here	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
paused,	1
evidently	1
collecting	1
his	1
ideas	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"She	1
said...	1
Oh	1
yes!	1
She	1
said,	1
'Girl,'	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
'put	1
on	1
a	1
livery,	1
get	1
up	1
behind	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
while	1
I	1
make	1
some	1
calls.'"	1
	1
Here	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
spluttered	1
and	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
long	1
before	1
his	1
audience,	1
which	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
unfavorable	1
to	1
the	1
narrator.	1
Several	1
persons,	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
did	1
however	1
smile.	1
	1
"She	1
went.	1
Suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
wind.	1
The	1
girl	1
lost	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
her	1
long	1
hair	1
came	1
down...."	1
Here	1
he	1
could	1
contain	1
himself	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
went	1
on,	1
between	1
gasps	1
of	1
laughter:	1
"And	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
knew...."	1
	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
anecdote	1
ended.	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
unintelligible	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
it,	1
or	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
Russian,	1
still	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
appreciated	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte's	1
social	1
tact	1
in	1
so	1
agreeably	1
ending	1
Pierre's	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
unamiable	1
outburst.	1
After	1
the	1
anecdote	1
the	1
conversation	1
broke	1
up	1
into	1
insignificant	1
small	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
next	1
balls,	1
about	1
theatricals,	1
and	1
who	1
would	1
meet	1
whom,	1
and	1
when	1
and	1
where.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Having	1
thanked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
for	1
her	1
charming	1
soiree,	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
leave.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
ungainly.	1
Stout,	1
about	1
the	1
average	1
height,	1
broad,	1
with	1
huge	1
red	1
hands;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
how	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
how	1
to	1
leave	1
one;	1
that	1
is,	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
before	1
going	1
away.	1
Besides	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
absent-	1
minded.	1
When	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
the	1
general's	1
three-cornered	1
hat,	1
and	1
held	1
it,	1
pulling	1
at	1
the	1
plume,	1
till	1
the	1
general	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
restore	1
it.	1
All	1
his	1
absent-mindedness	1
and	1
inability	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
room	1
and	1
converse	1
in	1
it	1
was,	1
however,	1
redeemed	1
by	1
his	1
kindly,	1
simple,	1
and	1
modest	1
expression.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
turned	1
toward	1
him	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
Christian	1
mildness	1
that	1
expressed	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
his	1
indiscretion,	1
nodded	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
but	1
I	1
also	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
change	1
your	1
opinions,	1
my	1
dear	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre."	1
	1
When	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
and	1
only	1
bowed,	1
but	1
again	1
everybody	1
saw	1
his	1
smile,	1
which	1
said	1
nothing,	1
unless	1
perhaps,	1
"Opinions	1
are	1
opinions,	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
capital,	1
good-natured	1
fellow	1
I	1
am."	1
And	1
everyone,	1
including	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
felt	1
this.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
and,	1
turning	1
his	1
shoulders	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
was	1
helping	1
him	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
cloak,	1
listened	1
indifferently	1
to	1
his	1
wife's	1
chatter	1
with	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
stood	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
pretty,	1
pregnant	1
princess,	1
and	1
stared	1
fixedly	1
at	1
her	1
through	1
his	1
eyeglass.	1
	1
"Go	1
in,	1
Annette,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
catch	1
cold,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
"It	1
is	1
settled,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
already	1
managed	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Lise	1
about	1
the	1
match	1
she	1
contemplated	1
between	1
Anatole	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
"I	1
rely	1
on	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
tone.	1
"Write	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
how	1
her	1
father	1
looks	1
at	1
the	1
matter.	1
Au	1
revoir!"--	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
hall.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
approached	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and,	1
bending	1
his	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her,	1
began	1
to	1
whisper	1
something.	1
	1
Two	1
footmen,	1
the	1
princess'	1
and	1
his	1
own,	1
stood	1
holding	1
a	1
shawl	1
and	1
a	1
cloak,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
finish.	1
They	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
sentences	1
which	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
meaningless,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
understanding	1
but	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
The	1
princess	1
as	1
usual	1
spoke	1
smilingly	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
a	1
laugh.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador's,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
"-so	1
dull-.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
delightful	1
evening,	1
has	1
it	1
not?	1
Delightful!"	1
	1
"They	1
say	1
the	1
ball	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
good,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess,	1
drawing	1
up	1
her	1
downy	1
little	1
lip.	1
"All	1
the	1
pretty	1
women	1
in	1
society	1
will	1
be	1
there."	1
	1
"Not	1
all,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
there;	1
not	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
smiling	1
joyfully;	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
shawl	1
from	1
the	1
footman,	1
whom	1
he	1
even	1
pushed	1
aside,	1
he	1
began	1
wrapping	1
it	1
round	1
the	1
princess.	1
Either	1
from	1
awkwardness	1
or	1
intentionally	1
(no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
which)	1
after	1
the	1
shawl	1
had	1
been	1
adjusted	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
arm	1
around	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
as	1
though	1
embracing	1
her.	1
	1
Still	1
smiling,	1
she	1
gracefully	1
moved	1
away,	1
turning	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
husband.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed,	1
so	1
weary	1
and	1
sleepy	1
did	1
he	1
seem.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
ready?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
wife,	1
looking	1
past	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
hurriedly	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
cloak,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion	1
reached	1
to	1
his	1
very	1
heels,	1
and,	1
stumbling	1
in	1
it,	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
following	1
the	1
princess,	1
whom	1
a	1
footman	1
was	1
helping	1
into	1
the	1
carriage.	1
	1
"Princesse,	1
au	1
revoir,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
stumbling	1
with	1
his	1
tongue	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
picking	1
up	1
her	1
dress,	1
was	1
taking	1
her	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
carriage,	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
adjusting	1
his	1
saber;	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
under	1
pretense	1
of	1
helping,	1
was	1
in	1
everyone's	1
way.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
Russian	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
disagreeable	1
tone	1
to	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
who	1
was	1
blocking	1
his	1
path.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
expecting	1
you,	1
Pierre,"	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
voice,	1
but	1
gently	1
and	1
affectionately.	1
	1
The	1
postilion	1
started,	1
the	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
rattled.	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
laughed	1
spasmodically	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
vicomte	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
home.	1
	1
"Well,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
having	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
"your	1
little	1
princess	1
is	1
very	1
nice,	1
very	1
nice	1
indeed,	1
quite	1
French,"	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
fingers.	1
Hippolyte	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
terrible	1
chap	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
innocent	1
airs,"	1
continued	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
"I	1
pity	1
the	1
poor	1
husband,	1
that	1
little	1
officer	1
who	1
gives	1
himself	1
the	1
airs	1
of	1
a	1
monarch."	1
	1
Hippolyte	1
spluttered	1
again,	1
and	1
amid	1
his	1
laughter	1
said,	1
"And	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
ladies	1
are	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
French?	1
One	1
has	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
them."	1
	1
Pierre	1
reaching	1
the	1
house	1
first	1
went	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
study	1
like	1
one	1
quite	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
immediately	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
took	1
from	1
the	1
shelf	1
the	1
first	1
book	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand	1
(it	1
was	1
Caesar's	1
Commentaries),	1
and	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
elbow,	1
began	1
reading	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
Mlle	1
Scherer?	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
ill	1
now,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
study,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hands.	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
his	1
whole	1
body,	1
making	1
the	1
sofa	1
creak.	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
eager	1
face	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"That	1
abbe	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
light....	1
In	1
my	1
opinion	1
perpetual	1
peace	1
is	1
possible	1
but--I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
express	1
it...	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
balance	1
of	1
political	1
power...."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
such	1
abstract	1
conversation.	1
	1
"One	1
can't	1
everywhere	1
say	1
all	1
one	1
thinks,	1
mon	1
cher.	1
Well,	1
have	1
you	1
at	1
last	1
decided	1
on	1
anything?	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
guardsman	1
or	1
a	1
diplomatist?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
after	1
a	1
momentary	1
silence.	1
	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
tucked	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
"Really,	1
I	1
don't	1
yet	1
know.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
either	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
must	1
decide	1
on	1
something!	1
Your	1
father	1
expects	1
it."	1
	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
ten	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
abroad	1
with	1
an	1
abbe	1
as	1
tutor,	1
and	1
had	1
remained	1
away	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
twenty.	1
When	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
his	1
father	1
dismissed	1
the	1
abbe	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
"Now	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
look	1
round,	1
and	1
choose	1
your	1
profession.	1
I	1
will	1
agree	1
to	1
anything.	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
money.	1
Write	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
you	1
in	1
everything."	1
Pierre	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
choosing	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
three	1
months,	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
decided	1
on	1
anything.	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
this	1
choice	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
speaking.	1
Pierre	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
Freemason,"	1
said	1
he,	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
abbe	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
that	1
evening.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
all	1
nonsense."	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
"let	1
us	1
talk	1
business.	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
not;	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
war	1
now	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
war	1
for	1
freedom	1
I	1
could	1
understand	1
it	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
army;	1
but	1
to	1
help	1
England	1
and	1
Austria	1
against	1
the	1
greatest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
not	1
right."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
only	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
childish	1
words.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
finds	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
in	1
fact	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
other	1
answer	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gave	1
to	1
this	1
naive	1
question.	1
	1
"If	1
no	1
one	1
fought	1
except	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
conviction,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wars,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
splendid,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
ironically.	1
	1
"Very	1
likely	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
splendid,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
about..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"What	1
for?	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
I	1
must.	1
Besides	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going..."	1
He	1
paused.	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
because	1
the	1
life	1
I	1
am	1
leading	1
here	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
me!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
The	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
woman's	1
dress	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shook	1
himself	1
as	1
if	1
waking	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
look	1
it	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
removed	1
his	1
feet	1
from	1
the	1
sofa.	1
The	1
princess	1
came	1
in.	1
She	1
had	1
changed	1
her	1
gown	1
for	1
a	1
house	1
dress	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
elegant	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose	1
and	1
politely	1
placed	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
it,"	1
she	1
began,	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
French,	1
settling	1
down	1
briskly	1
and	1
fussily	1
in	1
the	1
easy	1
chair,	1
"how	1
is	1
it	1
Annette	1
never	1
got	1
married?	1
How	1
stupid	1
you	1
men	1
all	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
married	1
her!	1
Excuse	1
me	1
for	1
saying	1
so,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
sense	1
about	1
women.	1
What	1
an	1
argumentative	1
fellow	1
you	1
are,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre!"	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
arguing	1
with	1
your	1
husband.	1
I	1
can't	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
war,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
addressing	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
so	1
commonly	1
shown	1
by	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
intercourse	1
with	1
young	1
women.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
started.	1
Evidently	1
Pierre's	1
words	1
touched	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
quick.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
tell	1
him!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it;	1
I	1
don't	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
understand	1
why	1
men	1
can't	1
live	1
without	1
wars.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
women	1
don't	1
want	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
don't	1
need	1
it?	1
Now	1
you	1
shall	1
judge	1
between	1
us.	1
I	1
always	1
tell	1
him:	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
Uncle's	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
a	1
most	1
brilliant	1
position.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
known,	1
so	1
much	1
appreciated	1
by	1
everyone.	1
The	1
other	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
Apraksins'	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
lady	1
asking,	1
'Is	1
that	1
the	1
famous	1
Prince	1
Andrew?'	1
I	1
did	1
indeed."	1
She	1
laughed.	1
"He	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
received	1
everywhere.	1
He	1
might	1
easily	1
become	1
aide-de-camp	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
Emperor	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
most	1
graciously.	1
Annette	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
it.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
and,	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
conversation,	1
gave	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"When	1
are	1
you	1
starting?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
going,	1
don't!	1
I	1
won't	1
hear	1
it	1
spoken	1
of,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
petulantly	1
playful	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
plainly	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
circle	1
of	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
member.	1
"Today	1
when	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
delightful	1
associations	1
must	1
be	1
broken	1
off...	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
know,	1
Andre..."	1
(she	1
looked	1
significantly	1
at	1
her	1
husband)	1
"I'm	1
afraid,	1
I'm	1
afraid!"	1
she	1
whispered,	1
and	1
a	1
shudder	1
ran	1
down	1
her	1
back.	1
	1
Her	1
husband	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
someone	1
besides	1
Pierre	1
and	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
frigid	1
politeness.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
afraid	1
of,	1
Lise?	1
I	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"There,	1
what	1
egotists	1
men	1
all	1
are:	1
all,	1
all	1
egotists!	1
Just	1
for	1
a	1
whim	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
goodness	1
only	1
knows	1
why,	1
he	1
leaves	1
me	1
and	1
locks	1
me	1
up	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"With	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
sister,	1
remember,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gently.	1
	1
"Alone	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
without	1
my	1
friends....	1
And	1
he	1
expects	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
afraid."	1
	1
Her	1
tone	1
was	1
now	1
querulous	1
and	1
her	1
lip	1
drawn	1
up,	1
giving	1
her	1
not	1
a	1
joyful,	1
but	1
an	1
animal,	1
squirrel-like	1
expression.	1
She	1
paused	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
indecorous	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
pregnancy	1
before	1
Pierre,	1
though	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
lay	1
in	1
that.	1
	1
"I	1
still	1
can't	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
afraid	1
of,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
slowly,	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
blushed,	1
and	1
raised	1
her	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair.	1
	1
"No,	1
Andrew,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
you	1
have	1
changed.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
you	1
have..."	1
	1
"Your	1
doctor	1
tells	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
earlier,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"You	1
had	1
better	1
go."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
her	1
short	1
downy	1
lip	1
quivered.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
with	1
naive	1
surprise,	1
now	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
her,	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
rise	1
too,	1
but	1
changed	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
I	1
mind	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre	1
being	1
here?"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
suddenly,	1
her	1
pretty	1
face	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
distorted	1
by	1
a	1
tearful	1
grimace.	1
"I	1
have	1
long	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you,	1
Andrew,	1
why	1
you	1
have	1
changed	1
so	1
to	1
me?	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
you?	1
You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
for	1
me.	1
Why	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Lise!"	1
was	1
all	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said.	1
But	1
that	1
one	1
word	1
expressed	1
an	1
entreaty,	1
a	1
threat,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
conviction	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
regret	1
her	1
words.	1
But	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
hurriedly:	1
	1
"You	1
treat	1
me	1
like	1
an	1
invalid	1
or	1
a	1
child.	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all!	1
Did	1
you	1
behave	1
like	1
that	1
six	1
months	1
ago?"	1
	1
"Lise,	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
desist,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
still	1
more	1
emphatically.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
agitated	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
rose	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
princess.	1
He	1
seemed	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
himself.	1
	1
"Calm	1
yourself,	1
Princess!	1
It	1
seems	1
so	1
to	1
you	1
because...	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
myself	1
have	1
experienced...	1
and	1
so...	1
because...	1
No,	1
excuse	1
me!	1
An	1
outsider	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
here...	1
No,	1
don't	1
distress	1
yourself...	1
Good-	1
bye!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
"No,	1
wait,	1
Pierre!	1
The	1
princess	1
is	1
too	1
kind	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
spending	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
thinks	1
only	1
of	1
himself,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
princess	1
without	1
restraining	1
her	1
angry	1
tears.	1
	1
"Lise!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
dryly,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
pitch	1
which	1
indicates	1
that	1
patience	1
is	1
exhausted.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
angry,	1
squirrel-like	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
princess'	1
pretty	1
face	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
winning	1
and	1
piteous	1
look	1
of	1
fear.	1
Her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
askance	1
at	1
her	1
husband's	1
face,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
assumed	1
the	1
timid,	1
deprecating	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
dog	1
when	1
it	1
rapidly	1
but	1
feebly	1
wags	1
its	1
drooping	1
tail.	1
	1
"Mon	1
Dieu,	1
mon	1
Dieu!"	1
she	1
muttered,	1
and	1
lifting	1
her	1
dress	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
forehead.	1
	1
"Good	1
night,	1
Lise,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
and	1
courteously	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
a	1
stranger.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
friends	1
were	1
silent.	1
Neither	1
cared	1
to	1
begin	1
talking.	1
Pierre	1
continually	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew;	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
hand.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
have	1
supper,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
elegant,	1
newly	1
decorated,	1
and	1
luxurious	1
dining	1
room.	1
Everything	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
napkins	1
to	1
the	1
silver,	1
china,	1
and	1
glass	1
bore	1
that	1
imprint	1
of	1
newness	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
households	1
of	1
the	1
newly	1
married.	1
Halfway	1
through	1
supper	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
such	1
as	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
began	1
to	1
talk--as	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
long	1
had	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
suddenly	1
determines	1
to	1
speak	1
out.	1
	1
"Never,	1
never	1
marry,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!	1
That's	1
my	1
advice:	1
never	1
marry	1
till	1
you	1
can	1
say	1
to	1
yourself	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
you	1
are	1
capable	1
of,	1
and	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
your	1
choice	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
plainly	1
as	1
she	1
is,	1
or	1
else	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
cruel	1
and	1
irrevocable	1
mistake.	1
Marry	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
old	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
nothing--or	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
noble	1
in	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
lost.	1
It	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
wasted	1
on	1
trifles.	1
Yes!	1
Yes!	1
Yes!	1
Don't	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
surprise.	1
If	1
you	1
marry	1
expecting	1
anything	1
from	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
future,	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
that	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
is	1
ended,	1
all	1
is	1
closed	1
except	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
ranged	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
court	1
lackey	1
and	1
an	1
idiot!...	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
good?..."	1
and	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
which	1
made	1
his	1
face	1
seem	1
different	1
and	1
the	1
good-natured	1
expression	1
still	1
more	1
apparent,	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
amazement.	1
	1
"My	1
wife,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"is	1
an	1
excellent	1
woman,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
women	1
with	1
whom	1
a	1
man's	1
honor	1
is	1
safe;	1
but,	1
O	1
God,	1
what	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
give	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
unmarried!	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
mention	1
this,	1
because	1
I	1
like	1
you."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
ever	1
like	1
that	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
had	1
lolled	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
easy	1
chairs	1
and	1
with	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
had	1
uttered	1
French	1
phrases	1
between	1
his	1
teeth.	1
Every	1
muscle	1
of	1
his	1
thin	1
face	1
was	1
now	1
quivering	1
with	1
nervous	1
excitement;	1
his	1
eyes,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
seemed	1
extinguished,	1
now	1
flashed	1
with	1
brilliant	1
light.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
lifeless	1
he	1
seemed	1
at	1
ordinary	1
times,	1
the	1
more	1
impassioned	1
he	1
became	1
in	1
these	1
moments	1
of	1
almost	1
morbid	1
irritation.	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
understand	1
why	1
I	1
say	1
this,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
life.	1
You	1
talk	1
of	1
Bonaparte	1
and	1
his	1
career,"	1
said	1
he	1
(though	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
mentioned	1
Bonaparte),	1
"but	1
Bonaparte	1
when	1
he	1
worked	1
went	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
toward	1
his	1
goal.	1
He	1
was	1
free,	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
aim	1
to	1
consider,	1
and	1
he	1
reached	1
it.	1
But	1
tie	1
yourself	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
chained	1
convict,	1
you	1
lose	1
all	1
freedom!	1
And	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
strength	1
merely	1
weighs	1
you	1
down	1
and	1
torments	1
you	1
with	1
regret.	1
Drawing	1
rooms,	1
gossip,	1
balls,	1
vanity,	1
and	1
triviality--these	1
are	1
the	1
enchanted	1
circle	1
I	1
cannot	1
escape	1
from.	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
the	1
greatest	1
war	1
there	1
ever	1
was,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
and	1
am	1
fit	1
for	1
nothing.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
amiable	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
caustic	1
wit,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"and	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
they	1
listen	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
that	1
stupid	1
set	1
without	1
whom	1
my	1
wife	1
cannot	1
exist,	1
and	1
those	1
women...	1
If	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
those	1
society	1
women	1
are,	1
and	1
women	1
in	1
general!	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
right.	1
Selfish,	1
vain,	1
stupid,	1
trivial	1
in	1
everything--that's	1
what	1
women	1
are	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
true	1
colors!	1
When	1
you	1
meet	1
them	1
in	1
society	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
in	1
them,	1
but	1
there's	1
nothing,	1
nothing,	1
nothing!	1
No,	1
don't	1
marry,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
don't	1
marry!"	1
concluded	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
funny	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"that	1
you,	1
you	1
should	1
consider	1
yourself	1
incapable	1
and	1
your	1
life	1
a	1
spoiled	1
life.	1
You	1
have	1
everything	1
before	1
you,	1
everything.	1
And	1
you..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
his	1
sentence,	1
but	1
his	1
tone	1
showed	1
how	1
highly	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
he	1
talk	1
like	1
that?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
considered	1
his	1
friend	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
perfection	1
because	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
possessed	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
just	1
the	1
very	1
qualities	1
Pierre	1
lacked,	1
and	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
best	1
described	1
as	1
strength	1
of	1
will.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
always	1
astonished	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
calm	1
manner	1
of	1
treating	1
everybody,	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
memory,	1
his	1
extensive	1
reading	1
(he	1
had	1
read	1
everything,	1
knew	1
everything,	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
opinion	1
about	1
everything),	1
but	1
above	1
all	1
at	1
his	1
capacity	1
for	1
work	1
and	1
study.	1
And	1
if	1
Pierre	1
was	1
often	1
struck	1
by	1
Andrew's	1
lack	1
of	1
capacity	1
for	1
philosophical	1
meditation	1
(to	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
particularly	1
addicted),	1
he	1
regarded	1
even	1
this	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
defect	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
strength.	1
	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
best,	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
simplest	1
relations	1
of	1
life,	1
praise	1
and	1
commendation	1
are	1
essential,	1
just	1
as	1
grease	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
wheels	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
run	1
smoothly.	1
	1
"My	1
part	1
is	1
played	1
out,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"What's	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking	1
about	1
me?	1
Let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
you,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
silence,	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
reassuring	1
thoughts.	1
	1
That	1
smile	1
was	1
immediately	1
reflected	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
face.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
me?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
his	1
face	1
relaxing	1
into	1
a	1
careless,	1
merry	1
smile.	1
"What	1
am	1
I?	1
An	1
illegitimate	1
son!"	1
He	1
suddenly	1
blushed	1
crimson,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
to	1
say	1
this.	1
"Without	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
without	1
means...	1
And	1
it	1
really..."	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
"it	1
really"	1
was.	1
"For	1
the	1
present	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
and	1
am	1
all	1
right.	1
Only	1
I	1
haven't	1
the	1
least	1
idea	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do;	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
seriously."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
kindly	1
at	1
him,	1
yet	1
his	1
glance--friendly	1
and	1
affectionate	1
as	1
it	1
was--expressed	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
superiority.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
you,	1
especially	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
one	1
live	1
man	1
among	1
our	1
whole	1
set.	1
Yes,	1
you're	1
all	1
right!	1
Choose	1
what	1
you	1
will;	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
You'll	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
anywhere.	1
But	1
look	1
here:	1
give	1
up	1
visiting	1
those	1
Kuragins	1
and	1
leading	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
life.	1
It	1
suits	1
you	1
so	1
badly--all	1
this	1
debauchery,	1
dissipation,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
have,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"Women,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
women!"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Women	1
who	1
are	1
comme	1
il	1
faut,	1
that's	1
a	1
different	1
matter;	1
but	1
the	1
Kuragins'	1
set	1
of	1
women,	1
'women	1
and	1
wine'	1
I	1
don't	1
understand!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
staying	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin's	1
and	1
sharing	1
the	1
dissipated	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
Anatole,	1
the	1
son	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
planning	1
to	1
reform	1
by	1
marrying	1
him	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
sister.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
as	1
if	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
happy	1
thought,	1
"seriously,	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
it....	1
Leading	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
I	1
can't	1
decide	1
or	1
think	1
properly	1
about	1
anything.	1
One's	1
head	1
aches,	1
and	1
one	1
spends	1
all	1
one's	1
money.	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
for	1
tonight,	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
go."	1
	1
"You	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
not	1
to	1
go?"	1
	1
"On	1
my	1
honor!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
o'clock	1
when	1
Pierre	1
left	1
his	1
friend.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cloudless,	1
northern,	1
summer	1
night.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
an	1
open	1
cab	1
intending	1
to	1
drive	1
straight	1
home.	1
But	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
drew	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
night.	1
It	1
was	1
light	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
deserted	1
street	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
more	1
like	1
morning	1
or	1
evening	1
than	1
night.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
that	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
was	1
expecting	1
the	1
usual	1
set	1
for	1
cards	1
that	1
evening,	1
after	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
generally	1
a	1
drinking	1
bout,	1
finishing	1
with	1
visits	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
Pierre	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Kuragin's,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
immediately	1
recalled	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
there.	1
Then,	1
as	1
happens	1
to	1
people	1
of	1
weak	1
character,	1
he	1
desired	1
so	1
passionately	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
enjoy	1
that	1
dissipation	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
go.	1
The	1
thought	1
immediately	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
account,	1
because	1
before	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
promised	1
Prince	1
Anatole	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
gathering;	1
"besides,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"all	1
such	1
'words	1
of	1
honor'	1
are	1
conventional	1
things	1
with	1
no	1
definite	1
meaning,	1
especially	1
if	1
one	1
considers	1
that	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
one	1
may	1
be	1
dead,	1
or	1
something	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
honor	1
and	1
dishonor	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
same!"	1
Pierre	1
often	1
indulged	1
in	1
reflections	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
nullifying	1
all	1
his	1
decisions	1
and	1
intentions.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
Kuragin's.	1
	1
Reaching	1
the	1
large	1
house	1
near	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards'	1
barracks,	1
in	1
which	1
Anatole	1
lived,	1
Pierre	1
entered	1
the	1
lighted	1
porch,	1
ascended	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom;	1
empty	1
bottles,	1
cloaks,	1
and	1
overshoes	1
were	1
lying	1
about;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
alcohol,	1
and	1
sounds	1
of	1
voices	1
and	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
	1
Cards	1
and	1
supper	1
were	1
over,	1
but	1
the	1
visitors	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed.	1
Pierre	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
first	1
room,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
supper.	1
A	1
footman,	1
thinking	1
no	1
one	1
saw	1
him,	1
was	1
drinking	1
on	1
the	1
sly	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
glasses.	1
From	1
the	1
third	1
room	1
came	1
sounds	1
of	1
laughter,	1
the	1
shouting	1
of	1
familiar	1
voices,	1
the	1
growling	1
of	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
general	1
commotion.	1
Some	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
young	1
men	1
were	1
crowding	1
anxiously	1
round	1
an	1
open	1
window.	1
Three	1
others	1
were	1
romping	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
bear,	1
one	1
pulling	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
chain	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
a	1
hundred	1
on	1
Stevens!"	1
shouted	1
one.	1
	1
"Mind,	1
no	1
holding	1
on!"	1
cried	1
another.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
on	1
Dolokhov!"	1
cried	1
a	1
third.	1
"Kuragin,	1
you	1
part	1
our	1
hands."	1
	1
"There,	1
leave	1
Bruin	1
alone;	1
here's	1
a	1
bet	1
on."	1
	1
"At	1
one	1
draught,	1
or	1
he	1
loses!"	1
shouted	1
a	1
fourth.	1
	1
"Jacob,	1
bring	1
a	1
bottle!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
host,	1
a	1
tall,	1
handsome	1
fellow	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
group,	1
without	1
a	1
coat,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
fine	1
linen	1
shirt	1
unfastened	1
in	1
front.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
you	1
fellows....	1
Here	1
is	1
Petya!	1
Good	1
man!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
addressing	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Another	1
voice,	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
with	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
particularly	1
striking	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
drunken	1
voices	1
by	1
its	1
sober	1
ring,	1
cried	1
from	1
the	1
window:	1
"Come	1
here;	1
part	1
the	1
bets!"	1
This	1
was	1
Dolokhov,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment,	1
a	1
notorious	1
gambler	1
and	1
duelist,	1
who	1
was	1
living	1
with	1
Anatole.	1
Pierre	1
smiled,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
merrily.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
What's	1
it	1
all	1
about?"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
drunk	1
yet!	1
A	1
bottle	1
here,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
taking	1
a	1
glass	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"First	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
must	1
drink!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
drank	1
one	1
glass	1
after	1
another,	1
looking	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
at	1
the	1
tipsy	1
guests	1
who	1
were	1
again	1
crowding	1
round	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
their	1
chatter.	1
Anatole	1
kept	1
on	1
refilling	1
Pierre's	1
glass	1
while	1
explaining	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
betting	1
with	1
Stevens,	1
an	1
English	1
naval	1
officer,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
ledge	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
floor	1
window	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
hanging	1
out.	1
	1
"Go	1
on,	1
you	1
must	1
drink	1
it	1
all,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
giving	1
Pierre	1
the	1
last	1
glass,	1
"or	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
go!"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
won't,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
pushing	1
Anatole	1
aside,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
Englishman's	1
hand	1
and	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
repeating	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
bet,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
particularly	1
to	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
of	1
medium	1
height,	1
with	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
light-blue	1
eyes.	1
He	1
was	1
about	1
twenty-five.	1
Like	1
all	1
infantry	1
officers	1
he	1
wore	1
no	1
mustache,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
mouth,	1
the	1
most	1
striking	1
feature	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
was	1
clearly	1
seen.	1
The	1
lines	1
of	1
that	1
mouth	1
were	1
remarkably	1
finely	1
curved.	1
The	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
lip	1
formed	1
a	1
sharp	1
wedge	1
and	1
closed	1
firmly	1
on	1
the	1
firm	1
lower	1
one,	1
and	1
something	1
like	1
two	1
distinct	1
smiles	1
played	1
continually	1
round	1
the	1
two	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
mouth;	1
this,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
resolute,	1
insolent	1
intelligence	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
his	1
face.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
small	1
means	1
and	1
no	1
connections.	1
Yet,	1
though	1
Anatole	1
spent	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
rubles,	1
Dolokhov	1
lived	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
placed	1
himself	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
footing	1
that	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
them,	1
including	1
Anatole	1
himself,	1
respected	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
did	1
Anatole.	1
Dolokhov	1
could	1
play	1
all	1
games	1
and	1
nearly	1
always	1
won.	1
However	1
much	1
he	1
drank,	1
he	1
never	1
lost	1
his	1
clearheadedness.	1
Both	1
Kuragin	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
notorious	1
among	1
the	1
rakes	1
and	1
scapegraces	1
of	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
The	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
was	1
brought.	1
The	1
window	1
frame	1
which	1
prevented	1
anyone	1
from	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
sill	1
was	1
being	1
forced	1
out	1
by	1
two	1
footmen,	1
who	1
were	1
evidently	1
flurried	1
and	1
intimidated	1
by	1
the	1
directions	1
and	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
around.	1
	1
Anatole	1
with	1
his	1
swaggering	1
air	1
strode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
smash	1
something.	1
Pushing	1
away	1
the	1
footmen	1
he	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
frame,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
it.	1
He	1
smashed	1
a	1
pane.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
try,	1
Hercules,"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Pierre	1
seized	1
the	1
crossbeam,	1
tugged,	1
and	1
wrenched	1
the	1
oak	1
frame	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
crash.	1
	1
"Take	1
it	1
right	1
out,	1
or	1
they'll	1
think	1
I'm	1
holding	1
on,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
Englishman	1
bragging?...	1
Eh?	1
Is	1
it	1
all	1
right?"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
	1
"First-rate,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
at	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
window,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sky,	1
the	1
dawn	1
merging	1
with	1
the	1
afterglow	1
of	1
sunset,	1
was	1
visible.	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
the	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
jumped	1
onto	1
the	1
window	1
sill.	1
"Listen!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
standing	1
there	1
and	1
addressing	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
fifty	1
imperials"--he	1
spoke	1
French	1
that	1
the	1
Englishman	1
might	1
understand	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
it	1
very	1
well--"I	1
bet	1
fifty	1
imperials...	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
hundred?"	1
added	1
he,	1
addressing	1
the	1
Englishman.	1
	1
"No,	1
fifty,"	1
replied	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
"All	1
right.	1
Fifty	1
imperials...	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
drink	1
a	1
whole	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
without	1
taking	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
mouth,	1
sitting	1
outside	1
the	1
window	1
on	1
this	1
spot"	1
(he	1
stooped	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
sloping	1
ledge	1
outside	1
the	1
window)	1
"and	1
without	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
anything.	1
Is	1
that	1
right?"	1
	1
"Quite	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman.	1
	1
Anatole	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Englishman	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
him--the	1
Englishman	1
was	1
short--began	1
repeating	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
wager	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
English.	1
	1
"Wait!"	1
cried	1
Dolokhov,	1
hammering	1
with	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
to	1
attract	1
attention.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
Kuragin.	1
Listen!	1
If	1
anyone	1
else	1
does	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
him	1
a	1
hundred	1
imperials.	1
Do	1
you	1
understand?"	1
	1
The	1
Englishman	1
nodded,	1
but	1
gave	1
no	1
indication	1
whether	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
accept	1
this	1
challenge	1
or	1
not.	1
Anatole	1
did	1
not	1
release	1
him,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
kept	1
nodding	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
understood,	1
Anatole	1
went	1
on	1
translating	1
Dolokhov's	1
words	1
into	1
English.	1
A	1
thin	1
young	1
lad,	1
an	1
hussar	1
of	1
the	1
Life	1
Guards,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
losing	1
that	1
evening,	1
climbed	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
leaned	1
over,	1
and	1
looked	1
down.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
pavement.	1
	1
"Shut	1
up!"	1
cried	1
Dolokhov,	1
pushing	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
window.	1
The	1
lad	1
jumped	1
awkwardly	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
tripping	1
over	1
his	1
spurs.	1
	1
Placing	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
reach	1
it	1
easily,	1
Dolokhov	1
climbed	1
carefully	1
and	1
slowly	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
lowered	1
his	1
legs.	1
Pressing	1
against	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
he	1
adjusted	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
seat,	1
lowered	1
his	1
hands,	1
moved	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
bottle.	1
Anatole	1
brought	1
two	1
candles	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
quite	1
light.	1
Dolokhov's	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
shirt,	1
and	1
his	1
curly	1
head,	1
were	1
lit	1
up	1
from	1
both	1
sides.	1
Everyone	1
crowded	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
the	1
Englishman	1
in	1
front.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
smiling	1
but	1
silent.	1
One	1
man,	1
older	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
present,	1
suddenly	1
pushed	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
and	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
seize	1
hold	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
shirt.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
this	1
is	1
folly!	1
He'll	1
be	1
killed,"	1
said	1
this	1
more	1
sensible	1
man.	1
	1
Anatole	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"Don't	1
touch	1
him!	1
You'll	1
startle	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
he'll	1
be	1
killed.	1
Eh?...	1
What	1
then?...	1
Eh?"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
turned	1
round	1
and,	1
again	1
holding	1
on	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
arranged	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
seat.	1
	1
"If	1
anyone	1
comes	1
meddling	1
again,"	1
said	1
he,	1
emitting	1
the	1
words	1
separately	1
through	1
his	1
thin	1
compressed	1
lips,	1
"I	1
will	1
throw	1
him	1
down	1
there.	1
Now	1
then!"	1
	1
Saying	1
this	1
he	1
again	1
turned	1
round,	1
dropped	1
his	1
hands,	1
took	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
lifted	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
free	1
hand	1
to	1
balance	1
himself.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
footmen	1
who	1
had	1
stooped	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
some	1
broken	1
glass	1
remained	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
from	1
Dolokhov's	1
back.	1
Anatole	1
stood	1
erect	1
with	1
staring	1
eyes.	1
The	1
Englishman	1
looked	1
on	1
sideways,	1
pursing	1
up	1
his	1
lips.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
wished	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
affair	1
ran	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall.	1
Pierre	1
hid	1
his	1
face,	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
forgot	1
to	1
fade	1
though	1
his	1
features	1
now	1
expressed	1
horror	1
and	1
fear.	1
All	1
were	1
still.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Dolokhov	1
still	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position,	1
only	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
thrown	1
further	1
back	1
till	1
his	1
curly	1
hair	1
touched	1
his	1
shirt	1
collar,	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
holding	1
the	1
bottle	1
was	1
lifted	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
and	1
trembled	1
with	1
the	1
effort.	1
The	1
bottle	1
was	1
emptying	1
perceptibly	1
and	1
rising	1
still	1
higher	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
tilting	1
yet	1
further	1
back.	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
so	1
long?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
had	1
elapsed.	1
Suddenly	1
Dolokhov	1
made	1
a	1
backward	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
spine,	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
trembled	1
nervously;	1
this	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
cause	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
to	1
slip	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sloping	1
ledge.	1
As	1
he	1
began	1
slipping	1
down,	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
arm	1
wavered	1
still	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
strain.	1
One	1
hand	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
clutch	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
but	1
refrained	1
from	1
touching	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
again	1
covered	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
open	1
them	1
again.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
stir	1
all	1
around.	1
He	1
looked	1
up:	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
but	1
radiant	1
face.	1
	1
"It's	1
empty."	1
	1
He	1
threw	1
the	1
bottle	1
to	1
the	1
Englishman,	1
who	1
caught	1
it	1
neatly.	1
Dolokhov	1
jumped	1
down.	1
He	1
smelt	1
strongly	1
of	1
rum.	1
	1
"Well	1
done!...	1
Fine	1
fellow!...	1
There's	1
a	1
bet	1
for	1
you!...	1
Devil	1
take	1
you!"	1
came	1
from	1
different	1
sides.	1
	1
The	1
Englishman	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
began	1
counting	1
out	1
the	1
money.	1
Dolokhov	1
stood	1
frowning	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
speak.	1
Pierre	1
jumped	1
upon	1
the	1
window	1
sill.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
who	1
wishes	1
to	1
bet	1
with	1
me?	1
I'll	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
thing!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
cried.	1
"Even	1
without	1
a	1
bet,	1
there!	1
Tell	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
bottle.	1
I'll	1
do	1
it....	1
Bring	1
a	1
bottle!"	1
	1
"Let	1
him	1
do	1
it,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"What	1
next?	1
Have	1
you	1
gone	1
mad?...	1
No	1
one	1
would	1
let	1
you!...	1
Why,	1
you	1
go	1
giddy	1
even	1
on	1
a	1
staircase,"	1
exclaimed	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"I'll	1
drink	1
it!	1
Let's	1
have	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum!"	1
shouted	1
Pierre,	1
banging	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
determined	1
and	1
drunken	1
gesture	1
and	1
preparing	1
to	1
climb	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
They	1
seized	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
arms;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
everyone	1
who	1
touched	1
him	1
was	1
sent	1
flying.	1
	1
"No,	1
you'll	1
never	1
manage	1
him	1
that	1
way,"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
I'll	1
get	1
round	1
him....	1
Listen!	1
I'll	1
take	1
your	1
bet	1
tomorrow,	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
going	1
to	1
----'s."	1
	1
"Come	1
on	1
then,"	1
cried	1
Pierre.	1
"Come	1
on!...	1
And	1
we'll	1
take	1
Bruin	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
bear,	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
lifted	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
began	1
dancing	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
kept	1
the	1
promise	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
her	1
only	1
son	1
Boris	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
soiree.	1
The	1
matter	1
was	1
mentioned	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
an	1
exception	1
made,	1
and	1
Boris	1
transferred	1
into	1
the	1
regiment	1
of	1
Semenov	1
Guards	1
with	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
cornet.	1
He	1
received,	1
however,	1
no	1
appointment	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff	1
despite	1
all	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
endeavors	1
and	1
entreaties.	1
Soon	1
after	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
rich	1
relations,	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
stayed	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
where	1
her	1
darling	1
Bory,	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
entered	1
a	1
regiment	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
was	1
being	1
at	1
once	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards	1
as	1
a	1
cornet,	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
lived	1
for	1
years	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
The	1
Guards	1
had	1
already	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
August,	1
and	1
her	1
son,	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
his	1
equipment,	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
to	1
Radzivilov.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
St.	1
Natalia's	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
day	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs--the	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
youngest	1
daughter--both	1
named	1
Nataly.	1
Ever	1
since	1
the	1
morning,	1
carriages	1
with	1
six	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
coming	1
and	1
going	1
continually,	1
bringing	1
visitors	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
Rostova's	1
big	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Povarskaya,	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
countess	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
handsome	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
with	1
the	1
visitors	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
congratulate,	1
and	1
who	1
constantly	1
succeeded	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
relays.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
about	1
forty-five,	1
with	1
a	1
thin	1
Oriental	1
type	1
of	1
face,	1
evidently	1
worn	1
out	1
with	1
childbearing--she	1
had	1
had	1
twelve.	1
A	1
languor	1
of	1
motion	1
and	1
speech,	1
resulting	1
from	1
weakness,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
distinguished	1
air	1
which	1
inspired	1
respect.	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
Drubetskaya,	1
who	1
as	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
was	1
also	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
helped	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
entertain	1
the	1
visitors.	1
The	1
young	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms,	1
not	1
considering	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
receiving	1
the	1
visitors.	1
The	1
count	1
met	1
the	1
guests	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
off,	1
inviting	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very,	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
or	1
"ma	1
chere"--he	1
called	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
variation	1
in	1
his	1
tone,	1
"my	1
dear,"	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
above	1
or	1
below	1
him	1
in	1
rank--"I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
two	1
dear	1
ones	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
we	1
are	1
keeping.	1
But	1
mind	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
offended,	1
ma	1
chere!	1
On	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
come,	1
mon	1
cher!"	1
These	1
words	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception	1
or	1
variation,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
full,	1
cheerful,	1
clean-shaven	1
face,	1
the	1
same	1
firm	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
quick,	1
repeated	1
bows.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
visitor	1
off	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
toward	1
him	1
or	1
her,	1
and	1
jauntily	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
enjoys	1
life	1
and	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
live,	1
he	1
swayed	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
with	1
dignity,	1
offered	1
surmises	1
about	1
the	1
weather,	1
or	1
touched	1
on	1
questions	1
of	1
health,	1
sometimes	1
in	1
Russian	1
and	1
sometimes	1
in	1
very	1
bad	1
but	1
self-confident	1
French;	1
then	1
again,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
weary	1
but	1
unflinching	1
in	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
duty,	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
visitors	1
off	1
and,	1
stroking	1
his	1
scanty	1
gray	1
hairs	1
over	1
his	1
bald	1
patch,	1
also	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Sometimes	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
anteroom	1
he	1
would	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
conservatory	1
and	1
pantry	1
into	1
the	1
large	1
marble	1
dining	1
hall,	1
where	1
tables	1
were	1
being	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
eighty	1
people;	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
footmen,	1
who	1
were	1
bringing	1
in	1
silver	1
and	1
china,	1
moving	1
tables,	1
and	1
unfolding	1
damask	1
table	1
linen,	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
Dmitri	1
Vasilevich,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
and	1
the	1
manager	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
affairs,	1
and	1
while	1
looking	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
enormous	1
table	1
would	1
say:	1
"Well,	1
Dmitri,	1
you'll	1
see	1
that	1
things	1
are	1
all	1
as	1
they	1
should	1
be?	1
That's	1
right!	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
serving,	1
that's	1
it."	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
complacent	1
sigh	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Lvovna	1
Karagina	1
and	1
her	1
daughter!"	1
announced	1
the	1
countess'	1
gigantic	1
footman	1
in	1
his	1
bass	1
voice,	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
countess	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
pinch	1
from	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
her	1
husband's	1
portrait	1
on	1
it.	1
	1
"I'm	1
quite	1
worn	1
out	1
by	1
these	1
callers.	1
However,	1
I'll	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
no	1
more.	1
She	1
is	1
so	1
affected.	1
Ask	1
her	1
in,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
in	1
a	1
sad	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
saying:	1
"Very	1
well,	1
finish	1
me	1
off."	1
	1
A	1
tall,	1
stout,	1
and	1
proud-looking	1
woman,	1
with	1
a	1
round-faced	1
smiling	1
daughter,	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
their	1
dresses	1
rustling.	1
	1
"Dear	1
Countess,	1
what	1
an	1
age...	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
laid	1
up,	1
poor	1
child...	1
at	1
the	1
Razumovski's	1
ball...	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina...	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
delighted..."	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
animated	1
feminine	1
voices,	1
interrupting	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
dresses	1
and	1
the	1
scraping	1
of	1
chairs.	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
conversations	1
began	1
which	1
last	1
out	1
until,	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
pause,	1
the	1
guests	1
rise	1
with	1
a	1
rustle	1
of	1
dresses	1
and	1
say,	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
delighted...	1
Mamma's	1
health...	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina..."	1
and	1
then,	1
again	1
rustling,	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
put	1
on	1
cloaks	1
or	1
mantles,	1
and	1
drive	1
away.	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
chief	1
topic	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
celebrated	1
beau	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
day,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
about	1
his	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
Pierre,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
behaved	1
so	1
improperly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
count,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"He	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
bad	1
health,	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
vexation	1
about	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
kill	1
him!"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
that?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
visitor	1
alluded	1
to,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
about	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
distress	1
some	1
fifteen	1
times.	1
	1
"That's	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
a	1
modern	1
education,"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"It	1
seems	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
abroad	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
liked,	1
now	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
hear	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
doing	1
such	1
terrible	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
expelled	1
by	1
the	1
police."	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
say	1
so!"	1
replied	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"He	1
chose	1
his	1
friends	1
badly,"	1
interposed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son,	1
he,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
Dolokhov	1
have,	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
what!	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
it.	1
Dolokhov	1
has	1
been	1
degraded	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
Bezukhov's	1
son	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin's	1
father	1
managed	1
somehow	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
son's	1
affair	1
hushed	1
up,	1
but	1
even	1
he	1
was	1
ordered	1
out	1
of	1
Petersburg."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
up	1
to?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
regular	1
brigands,	1
especially	1
Dolokhov,"	1
replied	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Marya	1
Ivanovna	1
Dolokhova,	1
such	1
a	1
worthy	1
woman,	1
but	1
there,	1
just	1
fancy!	1
Those	1
three	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
bear	1
somewhere,	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
carriage,	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
visit	1
some	1
actresses!	1
The	1
police	1
tried	1
to	1
interfere,	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
do?	1
They	1
tied	1
a	1
policeman	1
and	1
the	1
bear	1
back	1
to	1
back	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
bear	1
into	1
the	1
Moyka	1
Canal.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
bear	1
swimming	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
policeman	1
on	1
his	1
back!"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
nice	1
figure	1
the	1
policeman	1
must	1
have	1
cut,	1
my	1
dear!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
count,	1
dying	1
with	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
dreadful!	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
laugh	1
at	1
it,	1
Count?"	1
	1
Yet	1
the	1
ladies	1
themselves	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
rescue	1
the	1
poor	1
man,"	1
continued	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"And	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov's	1
son	1
who	1
amuses	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
sensible	1
manner!	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
well	1
educated	1
and	1
clever.	1
This	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
foreign	1
education	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
him!	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
receive	1
him,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
money.	1
They	1
wanted	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
quite	1
declined:	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
daughters	1
to	1
consider."	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
so	1
rich?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess,	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
girls,	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
assumed	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
inattention.	1
"His	1
children	1
are	1
all	1
illegitimate.	1
I	1
think	1
Pierre	1
also	1
is	1
illegitimate."	1
	1
The	1
visitor	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
with	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
intervened	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
connections	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
"The	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is,"	1
said	1
she	1
significantly,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper,	1
"everyone	1
knows	1
Count	1
Cyril's	1
reputation....	1
He	1
has	1
lost	1
count	1
of	1
his	1
children,	1
but	1
this	1
Pierre	1
was	1
his	1
favorite."	1
	1
"How	1
handsome	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
still	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
year	1
ago!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
handsomer	1
man."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
altered	1
now,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Well,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
is	1
the	1
next	1
heir	1
through	1
his	1
wife,	1
but	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
Pierre,	1
looked	1
after	1
his	1
education,	1
and	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
about	1
him;	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
his	1
death--and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Lorrain	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
Petersburg-	1
-no	1
one	1
knows	1
who	1
will	1
inherit	1
his	1
immense	1
fortune,	1
Pierre	1
or	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
Forty	1
thousand	1
serfs	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
rubles!	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
told	1
me	1
himself.	1
Besides,	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
my	1
mother's	1
second	1
cousin.	1
He's	1
also	1
my	1
Bory's	1
godfather,"	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
attached	1
no	1
importance	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
fact.	1
	1
"Prince	1
Vasili	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
yesterday.	1
I	1
hear	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
on	1
some	1
inspection	1
business,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
between	1
ourselves,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
"that	1
is	1
a	1
pretext.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich,	1
hearing	1
how	1
ill	1
he	1
is."	1
	1
"But	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
capital	1
joke,"	1
said	1
the	1
count;	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
elder	1
visitor	1
was	1
not	1
listening,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies.	1
"I	1
can	1
just	1
imagine	1
what	1
a	1
funny	1
figure	1
that	1
policeman	1
cut!"	1
	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arms	1
to	1
impersonate	1
the	1
policeman,	1
his	1
portly	1
form	1
again	1
shook	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
ringing	1
laugh,	1
the	1
laugh	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
always	1
eats	1
well	1
and,	1
in	1
particular,	1
drinks	1
well.	1
"So	1
do	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
us!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Silence	1
ensued.	1
The	1
countess	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
callers,	1
smiling	1
affably,	1
but	1
not	1
concealing	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
distressed	1
if	1
they	1
now	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
leave.	1
The	1
visitor's	1
daughter	1
was	1
already	1
smoothing	1
down	1
her	1
dress	1
with	1
an	1
inquiring	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
mother,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
were	1
heard	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
running	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
falling	1
over,	1
and	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
thirteen,	1
hiding	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
short	1
muslin	1
frock,	1
darted	1
in	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
intended	1
her	1
flight	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
so	1
far.	1
Behind	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
appeared	1
a	1
student	1
with	1
a	1
crimson	1
coat	1
collar,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
fifteen,	1
and	1
a	1
plump	1
rosy-faced	1
boy	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
jacket.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
jumped	1
up	1
and,	1
swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
spread	1
his	1
arms	1
wide	1
and	1
threw	1
them	1
round	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
in.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
she	1
is!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
laughing.	1
"My	1
pet,	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
it	1
is.	1
My	1
dear	1
pet!"	1
	1
"Ma	1
chere,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
everything,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
feigned	1
severity.	1
"You	1
spoil	1
her,	1
Ilya,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
my	1
dear?	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
many	1
happy	1
returns	1
of	1
your	1
name	1
day,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"What	1
a	1
charming	1
child,"	1
she	1
added,	1
addressing	1
the	1
mother.	1
	1
This	1
black-eyed,	1
wide-mouthed	1
girl,	1
not	1
pretty	1
but	1
full	1
of	1
life--with	1
childish	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
which	1
after	1
her	1
run	1
heaved	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
bodice,	1
with	1
black	1
curls	1
tossed	1
backward,	1
thin	1
bare	1
arms,	1
little	1
legs	1
in	1
lace-	1
frilled	1
drawers,	1
and	1
feet	1
in	1
low	1
slippers--was	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
charming	1
age	1
when	1
a	1
girl	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
child,	1
though	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
a	1
young	1
woman.	1
Escaping	1
from	1
her	1
father	1
she	1
ran	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
lace	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
mantilla--not	1
paying	1
the	1
least	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
severe	1
remark--and	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
She	1
laughed,	1
and	1
in	1
fragmentary	1
sentences	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
about	1
a	1
doll	1
which	1
she	1
produced	1
from	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
frock.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
see?...	1
My	1
doll...	1
Mimi...	1
You	1
see..."	1
was	1
all	1
Natasha	1
managed	1
to	1
utter	1
(to	1
her	1
everything	1
seemed	1
funny).	1
She	1
leaned	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
loud,	1
ringing	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
prim	1
visitor	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
joining	1
in.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
monstrosity	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
pushing	1
away	1
her	1
daughter	1
with	1
pretended	1
sternness,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
visitor	1
she	1
added:	1
"She	1
is	1
my	1
youngest	1
girl."	1
	1
Natasha,	1
raising	1
her	1
face	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
from	1
her	1
mother's	1
mantilla,	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
her	1
through	1
tears	1
of	1
laughter,	1
and	1
again	1
hid	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
The	1
visitor,	1
compelled	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
at	1
this	1
family	1
scene,	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
"is	1
Mimi	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
yours?	1
A	1
daughter,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
visitor's	1
tone	1
of	1
condescension	1
to	1
childish	1
things.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
seriously.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
younger	1
generation:	1
Boris,	1
the	1
officer,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
son;	1
Nicholas,	1
the	1
undergraduate,	1
the	1
count's	1
eldest	1
son;	1
Sonya,	1
the	1
count's	1
fifteen-year-old	1
niece,	1
and	1
little	1
Petya,	1
his	1
youngest	1
boy,	1
had	1
all	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
were	1
obviously	1
trying	1
to	1
restrain	1
within	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
decorum	1
the	1
excitement	1
and	1
mirth	1
that	1
shone	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
faces.	1
Evidently	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
rooms,	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
dashed	1
out	1
so	1
impetuously,	1
the	1
conversation	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
amusing	1
than	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
talk	1
of	1
society	1
scandals,	1
the	1
weather,	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
suppress	1
their	1
laughter.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
young	1
men,	1
the	1
student	1
and	1
the	1
officer,	1
friends	1
from	1
childhood,	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
and	1
both	1
handsome	1
fellows,	1
though	1
not	1
alike.	1
Boris	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
fair,	1
and	1
his	1
calm	1
and	1
handsome	1
face	1
had	1
regular,	1
delicate	1
features.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
short	1
with	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
an	1
open	1
expression.	1
Dark	1
hairs	1
were	1
already	1
showing	1
on	1
his	1
upper	1
lip,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
expressed	1
impetuosity	1
and	1
enthusiasm.	1
Nicholas	1
blushed	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
He	1
evidently	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
failed.	1
Boris	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
at	1
once	1
found	1
his	1
footing,	1
and	1
related	1
quietly	1
and	1
humorously	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
doll	1
Mimi	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
a	1
young	1
lady,	1
before	1
her	1
nose	1
was	1
broken;	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
aged	1
during	1
the	1
five	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her,	1
and	1
how	1
her	1
head	1
had	1
cracked	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
skull.	1
Having	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
younger	1
brother,	1
who	1
was	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
shaking	1
with	1
suppressed	1
laughter,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
any	1
longer,	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
her	1
nimble	1
little	1
feet	1
would	1
carry	1
her.	1
Boris	1
did	1
not	1
laugh.	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
out,	1
weren't	1
you,	1
Mamma?	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
the	1
carriage?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
mother	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
ready,"	1
she	1
answered,	1
returning	1
his	1
smile.	1
	1
Boris	1
quietly	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
Natasha.	1
The	1
plump	1
boy	1
ran	1
after	1
them	1
angrily,	1
as	1
if	1
vexed	1
that	1
their	1
program	1
had	1
been	1
disturbed.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
The	1
only	1
young	1
people	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
not	1
counting	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor	1
and	1
the	1
countess'	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
(who	1
was	1
four	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
behaved	1
already	1
like	1
a	1
grown-up	1
person),	1
were	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
the	1
niece.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
a	1
slender	1
little	1
brunette	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
veiled	1
by	1
long	1
lashes,	1
thick	1
black	1
plaits	1
coiling	1
twice	1
round	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
tawny	1
tint	1
in	1
her	1
complexion	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
color	1
of	1
her	1
slender	1
but	1
graceful	1
and	1
muscular	1
arms	1
and	1
neck.	1
By	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
her	1
movements,	1
by	1
the	1
softness	1
and	1
flexibility	1
of	1
her	1
small	1
limbs,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
certain	1
coyness	1
and	1
reserve	1
of	1
manner,	1
she	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
pretty,	1
half-grown	1
kitten	1
which	1
promises	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
beautiful	1
little	1
cat.	1
She	1
evidently	1
considered	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
show	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
by	1
smiling,	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself	1
her	1
eyes	1
under	1
their	1
thick	1
long	1
lashes	1
watched	1
her	1
cousin	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army,	1
with	1
such	1
passionate	1
girlish	1
adoration	1
that	1
her	1
smile	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
impose	1
upon	1
anyone,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
kitten	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
only	1
to	1
spring	1
up	1
with	1
more	1
energy	1
and	1
again	1
play	1
with	1
her	1
cousin	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
too	1
could,	1
like	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Boris,	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah	1
yes,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
addressing	1
the	1
visitor	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
Nicholas,	1
"his	1
friend	1
Boris	1
has	1
become	1
an	1
officer,	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
friendship's	1
sake	1
he	1
is	1
leaving	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
me,	1
his	1
old	1
father,	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
military	1
service,	1
my	1
dear.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
everything	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Archives	1
Department!	1
Isn't	1
that	1
friendship?"	1
remarked	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
an	1
inquiring	1
tone.	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
war	1
has	1
been	1
declared,"	1
replied	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"They've	1
been	1
saying	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
while,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
"and	1
they'll	1
say	1
so	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
My	1
dear,	1
there's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
"He's	1
joining	1
the	1
hussars."	1
	1
The	1
visitor,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say,	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
from	1
friendship,"	1
declared	1
Nicholas,	1
flaring	1
up	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
shameful	1
aspersion.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
from	1
friendship	1
at	1
all;	1
I	1
simply	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
is	1
my	1
vocation."	1
	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
cousin	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
regarding	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
approbation.	1
	1
"Schubert,	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
Hussars,	1
is	1
dining	1
with	1
us	1
today.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
on	1
leave	1
and	1
is	1
taking	1
Nicholas	1
back	1
with	1
him.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
speaking	1
playfully	1
of	1
a	1
matter	1
that	1
evidently	1
distressed	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
you,	1
Papa,"	1
said	1
his	1
son,	1
"that	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
I'll	1
stay.	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
use	1
anywhere	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
army;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
diplomat	1
or	1
a	1
government	1
clerk.--I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
hide	1
what	1
I	1
feel."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
kept	1
glancing	1
with	1
the	1
flirtatiousness	1
of	1
a	1
handsome	1
youth	1
at	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
kitten,	1
feasting	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
him,	1
seemed	1
ready	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
to	1
start	1
her	1
gambols	1
again	1
and	1
display	1
her	1
kittenish	1
nature.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count.	1
"He	1
always	1
flares	1
up!	1
This	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
turned	1
all	1
their	1
heads;	1
they	1
all	1
think	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
an	1
ensign	1
and	1
became	1
Emperor.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
God	1
grant	1
it,"	1
he	1
added,	1
not	1
noticing	1
his	1
visitor's	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
elders	1
began	1
talking	1
about	1
Bonaparte.	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
turned	1
to	1
young	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
weren't	1
at	1
the	1
Arkharovs'	1
on	1
Thursday.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
dull	1
without	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
tender	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man,	1
flattered,	1
sat	1
down	1
nearer	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
coquettish	1
smile,	1
and	1
engaged	1
the	1
smiling	1
Julie	1
in	1
a	1
confidential	1
conversation	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
noticing	1
that	1
his	1
involuntary	1
smile	1
had	1
stabbed	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
who	1
blushed	1
and	1
smiled	1
unnaturally.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
talk	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
passionately	1
angry	1
glance,	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
maintain	1
the	1
artificial	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
lips,	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
Nicholas'	1
animation	1
vanished.	1
He	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
pause	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
distressed	1
face	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
find	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"How	1
plainly	1
all	1
these	1
young	1
people	1
wear	1
their	1
hearts	1
on	1
their	1
sleeves!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out.	1
"Cousinage--	1
dangereux	1
voisinage;"	1
*	1
she	1
added.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Cousinhood	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous	1
neighborhood.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
when	1
the	1
brightness	1
these	1
young	1
people	1
had	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
vanished;	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
answering	1
a	1
question	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
put	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
her	1
mind,	1
"and	1
how	1
much	1
suffering,	1
how	1
much	1
anxiety	1
one	1
has	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
rejoice	1
in	1
them	1
now!	1
And	1
yet	1
really	1
the	1
anxiety	1
is	1
greater	1
now	1
than	1
the	1
joy.	1
One	1
is	1
always,	1
always	1
anxious!	1
Especially	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
age,	1
so	1
dangerous	1
both	1
for	1
girls	1
and	1
boys."	1
	1
"It	1
all	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
bringing	1
up,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you're	1
quite	1
right,"	1
continued	1
the	1
countess.	1
"Till	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
always,	1
thank	1
God,	1
been	1
my	1
children's	1
friend	1
and	1
had	1
their	1
full	1
confidence,"	1
said	1
she,	1
repeating	1
the	1
mistake	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
parents	1
who	1
imagine	1
that	1
their	1
children	1
have	1
no	1
secrets	1
from	1
them.	1
"I	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
my	1
daughters'	1
first	1
confidante,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
Nicholas,	1
with	1
his	1
impulsive	1
nature,	1
does	1
get	1
into	1
mischief	1
(a	1
boy	1
can't	1
help	1
it),	1
he	1
will	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
never	1
be	1
like	1
those	1
Petersburg	1
young	1
men."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
are	1
splendid,	1
splendid	1
youngsters,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
always	1
solved	1
questions	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
perplexing	1
by	1
deciding	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
splendid.	1
"Just	1
fancy:	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar.	1
What's	1
one	1
to	1
do,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
charming	1
creature	1
your	1
younger	1
girl	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor;	1
"a	1
little	1
volcano!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
regular	1
volcano,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Takes	1
after	1
me!	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
voice	1
she	1
has;	1
though	1
she's	1
my	1
daughter,	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
she'll	1
be	1
a	1
singer,	1
a	1
second	1
Salomoni!	1
We	1
have	1
engaged	1
an	1
Italian	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
lessons."	1
	1
"Isn't	1
she	1
too	1
young?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
harms	1
the	1
voice	1
to	1
train	1
it	1
at	1
that	1
age."	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
too	1
young!"	1
replied	1
the	1
count.	1
"Why,	1
our	1
mothers	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
at	1
twelve	1
or	1
thirteen."	1
	1
"And	1
she's	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Boris	1
already.	1
Just	1
fancy!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile,	1
looking	1
at	1
Boris	1
and	1
went	1
on,	1
evidently	1
concerned	1
with	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
always	1
occupied	1
her:	1
"Now	1
you	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
severe	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
forbid	1
it...	1
goodness	1
knows	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
up	1
to	1
on	1
the	1
sly"	1
(she	1
meant	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
kissing),	1
"but	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
know	1
every	1
word	1
she	1
utters.	1
She	1
will	1
come	1
running	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
accord	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
everything.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
spoil	1
her,	1
but	1
really	1
that	1
seems	1
the	1
best	1
plan.	1
With	1
her	1
elder	1
sister	1
I	1
was	1
stricter."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
quite	1
differently,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
handsome	1
elder	1
daughter,	1
Countess	1
Vera,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
smile	1
did	1
not	1
enhance	1
Vera's	1
beauty	1
as	1
smiles	1
generally	1
do;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
unnatural,	1
and	1
therefore	1
unpleasant,	1
expression.	1
Vera	1
was	1
good-looking,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
stupid,	1
quick	1
at	1
learning,	1
was	1
well-brought	1
up,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
voice;	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
true	1
and	1
appropriate,	1
yet,	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
everyone--the	1
visitors	1
and	1
countess	1
alike--turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
wondering	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
awkward.	1
	1
"People	1
are	1
always	1
too	1
clever	1
with	1
their	1
eldest	1
children	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
exceptional	1
of	1
them,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
denying	1
it,	1
my	1
dear?	1
Our	1
dear	1
countess	1
was	1
too	1
clever	1
with	1
Vera,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
that?	1
She's	1
turned	1
out	1
splendidly	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
he	1
added,	1
winking	1
at	1
Vera.	1
	1
The	1
guests	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
leave,	1
promising	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
"What	1
manners!	1
I	1
thought	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
go,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
guests	1
out.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
only	1
went	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
conservatory.	1
There	1
she	1
paused	1
and	1
stood	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
waiting	1
for	1
Boris	1
to	1
come	1
out.	1
She	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
impatient,	1
and	1
stamped	1
her	1
foot,	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
at	1
his	1
not	1
coming	1
at	1
once,	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
discreet	1
steps	1
approaching	1
neither	1
quickly	1
nor	1
slowly.	1
At	1
this	1
Natasha	1
dashed	1
swiftly	1
among	1
the	1
flower	1
tubs	1
and	1
hid	1
there.	1
	1
Boris	1
paused	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
looked	1
round,	1
brushed	1
a	1
little	1
dust	1
from	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
uniform,	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
mirror	1
examined	1
his	1
handsome	1
face.	1
Natasha,	1
very	1
still,	1
peered	1
out	1
from	1
her	1
ambush,	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do.	1
He	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
before	1
the	1
glass,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
walked	1
toward	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
but	1
changed	1
her	1
mind.	1
"Let	1
him	1
look	1
for	1
me,"	1
thought	1
she.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Boris	1
gone	1
than	1
Sonya,	1
flushed,	1
in	1
tears,	1
and	1
muttering	1
angrily,	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
checked	1
her	1
first	1
impulse	1
to	1
run	1
out	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
her	1
hiding	1
place,	1
watching--as	1
under	1
an	1
invisible	1
cap--to	1
see	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
She	1
was	1
experiencing	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
peculiar	1
pleasure.	1
Sonya,	1
muttering	1
to	1
herself,	1
kept	1
looking	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door.	1
It	1
opened	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
How	1
can	1
you?"	1
said	1
he,	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"It's	1
nothing,	1
nothing;	1
leave	1
me	1
alone!"	1
sobbed	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you	1
do,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
her!"	1
	1
"So-o-onya!	1
Look	1
here!	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
torture	1
me	1
and	1
yourself	1
like	1
that,	1
for	1
a	1
mere	1
fancy?"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
taking	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
Sonya	1
did	1
not	1
pull	1
it	1
away,	1
and	1
left	1
off	1
crying.	1
Natasha,	1
not	1
stirring	1
and	1
scarcely	1
breathing,	1
watched	1
from	1
her	1
ambush	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes.	1
"What	1
will	1
happen	1
now?"	1
thought	1
she.	1
	1
"Sonya!	1
What	1
is	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
me?	1
You	1
alone	1
are	1
everything!"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"And	1
I	1
will	1
prove	1
it	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
I	1
won't;	1
only	1
forgive	1
me,	1
Sonya!"	1
He	1
drew	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
nice,"	1
thought	1
Natasha;	1
and	1
when	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
conservatory	1
she	1
followed	1
and	1
called	1
Boris	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Boris,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
and	1
significant	1
look.	1
"I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
Here,	1
here!"	1
and	1
she	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
conservatory	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
among	1
the	1
tubs	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
hiding.	1
	1
Boris	1
followed	1
her,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
something?"	1
asked	1
he.	1
	1
She	1
grew	1
confused,	1
glanced	1
round,	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
doll	1
she	1
had	1
thrown	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tubs,	1
picked	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
"Kiss	1
the	1
doll,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Boris	1
looked	1
attentively	1
and	1
kindly	1
at	1
her	1
eager	1
face,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"Don't	1
you	1
want	1
to?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
she,	1
and	1
went	1
further	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
plants	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
doll.	1
"Closer,	1
closer!"	1
she	1
whispered.	1
	1
She	1
caught	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
by	1
his	1
cuffs,	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
solemnity	1
and	1
fear	1
appeared	1
on	1
her	1
flushed	1
face.	1
	1
"And	1
me?	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
kiss	1
me?"	1
she	1
whispered	1
almost	1
inaudibly,	1
glancing	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows,	1
smiling,	1
and	1
almost	1
crying	1
from	1
excitement.	1
	1
Boris	1
blushed.	1
	1
"How	1
funny	1
you	1
are!"	1
he	1
said,	1
bending	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
blushing	1
still	1
more,	1
but	1
he	1
waited	1
and	1
did	1
nothing.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
onto	1
a	1
tub	1
to	1
be	1
higher	1
than	1
he,	1
embraced	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
both	1
her	1
slender	1
bare	1
arms	1
clasped	1
him	1
above	1
his	1
neck,	1
and,	1
tossing	1
back	1
her	1
hair,	1
kissed	1
him	1
full	1
on	1
the	1
lips.	1
	1
Then	1
she	1
slipped	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
flowerpots	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tubs	1
and	1
stood,	1
hanging	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"Natasha,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
but..."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me?"	1
Natasha	1
broke	1
in.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am,	1
but	1
please	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
like	1
that....	1
In	1
another	1
four	1
years...	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
for	1
your	1
hand."	1
	1
Natasha	1
considered.	1
	1
"Thirteen,	1
fourteen,	1
fifteen,	1
sixteen,"	1
she	1
counted	1
on	1
her	1
slender	1
little	1
fingers.	1
"All	1
right!	1
Then	1
it's	1
settled?"	1
	1
A	1
smile	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
eager	1
face.	1
	1
"Settled!"	1
replied	1
Boris.	1
	1
"Forever?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl.	1
"Till	1
death	1
itself?"	1
	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
face	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
adjoining	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
After	1
receiving	1
her	1
visitors,	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
admit	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
the	1
porter	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
invite	1
to	1
dinner	1
all	1
who	1
came	1
"to	1
congratulate."	1
The	1
countess	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
tête-à-tête	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
her	1
childhood,	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
properly	1
since	1
she	1
returned	1
from	1
Petersburg.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
her	1
tear-worn	1
but	1
pleasant	1
face,	1
drew	1
her	1
chair	1
nearer	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"With	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
frank,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"There	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
left	1
of	1
us	1
old	1
friends!	1
That's	1
why	1
I	1
so	1
value	1
your	1
friendship."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
looked	1
at	1
Vera	1
and	1
paused.	1
The	1
countess	1
pressed	1
her	1
friend's	1
hand.	1
	1
"Vera,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
not	1
a	1
favorite,	1
"how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
little	1
tact?	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
wanted	1
here?	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
girls,	1
or..."	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
Vera	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
at	1
all	1
hurt.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
sooner,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
gone,"	1
she	1
replied	1
as	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room.	1
	1
But	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
she	1
noticed	1
two	1
couples	1
sitting,	1
one	1
pair	1
at	1
each	1
window.	1
She	1
stopped	1
and	1
smiled	1
scornfully.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
sitting	1
close	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
who	1
was	1
copying	1
out	1
some	1
verses	1
for	1
her,	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
written.	1
Boris	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
window	1
and	1
ceased	1
talking	1
when	1
Vera	1
entered.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
Vera	1
with	1
guilty,	1
happy	1
faces.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
pleasant	1
and	1
touching	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
little	1
girls	1
in	1
love;	1
but	1
apparently	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
roused	1
no	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
in	1
Vera.	1
	1
"How	1
often	1
have	1
I	1
asked	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
things?"	1
she	1
said.	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
room	1
of	1
your	1
own,"	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
inkstand	1
from	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
minute,	1
in	1
a	1
minute,"	1
he	1
said,	1
dipping	1
his	1
pen.	1
	1
"You	1
always	1
manage	1
to	1
do	1
things	1
at	1
the	1
wrong	1
time,"	1
continued	1
Vera.	1
"You	1
came	1
rushing	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
so	1
that	1
everyone	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you."	1
	1
Though	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
quite	1
just,	1
perhaps	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
no	1
one	1
replied,	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
simply	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
She	1
lingered	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
inkstand	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"And	1
at	1
your	1
age	1
what	1
secrets	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
between	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Boris,	1
or	1
between	1
you	1
two?	1
It's	1
all	1
nonsense!"	1
	1
"Now,	1
Vera,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
you?"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
in	1
defense,	1
speaking	1
very	1
gently.	1
	1
She	1
seemed	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
kind	1
and	1
affectionate	1
to	1
everyone.	1
	1
"Very	1
silly,"	1
said	1
Vera.	1
"I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you.	1
Secrets	1
indeed!"	1
	1
"All	1
have	1
secrets	1
of	1
their	1
own,"	1
answered	1
Natasha,	1
getting	1
warmer.	1
"We	1
don't	1
interfere	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
Berg."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
not,"	1
said	1
Vera,	1
"because	1
there	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
anything	1
wrong	1
in	1
my	1
behavior.	1
But	1
I'll	1
just	1
tell	1
Mamma	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
behaving	1
with	1
Boris."	1
	1
"Natalya	1
Ilynichna	1
behaves	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
me,"	1
remarked	1
Boris.	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
complain	1
of."	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Boris!	1
You	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
diplomat	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
tiresome,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
in	1
a	1
mortified	1
voice	1
that	1
trembled	1
slightly.	1
(She	1
used	1
the	1
word	1
"diplomat,"	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
much	1
in	1
vogue	1
among	1
the	1
children,	1
in	1
the	1
special	1
sense	1
they	1
attached	1
to	1
it.)	1
"Why	1
does	1
she	1
bother	1
me?"	1
And	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Vera,	1
"You'll	1
never	1
understand	1
it,	1
because	1
you've	1
never	1
loved	1
anyone.	1
You	1
have	1
no	1
heart!	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
Madame	1
de	1
Genlis	1
and	1
nothing	1
more"	1
(this	1
nickname,	1
bestowed	1
on	1
Vera	1
by	1
Nicholas,	1
was	1
considered	1
very	1
stinging),	1
"and	1
your	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
people!	1
Go	1
and	1
flirt	1
with	1
Berg	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
she	1
finished	1
quickly.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
not	1
run	1
after	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
before	1
visitors..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
you've	1
done	1
what	1
you	1
wanted,"	1
put	1
in	1
Nicholas--"said	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
to	1
everyone	1
and	1
upset	1
them.	1
Let's	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
nursery."	1
	1
All	1
four,	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
scared	1
birds,	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"The	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
were	1
said	1
to	1
me,"	1
remarked	1
Vera,	1
"I	1
said	1
none	1
to	1
anyone."	1
	1
"Madame	1
de	1
Genlis!	1
Madame	1
de	1
Genlis!"	1
shouted	1
laughing	1
voices	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
Vera,	1
who	1
produced	1
such	1
an	1
irritating	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
effect	1
on	1
everyone,	1
smiled	1
and,	1
evidently	1
unmoved	1
by	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
arranged	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
scarf.	1
Looking	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
handsome	1
face	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
become	1
still	1
colder	1
and	1
calmer.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
still	1
going	1
on.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
"my	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
roses	1
either.	1
Don't	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
we	1
are	1
living	1
our	1
means	1
won't	1
last	1
long?	1
It's	1
all	1
the	1
Club	1
and	1
his	1
easygoing	1
nature.	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
do	1
we	1
get	1
any	1
rest?	1
Theatricals,	1
hunting,	1
and	1
heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
besides!	1
But	1
don't	1
let's	1
talk	1
about	1
me;	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
managed	1
everything.	1
I	1
often	1
wonder	1
at	1
you,	1
Annette--how	1
at	1
your	1
age	1
you	1
can	1
rush	1
off	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
to	1
those	1
ministers	1
and	1
great	1
people,	1
and	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
them	1
all!	1
It's	1
quite	1
astonishing.	1
How	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
things	1
settled?	1
I	1
couldn't	1
possibly	1
do	1
it."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
love,"	1
answered	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"God	1
grant	1
you	1
never	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
a	1
widow	1
without	1
means	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
son	1
you	1
love	1
to	1
distraction!	1
One	1
learns	1
many	1
things	1
then,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
pride.	1
"That	1
lawsuit	1
taught	1
me	1
much.	1
When	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
big	1
people	1
I	1
write	1
a	1
note:	1
'Princess	1
So-and-So	1
desires	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
So	1
and-So,'	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
take	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
go	1
myself	1
two,	1
three,	1
or	1
four	1
times--	1
till	1
I	1
get	1
what	1
I	1
want.	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
what	1
they	1
think	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
apply	1
about	1
Bory?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"You	1
see	1
yours	1
is	1
already	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Guards,	1
while	1
my	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
going	1
as	1
a	1
cadet.	1
There's	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
interest	1
himself	1
for	1
him.	1
To	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
apply?"	1
	1
"To	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
kind.	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
agreed	1
to	1
everything,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
enthusiastically,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
all	1
the	1
humiliation	1
she	1
had	1
endured	1
to	1
gain	1
her	1
end.	1
	1
"Has	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
aged	1
much?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
we	1
acted	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
Rumyantsovs'	1
theatricals.	1
I	1
expect	1
he	1
has	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
He	1
paid	1
me	1
attentions	1
in	1
those	1
days,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
ever,"	1
replied	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"overflowing	1
with	1
amiability.	1
His	1
position	1
has	1
not	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
'I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
so	1
little	1
for	1
you,	1
dear	1
Princess.	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
command.'	1
Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
relation.	1
But,	1
Nataly,	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
my	1
son:	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
his	1
happiness!	1
And	1
my	1
affairs	1
are	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
bad	1
way	1
that	1
my	1
position	1
is	1
now	1
a	1
terrible	1
one,"	1
continued	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
sadly,	1
dropping	1
her	1
voice.	1
"My	1
wretched	1
lawsuit	1
takes	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
and	1
makes	1
no	1
progress.	1
Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
I	1
have	1
literally	1
not	1
a	1
penny	1
and	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
equip	1
Boris."	1
She	1
took	1
out	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
"I	1
need	1
five	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
and	1
have	1
only	1
one	1
twenty-five-ruble	1
note.	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state....	1
My	1
only	1
hope	1
now	1
is	1
in	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov.	1
If	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
assist	1
his	1
godson--you	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
Bory's	1
godfather--and	1
allow	1
him	1
something	1
for	1
his	1
maintenance,	1
all	1
my	1
trouble	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
thrown	1
away....	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
equip	1
him."	1
	1
The	1
countess'	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
she	1
pondered	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"I	1
often	1
think,	1
though,	1
perhaps	1
it's	1
a	1
sin,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
"that	1
here	1
lives	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov	1
so	1
rich,	1
all	1
alone...	1
that	1
tremendous	1
fortune...	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
life	1
worth?	1
It's	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
Bory's	1
life	1
is	1
only	1
just	1
beginning...."	1
	1
"Surely	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
something	1
to	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Heaven	1
only	1
knows,	1
my	1
dear!	1
These	1
rich	1
grandees	1
are	1
so	1
selfish.	1
Still,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
Boris	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
straight	1
out.	1
Let	1
people	1
think	1
what	1
they	1
will	1
of	1
me,	1
it's	1
really	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
my	1
son's	1
fate	1
is	1
at	1
stake."	1
The	1
princess	1
rose.	1
"It's	1
now	1
two	1
o'clock	1
and	1
you	1
dine	1
at	1
four.	1
There	1
will	1
just	1
be	1
time."	1
	1
And	1
like	1
a	1
practical	1
Petersburg	1
lady	1
who	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
time,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
sent	1
someone	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
should	1
not	1
hear,	1
"Wish	1
me	1
good	1
luck."	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
coming	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
dining	1
hall	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
and	1
he	1
added:	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
better,	1
ask	1
Pierre	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
us.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
danced	1
with	1
the	1
children.	1
Be	1
sure	1
to	1
invite	1
him,	1
my	1
dear.	1
We	1
will	1
see	1
how	1
Taras	1
distinguishes	1
himself	1
today.	1
He	1
says	1
Count	1
Orlov	1
never	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
dinner	1
as	1
ours	1
will	1
be!"	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
as	1
Countess	1
Rostova's	1
carriage	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
seated	1
drove	1
over	1
the	1
straw	1
covered	1
street	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
wide	1
courtyard	1
of	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov's	1
house.	1
"My	1
dear	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
drawing	1
her	1
hand	1
from	1
beneath	1
her	1
old	1
mantle	1
and	1
laying	1
it	1
timidly	1
and	1
tenderly	1
on	1
her	1
son's	1
arm,	1
"be	1
affectionate	1
and	1
attentive	1
to	1
him.	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
your	1
godfather	1
after	1
all,	1
your	1
future	1
depends	1
on	1
him.	1
Remember	1
that,	1
my	1
dear,	1
and	1
be	1
nice	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
you	1
so	1
well	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
be."	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
anything	1
besides	1
humiliation	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it..."	1
answered	1
her	1
son	1
coldly.	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
your	1
sake."	1
	1
Although	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
saw	1
someone's	1
carriage	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance,	1
after	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
son	1
(who	1
without	1
asking	1
to	1
be	1
announced	1
had	1
passed	1
straight	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
porch	1
between	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
statues	1
in	1
niches)	1
and	1
looking	1
significantly	1
at	1
the	1
lady's	1
old	1
cloak,	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
they	1
wanted	1
the	1
count	1
or	1
the	1
princesses,	1
and,	1
hearing	1
that	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
said	1
his	1
excellency	1
was	1
worse	1
today,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
excellency	1
was	1
not	1
receiving	1
anyone.	1
	1
"We	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
back,"	1
said	1
the	1
son	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"My	1
dear!"	1
exclaimed	1
his	1
mother	1
imploringly,	1
again	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
touch	1
might	1
soothe	1
or	1
rouse	1
him.	1
	1
Boris	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cloak.	1
	1
"My	1
friend,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
in	1
gentle	1
tones,	1
addressing	1
the	1
hall	1
porter,	1
"I	1
know	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
very	1
ill...	1
that's	1
why	1
I	1
have	1
come...	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
relation.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
disturb	1
him,	1
my	1
friend...	1
I	1
only	1
need	1
see	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Sergeevich:	1
he	1
is	1
staying	1
here,	1
is	1
he	1
not?	1
Please	1
announce	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
hall	1
porter	1
sullenly	1
pulled	1
a	1
bell	1
that	1
rang	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
"Princess	1
Drubetskaya	1
to	1
see	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Sergeevich,"	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
a	1
footman	1
dressed	1
in	1
knee	1
breeches,	1
shoes,	1
and	1
a	1
swallow-tail	1
coat,	1
who	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
and	1
looked	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
halfway	1
landing.	1
	1
The	1
mother	1
smoothed	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dyed	1
silk	1
dress	1
before	1
a	1
large	1
Venetian	1
mirror	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
trodden-down	1
shoes	1
briskly	1
ascended	1
the	1
carpeted	1
stairs.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
son,	1
once	1
more	1
stimulating	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
touch,	1
"you	1
promised	1
me!"	1
	1
The	1
son,	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes,	1
followed	1
her	1
quietly.	1
	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
large	1
hall,	1
from	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
apartments	1
assigned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
son,	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
an	1
elderly	1
footman	1
who	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
as	1
they	1
entered,	1
the	1
bronze	1
handle	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
turned	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
came	1
out--wearing	1
a	1
velvet	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
star	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
when	1
at	1
home--taking	1
leave	1
of	1
a	1
good-looking,	1
dark-haired	1
man.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Petersburg	1
doctor,	1
Lorrain.	1
	1
"Then	1
it	1
is	1
certain?"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"Prince,	1
humanum	1
est	1
errare,	1
*	1
but..."	1
replied	1
the	1
doctor,	1
swallowing	1
his	1
r's,	1
and	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
Latin	1
words	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
accent.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
err	1
is	1
human.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
very	1
well..."	1
	1
Seeing	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and	1
her	1
son,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
dismissed	1
the	1
doctor	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
approached	1
them	1
silently	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
inquiry.	1
The	1
son	1
noticed	1
that	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
sorrow	1
suddenly	1
clouded	1
his	1
mother's	1
face,	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
slightly.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Prince!	1
In	1
what	1
sad	1
circumstances	1
we	1
meet	1
again!	1
And	1
how	1
is	1
our	1
dear	1
invalid?"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
though	1
unaware	1
of	1
the	1
cold	1
offensive	1
look	1
fixed	1
on	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
Boris	1
questioningly	1
and	1
perplexed.	1
Boris	1
bowed	1
politely.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
without	1
acknowledging	1
the	1
bow	1
turned	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
answering	1
her	1
query	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
lips	1
indicating	1
very	1
little	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
patient.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible?"	1
exclaimed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
awful!	1
It	1
is	1
terrible	1
to	1
think....	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
son,"	1
she	1
added,	1
indicating	1
Boris.	1
"He	1
wanted	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
himself."	1
	1
Boris	1
bowed	1
again	1
politely.	1
	1
"Believe	1
me,	1
Prince,	1
a	1
mother's	1
heart	1
will	1
never	1
forget	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
us."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
a	1
service,	1
my	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
arranging	1
his	1
lace	1
frill,	1
and	1
in	1
tone	1
and	1
manner,	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
under	1
an	1
obligation,	1
assuming	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
much	1
greater	1
importance	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
at	1
Anna	1
Scherer's	1
reception.	1
	1
"Try	1
to	1
serve	1
well	1
and	1
show	1
yourself	1
worthy,"	1
added	1
he,	1
addressing	1
Boris	1
with	1
severity.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad....	1
Are	1
you	1
here	1
on	1
leave?"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
tone	1
of	1
indifference.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
awaiting	1
orders	1
to	1
join	1
my	1
new	1
regiment,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
Boris,	1
betraying	1
neither	1
annoyance	1
at	1
the	1
prince's	1
brusque	1
manner	1
nor	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation,	1
but	1
speaking	1
so	1
quietly	1
and	1
respectfully	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
searching	1
glance.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
living	1
with	1
your	1
mother?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
living	1
at	1
Countess	1
Rostova's,"	1
replied	1
Boris,	1
again	1
adding,	1
"your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"That	1
is,	1
with	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
who	1
married	1
Nataly	1
Shinshina,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
	1
"I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
his	1
monotonous	1
voice.	1
"I	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
how	1
Nataly	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
marry	1
that	1
unlicked	1
bear!	1
A	1
perfectly	1
absurd	1
and	1
stupid	1
fellow,	1
and	1
a	1
gambler	1
too,	1
I	1
am	1
told."	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
man,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
a	1
pathetic	1
smile,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
too	1
knew	1
that	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
deserved	1
this	1
censure,	1
but	1
asked	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
on	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
man.	1
"What	1
do	1
the	1
doctors	1
say?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
her	1
worn	1
face	1
again	1
expressing	1
deep	1
sorrow.	1
	1
"They	1
give	1
little	1
hope,"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
should	1
so	1
like	1
to	1
thank	1
Uncle	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
Boris.	1
He	1
is	1
his	1
godson,"	1
she	1
added,	1
her	1
tone	1
suggesting	1
that	1
this	1
fact	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
much	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
became	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
frowned.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
finding	1
in	1
her	1
a	1
rival	1
for	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
fortune,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
reassure	1
him.	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
sincere	1
affection	1
and	1
devotion	1
to	1
Uncle,"	1
said	1
she,	1
uttering	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
peculiar	1
assurance	1
and	1
unconcern,	1
"I	1
know	1
his	1
character:	1
noble,	1
upright...	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
one	1
with	1
him	1
except	1
the	1
young	1
princesses....	1
They	1
are	1
still	1
young...."	1
She	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
continued	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
"Has	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
final	1
duty,	1
Prince?	1
How	1
priceless	1
are	1
those	1
last	1
moments!	1
It	1
can	1
make	1
things	1
no	1
worse,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill.	1
We	1
women,	1
Prince,"	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
tenderly,	1
"always	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
these	1
things.	1
I	1
absolutely	1
must	1
see	1
him,	1
however	1
painful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
suffering."	1
	1
Evidently	1
the	1
prince	1
understood	1
her,	1
and	1
also	1
understood,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
	1
"Would	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
meeting	1
be	1
too	1
trying	1
for	1
him,	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Let	1
us	1
wait	1
until	1
evening.	1
The	1
doctors	1
are	1
expecting	1
a	1
crisis."	1
	1
"But	1
one	1
cannot	1
delay,	1
Prince,	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment!	1
Consider	1
that	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
at	1
stake.	1
Ah,	1
it	1
is	1
awful:	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
Christian..."	1
	1
A	1
door	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms	1
opened	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
princesses,	1
the	1
count's	1
niece,	1
entered	1
with	1
a	1
cold,	1
stern	1
face.	1
The	1
length	1
of	1
her	1
body	1
was	1
strikingly	1
out	1
of	1
proportion	1
to	1
her	1
short	1
legs.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
turned	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"Still	1
the	1
same;	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
expect,	1
this	1
noise..."	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
looking	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
stranger.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
hardly	1
knew	1
you,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
smile,	1
ambling	1
lightly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
niece.	1
"I	1
have	1
come,	1
and	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
service	1
to	1
help	1
you	1
nurse	1
my	1
uncle.	1
I	1
imagine	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
gone	1
through,"	1
and	1
she	1
sympathetically	1
turned	1
up	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
gave	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
smile,	1
but	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
gloves	1
and,	1
occupying	1
the	1
position	1
she	1
had	1
conquered,	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
inviting	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
"Boris,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"I	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
my	1
uncle;	1
but	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
to	1
Pierre	1
meanwhile	1
and	1
don't	1
forget	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
invitation.	1
They	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
dinner.	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
won't	1
go?"	1
she	1
continued,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince,	1
who	1
had	1
plainly	1
become	1
depressed,	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
only	1
too	1
glad	1
if	1
you	1
relieve	1
me	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
man....	1
Here	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
not	1
once	1
asked	1
for	1
him."	1
	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
A	1
footman	1
conducted	1
Boris	1
down	1
one	1
flight	1
of	1
stairs	1
and	1
up	1
another,	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
rooms.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Pierre,	1
after	1
all,	1
had	1
not	1
managed	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
expelled	1
from	1
there	1
for	1
riotous	1
conduct	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
story	1
told	1
about	1
him	1
at	1
Count	1
Rostov's	1
was	1
true.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
tying	1
a	1
policeman	1
to	1
a	1
bear.	1
He	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
was	1
staying	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
Though	1
he	1
expected	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
escapade	1
would	1
be	1
already	1
known	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
about	1
his	1
father--who	1
were	1
never	1
favorably	1
disposed	1
toward	1
him--would	1
have	1
used	1
it	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
count	1
against	1
him,	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
Entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
the	1
princesses	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
their	1
time,	1
he	1
greeted	1
the	1
ladies,	1
two	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
embroidery	1
frames	1
while	1
a	1
third	1
read	1
aloud.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
eldest	1
who	1
was	1
reading--the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
met	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
The	1
two	1
younger	1
ones	1
were	1
embroidering:	1
both	1
were	1
rosy	1
and	1
pretty	1
and	1
they	1
differed	1
only	1
in	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
mole	1
on	1
her	1
lip	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
much	1
prettier.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
received	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
corpse	1
or	1
a	1
leper.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
paused	1
in	1
her	1
reading	1
and	1
silently	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes;	1
the	1
second	1
assumed	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
expression;	1
while	1
the	1
youngest,	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
mole,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
cheerful	1
and	1
lively	1
disposition,	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
frame	1
to	1
hide	1
a	1
smile	1
probably	1
evoked	1
by	1
the	1
amusing	1
scene	1
she	1
foresaw.	1
She	1
drew	1
her	1
wool	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
canvas	1
and,	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
laughing,	1
stooped	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
pattern.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
cousin?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"You	1
don't	1
recognize	1
me?"	1
	1
"I	1
recognize	1
you	1
only	1
too	1
well,	1
too	1
well."	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
the	1
count?	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
him?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
awkwardly	1
as	1
usual,	1
but	1
unabashed.	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
is	1
suffering	1
physically	1
and	1
mentally,	1
and	1
apparently	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
your	1
best	1
to	1
increase	1
his	1
mental	1
sufferings."	1
	1
"Can	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
count?"	1
Pierre	1
again	1
asked.	1
	1
"Hm....	1
If	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
outright,	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
him...	1
Olga,	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
Uncle's	1
beef	1
tea	1
is	1
ready--it	1
is	1
almost	1
time,"	1
she	1
added,	1
giving	1
Pierre	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
busy,	1
and	1
busy	1
making	1
his	1
father	1
comfortable,	1
while	1
evidently	1
he,	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
only	1
busy	1
causing	1
him	1
annoyance.	1
	1
Olga	1
went	1
out.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
sisters;	1
then	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
said:	1
"Then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
rooms.	1
You	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
him."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
low	1
but	1
ringing	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
sister	1
with	1
the	1
mole.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
arrived	1
and	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house.	1
He	1
sent	1
for	1
Pierre	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
behave	1
here	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
you	1
will	1
end	1
very	1
badly;	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
The	1
count	1
is	1
very,	1
very	1
ill,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Since	1
then	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
disturbed	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
rooms	1
upstairs.	1
	1
When	1
Boris	1
appeared	1
at	1
his	1
door	1
Pierre	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room,	1
stopping	1
occasionally	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
make	1
menacing	1
gestures	1
at	1
the	1
wall,	1
as	1
if	1
running	1
a	1
sword	1
through	1
an	1
invisible	1
foe,	1
and	1
glaring	1
savagely	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
resuming	1
his	1
walk,	1
muttering	1
indistinct	1
words,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
gesticulating.	1
	1
"England	1
is	1
done	1
for,"	1
said	1
he,	1
scowling	1
and	1
pointing	1
his	1
finger	1
at	1
someone	1
unseen.	1
"Mr.	1
Pitt,	1
as	1
a	1
traitor	1
to	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
man,	1
is	1
sentenced	1
to..."	1
But	1
before	1
Pierre--who	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
imagined	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
just	1
effected	1
the	1
dangerous	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Straits	1
of	1
Dover	1
and	1
captured	1
London--could	1
pronounce	1
Pitt's	1
sentence,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
well-built	1
and	1
handsome	1
young	1
officer	1
entering	1
his	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
paused.	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow	1
when	1
Boris	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
and	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
him,	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
impulsive	1
and	1
hearty	1
way	1
he	1
took	1
Boris	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
smile.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember	1
me?"	1
asked	1
Boris	1
quietly	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile.	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
with	1
my	1
mother	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
well."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
ill.	1
People	1
are	1
always	1
disturbing	1
him,"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
who	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
was.	1
	1
Boris	1
felt	1
that	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
him	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
introduce	1
himself,	1
and	1
without	1
experiencing	1
the	1
least	1
embarrassment	1
looked	1
Pierre	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
"Count	1
Rostov	1
asks	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
today,"	1
said	1
he,	1
after	1
a	1
considerable	1
pause	1
which	1
made	1
Pierre	1
feel	1
uncomfortable.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Count	1
Rostov!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre	1
joyfully.	1
"Then	1
you	1
are	1
his	1
son,	1
Ilya?	1
Only	1
fancy,	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
you	1
at	1
first.	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Sparrow	1
Hills	1
with	1
Madame	1
Jacquot?...	1
It's	1
such	1
an	1
age..."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
Boris	1
deliberately,	1
with	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
slightly	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
"I	1
am	1
Boris,	1
son	1
of	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
Drubetskaya.	1
Rostov,	1
the	1
father,	1
is	1
Ilya,	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
Nicholas.	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
any	1
Madame	1
Jacquot."	1
	1
Pierre	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
attacked	1
by	1
mosquitoes	1
or	1
bees.	1
	1
"Oh	1
dear,	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
thinking	1
about?	1
I've	1
mixed	1
everything	1
up.	1
One	1
has	1
so	1
many	1
relatives	1
in	1
Moscow!	1
So	1
you	1
are	1
Boris?	1
Of	1
course.	1
Well,	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
where	1
we	1
are.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition?	1
The	1
English	1
will	1
come	1
off	1
badly,	1
you	1
know,	1
if	1
Napoleon	1
gets	1
across	1
the	1
Channel.	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
expedition	1
is	1
quite	1
feasible.	1
If	1
only	1
Villeneuve	1
doesn't	1
make	1
a	1
mess	1
of	1
things!"	1
	1
Boris	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
Villeneuve's	1
name.	1
	1
"We	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
are	1
more	1
occupied	1
with	1
dinner	1
parties	1
and	1
scandal	1
than	1
with	1
politics,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
quiet	1
ironical	1
tone.	1
"I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
thought	1
about	1
it.	1
Moscow	1
is	1
chiefly	1
busy	1
with	1
gossip,"	1
he	1
continued.	1
"Just	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
father."	1
	1
Pierre	1
smiled	1
in	1
his	1
good-natured	1
way	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
for	1
his	1
companion's	1
sake	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
might	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
would	1
afterwards	1
regret.	1
But	1
Boris	1
spoke	1
distinctly,	1
clearly,	1
and	1
dryly,	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Moscow	1
has	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
gossip,"	1
Boris	1
went	1
on.	1
"Everybody	1
is	1
wondering	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
will	1
leave	1
his	1
fortune,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
perhaps	1
outlive	1
us	1
all,	1
as	1
I	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
he	1
will..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
horrid,"	1
interrupted	1
Pierre,	1
"very	1
horrid."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
still	1
afraid	1
that	1
this	1
officer	1
might	1
inadvertently	1
say	1
something	1
disconcerting	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
"And	1
it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
Boris	1
flushing	1
slightly,	1
but	1
not	1
changing	1
his	1
tone	1
or	1
attitude,	1
"it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
everyone	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
man?"	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
does,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
just	1
wish	1
to	1
say,	1
to	1
avoid	1
misunderstandings,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
mistaken	1
if	1
you	1
reckon	1
me	1
or	1
my	1
mother	1
among	1
such	1
people.	1
We	1
are	1
very	1
poor,	1
but	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
reason	1
that	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
rich,	1
I	1
don't	1
regard	1
myself	1
as	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
neither	1
I	1
nor	1
my	1
mother	1
would	1
ever	1
ask	1
or	1
take	1
anything	1
from	1
him."	1
	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
understand,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
did,	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sofa,	1
seized	1
Boris	1
under	1
the	1
elbow	1
in	1
his	1
quick,	1
clumsy	1
way,	1
and,	1
blushing	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
Boris,	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
mingled	1
shame	1
and	1
vexation.	1
	1
"Well,	1
this	1
is	1
strange!	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I...	1
who	1
could	1
think?...	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well..."	1
	1
But	1
Boris	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
out	1
fully.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it?	1
You	1
must	1
excuse	1
me,"	1
said	1
he,	1
putting	1
Pierre	1
at	1
ease	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
put	1
at	1
ease	1
by	1
him,	1
"but	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
offended	1
you.	1
I	1
always	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
speak	1
out...	1
Well,	1
what	1
answer	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
take?	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'?"	1
	1
And	1
Boris,	1
having	1
apparently	1
relieved	1
himself	1
of	1
an	1
onerous	1
duty	1
and	1
extricated	1
himself	1
from	1
an	1
awkward	1
situation	1
and	1
placed	1
another	1
in	1
it,	1
became	1
quite	1
pleasant	1
again.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
say,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
calming	1
down,	1
"you	1
are	1
a	1
wonderful	1
fellow!	1
What	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
said	1
is	1
good,	1
very	1
good.	1
Of	1
course	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
me.	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
met	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time...	1
not	1
since	1
we	1
were	1
children.	1
You	1
might	1
think	1
that	1
I...	1
I	1
understand,	1
quite	1
understand.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
myself,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
courage,	1
but	1
it's	1
splendid.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
acquaintance.	1
It's	1
queer,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
suspected	1
me!"	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it!	1
I	1
hope	1
we'll	1
get	1
better	1
acquainted,"	1
and	1
he	1
pressed	1
Boris'	1
hand.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
sent	1
for	1
me....	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
one	1
do?"	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
think	1
Napoleon	1
will	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
army	1
across?"	1
asked	1
Boris	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
Boris	1
wished	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition.	1
	1
A	1
footman	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
summon	1
Boris--the	1
princess	1
was	1
going.	1
Pierre,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
Boris'	1
better	1
acquaintance,	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
warmly	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
looked	1
affectionately	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
into	1
Boris'	1
eyes.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
Pierre	1
continued	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
no	1
longer	1
piercing	1
an	1
imaginary	1
foe	1
with	1
his	1
imaginary	1
sword,	1
but	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
that	1
pleasant,	1
intelligent,	1
and	1
resolute	1
young	1
man.	1
	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
in	1
early	1
youth,	1
especially	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
leads	1
a	1
lonely	1
life,	1
he	1
felt	1
an	1
unaccountable	1
tenderness	1
for	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
friends.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
saw	1
the	1
princess	1
off.	1
She	1
held	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
tearful.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
dreadful,	1
dreadful!"	1
she	1
was	1
saying,	1
"but	1
cost	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
duty.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
night.	1
He	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
like	1
this.	1
Every	1
moment	1
is	1
precious.	1
I	1
can't	1
think	1
why	1
his	1
nieces	1
put	1
it	1
off.	1
Perhaps	1
God	1
will	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
prepare	1
him!...	1
Adieu,	1
Prince!	1
May	1
God	1
support	1
you..."	1
	1
"Adieu,	1
ma	1
bonne,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
state,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
carriage.	1
"He	1
hardly	1
recognizes	1
anybody."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand,	1
Mamma--what	1
is	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
Pierre?"	1
asked	1
the	1
son.	1
	1
"The	1
will	1
will	1
show	1
that,	1
my	1
dear;	1
our	1
fate	1
also	1
depends	1
on	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
anything?"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear!	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
rich,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
poor!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
sufficient	1
reason,	1
Mamma..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Heaven!	1
How	1
ill	1
he	1
is!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
mother.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
After	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
had	1
driven	1
off	1
with	1
her	1
son	1
to	1
visit	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov,	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
all	1
alone	1
applying	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
her	1
eyes.	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
rang.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
she	1
said	1
crossly	1
to	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
kept	1
her	1
waiting	1
some	1
minutes.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
serve	1
me?	1
Then	1
I'll	1
find	1
you	1
another	1
place."	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
upset	1
by	1
her	1
friend's	1
sorrow	1
and	1
humiliating	1
poverty,	1
and	1
was	1
therefore	1
out	1
of	1
sorts,	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
with	1
her	1
always	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
calling	1
her	1
maid	1
"my	1
dear"	1
and	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
politeness.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry,	1
ma'am,"	1
answered	1
the	1
maid.	1
	1
"Ask	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
came	1
waddling	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
guilty	1
look	1
as	1
usual.	1
	1
"Well,	1
little	1
countess?	1
What	1
a	1
saute	1
of	1
game	1
au	1
madere	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
have,	1
my	1
dear!	1
I	1
tasted	1
it.	1
The	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
I	1
paid	1
for	1
Taras	1
were	1
not	1
ill-	1
spent.	1
He	1
is	1
worth	1
it!"	1
	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
wife,	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
ruffling	1
his	1
gray	1
hair.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
your	1
commands,	1
little	1
countess?"	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
dear...	1
What's	1
that	1
mess?"	1
she	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
waistcoat.	1
"It's	1
the	1
saute,	1
most	1
likely,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
Count,	1
I	1
want	1
some	1
money."	1
	1
Her	1
face	1
became	1
sad.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
little	1
countess!"...	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
began	1
bustling	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
his	1
pocketbook.	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
Count!	1
I	1
want	1
five	1
hundred	1
rubles,"	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
her	1
cambric	1
handkerchief	1
she	1
began	1
wiping	1
her	1
husband's	1
waistcoat.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
immediately,	1
immediately!	1
Hey,	1
who's	1
there?"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
only	1
used	1
by	1
persons	1
who	1
are	1
certain	1
that	1
those	1
they	1
call	1
will	1
rush	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
summons.	1
"Send	1
Dmitri	1
to	1
me!"	1
	1
Dmitri,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house	1
and	1
now	1
managed	1
all	1
his	1
affairs,	1
stepped	1
softly	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
want,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
the	1
deferential	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
entered.	1
"Bring	1
me..."	1
he	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment,	1
"yes,	1
bring	1
me	1
seven	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
yes!	1
But	1
mind,	1
don't	1
bring	1
me	1
such	1
tattered	1
and	1
dirty	1
notes	1
as	1
last	1
time,	1
but	1
nice	1
clean	1
ones	1
for	1
the	1
countess."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Dmitri,	1
clean	1
ones,	1
please,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
sighing	1
deeply.	1
	1
"When	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
them,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
asked	1
Dmitri.	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
inform	1
you...	1
But,	1
don't	1
be	1
uneasy,"	1
he	1
added,	1
noticing	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
breathe	1
heavily	1
and	1
quickly	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
approaching	1
anger.	1
"I	1
was	1
forgetting...	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
it	1
brought	1
at	1
once?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes;	1
just	1
so!	1
Bring	1
it.	1
Give	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
countess."	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
treasure	1
that	1
Dmitri	1
is,"	1
added	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
when	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
departed.	1
"There	1
is	1
never	1
any	1
'impossible'	1
with	1
him.	1
That's	1
a	1
thing	1
I	1
hate!	1
Everything	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
money,	1
Count,	1
money!	1
How	1
much	1
sorrow	1
it	1
causes	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
great	1
need	1
of	1
this	1
sum."	1
	1
"You,	1
my	1
little	1
countess,	1
are	1
a	1
notorious	1
spendthrift,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
having	1
kissed	1
his	1
wife's	1
hand	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
	1
When	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
from	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
the	1
money,	1
all	1
in	1
clean	1
notes,	1
was	1
lying	1
ready	1
under	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
on	1
the	1
countess'	1
little	1
table,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
noticed	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
agitating	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
state	1
he	1
is	1
in!	1
One	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
him,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill!	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
there	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
and	1
hardly	1
said	1
a	1
word..."	1
	1
"Annette,	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
don't	1
refuse	1
me,"	1
the	1
countess	1
began,	1
with	1
a	1
blush	1
that	1
looked	1
very	1
strange	1
on	1
her	1
thin,	1
dignified,	1
elderly	1
face,	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
handkerchief.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
instantly	1
guessed	1
her	1
intention	1
and	1
stooped	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
countess	1
at	1
the	1
appropriate	1
moment.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
for	1
Boris	1
from	1
me,	1
for	1
his	1
outfit."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
was	1
already	1
embracing	1
her	1
and	1
weeping.	1
The	1
countess	1
wept	1
too.	1
They	1
wept	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
friends,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
kindhearted,	1
and	1
because	1
they--friends	1
from	1
childhood--had	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
base	1
thing	1
as	1
money,	1
and	1
because	1
their	1
youth	1
was	1
over....	1
But	1
those	1
tears	1
were	1
pleasant	1
to	1
them	1
both.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Countess	1
Rostova,	1
with	1
her	1
daughters	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
guests,	1
was	1
already	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
count	1
took	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
showed	1
them	1
his	1
choice	1
collection	1
of	1
Turkish	1
pipes.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
ask:	1
"Hasn't	1
she	1
come	1
yet?"	1
They	1
were	1
expecting	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
Akhrosimova,	1
known	1
in	1
society	1
as	1
le	1
terrible	1
dragon,	1
a	1
lady	1
distinguished	1
not	1
for	1
wealth	1
or	1
rank,	1
but	1
for	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
frank	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
Moscow	1
and	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
both	1
cities	1
wondered	1
at	1
her,	1
laughed	1
privately	1
at	1
her	1
rudenesses,	1
and	1
told	1
good	1
stories	1
about	1
her,	1
while	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
all	1
without	1
exception	1
respected	1
and	1
feared	1
her.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
count's	1
room,	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
tobacco	1
smoke,	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
war	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
announced	1
in	1
a	1
manifesto,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
recruiting.	1
None	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
yet	1
seen	1
the	1
manifesto,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
knew	1
it	1
had	1
appeared.	1
The	1
count	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
between	1
two	1
guests	1
who	1
were	1
smoking	1
and	1
talking.	1
He	1
neither	1
smoked	1
nor	1
talked,	1
but	1
bending	1
his	1
head	1
first	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
watched	1
the	1
smokers	1
with	1
evident	1
pleasure	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
neighbors,	1
whom	1
he	1
egged	1
on	1
against	1
each	1
other.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
sallow,	1
clean-shaven	1
civilian	1
with	1
a	1
thin	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
face,	1
already	1
growing	1
old,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
like	1
a	1
most	1
fashionable	1
young	1
man.	1
He	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
as	1
if	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1
and,	1
having	1
stuck	1
an	1
amber	1
mouthpiece	1
far	1
into	1
his	1
mouth,	1
was	1
inhaling	1
the	1
smoke	1
spasmodically	1
and	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
This	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
bachelor,	1
Shinshin,	1
a	1
cousin	1
of	1
the	1
countess',	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
"a	1
sharp	1
tongue"	1
as	1
they	1
said	1
in	1
Moscow	1
society.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
condescending	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
The	1
latter,	1
a	1
fresh,	1
rosy	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
irreproachably	1
washed,	1
brushed,	1
and	1
buttoned,	1
held	1
his	1
pipe	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
with	1
red	1
lips	1
gently	1
inhaled	1
the	1
smoke,	1
letting	1
it	1
escape	1
from	1
his	1
handsome	1
mouth	1
in	1
rings.	1
This	1
was	1
Lieutenant	1
Berg,	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment	1
with	1
whom	1
Boris	1
was	1
to	1
travel	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
about	1
whom	1
Natasha	1
had	1
teased	1
her	1
elder	1
sister	1
Vera,	1
speaking	1
of	1
Berg	1
as	1
her	1
"intended."	1
The	1
count	1
sat	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
listened	1
attentively.	1
His	1
favorite	1
occupation	1
when	1
not	1
playing	1
boston,	1
a	1
card	1
game	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of,	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
listener,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
setting	1
two	1
loquacious	1
talkers	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
old	1
chap,	1
mon	1
tres	1
honorable	1
Alphonse	1
Karlovich,"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
laughing	1
ironically	1
and	1
mixing	1
the	1
most	1
ordinary	1
Russian	1
expressions	1
with	1
the	1
choicest	1
French	1
phrases--which	1
was	1
a	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
his	1
speech.	1
"Vous	1
comptez	1
vous	1
faire	1
des	1
rentes	1
sur	1
l'etat;	1
*	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
company?"	1
	1
	1
*	1
You	1
expect	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
income	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
	1
"No,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich;	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry	1
the	1
advantages	1
are	1
far	1
less	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
infantry.	1
Just	1
consider	1
my	1
own	1
position	1
now,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich..."	1
	1
Berg	1
always	1
spoke	1
quietly,	1
politely,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
precision.	1
His	1
conversation	1
always	1
related	1
entirely	1
to	1
himself;	1
he	1
would	1
remain	1
calm	1
and	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
talk	1
related	1
to	1
any	1
topic	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
direct	1
bearing	1
on	1
himself.	1
He	1
could	1
remain	1
silent	1
for	1
hours	1
without	1
being	1
at	1
all	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
countenance	1
himself	1
or	1
making	1
others	1
uncomfortable,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
conversation	1
concerned	1
himself	1
he	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
circumstantially	1
and	1
with	1
evident	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
"Consider	1
my	1
position,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich.	1
Were	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry	1
I	1
should	1
get	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
every	1
four	1
months,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
lieutenant;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
receive	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty,"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
Shinshin	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
a	1
joyful,	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
obvious	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
success	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
desire	1
of	1
everyone	1
else.	1
	1
"Besides	1
that,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich,	1
by	1
exchanging	1
into	1
the	1
Guards	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
prominent	1
position,"	1
continued	1
Berg,	1
"and	1
vacancies	1
occur	1
much	1
more	1
frequently	1
in	1
the	1
Foot	1
Guards.	1
Then	1
just	1
think	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
rubles!	1
I	1
even	1
manage	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
little	1
aside	1
and	1
to	1
send	1
something	1
to	1
my	1
father,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
emitting	1
a	1
smoke	1
ring.	1
	1
"La	1
balance	1
y	1
est...	1
*	1
A	1
German	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
skin	1
a	1
flint,	1
as	1
the	1
proverb	1
says,"	1
remarked	1
Shinshin,	1
moving	1
his	1
pipe	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
winking	1
at	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
	1
*	1
So	1
that	1
squares	1
matters.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
The	1
other	1
guests	1
seeing	1
that	1
Shinshin	1
was	1
talking	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
listen.	1
Berg,	1
oblivious	1
of	1
irony	1
or	1
indifference,	1
continued	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
by	1
exchanging	1
into	1
the	1
Guards	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
gained	1
a	1
step	1
on	1
his	1
old	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
Cadet	1
Corps;	1
how	1
in	1
wartime	1
the	1
company	1
commander	1
might	1
get	1
killed	1
and	1
he,	1
as	1
senior	1
in	1
the	1
company,	1
might	1
easily	1
succeed	1
to	1
the	1
post;	1
how	1
popular	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
how	1
satisfied	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
Berg	1
evidently	1
enjoyed	1
narrating	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
suspect	1
that	1
others,	1
too,	1
might	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
interests.	1
But	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
so	1
prettily	1
sedate,	1
and	1
the	1
naivete	1
of	1
his	1
youthful	1
egotism	1
was	1
so	1
obvious,	1
that	1
he	1
disarmed	1
his	1
hearers.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
boy,	1
you'll	1
get	1
along	1
wherever	1
you	1
go--foot	1
or	1
horse--that	1
I'll	1
warrant,"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
patting	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
feet	1
off	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
Berg	1
smiled	1
joyously.	1
The	1
count,	1
by	1
his	1
guests,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
moment	1
before	1
a	1
big	1
dinner	1
when	1
the	1
assembled	1
guests,	1
expecting	1
the	1
summons	1
to	1
zakuska,	1
*	1
avoid	1
engaging	1
in	1
any	1
long	1
conversation	1
but	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
move	1
about	1
and	1
talk,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
impatient	1
for	1
their	1
food.	1
The	1
host	1
and	1
hostess	1
look	1
toward	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
glance	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
visitors	1
try	1
to	1
guess	1
from	1
these	1
glances	1
who,	1
or	1
what,	1
they	1
are	1
waiting	1
for--some	1
important	1
relation	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived,	1
or	1
a	1
dish	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
ready.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Hors	1
d'oeuvres.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
come	1
just	1
at	1
dinnertime	1
and	1
was	1
sitting	1
awkwardly	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
chair	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
across,	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
everyone.	1
The	1
countess	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
talk,	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
naively	1
looking	1
around	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
somebody	1
and	1
answered	1
all	1
her	1
questions	1
in	1
monosyllables.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
fact.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
guests,	1
knowing	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
with	1
the	1
bear,	1
looked	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
this	1
big,	1
stout,	1
quiet	1
man,	1
wondering	1
how	1
such	1
a	1
clumsy,	1
modest	1
fellow	1
could	1
have	1
played	1
such	1
a	1
prank	1
on	1
a	1
policeman.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
only	1
lately	1
arrived?"	1
the	1
countess	1
asked	1
him.	1
	1
"Oui,	1
madame,"	1
replied	1
he,	1
looking	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
my	1
husband?"	1
	1
"Non,	1
madame."	1
He	1
smiled	1
quite	1
inappropriately.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
Paris	1
recently,	1
I	1
believe?	1
I	1
suppose	1
it's	1
very	1
interesting."	1
	1
"Very	1
interesting."	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
The	1
latter	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
being	1
asked	1
to	1
entertain	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
his	1
father;	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
her,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
countess,	1
only	1
in	1
monosyllables.	1
The	1
other	1
guests	1
were	1
all	1
conversing	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
"The	1
Razumovskis...	1
It	1
was	1
charming...	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
kind...	1
Countess	1
Apraksina..."	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
The	1
countess	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Dmitrievna?"	1
came	1
her	1
voice	1
from	1
there.	1
	1
"Herself,"	1
came	1
the	1
answer	1
in	1
a	1
rough	1
voice,	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
unmarried	1
ladies	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
married	1
ones	1
except	1
the	1
very	1
oldest	1
rose.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Tall	1
and	1
stout,	1
holding	1
high	1
her	1
fifty-year-old	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
curls,	1
she	1
stood	1
surveying	1
the	1
guests,	1
and	1
leisurely	1
arranged	1
her	1
wide	1
sleeves	1
as	1
if	1
rolling	1
them	1
up.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
always	1
spoke	1
in	1
Russian.	1
	1
"Health	1
and	1
happiness	1
to	1
her	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
we	1
are	1
keeping	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
children,"	1
she	1
said,	1
in	1
her	1
loud,	1
full-toned	1
voice	1
which	1
drowned	1
all	1
others.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
old	1
sinner,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
who	1
was	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand,	1
"you're	1
feeling	1
dull	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
I	1
daresay?	1
Nowhere	1
to	1
hunt	1
with	1
your	1
dogs?	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
old	1
man?	1
Just	1
see	1
how	1
these	1
nestlings	1
are	1
growing	1
up,"	1
and	1
she	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
girls.	1
"You	1
must	1
look	1
for	1
husbands	1
for	1
them	1
whether	1
you	1
like	1
it	1
or	1
not...."	1
	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"how's	1
my	1
Cossack?"	1
(Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
always	1
called	1
Natasha	1
a	1
Cossack)	1
and	1
she	1
stroked	1
the	1
child's	1
arm	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
fearless	1
and	1
gay	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand.	1
"I	1
know	1
she's	1
a	1
scamp	1
of	1
a	1
girl,	1
but	1
I	1
like	1
her."	1
	1
She	1
took	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
pear-shaped	1
ruby	1
earrings	1
from	1
her	1
huge	1
reticule	1
and,	1
having	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
rosy	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
beamed	1
with	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
her	1
saint's-day	1
fete,	1
turned	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
addressed	1
herself	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
eh,	1
friend!	1
Come	1
here	1
a	1
bit,"	1
said	1
she,	1
assuming	1
a	1
soft	1
high	1
tone	1
of	1
voice.	1
"Come	1
here,	1
my	1
friend..."	1
and	1
she	1
ominously	1
tucked	1
up	1
her	1
sleeves	1
still	1
higher.	1
Pierre	1
approached,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
childlike	1
way	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Come	1
nearer,	1
come	1
nearer,	1
friend!	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
to	1
tell	1
your	1
father	1
the	1
truth	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
favor,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
case	1
it's	1
my	1
evident	1
duty."	1
She	1
paused.	1
All	1
were	1
silent,	1
expectant	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
clearly	1
only	1
a	1
prelude.	1
	1
"A	1
fine	1
lad!	1
My	1
word!	1
A	1
fine	1
lad!...	1
His	1
father	1
lies	1
on	1
his	1
deathbed	1
and	1
he	1
amuses	1
himself	1
setting	1
a	1
policeman	1
astride	1
a	1
bear!	1
For	1
shame,	1
sir,	1
for	1
shame!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
if	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
war."	1
	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
from	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
table?"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
went	1
in	1
first	1
with	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
the	1
countess	1
followed	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
a	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
them	1
because	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
regiment;	1
then	1
came	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
Shinshin.	1
Berg	1
gave	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
Vera.	1
The	1
smiling	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
Nicholas.	1
After	1
them	1
other	1
couples	1
followed,	1
filling	1
the	1
whole	1
dining	1
hall,	1
and	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children,	1
tutors,	1
and	1
governesses	1
followed	1
singly.	1
The	1
footmen	1
began	1
moving	1
about,	1
chairs	1
scraped,	1
the	1
band	1
struck	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
gallery,	1
and	1
the	1
guests	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
places.	1
Then	1
the	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
household	1
band	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
forks,	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
visitors,	1
and	1
the	1
soft	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
footmen.	1
At	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
sat	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
on	1
her	1
right	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
on	1
her	1
left,	1
the	1
other	1
lady	1
visitors	1
were	1
farther	1
down.	1
At	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
sat	1
the	1
count,	1
with	1
the	1
hussar	1
colonel	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
and	1
Shinshin	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
male	1
visitors	1
on	1
his	1
right.	1
Midway	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
table	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
sat	1
the	1
grownup	1
young	1
people:	1
Vera	1
beside	1
Berg,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
beside	1
Boris;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
the	1
children,	1
tutors,	1
and	1
governesses.	1
From	1
behind	1
the	1
crystal	1
decanters	1
and	1
fruit	1
vases,	1
the	1
count	1
kept	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
tall	1
cap	1
with	1
its	1
light-blue	1
ribbons,	1
and	1
busily	1
filled	1
his	1
neighbors'	1
glasses,	1
not	1
neglecting	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
countess	1
in	1
turn,	1
without	1
omitting	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess,	1
threw	1
significant	1
glances	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
pineapples	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
whose	1
face	1
and	1
bald	1
head	1
seemed	1
by	1
their	1
redness	1
to	1
contrast	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
with	1
his	1
gray	1
hair.	1
At	1
the	1
ladies'	1
end	1
an	1
even	1
chatter	1
of	1
voices	1
was	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
at	1
the	1
men's	1
end	1
the	1
voices	1
sounded	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
especially	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars	1
who,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
flushed,	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
held	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
pattern	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
guests.	1
Berg	1
with	1
tender	1
smiles	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
Vera	1
that	1
love	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
earthly	1
but	1
a	1
heavenly	1
feeling.	1
Boris	1
was	1
telling	1
his	1
new	1
friend	1
Pierre	1
who	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
and	1
exchanging	1
glances	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite.	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
little	1
but	1
examined	1
the	1
new	1
faces,	1
and	1
ate	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
Of	1
the	1
two	1
soups	1
he	1
chose	1
turtle	1
with	1
savory	1
patties	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
game	1
without	1
omitting	1
a	1
single	1
dish	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wines.	1
These	1
latter	1
the	1
butler	1
thrust	1
mysteriously	1
forward,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
napkin,	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
next	1
man's	1
shoulders	1
and	1
whispered:	1
"Dry	1
Madeira"...	1
"Hungarian"...	1
or	1
"Rhine	1
wine"	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be.	1
Of	1
the	1
four	1
crystal	1
glasses	1
engraved	1
with	1
the	1
count's	1
monogram	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
his	1
plate,	1
Pierre	1
held	1
out	1
one	1
at	1
random	1
and	1
drank	1
with	1
enjoyment,	1
gazing	1
with	1
ever-	1
increasing	1
amiability	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
guests.	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite,	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
Boris	1
as	1
girls	1
of	1
thirteen	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
boy	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
and	1
have	1
just	1
kissed	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
Sometimes	1
that	1
same	1
look	1
fell	1
on	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
that	1
funny	1
lively	1
little	1
girl's	1
look	1
made	1
him	1
inclined	1
to	1
laugh	1
without	1
knowing	1
why.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
sat	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
Sonya,	1
beside	1
Julie	1
Karagina,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
talking	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
involuntary	1
smile.	1
Sonya	1
wore	1
a	1
company	1
smile	1
but	1
was	1
evidently	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy;	1
now	1
she	1
turned	1
pale,	1
now	1
blushed	1
and	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
overhear	1
what	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Julie	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
governess	1
kept	1
looking	1
round	1
uneasily	1
as	1
if	1
preparing	1
to	1
resent	1
any	1
slight	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
put	1
upon	1
the	1
children.	1
The	1
German	1
tutor	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
all	1
the	1
dishes,	1
wines,	1
and	1
kinds	1
of	1
dessert,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
full	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
Germany;	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
greatly	1
offended	1
when	1
the	1
butler	1
with	1
a	1
bottle	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
napkin	1
passed	1
him	1
by.	1
He	1
frowned,	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
of	1
that	1
wine,	1
but	1
was	1
mortified	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
quench	1
his	1
thirst	1
or	1
from	1
greediness	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
it,	1
but	1
simply	1
from	1
a	1
conscientious	1
desire	1
for	1
knowledge.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
At	1
the	1
men's	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
talk	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
The	1
colonel	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
declaration	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
already	1
appeared	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
copy,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
seen,	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
been	1
forwarded	1
by	1
courier	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
the	1
deuce	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
fight	1
Bonaparte?"	1
remarked	1
Shinshin.	1
"He	1
has	1
stopped	1
Austria's	1
cackle	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
our	1
turn	1
next."	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
tall,	1
plethoric	1
German,	1
evidently	1
devoted	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
patriotically	1
Russian.	1
He	1
resented	1
Shinshin's	1
remark.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
reasson,	1
my	1
goot	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he,	1
speaking	1
with	1
a	1
German	1
accent,	1
"for	1
the	1
reasson	1
zat	1
ze	1
Emperor	1
knows	1
zat.	1
He	1
declares	1
in	1
ze	1
manifessto	1

and	1
dignity	1
of	1
ze	1
Empire	1
as	1
vell	1
as	1
ze	1
sanctity	1
of	1
its	1
alliances..."	1
he	1
spoke	1
this	1
last	1
word	1
with	1
particular	1
emphasis	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
it	1
lay	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
Then	1
with	1
the	1
unerring	1
official	1
memory	1
that	1
characterized	1
him	1
he	1
repeated	1
from	1
the	1
opening	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
manifesto:	1
	1
...	1
and	1
the	1
wish,	1
which	1
constitutes	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
sole	1
and	1
absolute	1
aim-	1
-to	1
establish	1
peace	1
in	1
Europe	1
on	1
firm	1
foundations--has	1
now	1
decided	1
him	1
to	1
despatch	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
abroad	1
and	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
new	1
condition	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
that	1
purpose.	1
	1
"Zat,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
is	1
vy..."	1
he	1
concluded,	1
drinking	1
a	1
tumbler	1
of	1
wine	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
looking	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
for	1
approval.	1
	1
"Connaissez-vous	1
le	1
Proverbe:	1
*	1
'Jerome,	1
Jerome,	1
do	1
not	1
roam,	1
but	1
turn	1
spindles	1
at	1
home!'?"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
puckering	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
smiling.	1
"Cela	1
nous	1
convient	1
a	1
merveille.*(2)	1
Suvorov	1
now--he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about;	1
yet	1
they	1
beat	1
him	1
a	1
plate	1
couture,*(3)	1
and	1
where	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
find	1
Suvorovs	1
now?	1
Je	1
vous	1
demande	1

said	1
he,	1
continually	1
changing	1
from	1
French	1
to	1
Russian.	1
	1
	1
*Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1

That	1

	1

Hollow.	1
	1
*(4)	1
I	1
just	1
ask	1

	1
"Ve	1
must	1
vight	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
tr-r-op	1
of	1
our	1
plood!"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel,	1
thumping	1
the	1
table;	1
"and	1
ve	1
must	1
tie	1
for	1
our	1
Emperor,	1
and	1

pe	1

And	1
ve	1
must	1
discuss	1
it	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
po-o-ossible"...	1
he	1
dwelt	1
particularly	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
possible...	1
"as	1
po-o-ossible,"	1
he	1
ended,	1
again	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
"Zat	1
is	1
how	1
ve	1
old	1
hussars	1
look	1
at	1

and	1
zere's	1
an	1

of	1

And	1
how	1
do	1
you,	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
hussar,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
judge	1
of	1
it?"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
being	1
discussed	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
his	1
partner	1
with	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
intent	1
on	1
the	1
colonel.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
quite	1
of	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
flaming	1
up,	1
turning	1
his	1
plate	1
round	1
and	1
moving	1
his	1
wineglasses	1
about	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
decision	1
and	1
desperation	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
facing	1
some	1
great	1
danger.	1
"I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
we	1
Russians	1
must	1
die	1
or	1
conquer,"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
conscious--as	1
were	1
others--after	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
uttered	1
that	1
his	1
remarks	1
were	1
too	1
enthusiastic	1
and	1
emphatic	1
for	1
the	1
occasion	1
and	1
were	1
therefore	1
awkward.	1
	1
"What	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
was	1
splendid!"	1
said	1
his	1
partner	1
Julie.	1
	1
Sonya	1
trembled	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
blushed	1
to	1
her	1
ears	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
and	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
while	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
speaking.	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
colonel's	1
speech	1
and	1
nodded	1
approvingly.	1
	1
"That's	1
fine,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"The	1
young	1
man's	1
a	1
real	1
hussar!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
colonel,	1
again	1
thumping	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
noise	1
about	1
over	1
there?"	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
deep	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
inquired	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
thumping	1
the	1
table	1
for?"	1
she	1
demanded	1
of	1
the	1
hussar,	1
"and	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
exciting	1
yourself?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
French	1
are	1
here?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
speaking	1
ze	1
truce,"	1
replied	1
the	1
hussar	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
war,"	1
the	1
count	1
shouted	1
down	1
the	1
table.	1
"You	1
know	1
my	1
son's	1
going,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna?	1
My	1
son	1
is	1
going."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
four	1
sons	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
don't	1
fret.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
God's	1
hands.	1
You	1
may	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
bed	1
or	1
God	1
may	1
spare	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
battle,"	1
replied	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
deep	1
voice,	1
which	1
easily	1
carried	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"That's	1
true!"	1
	1
Once	1
more	1
the	1
conversations	1
concentrated,	1
the	1
ladies'	1
at	1
the	1
one	1
end	1
and	1
the	1
men's	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
ask,"	1
Natasha's	1
little	1
brother	1
was	1
saying;	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
won't	1
ask!"	1
	1
"I	1
will,"	1
replied	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
flushed	1
with	1
reckless	1
and	1
joyous	1
resolution.	1
She	1
half	1
rose,	1
by	1
a	1
glance	1
inviting	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite,	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
coming,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
mother:	1
	1
"Mamma!"	1
rang	1
out	1
the	1
clear	1
contralto	1
notes	1
of	1
her	1
childish	1
voice,	1
audible	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess,	1
startled;	1
but	1
seeing	1
by	1
her	1
daughter's	1
face	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
mischief,	1
she	1
shook	1
a	1
finger	1
at	1
her	1
sternly	1
with	1
a	1
threatening	1
and	1
forbidding	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
hushed.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
What	1
sweets	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
have?"	1
and	1
Natasha's	1
voice	1
sounded	1
still	1
more	1
firm	1
and	1
resolute.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
tried	1
to	1
frown,	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
shook	1
her	1
fat	1
finger.	1
	1
"Cossack!"	1
she	1
said	1
threateningly.	1
	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
guests,	1
uncertain	1
how	1
to	1
regard	1
this	1
sally,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
"You	1
had	1
better	1
take	1
care!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
What	1
sweets	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
have?"	1
Natasha	1
again	1
cried	1
boldly,	1
with	1
saucy	1
gaiety,	1
confident	1
that	1
her	1
prank	1
would	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
good	1
part.	1
	1
Sonya	1
and	1
fat	1
little	1
Petya	1
doubled	1
up	1
with	1
laughter.	1
	1
"You	1
see!	1
I	1
have	1
asked,"	1
whispered	1
Natasha	1
to	1
her	1
little	1
brother	1
and	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
glancing	1
at	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
"Ice	1
pudding,	1
but	1
you	1
won't	1
get	1
any,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
Natasha	1
saw	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
braved	1
even	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Dmitrievna!	1
What	1
kind	1
of	1
ice	1
pudding?	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
ice	1
cream."	1
	1
"Carrot	1
ices."	1
	1
"No!	1
What	1
kind,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna?	1
What	1
kind?"	1
she	1
almost	1
screamed;	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
know!"	1
	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
joined	1
in.	1
Everyone	1
laughed,	1
not	1
at	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
answer	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
incredible	1
boldness	1
and	1
smartness	1
of	1
this	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
dared	1
to	1
treat	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
in	1
this	1
fashion.	1
	1
Natasha	1
only	1
desisted	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
pineapple	1
ice.	1
Before	1
the	1
ices,	1
champagne	1
was	1
served	1
round.	1
The	1
band	1
again	1
struck	1
up,	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
kissed,	1
and	1
the	1
guests,	1
leaving	1
their	1
seats,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
"congratulate"	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
reached	1
across	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
clink	1
glasses	1
with	1
the	1
count,	1
with	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
Again	1
the	1
footmen	1
rushed	1
about,	1
chairs	1
scraped,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
order	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
but	1
with	1
redder	1
faces,	1
the	1
guests	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
study.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
The	1
card	1
tables	1
were	1
drawn	1
out,	1
sets	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
boston,	1
and	1
the	1
count's	1
visitors	1
settled	1
themselves,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
drawing	1
rooms,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
library.	1
	1
The	1
count,	1
holding	1
his	1
cards	1
fanwise,	1
kept	1
himself	1
with	1
difficulty	1
from	1
dropping	1
into	1
his	1
usual	1
after-dinner	1
nap,	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
everything.	1
The	1
young	1
people,	1
at	1
the	1
countess'	1
instigation,	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
harp.	1
Julie	1
by	1
general	1
request	1
played	1
first.	1
After	1
she	1
had	1
played	1
a	1
little	1
air	1
with	1
variations	1
on	1
the	1
harp,	1
she	1
joined	1
the	1
other	1
young	1
ladies	1
in	1
begging	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
were	1
noted	1
for	1
their	1
musical	1
talent,	1
to	1
sing	1
something.	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
treated	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
grown	1
up,	1
was	1
evidently	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
felt	1
shy.	1
	1
"What	1
shall	1
we	1
sing?"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"'The	1
Brook,'"	1
suggested	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
let's	1
be	1
quick.	1
Boris,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"But	1
where	1
is	1
Sonya?"	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
her	1
friend	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
ran	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
Running	1
into	1
Sonya's	1
room	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
her	1
there,	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
nursery,	1
but	1
Sonya	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
either.	1
Natasha	1
concluded	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
The	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
was	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
mourning	1
for	1
the	1
younger	1
female	1
generation	1
in	1
the	1
Rostov	1
household.	1
And	1
there	1
in	1
fact	1
was	1
Sonya	1
lying	1
face	1
downward	1
on	1
Nurse's	1
dirty	1
feather	1
bed	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
chest,	1
crumpling	1
her	1
gauzy	1
pink	1
dress	1
under	1
her,	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
fingers,	1
and	1
sobbing	1
so	1
convulsively	1
that	1
her	1
bare	1
little	1
shoulders	1
shook.	1
Natasha's	1
face,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
radiantly	1
happy	1
all	1
that	1
saint's	1
day,	1
suddenly	1
changed:	1
her	1
eyes	1
became	1
fixed,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
shiver	1
passed	1
down	1
her	1
broad	1
neck	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
her	1
mouth	1
drooped.	1
	1
"Sonya!	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter?...	1
Oo...	1
Oo...	1
Oo...!"	1
And	1
Natasha's	1
large	1
mouth	1
widened,	1
making	1
her	1
look	1
quite	1
ugly,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
wail	1
like	1
a	1
baby	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
except	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
crying.	1
Sonya	1
tried	1
to	1
lift	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
answer	1
but	1
could	1
not,	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
still	1
deeper	1
in	1
the	1
bed.	1
Natasha	1
wept,	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
blue-striped	1
feather	1
bed	1
and	1
hugging	1
her	1
friend.	1
With	1
an	1
effort	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
wiping	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
explaining.	1
	1
"Nicholas	1
is	1
going	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
week's	1
time,	1
his...	1
papers...	1
have	1
come...	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
himself...	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
cry,"	1
and	1
she	1
showed	1
a	1
paper	1
she	1
held	1
in	1
her	1
hand--with	1
the	1
verses	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
written,	1
"still,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
cry,	1
but	1
you	1
can't...	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
understand...	1
what	1
a	1
soul	1
he	1
has!"	1
	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
again	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
noble	1
soul.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you...	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
envious...	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
Boris	1
also,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
gaining	1
a	1
little	1
strength;	1
"he	1
is	1
nice...	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
difficulties	1
in	1
your	1
way....	1
But	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
my	1
cousin...	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
to...	1
the	1
Metropolitan	1
himself...	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
done.	1
And	1
besides,	1
if	1
she	1
tells	1
Mamma"	1
(Sonya	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
called	1
her	1
so)	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
spoiling	1
Nicholas'	1
career	1
and	1
am	1
heartless	1
and	1
ungrateful,	1
while	1
truly...	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,"	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross,	1
"I	1
love	1
her	1
so	1
much,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
you,	1
only	1
Vera...	1
And	1
what	1
for?	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
her?	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
willingly	1
sacrifice	1
everything,	1
only	1
I	1
have	1
nothing...."	1
	1
Sonya	1
could	1
not	1
continue,	1
and	1
again	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
feather	1
bed.	1
Natasha	1
began	1
consoling	1
her,	1
but	1
her	1
face	1
showed	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
her	1
friend's	1
trouble.	1
	1
"Sonya,"	1
she	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
guessed	1
the	1
true	1
reason	1
of	1
her	1
friend's	1
sorrow,	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
Vera	1
has	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
you	1
since	1
dinner?	1
Hasn't	1
she?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
these	1
verses	1
Nicholas	1
wrote	1
himself	1
and	1
I	1
copied	1
some	1
others,	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
them	1
on	1
my	1
table	1
and	1
said	1
she'd	1
show	1
them	1
to	1
Mamma,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
ungrateful,	1
and	1
that	1
Mamma	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
me,	1
but	1
that	1
he'll	1
marry	1
Julie.	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
he's	1
been	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
day...	1
Natasha,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
deserve	1
it?..."	1
	1
And	1
again	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
sob,	1
more	1
bitterly	1
than	1
before.	1
Natasha	1
lifted	1
her	1
up,	1
hugged	1
her,	1
and,	1
smiling	1
through	1
her	1
tears,	1
began	1
comforting	1
her.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
don't	1
believe	1
her,	1
darling!	1
Don't	1
believe	1
her!	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
and	1
Nicholas,	1
all	1
three	1
of	1
us,	1
talked	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
after	1
supper?	1
Why,	1
we	1
settled	1
how	1
everything	1
was	1
to	1
be.	1
I	1
don't	1
quite	1
remember	1
how,	1
but	1
don't	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
all	1
be	1
arranged	1
and	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
was?	1
There's	1
Uncle	1
Shinshin's	1
brother	1
has	1
married	1
his	1
first	1
cousin.	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
only	1
second	1
cousins,	1
you	1
know.	1
And	1
Boris	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
possible.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
clever	1
and	1
so	1
good!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
cry,	1
Sonya,	1
dear	1
love,	1
darling	1
Sonya!"	1
and	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
and	1
laughed.	1
"Vera's	1
spiteful;	1
never	1
mind	1
her!	1
And	1
all	1
will	1
come	1
right	1
and	1
she	1
won't	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
Mamma.	1
Nicholas	1
will	1
tell	1
her	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
doesn't	1
care	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
Julie."	1
	1
Natasha	1
kissed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
hair.	1
	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
up.	1
The	1
little	1
kitten	1
brightened,	1
its	1
eyes	1
shone,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
ready	1
to	1
lift	1
its	1
tail,	1
jump	1
down	1
on	1
its	1
soft	1
paws,	1
and	1
begin	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
worsted	1
as	1
a	1
kitten	1
should.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
so?...	1
Really?	1
Truly?"	1
she	1
said,	1
quickly	1
smoothing	1
her	1
frock	1
and	1
hair.	1
	1
"Really,	1
truly!"	1
answered	1
Natasha,	1
pushing	1
in	1
a	1
crisp	1
lock	1
that	1
had	1
strayed	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
friend's	1
plaits.	1
	1
Both	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Well,	1
let's	1
go	1
and	1
sing	1
'The	1
Brook.'"	1
	1
"Come	1
along!"	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
fat	1
Pierre	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite	1
me	1
is	1
so	1
funny!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
stopping	1
suddenly.	1
"I	1
feel	1
so	1
happy!"	1
	1
And	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
run	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
Sonya,	1
shaking	1
off	1
some	1
down	1
which	1
clung	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
tucking	1
away	1
the	1
verses	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
bony	1
little	1
chest,	1
ran	1
after	1
Natasha	1
down	1
the	1
passage	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
flushed	1
face	1
and	1
light,	1
joyous	1
steps.	1
At	1
the	1
visitors'	1
request	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
sang	1
the	1
quartette,	1
"The	1
Brook,"	1
with	1
which	1
everyone	1
was	1
delighted.	1
Then	1
Nicholas	1
sang	1
a	1
song	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
learned:	1
	1
	1
At	1
nighttime	1
in	1
the	1
moon's	1
fair	1
glow	1
How	1
sweet,	1
as	1
fancies	1
wander	1
free,	1
To	1
feel	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there's	1
one	1
Who	1
still	1
is	1
thinking	1
but	1
of	1
thee!	1
	1
That	1
while	1
her	1
fingers	1
touch	1
the	1
harp	1
Wafting	1
sweet	1
music	1
o'er	1
the	1
lea,	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
thee	1
thus	1
swells	1
her	1
heart,	1
Sighing	1
its	1
message	1
out	1
to	1
thee...	1
	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
then	1
bliss	1
unspoilt,	1
But	1
oh!	1
till	1
then	1
I	1
cannot	1
live!...	1
	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
the	1
last	1
verse	1
before	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
hall,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
coughing	1
of	1
the	1
musicians	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
gallery.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
where	1
Shinshin	1
had	1
engaged	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
recently	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad,	1
in	1
a	1
political	1
conversation	1
in	1
which	1
several	1
others	1
joined	1
but	1
which	1
bored	1
Pierre.	1
When	1
the	1
music	1
began	1
Natasha	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
walking	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
said,	1
laughing	1
and	1
blushing:	1
	1
"Mamma	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
dancers."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
mixing	1
the	1
figures,"	1
Pierre	1
replied;	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
teacher..."	1
And	1
lowering	1
his	1
big	1
arm	1
he	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
slender	1
little	1
girl.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
couples	1
were	1
arranging	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
musicians	1
tuning	1
up,	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
partner.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
perfectly	1
happy;	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
a	1
grown-up	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
abroad.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
conspicuous	1
place	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
grown-up	1
lady.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
fan	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
hold.	1
Assuming	1
quite	1
the	1
pose	1
of	1
a	1
society	1
woman	1
(heaven	1
knows	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
learned	1
it)	1
she	1
talked	1
with	1
her	1
partner,	1
fanning	1
herself	1
and	1
smiling	1
over	1
the	1
fan.	1
	1
"Dear,	1
dear!	1
Just	1
look	1
at	1
her!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
she	1
crossed	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Natasha	1
blushed	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
Mamma!	1
Why	1
should	1
you?	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
at?"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
ecossaise	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
clatter	1
of	1
chairs	1
being	1
pushed	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
had	1
been	1
playing	1
cards	1
with	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
distinguished	1
and	1
older	1
visitors.	1
They	1
now,	1
stretching	1
themselves	1
after	1
sitting	1
so	1
long,	1
and	1
replacing	1
their	1
purses	1
and	1
pocketbooks,	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
First	1
came	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
both	1
with	1
merry	1
countenances.	1
The	1
count,	1
with	1
playful	1
ceremony	1
somewhat	1
in	1
ballet	1
style,	1
offered	1
his	1
bent	1
arm	1
to	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
He	1
drew	1
himself	1
up,	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
debonair	1
gallantry	1
lit	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
ecossaise	1
was	1
ended,	1
he	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
musicians	1
and	1
shouted	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
gallery,	1
addressing	1
the	1
first	1
violin:	1
	1
"Semen!	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Daniel	1
Cooper?"	1
	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
count's	1
favorite	1
dance,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
danced	1
in	1
his	1
youth.	1
(Strictly	1
speaking,	1
Daniel	1
Cooper	1
was	1
one	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
anglaise.)	1
	1
"Look	1
at	1
Papa!"	1
shouted	1
Natasha	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
company,	1
and	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
a	1
grown-up	1
partner	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
curly	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
ring	1
with	1
her	1
laughter.	1
	1
And	1
indeed	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
looked	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
jovial	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
standing	1
beside	1
his	1
tall	1
and	1
stout	1
partner,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
curved	1
his	1
arms,	1
beat	1
time,	1
straightened	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
turned	1
out	1
his	1
toes,	1
tapped	1
gently	1
with	1
his	1
foot,	1
and,	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
broadened	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
prepared	1
the	1
onlookers	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
provocatively	1
gay	1
strains	1
of	1
Daniel	1
Cooper	1
(somewhat	1
resembling	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
merry	1
peasant	1
dance)	1
began	1
to	1
sound,	1
all	1
the	1
doorways	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom	1
were	1
suddenly	1
filled	1
by	1
the	1
domestic	1
serfs--the	1
men	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
on	1
the	1
other--who	1
with	1
beaming	1
faces	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
master	1
making	1
merry.	1
	1
"Just	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
master!	1
A	1
regular	1
eagle	1
he	1
is!"	1
loudly	1
remarked	1
the	1
nurse,	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doorways.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
danced	1
well	1
and	1
knew	1
it.	1
But	1
his	1
partner	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
dance	1
well.	1
Her	1
enormous	1
figure	1
stood	1
erect,	1
her	1
powerful	1
arms	1
hanging	1
down	1
(she	1
had	1
handed	1
her	1
reticule	1
to	1
the	1
countess),	1
and	1
only	1
her	1
stern	1
but	1
handsome	1
face	1
really	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
dance.	1
What	1
was	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
plump	1
figure,	1
in	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
found	1
expression	1
only	1
in	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
beaming	1
face	1
and	1
quivering	1
nose.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
count,	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
swing	1
of	1
it,	1
charmed	1
the	1
spectators	1
by	1
the	1
unexpectedness	1
of	1
his	1
adroit	1
maneuvers	1
and	1
the	1
agility	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
capered	1
about	1
on	1
his	1
light	1
feet,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
produced	1
no	1
less	1
impression	1
by	1
slight	1
exertions--the	1
least	1
effort	1
to	1
move	1
her	1
shoulders	1
or	1
bend	1
her	1
arms	1
when	1
turning,	1
or	1
stamp	1
her	1
foot--	1
which	1
everyone	1
appreciated	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
her	1
size	1
and	1
habitual	1
severity.	1
The	1
dance	1
grew	1
livelier	1
and	1
livelier.	1
The	1
other	1
couples	1
could	1
not	1
attract	1
a	1
moment's	1
attention	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
evolutions	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
All	1
were	1
watching	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
Natasha	1
kept	1
pulling	1
everyone	1
by	1
sleeve	1
or	1
dress,	1
urging	1
them	1
to	1
"look	1
at	1
Papa!"	1
though	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
never	1
took	1
their	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
couple.	1
In	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
the	1
dance	1
the	1
count,	1
breathing	1
deeply,	1
waved	1
and	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
musicians	1
to	1
play	1
faster.	1
Faster,	1
faster,	1
and	1
faster;	1
lightly,	1
more	1
lightly,	1
and	1
yet	1
more	1
lightly	1
whirled	1
the	1
count,	1
flying	1
round	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
toes,	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
heels;	1
until,	1
turning	1
his	1
partner	1
round	1
to	1
her	1
seat,	1
he	1
executed	1
the	1
final	1
pas,	1
raising	1
his	1
soft	1
foot	1
backwards,	1
bowing	1
his	1
perspiring	1
head,	1
smiling	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
wide	1
sweep	1
with	1
his	1
arm,	1
amid	1
a	1
thunder	1
of	1
applause	1
and	1
laughter	1
led	1
by	1
Natasha.	1
Both	1
partners	1
stood	1
still,	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
and	1
wiping	1
their	1
faces	1
with	1
their	1
cambric	1
handkerchiefs.	1
	1
"That's	1
how	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
our	1
time,	1
ma	1
chere,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
a	1
Daniel	1
Cooper!"	1
exclaimed	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
tucking	1
up	1
her	1
sleeves	1
and	1
puffing	1
heavily.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
While	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
ballroom	1
the	1
sixth	1
anglaise	1
was	1
being	1
danced,	1
to	1
a	1
tune	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
weary	1
musicians	1
blundered,	1
and	1
while	1
tired	1
footmen	1
and	1
cooks	1
were	1
getting	1
the	1
supper,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
a	1
sixth	1
stroke.	1
The	1
doctors	1
pronounced	1
recovery	1
impossible.	1
After	1
a	1
mute	1
confession,	1
communion	1
was	1
administered	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
preparations	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
unction,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
bustle	1
and	1
thrill	1
of	1
suspense	1
usual	1
at	1
such	1
moments.	1
Outside	1
the	1
house,	1
beyond	1
the	1
gates,	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
undertakers,	1
who	1
hid	1
whenever	1
a	1
carriage	1
drove	1
up,	1
waited	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
an	1
important	1
order	1
for	1
an	1
expensive	1
funeral.	1
The	1
Military	1
Governor	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
assiduous	1
in	1
sending	1
aides-de-camp	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
the	1
count's	1
health,	1
came	1
himself	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
bid	1
a	1
last	1
farewell	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
grandee	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
court,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov.	1
	1
The	1
magnificent	1
reception	1
room	1
was	1
crowded.	1
Everyone	1
stood	1
up	1
respectfully	1
when	1
the	1
Military	1
Governor,	1
having	1
stayed	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
passed	1
out,	1
slightly	1
acknowledging	1
their	1
bows	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
escape	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
the	1
glances	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
doctors,	1
clergy,	1
and	1
relatives	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
thinner	1
and	1
paler	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days,	1
escorted	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
repeating	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
low	1
tones.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
Military	1
Governor	1
had	1
gone,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sat	1
down	1
all	1
alone	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
crossing	1
one	1
leg	1
high	1
over	1
the	1
other,	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
his	1
knee	1
and	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
After	1
sitting	1
so	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
rose,	1
and,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes,	1
went	1
with	1
unusually	1
hurried	1
steps	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
corridor	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess.	1
	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
dimly	1
lit	1
reception	1
room	1
spoke	1
in	1
nervous	1
whispers,	1
and,	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
went	1
into	1
or	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
dying	1
man's	1
room,	1
grew	1
silent	1
and	1
gazed	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
curiosity	1
or	1
expectancy	1
at	1
his	1
door,	1
which	1
creaked	1
slightly	1
when	1
opened.	1
	1
"The	1
limits	1
of	1
human	1
life...	1
are	1
fixed	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
o'erpassed,"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
priest	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
listening	1
naively	1
to	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
"I	1
wonder,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
administer	1
unction?"	1
asked	1
the	1
lady,	1
adding	1
the	1
priest's	1
clerical	1
title,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
madam,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
sacrament,"	1
replied	1
the	1
priest,	1
passing	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
thin	1
grizzled	1
strands	1
of	1
hair	1
combed	1
back	1
across	1
his	1
bald	1
head.	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
that?	1
The	1
Military	1
Governor	1
himself?"	1
was	1
being	1
asked	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
"How	1
young-looking	1
he	1
is!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
over	1
sixty.	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
count	1
no	1
longer	1
recognizes	1
anyone.	1
They	1
wished	1
to	1
administer	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
unction."	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
someone	1
who	1
received	1
that	1
sacrament	1
seven	1
times."	1
	1
The	1
second	1
princess	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
sickroom	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
red	1
from	1
weeping	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Dr.	1
Lorrain,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
graceful	1
pose	1
under	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine,	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
a	1
table.	1
	1
"Beautiful,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
remark	1
about	1
the	1
weather.	1
"The	1
weather	1
is	1
beautiful,	1
Princess;	1
and	1
besides,	1
in	1
Moscow	1
one	1
feels	1
as	1
if	1
one	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"So	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
drink?"	1
	1
Lorrain	1
considered.	1
	1
"Has	1
he	1
taken	1
his	1
medicine?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
	1
"Take	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
boiled	1
water	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
cream	1
of	1
tartar,"	1
and	1
he	1
indicated	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
fingers	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
a	1
pinch.	1
	1
"Dere	1
has	1
neffer	1
been	1
a	1
gase,"	1
a	1
German	1
doctor	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
an	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
"dat	1
one	1
liffs	1
after	1
de	1
sird	1
stroke."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
a	1
well-preserved	1
man	1
he	1
was!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
aide-de-camp.	1
"And	1
who	1
will	1
inherit	1
his	1
wealth?"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"It	1
von't	1
go	1
begging,"	1
replied	1
the	1
German	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Everyone	1
again	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
door,	1
which	1
creaked	1
as	1
the	1
second	1
princess	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
drink	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
according	1
to	1
Lorrain's	1
instructions.	1
The	1
German	1
doctor	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Lorrain.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
can	1
last	1
till	1
morning?"	1
asked	1
the	1
German,	1
addressing	1
Lorrain	1
in	1
French	1
which	1
he	1
pronounced	1
badly.	1
	1
Lorrain,	1
pursing	1
up	1
his	1
lips,	1
waved	1
a	1
severely	1
negative	1
finger	1
before	1
his	1
nose.	1
	1
"Tonight,	1
not	1
later,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
decorous	1
smile	1
of	1
self-satisfaction	1
at	1
being	1
able	1
clearly	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
state	1
the	1
patient's	1
condition.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
princess'	1
room.	1
	1
In	1
this	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
dark;	1
only	1
two	1
tiny	1
lamps	1
were	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
icons	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
pleasant	1
scent	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
burnt	1
pastilles.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
crowded	1
with	1
small	1
pieces	1
of	1
furniture,	1
whatnots,	1
cupboards,	1
and	1
little	1
tables.	1
The	1
quilt	1
of	1
a	1
high,	1
white	1
feather	1
bed	1
was	1
just	1
visible	1
behind	1
a	1
screen.	1
A	1
small	1
dog	1
began	1
to	1
bark.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
is	1
it	1
you,	1
cousin?"	1
	1
She	1
rose	1
and	1
smoothed	1
her	1
hair,	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
usual	1
so	1
extremely	1
smooth	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
one	1
piece	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
varnish.	1
	1
"Has	1
anything	1
happened?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
terrified."	1
	1
"No,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
change.	1
I	1
only	1
came	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
about	1
business,	1
Catiche,"	1
*	1
muttered	1
the	1
prince,	1
seating	1
himself	1
wearily	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
vacated.	1
"You	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
place	1
warm,	1
I	1
must	1
say,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"Well,	1
sit	1
down:	1
let's	1
have	1
a	1
talk."	1
	1
	1
*Catherine.	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
perhaps	1
something	1
had	1
happened,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
unchanging	1
stonily	1
severe	1
expression;	1
and,	1
sitting	1
down	1
opposite	1
the	1
prince,	1
she	1
prepared	1
to	1
listen.	1
	1
"I	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
nap,	1
mon	1
cousin,	1
but	1
I	1
can't."	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
bending	1
it	1
downwards	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
this	1
"well?"	1
referred	1
to	1
much	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
understood	1
without	1
naming.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
straight,	1
rigid	1
body,	1
abnormally	1
long	1
for	1
her	1
legs,	1
looked	1
directly	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
with	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
emotion	1
in	1
her	1
prominent	1
gray	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
icons	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
This	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
devotion,	1
or	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
hope	1
of	1
resting	1
before	1
long.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
understood	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
weariness.	1
	1
"And	1
I?"	1
he	1
said;	1
"do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
me?	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
worn	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
post	1
horse,	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
you,	1
Catiche,	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
talk."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
his	1
cheeks	1
began	1
to	1
twitch	1
nervously,	1
now	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
giving	1
his	1
face	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
expression	1
which	1
was	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
on	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
drawing	1
room.	1
His	1
eyes	1
too	1
seemed	1
strange;	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
they	1
looked	1
impudently	1
sly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
glanced	1
round	1
in	1
alarm.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
holding	1
her	1
little	1
dog	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
bony	1
hands,	1
looked	1
attentively	1
into	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
eyes	1
evidently	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
break	1
silence,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
morning.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
my	1
dear	1
princess	1
and	1
cousin,	1
Catherine	1
Semenovna,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
theme,	1
apparently	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
inner	1
struggle;	1
"at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
this	1
one	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
everything.	1
One	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
you...	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
all,	1
like	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
as	1
you	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
moving,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
dull	1
expression.	1
	1
"And	1
then	1
of	1
course	1
my	1
family	1
has	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
considered,"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
went	1
on,	1
testily	1
pushing	1
away	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her.	1
"You	1
know,	1
Catiche,	1
that	1
we--you	1
three	1
sisters,	1
Mamontov,	1
and	1
my	1
wife--	1
are	1
the	1
count's	1
only	1
direct	1
heirs.	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
matters.	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
easier	1
for	1
me;	1
but,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
getting	1
on	1
for	1
sixty	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
anything.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
Pierre?	1
The	1
count,"	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
portrait,	1
"definitely	1
demanded	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
called."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
the	1
princess,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
considering	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
or	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
simply	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
constantly	1
pray	1
God	1
to	1
grant,	1
mon	1
cousin,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
"and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
allow	1
his	1
noble	1
soul	1
peacefully	1
to	1
leave	1
this..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course,"	1
interrupted	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
impatiently,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
and	1
angrily	1
pulling	1
back	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
pushed	1
away.	1
"But...	1
in	1
short,	1
the	1
fact	1
is...	1
you	1
know	1
yourself	1
that	1
last	1
winter	1
the	1
count	1
made	1
a	1
will	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
left	1
all	1
his	1
property,	1
not	1
to	1
us	1
his	1
direct	1
heirs,	1
but	1
to	1
Pierre."	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
made	1
wills	1
enough!"	1
quietly	1
remarked	1
the	1
princess.	1
"But	1
he	1
cannot	1
leave	1
the	1
estate	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
Pierre	1
is	1
illegitimate."	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
suddenly,	1
clutching	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
and	1
becoming	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
talking	1
more	1
rapidly:	1
"what	1
if	1
a	1
letter	1
has	1
been	1
written	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
count	1
asks	1
for	1
Pierre's	1
legitimation?	1
Do	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
in	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
services,	1
his	1
request	1
would	1
be	1
granted?..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
smiled	1
as	1
people	1
do	1
who	1
think	1
they	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
subject	1
under	1
discussion	1
than	1
those	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
with.	1
	1
"I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
more,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
seizing	1
her	1
hand,	1
"that	1
letter	1
was	1
written,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
sent,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
knew	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
only	1
question	1
is,	1
has	1
it	1
been	1
destroyed	1
or	1
not?	1
If	1
not,	1
then	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
all	1
is	1
over,"	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sighed	1
to	1
intimate	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
all	1
is	1
over,	1
"and	1
the	1
count's	1
papers	1
are	1
opened,	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
will	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
the	1
petition	1
will	1
certainly	1
be	1
granted.	1
Pierre	1
will	1
get	1
everything	1
as	1
the	1
legitimate	1
son."	1
	1
"And	1
our	1
share?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
smiling	1
ironically,	1
as	1
if	1
anything	1
might	1
happen,	1
only	1
not	1
that.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
poor	1
Catiche,	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
daylight!	1
He	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
the	1
legal	1
heir	1
to	1
everything	1
and	1
you	1
won't	1
get	1
anything.	1
You	1
must	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
whether	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
were	1
written,	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
or	1
not.	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
somehow	1
been	1
overlooked,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
are,	1
and	1
must	1
find	1
them,	1
because..."	1
	1
"What	1
next?"	1
the	1
princess	1
interrupted,	1
smiling	1
sardonically	1
and	1
not	1
changing	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
stupid;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
this:	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
cannot	1
inherit...	1
un	1
batard!"	1
*	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
supposing	1
that	1
this	1
translation	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
would	1
effectively	1
prove	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
the	1
invalidity	1
of	1
his	1
contention.	1
	1
	1
*	1
A	1
bastard.	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
Catiche!	1
Can't	1
you	1
understand!	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
intelligent,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
recognize	1
Pierre	1
as	1
legitimate,	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
Pierre	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
Pierre	1
but	1
will	1
become	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
will	1
then	1
inherit	1
everything	1
under	1
the	1
will?	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
are	1
not	1
destroyed,	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
dutiful	1
et	1
tout	1
ce	1
qui	1
s'ensuit!	1
*	1
That's	1
certain."	1
	1
	1
*	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
follows	1
therefrom.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
the	1
will	1
was	1
made,	1
but	1
I	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
invalid;	1
and	1
you,	1
mon	1
cousin,	1
seem	1
to	1
consider	1
me	1
a	1
perfect	1
fool,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
women	1
assume	1
when	1
they	1
suppose	1
they	1
are	1
saying	1
something	1
witty	1
and	1
stinging.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Princess	1
Catherine	1
Semenovna,"	1
began	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
impatiently,	1
"I	1
came	1
here	1
not	1
to	1
wrangle	1
with	1
you,	1
but	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
your	1
interests	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
kinswoman,	1
a	1
good,	1
kind,	1
true	1
relation.	1
And	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
tenth	1
time	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
the	1
will	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
favor	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
count's	1
papers,	1
then,	1
my	1
dear	1
girl,	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sisters	1
are	1
not	1
heiresses!	1
If	1
you	1
don't	1
believe	1
me,	1
then	1
believe	1
an	1
expert.	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
Dmitri	1
Onufrich"	1
(the	1
family	1
solicitor)	1
"and	1
he	1
says	1
the	1
same."	1
	1
At	1
this	1
a	1
sudden	1
change	1
evidently	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
princess'	1
ideas;	1
her	1
thin	1
lips	1
grew	1
white,	1
though	1
her	1
eyes	1
did	1
not	1
change,	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
passed	1
through	1
such	1
transitions	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
expect.	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
fine	1
thing!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
never	1
wanted	1
anything	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
now."	1
	1
She	1
pushed	1
the	1
little	1
dog	1
off	1
her	1
lap	1
and	1
smoothed	1
her	1
dress.	1
	1
"And	1
this	1
is	1
gratitude--this	1
is	1
recognition	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
for	1
his	1
sake!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"It's	1
splendid!	1
Fine!	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
anything,	1
Prince."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
one.	1
There	1
are	1
your	1
sisters..."	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
long	1
ago	1
but	1
had	1
forgotten.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
expect	1
nothing	1
but	1
meanness,	1
deceit,	1
envy,	1
intrigue,	1
and	1
ingratitude--the	1
blackest	1
ingratitude--in	1
this	1
house..."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
that	1
will	1
is?"	1
insisted	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
his	1
cheeks	1
twitching	1
more	1
than	1
ever.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
fool!	1
I	1
still	1
believed	1
in	1
people,	1
loved	1
them,	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
myself.	1
But	1
only	1
the	1
base,	1
the	1
vile	1
succeed!	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
intriguing!"	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
wished	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
the	1
prince	1
held	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
suddenly	1
lost	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race.	1
She	1
gave	1
her	1
companion	1
an	1
angry	1
glance.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
still	1
time,	1
my	1
dear.	1
You	1
must	1
remember,	1
Catiche,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
casually	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
anger,	1
of	1
illness,	1
and	1
was	1
afterwards	1
forgotten.	1
Our	1
duty,	1
my	1
dear,	1
is	1
to	1
rectify	1
his	1
mistake,	1
to	1
ease	1
his	1
last	1
moments	1
by	1
not	1
letting	1
him	1
commit	1
this	1
injustice,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
rendering	1
unhappy	1
those	1
who..."	1
	1
"Who	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
for	1
him,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
princess,	1
who	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
risen	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
prince	1
still	1
held	1
her	1
fast,	1
"though	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
appreciate	1
it.	1
No,	1
mon	1
cousin,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
"I	1
shall	1
always	1
remember	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
one	1
must	1
expect	1
no	1
reward,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
honor	1
nor	1
justice.	1
In	1
this	1
world	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
cunning	1
and	1
cruel."	1
	1
"Now	1
come,	1
come!	1
Be	1
reasonable.	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
excellent	1
heart."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
wicked	1
heart."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
your	1
heart,"	1
repeated	1
the	1
prince.	1
"I	1
value	1
your	1
friendship	1
and	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
as	1
good	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
me.	1
Don't	1
upset	1
yourself,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
sensibly	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
time,	1
be	1
it	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
be	1
it	1
but	1
an	1
hour....	1
Tell	1
me	1
all	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
will,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
where	1
it	1
is.	1
You	1
must	1
know.	1
We	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
He	1
has,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
forgotten	1
it	1
and	1
will	1
wish	1
to	1
destroy	1
it.	1
You	1
understand	1
that	1
my	1
sole	1
desire	1
is	1
conscientiously	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
wishes;	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
only	1
reason	1
for	1
being	1
here.	1
I	1
came	1
simply	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
and	1
you."	1
	1
"Now	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all!	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
intriguing--I	1
know!"	1
cried	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
the	1
point,	1
my	1
dear."	1
	1
"It's	1
that	1
protege	1
of	1
yours,	1
that	1
sweet	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya,	1
that	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
whom	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
for	1
a	1
housemaid...	1
the	1
infamous,	1
vile	1
woman!"	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
lose	1
any	1
time..."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
don't	1
talk	1
to	1
me!	1
Last	1
winter	1
she	1
wheedled	1
herself	1
in	1
here	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
count	1
such	1
vile,	1
disgraceful	1
things	1
about	1
us,	1
especially	1
about	1
Sophie--I	1
can't	1
repeat	1
them--that	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
count	1
quite	1
ill	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
fortnight.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
he	1
wrote	1
this	1
vile,	1
infamous	1
paper,	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
invalid."	1
	1
"We've	1
got	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
last--why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it	1
sooner?"	1
	1
"It's	1
in	1
the	1
inlaid	1
portfolio	1
that	1
he	1
keeps	1
under	1
his	1
pillow,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
ignoring	1
his	1
question.	1
"Now	1
I	1
know!	1
Yes;	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
sin,	1
a	1
great	1
sin,	1
it	1
is	1
hatred	1
of	1
that	1
vile	1
woman!"	1
almost	1
shrieked	1
the	1
princess,	1
now	1
quite	1
changed.	1
"And	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
come	1
worming	1
herself	1
in	1
here	1
for?	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
my	1
mind.	1
The	1
time	1
will	1
come!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
While	1
these	1
conversations	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
princess'	1
room,	1
a	1
carriage	1
containing	1
Pierre	1
(who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
for)	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
(who	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
accompany	1
him)	1
was	1
driving	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
house.	1
As	1
the	1
wheels	1
rolled	1
softly	1
over	1
the	1
straw	1
beneath	1
the	1
windows,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
having	1
turned	1
with	1
words	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
her	1
companion,	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep	1
in	1
his	1
corner	1
and	1
woke	1
him	1
up.	1
Rousing	1
himself,	1
Pierre	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
dying	1
father	1
which	1
awaited	1
him.	1
He	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
entrance	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
door.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
two	1
men,	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
tradespeople,	1
ran	1
hurriedly	1
from	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
wall.	1
Pausing	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
several	1
other	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
But	1
neither	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
nor	1
the	1
footman	1
nor	1
the	1
coachman,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
these	1
people,	1
took	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
them.	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
right,"	1
Pierre	1
concluded,	1
and	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
She	1
hurriedly	1
ascended	1
the	1
narrow	1
dimly	1
lit	1
stone	1
staircase,	1
calling	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
was	1
lagging	1
behind,	1
to	1
follow.	1
Though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
all,	1
still	1
less	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
stairs,	1
yet	1
judging	1
by	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
air	1
of	1
assurance	1
and	1
haste,	1
Pierre	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
absolutely	1
necessary.	1
Halfway	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
they	1
were	1
almost	1
knocked	1
over	1
by	1
some	1
men	1
who,	1
carrying	1
pails,	1
came	1
running	1
downstairs,	1
their	1
boots	1
clattering.	1
These	1
men	1
pressed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
let	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
pass	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
evince	1
the	1
least	1
surprise	1
at	1
seeing	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
princesses'	1
apartments?"	1
asked	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
a	1
footman	1
in	1
a	1
bold	1
loud	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
anything	1
were	1
now	1
permissible;	1
"the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
ma'am."	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
the	1
count	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
landing.	1
"I'd	1
better	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
room."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
paused	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
friend!"	1
she	1
said,	1
touching	1
his	1
arm	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
son's	1
when	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
afternoon,	1
"believe	1
me	1
I	1
suffer	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
you	1
do,	1
but	1
be	1
a	1
man!"	1
	1
"But	1
really,	1
hadn't	1
I	1
better	1
go	1
away?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
looking	1
kindly	1
at	1
her	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend!	1
Forget	1
the	1
wrongs	1
that	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
you.	1
Think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
father...	1
perhaps	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
death."	1
She	1
sighed.	1
"I	1
have	1
loved	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
son	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
Trust	1
yourself	1
to	1
me,	1
Pierre.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
forget	1
your	1
interests."	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
a	1
word,	1
but	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
grew	1
stronger,	1
and	1
he	1
meekly	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
opening	1
a	1
door.	1
	1
This	1
door	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
back	1
anteroom.	1
An	1
old	1
man,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
princesses,	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
knitting	1
a	1
stocking.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
these	1
rooms.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
addressing	1
a	1
maid	1
who	1
was	1
hurrying	1
past	1
with	1
a	1
decanter	1
on	1
a	1
tray	1
as	1
"my	1
dear"	1
and	1
"my	1
sweet,"	1
asked	1
about	1
the	1
princess'	1
health	1
and	1
then	1
led	1
Pierre	1
along	1
a	1
stone	1
passage.	1
The	1
first	1
door	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
princesses'	1
apartments.	1
The	1
maid	1
with	1
the	1
decanter	1
in	1
her	1
haste	1
had	1
not	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
(everything	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
haste	1
at	1
that	1
time),	1
and	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
in	1
passing	1
instinctively	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
where	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
were	1
sitting	1
close	1
together	1
talking.	1
Seeing	1
them	1
pass,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
drew	1
back	1
with	1
obvious	1
impatience,	1
while	1
the	1
princess	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
desperation	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might.	1
	1
This	1
action	1
was	1
so	1
unlike	1
her	1
usual	1
composure	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
depicted	1
on	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
face	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
dignity	1
that	1
Pierre	1
stopped	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
at	1
his	1
guide.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
evinced	1
no	1
surprise,	1
she	1
only	1
smiled	1
faintly	1
and	1
sighed,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected.	1
	1
"Be	1
a	1
man,	1
my	1
friend.	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
interests,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
look,	1
and	1
went	1
still	1
faster	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about,	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
what	1
"watching	1
over	1
his	1
interests"	1
meant,	1
but	1
he	1
decided	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
had	1
to	1
be.	1
From	1
the	1
passage	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
large,	1
dimly	1
lit	1
room	1
adjoining	1
the	1
count's	1
reception	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
sumptuous	1
but	1
cold	1
apartments	1
known	1
to	1
Pierre	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
approach,	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
there	1
now	1
stood	1
an	1
empty	1
bath,	1
and	1
water	1
had	1
been	1
spilled	1
on	1
the	1
carpet.	1
They	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
deacon	1
with	1
a	1
censer	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
passed	1
out	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
without	1
heeding	1
them.	1
They	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
familiar	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
two	1
Italian	1
windows	1
opening	1
into	1
the	1
conservatory,	1
with	1
its	1
large	1
bust	1
and	1
full	1
length	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine	1
the	1
Great.	1
The	1
same	1
people	1
were	1
still	1
sitting	1
here	1
in	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
positions	1
as	1
before,	1
whispering	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
All	1
became	1
silent	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
pale	1
tear-worn	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
she	1
entered,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
big	1
stout	1
figure	1
of	1
Pierre	1
who,	1
hanging	1
his	1
head,	1
meekly	1
followed	1
her.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
face	1
expressed	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
the	1
decisive	1
moment	1
had	1
arrived.	1
With	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
practical	1
Petersburg	1
lady	1
she	1
now,	1
keeping	1
Pierre	1
close	1
beside	1
her,	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
even	1
more	1
boldly	1
than	1
that	1
afternoon.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
as	1
she	1
brought	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
person	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
wished	1
to	1
see,	1
her	1
own	1
admission	1
was	1
assured.	1
Casting	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
at	1
all	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
noticing	1
the	1
count's	1
confessor	1
there,	1
she	1
glided	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
amble,	1
not	1
exactly	1
bowing	1
yet	1
seeming	1
to	1
grow	1
suddenly	1
smaller,	1
and	1
respectfully	1
received	1
the	1
blessing	1
first	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
another	1
priest.	1
	1
"God	1
be	1
thanked	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
time,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests;	1
"all	1
we	1
relatives	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
such	1
anxiety.	1
This	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
count's	1
son,"	1
she	1
added	1
more	1
softly.	1
"What	1
a	1
terrible	1
moment!"	1
	1
Having	1
said	1
this	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
"Dear	1
doctor,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
count's	1
son.	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
hope?"	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
cast	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
upwards	1
and	1
silently	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
movement	1
raised	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
eyes,	1
almost	1
closing	1
the	1
latter,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
To	1
him,	1
in	1
a	1
particularly	1
respectful	1
and	1
tenderly	1
sad	1
voice,	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"Trust	1
in	1
His	1
mercy!"	1
and	1
pointing	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
sofa	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
her,	1
she	1
went	1
silently	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
watching	1
and	1
it	1
creaked	1
very	1
slightly	1
as	1
she	1
disappeared	1
behind	1
it.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
monitress	1
implicitly,	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
sofa	1
she	1
had	1
indicated.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
had	1
disappeared	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
curiosity	1
and	1
sympathy.	1
He	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
casting	1
significant	1
looks	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
awe	1
and	1
even	1
servility.	1
A	1
deference	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
received	1
was	1
shown	1
him.	1
A	1
strange	1
lady,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
rose	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
her	1
seat;	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
picked	1
up	1
and	1
returned	1
a	1
glove	1
Pierre	1
had	1
dropped;	1
the	1
doctors	1
became	1
respectfully	1
silent	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
him.	1
At	1
first	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
another	1
seat	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
trouble	1
the	1
lady,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
glove	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
pass	1
round	1
the	1
doctors	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
way;	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
do,	1
and	1
that	1
tonight	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
obliged	1
to	1
perform	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
awful	1
rite	1
which	1
everyone	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
therefore	1
bound	1
to	1
accept	1
their	1
services.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
glove	1
in	1
silence	1
from	1
the	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
lady's	1
chair,	1
placing	1
his	1
huge	1
hands	1
symmetrically	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
naive	1
attitude	1
of	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
statue,	1
and	1
decided	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
do	1
foolish	1
things	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
act	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
ideas	1
tonight,	1
but	1
must	1
yield	1
himself	1
up	1
entirely	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
guiding	1
him.	1
	1
Not	1
two	1
minutes	1
had	1
passed	1
before	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
with	1
head	1
erect	1
majestically	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
was	1
wearing	1
his	1
long	1
coat	1
with	1
three	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
thinner	1
since	1
the	1
morning;	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
larger	1
than	1
usual	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
and	1
noticed	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
(a	1
thing	1
he	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
do),	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
downwards	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
firmly	1
fixed	1
on.	1
	1
"Courage,	1
courage,	1
my	1
friend!	1
He	1
has	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
That	1
is	1
well!"	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
But	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
ask:	1
"How	1
is..."	1
and	1
hesitated,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
"the	1
count,"	1
yet	1
ashamed	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
"father."	1
	1
"He	1
had	1
another	1
stroke	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago.	1
Courage,	1
my	1
friend..."	1
	1
Pierre's	1
mind	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
confused	1
state	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
"stroke"	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
blow	1
from	1
something.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
perplexity,	1
and	1
only	1
later	1
grasped	1
that	1
a	1
stroke	1
was	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
illness.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
Lorrain	1
in	1
passing	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
tiptoe.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
walk	1
well	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
jerked	1
at	1
each	1
step.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
deacons	1
and	1
some	1
servants	1
also	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Through	1
that	1
door	1
was	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
things	1
being	1
moved	1
about,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression,	1
pale	1
but	1
resolute	1
in	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
duty,	1
ran	1
out	1
and	1
touching	1
Pierre	1
lightly	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
said:	1
	1
"The	1
divine	1
mercy	1
is	1
inexhaustible!	1
Unction	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
administered.	1
Come."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
stepping	1
on	1
the	1
soft	1
carpet,	1
and	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
strange	1
lady,	1
the	1
aide-de-camp,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
all	1
followed	1
him	1
in,	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
no	1
further	1
need	1
for	1
permission	1
to	1
enter	1
that	1
room.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXIII	1
	1
Pierre	1
well	1
knew	1
this	1
large	1
room	1
divided	1
by	1
columns	1
and	1
an	1
arch,	1
its	1
walls	1
hung	1
round	1
with	1
Persian	1
carpets.	1
The	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
behind	1
the	1
columns,	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
silk-curtained	1
mahogany	1
bedstead	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
an	1
immense	1
case	1
containing	1
icons,	1
was	1
brightly	1
illuminated	1
with	1
red	1
light	1
like	1
a	1
Russian	1
church	1
during	1
evening	1
service.	1
Under	1
the	1
gleaming	1
icons	1
stood	1
a	1
long	1
invalid	1
chair,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
chair	1
on	1
snowy-	1
white	1
smooth	1
pillows,	1
evidently	1
freshly	1
changed,	1
Pierre	1
saw--covered	1
to	1
the	1
waist	1
by	1
a	1
bright	1
green	1
quilt--the	1
familiar,	1
majestic	1
figure	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
with	1
that	1
gray	1
mane	1
of	1
hair	1
above	1
his	1
broad	1
forehead	1
which	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
characteristically	1
noble	1
wrinkles	1
of	1
his	1
handsome,	1
ruddy	1
face.	1
He	1
lay	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
icons;	1
his	1
large	1
thick	1
hands	1
outside	1
the	1
quilt.	1
Into	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
which	1
was	1
lying	1
palm	1
downwards,	1
a	1
wax	1
taper	1
had	1
been	1
thrust	1
between	1
forefinger	1
and	1
thumb,	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
servant,	1
bending	1
over	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
chair,	1
held	1
it	1
in	1
position.	1
By	1
the	1
chair	1
stood	1
the	1
priests,	1
their	1
long	1
hair	1
falling	1
over	1
their	1
magnificent	1
glittering	1
vestments,	1
with	1
lighted	1
tapers	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
slowly	1
and	1
solemnly	1
conducting	1
the	1
service.	1
A	1
little	1
behind	1
them	1
stood	1
the	1
two	1
younger	1
princesses	1
holding	1
handkerchiefs	1
to	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
their	1
eldest	1
sister,	1
Catiche,	1
with	1
a	1
vicious	1
and	1
determined	1
look	1
steadily	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
icons,	1
as	1
though	1
declaring	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
for	1
herself	1
should	1
she	1
glance	1
round.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
a	1
meek,	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
all-forgiving	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
near	1
the	1
strange	1
lady.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
near	1
the	1
invalid	1
chair,	1
a	1
wax	1
taper	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand,	1
was	1
leaning	1
his	1
left	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
carved	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
velvet	1
chair	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
purpose,	1
and	1
was	1
crossing	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
turning	1
his	1
eyes	1
upward	1
each	1
time	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
forehead.	1
His	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
calm	1
look	1
of	1
piety	1
and	1
resignation	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
"If	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
these	1
sentiments,"	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying,	1
"so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you!"	1
	1
Behind	1
him	1
stood	1
the	1
aide-de-camp,	1
the	1
doctors,	1
and	1
the	1
menservants;	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
had	1
separated	1
as	1
in	1
church.	1
All	1
were	1
silently	1
crossing	1
themselves,	1
and	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
service,	1
the	1
subdued	1
chanting	1
of	1
deep	1
bass	1
voices,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
intervals	1
sighs	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
feet	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
importance	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
quite	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
about,	1
went	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
where	1
Pierre	1
was	1
standing	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
taper.	1
He	1
lit	1
it	1
and,	1
distracted	1
by	1
observing	1
those	1
around	1
him,	1
began	1
crossing	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
taper.	1
	1
Sophie,	1
the	1
rosy,	1
laughter-loving,	1
youngest	1
princess	1
with	1
the	1
mole,	1
watched	1
him.	1
She	1
smiled,	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
remained	1
with	1
it	1
hidden	1
for	1
awhile;	1
then	1
looking	1
up	1
and	1
seeing	1
Pierre	1
she	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
She	1
evidently	1
felt	1
unable	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
laughing,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
looking	1
at	1
him:	1
so	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
temptation	1
she	1
slipped	1
quietly	1
behind	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
columns.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
suddenly	1
ceased,	1
they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
count's	1
hand	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
ladies.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
stepped	1
forward	1
and,	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Lorrain	1
from	1
behind	1
her	1
back.	1
The	1
French	1
doctor	1
held	1
no	1
taper;	1
he	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
columns	1
in	1
a	1
respectful	1
attitude	1
implying	1
that	1
he,	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
differences	1
of	1
faith,	1
understood	1
the	1
full	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
rite	1
now	1
being	1
performed	1
and	1
even	1
approved	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
now	1
approached	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
noiseless	1
step	1
of	1
one	1
in	1
full	1
vigor	1
of	1
life,	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
white	1
fingers	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
green	1
quilt	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
was	1
free,	1
and	1
turning	1
sideways	1
felt	1
the	1
pulse	1
and	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment.	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
given	1
something	1
to	1
drink,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
around	1
him,	1
then	1
the	1
people	1
resumed	1
their	1
places	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
continued.	1
During	1
this	1
interval	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
left	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
leaning,	1
and--with	1
an	1
air	1
which	1
intimated	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
and	1
if	1
others	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
them--did	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
but	1
passed	1
by	1
him,	1
joined	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
and	1
moved	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
stood	1
the	1
high	1
bedstead	1
with	1
its	1
silken	1
hangings.	1
On	1
leaving	1
the	1
bed	1
both	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
passed	1
out	1
by	1
a	1
back	1
door,	1
but	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
places	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
before	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
concluded.	1
Pierre	1
paid	1
no	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
this	1
occurrence	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on,	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
happening	1
around	1
him	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
essential.	1
	1
The	1
chanting	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
ceased,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
heard	1
respectfully	1
congratulating	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
on	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
sacrament.	1
The	1
dying	1
man	1
lay	1
as	1
lifeless	1
and	1
immovable	1
as	1
before.	1
Around	1
him	1
everyone	1
began	1
to	1
stir:	1
steps	1
were	1
audible	1
and	1
whispers,	1
among	1
which	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
distinct.	1
	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
her	1
say:	1
	1
"Certainly	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
moved	1
onto	1
the	1
bed;	1
here	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible..."	1
	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
so	1
surrounded	1
by	1
doctors,	1
princesses,	1
and	1
servants	1
that	1
Pierre	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
see	1
the	1
reddish-yellow	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
mane--	1
which,	1
though	1
he	1
saw	1
other	1
faces	1
as	1
well,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
moment	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
service.	1
He	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
cautious	1
movements	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
invalid	1
chair	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
lifted	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
and	1
were	1
moving	1
him.	1
	1
"Catch	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
or	1
you'll	1
drop	1
him!"	1
he	1
heard	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
whisper.	1
"Catch	1
hold	1
from	1
underneath.	1
Here!"	1
exclaimed	1
different	1
voices;	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
of	1
the	1
bearers	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
grew	1
more	1
hurried,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
weight	1
they	1
were	1
carrying	1
were	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
As	1
the	1
bearers,	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
passed	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
momentary	1
glimpse	1
between	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
man's	1
high,	1
stout,	1
uncovered	1
chest	1
and	1
powerful	1
shoulders,	1
raised	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
holding	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
armpits,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
gray,	1
curly,	1
leonine	1
head.	1
This	1
head,	1
with	1
its	1
remarkably	1
broad	1
brow	1
and	1
cheekbones,	1
its	1
handsome,	1
sensual	1
mouth,	1
and	1
its	1
cold,	1
majestic	1
expression,	1
was	1
not	1
disfigured	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
death.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
it	1
three	1
months	1
before,	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
But	1
now	1
this	1
head	1
was	1
swaying	1
helplessly	1
with	1
the	1
uneven	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
bearers,	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
listless	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
itself	1
upon	1
nothing.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
bustle	1
beside	1
the	1
high	1
bedstead,	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
dispersed.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
touched	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
and	1
said,	1
"Come."	1
Pierre	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
in	1
a	1
stately	1
pose	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
ceremony	1
just	1
completed.	1
He	1
lay	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
propped	1
high	1
on	1
the	1
pillows.	1
His	1
hands	1
were	1
symmetrically	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
silk	1
quilt,	1
the	1
palms	1
downward.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
gazing	1
straight	1
at	1
him,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
by	1
mortal	1
man.	1
Either	1
this	1
look	1
meant	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
one	1
has	1
eyes	1
they	1
must	1
look	1
somewhere,	1
or	1
it	1
meant	1
too	1
much.	1
Pierre	1
hesitated,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
guide.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
made	1
a	1
hurried	1
sign	1
with	1
her	1
eyes,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
man's	1
hand	1
and	1
moving	1
her	1
lips	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
send	1
it	1
a	1
kiss.	1
Pierre,	1
carefully	1
stretching	1
his	1
neck	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
quilt,	1
followed	1
her	1
suggestion	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
boned,	1
fleshy	1
hand.	1
Neither	1
the	1
hand	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
muscle	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
face	1
stirred.	1
Once	1
more	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
next.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
indicated	1
a	1
chair	1
that	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
bed.	1
Pierre	1
obediently	1
sat	1
down,	1
his	1
eyes	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
doing	1
right.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
nodded	1
approvingly.	1
Again	1
Pierre	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
naively	1
symmetrical	1
pose	1
of	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
statue,	1
evidently	1
distressed	1
that	1
his	1
stout	1
and	1
clumsy	1
body	1
took	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
room	1
and	1
doing	1
his	1
utmost	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
possible.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
still	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
he	1
sat	1
down.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
indicated	1
by	1
her	1
attitude	1
her	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
pathetic	1
importance	1
of	1
these	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
This	1
lasted	1
about	1
two	1
minutes,	1
which	1
to	1
Pierre	1
seemed	1
an	1
hour.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
broad	1
muscles	1
and	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
twitch.	1
The	1
twitching	1
increased,	1
the	1
handsome	1
mouth	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
(only	1
now	1
did	1
Pierre	1
realize	1
how	1
near	1
death	1
his	1
father	1
was),	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
distorted	1
mouth	1
issued	1
an	1
indistinct,	1
hoarse	1
sound.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
looked	1
attentively	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
man's	1
eyes,	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
wanted;	1
she	1
pointed	1
first	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
then	1
to	1
some	1
drink,	1
then	1
named	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
an	1
inquiring	1
whisper,	1
then	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
quilt.	1
The	1
eyes	1
and	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
showed	1
impatience.	1
He	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
stood	1
constantly	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
"Wants	1
to	1
turn	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
servant,	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
count's	1
heavy	1
body	1
toward	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
being	1
turned	1
over,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
arms	1
fell	1
back	1
helplessly	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
fruitless	1
effort	1
to	1
pull	1
it	1
forward.	1
Whether	1
he	1
noticed	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
terror	1
with	1
which	1
Pierre	1
regarded	1
that	1
lifeless	1
arm,	1
or	1
whether	1
some	1
other	1
thought	1
flitted	1
across	1
his	1
dying	1
brain,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
refractory	1
arm,	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
terror-stricken	1
face,	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
arm,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
a	1
feeble,	1
piteous	1
smile	1
appeared,	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
features,	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
deride	1
his	1
own	1
helplessness.	1
At	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
smile	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
an	1
unexpected	1
quivering	1
in	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
tickling	1
in	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
tears	1
dimmed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
turned	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
side	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall.	1
He	1
sighed.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
dozing,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
observing	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
princesses	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
turn	1
at	1
watching.	1
"Let	1
us	1
go."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXIV	1
	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
except	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
who	1
were	1
sitting	1
under	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine	1
the	1
Great	1
and	1
talking	1
eagerly.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
they	1
became	1
silent,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
princess	1
hide	1
something	1
as	1
she	1
whispered:	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
bear	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
woman."	1
	1
"Catiche	1
has	1
had	1
tea	1
served	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
drawing	1
room,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Go	1
and	1
take	1
something,	1
my	1
poor	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
hold	1
out."	1
	1
To	1
Pierre	1
he	1
said	1
nothing,	1
merely	1
giving	1
his	1
arm	1
a	1
sympathetic	1
squeeze	1
below	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
with	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
into	1
the	1
small	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
refreshing	1
after	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night	1
as	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
this	1
delicious	1
Russian	1
tea,"	1
Lorrain	1
was	1
saying	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
restrained	1
animation	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
sipping	1
tea	1
from	1
a	1
delicate	1
Chinese	1
handleless	1
cup	1
before	1
a	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
tea	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
supper	1
were	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
circular	1
room.	1
Around	1
the	1
table	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
house	1
that	1
night	1
had	1
gathered	1
to	1
fortify	1
themselves.	1
Pierre	1
well	1
remembered	1
this	1
small	1
circular	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
its	1
mirrors	1
and	1
little	1
tables.	1
During	1
balls	1
given	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
dance,	1
had	1
liked	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
ladies	1
who,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
in	1
their	1
ball	1
dresses	1
with	1
diamonds	1
and	1
pearls	1
on	1
their	1
bare	1
shoulders,	1
looked	1
at	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
brilliantly	1
lighted	1
mirrors	1
which	1
repeated	1
their	1
reflections	1
several	1
times.	1
Now	1
this	1
same	1
room	1
was	1
dimly	1
lighted	1
by	1
two	1
candles.	1
On	1
one	1
small	1
table	1
tea	1
things	1
and	1
supper	1
dishes	1
stood	1
in	1
disorder,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
a	1
motley	1
throng	1
of	1
people	1
sat	1
there,	1
not	1
merrymaking,	1
but	1
somberly	1
whispering,	1
and	1
betraying	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
movement	1
that	1
they	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
forgot	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
eat	1
anything	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
very	1
much	1
have	1
liked	1
to.	1
He	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
monitress	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
again	1
going	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess.	1
Pierre	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
also	1
was	1
essential,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
interval	1
followed	1
her.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1
princess,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
speaking	1
in	1
excited	1
whispers.	1
	1
"Permit	1
me,	1
Princess,	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
necessary	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
not	1
necessary,"	1
said	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
speakers,	1
evidently	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
room.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
princess,"	1
answered	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
blandly	1
but	1
impressively,	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
and	1
preventing	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
passing,	1
"won't	1
this	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
poor	1
Uncle	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
needs	1
repose?	1
Worldly	1
conversation	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
already	1
prepared..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
in	1
his	1
familiar	1
attitude,	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
crossed	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
other.	1
His	1
cheeks,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
flabby	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
heavier	1
below,	1
were	1
twitching	1
violently;	1
but	1
he	1
wore	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
little	1
concerned	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
saying.	1
	1
"Come,	1
my	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
let	1
Catiche	1
do	1
as	1
she	1
pleases.	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
fond	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
of	1
her."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
paper,"	1
said	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ladies,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
an	1
inlaid	1
portfolio	1
she	1
held	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
"All	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
his	1
real	1
will	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
writing	1
table,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
paper	1
he	1
has	1
forgotten...."	1
	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
pass	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
sprang	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bar	1
her	1
path.	1
	1
"I	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
kind	1
princess,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
seizing	1
the	1
portfolio	1
so	1
firmly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
easily.	1
"Dear	1
princess,	1
I	1
beg	1
and	1
implore	1
you,	1
have	1
some	1
pity	1
on	1
him!	1
Je	1
vous	1
en	1
conjure..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
Their	1
efforts	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
the	1
portfolio	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
audible,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
speak,	1
her	1
words	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
flattering	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
Though	1
the	1
latter	1
held	1
on	1
tenaciously,	1
her	1
voice	1
lost	1
none	1
of	1
its	1
honeyed	1
firmness	1
and	1
softness.	1
	1
"Pierre,	1
my	1
dear,	1
come	1
here.	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
consultation;	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
Prince?"	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak,	1
cousin?"	1
suddenly	1
shrieked	1
the	1
princess	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
heard	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
startled.	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
remain	1
silent	1
when	1
heaven	1
knows	1
who	1
permits	1
herself	1
to	1
interfere,	1
making	1
a	1
scene	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
threshold	1
of	1
a	1
dying	1
man's	1
room?	1
Intriguer!"	1
she	1
hissed	1
viciously,	1
and	1
tugged	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might	1
at	1
the	1
portfolio.	1
	1
But	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
went	1
forward	1
a	1
step	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
portfolio,	1
and	1
changed	1
her	1
grip.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
rose.	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
reproach	1
and	1
surprise,	1
"this	1
is	1
absurd!	1
Come,	1
let	1
go	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
let	1
go.	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
too!"	1
	1
But	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
did	1
not	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
"Let	1
go,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
responsibility.	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
him,	1
I!...	1
does	1
that	1
satisfy	1
you?"	1
	1
"But,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"after	1
such	1
a	1
solemn	1
sacrament,	1
allow	1
him	1
a	1
moment's	1
peace!	1
Here,	1
Pierre,	1
tell	1
them	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
said	1
she,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who,	1
having	1
come	1
quite	1
close,	1
was	1
gazing	1
with	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
angry	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
which	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
dignity,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
twitching	1
cheeks	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"Remember	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
consequences,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
severely.	1
"You	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing."	1
	1
"Vile	1
woman!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
princess,	1
darting	1
unexpectedly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
portfolio	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
that	1
terrible	1
door,	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
watched	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
opened	1
so	1
quietly,	1
burst	1
noisily	1
open	1
and	1
banged	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
sisters	1
rushed	1
out	1
wringing	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing!"	1
she	1
cried	1
vehemently.	1
"He	1
is	1
dying	1
and	1
you	1
leave	1
me	1
alone	1
with	1
him!"	1
	1
Her	1
sister	1
dropped	1
the	1
portfolio.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
stooping,	1
quickly	1
caught	1
up	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
contention	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
recovering	1
themselves,	1
followed	1
her.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
eldest	1
sister	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
hard	1
face,	1
again	1
biting	1
her	1
underlip.	1
At	1
sight	1
of	1
Pierre	1
her	1
expression	1
showed	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
hatred.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
now	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
glad!"	1
said	1
she;	1
"this	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
waiting	1
for."	1
And	1
bursting	1
into	1
tears	1
she	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
came	1
next.	1
He	1
staggered	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
on	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
and	1
dropped	1
onto	1
it,	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
jaw	1
quivered	1
and	1
shook	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
an	1
ague.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
friend!"	1
said	1
he,	1
taking	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
elbow;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
a	1
sincerity	1
and	1
weakness	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
observed	1
in	1
it	1
before.	1
"How	1
often	1
we	1
sin,	1
how	1
much	1
we	1
deceive,	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
what?	1
I	1
am	1
near	1
sixty,	1
dear	1
friend...	1
I	1
too...	1
All	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
death,	1
all!	1
Death	1
is	1
awful..."	1
and	1
he	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
came	1
out	1
last.	1
She	1
approached	1
Pierre	1
with	1
slow,	1
quiet	1
steps.	1
	1
"Pierre!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
inquiring	1
look.	1
She	1
kissed	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
forehead,	1
wetting	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
tears.	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
no	1
more...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Come,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you.	1
Try	1
to	1
weep,	1
nothing	1
gives	1
such	1
relief	1
as	1
tears."	1
	1
She	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
Pierre	1
was	1
glad	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
face.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
returned	1
he	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre:	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
for	1
us	1
all,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
you.	1
But	1
God	1
will	1
support	1
you:	1
you	1
are	1
young,	1
and	1
are	1
now,	1
I	1
hope,	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
fortune.	1
The	1
will	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
opened.	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
your	1
head,	1
but	1
it	1
imposes	1
duties	1
on	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
man."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
silent.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
later	1
on	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
there,	1
God	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened!	1
You	1
know,	1
Uncle	1
promised	1
me	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
Boris.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time.	1
I	1
hope,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
you	1
will	1
carry	1
out	1
your	1
father's	1
wish?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
understood	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
coloring	1
shyly	1
looked	1
in	1
silence	1
at	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
After	1
her	1
talk	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
On	1
waking	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
death.	1
She	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
died	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
wish	1
to	1
die,	1
that	1
his	1
end	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
touching	1
but	1
edifying.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
meeting	1
between	1
father	1
and	1
son,	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
touching	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
tears,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
had	1
behaved	1
better	1
during	1
those	1
awful	1
moments--the	1
father	1
who	1
so	1
remembered	1
everything	1
and	1
everybody	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
such	1
pathetic	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
son,	1
or	1
Pierre,	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pitiful	1
to	1
see,	1
so	1
stricken	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
grief,	1
though	1
he	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
sadden	1
his	1
dying	1
father.	1
"It	1
is	1
painful,	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
one	1
good.	1
It	1
uplifts	1
the	1
soul	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
and	1
his	1
worthy	1
son,"	1
said	1
she.	1
Of	1
the	1
behavior	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
she	1
spoke	1
disapprovingly,	1
but	1
in	1
whispers	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
secret.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXV	1
	1
At	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Andreevich	1
Bolkonski's	1
estate,	1
the	1

of	1
young	1
Prince	1

wife	1
was	1
daily	1
expected,	1
but	1
this	1
expectation	1
did	1
not	1
upset	1
the	1
regular	1
routine	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
household.	1
General	1
in	1
Chief	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Andreevich	1
(nicknamed	1
in	1
society,	1
"the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia")	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Paul	1
had	1
exiled	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
estate	1
had	1
lived	1
there	1
continuously	1
with	1
his	1
daughter,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
her	1
companion,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
Though	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
reign	1
he	1
was	1
free	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
capitals,	1
he	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
remarking	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
could	1
come	1
the	1
hundred	1
miles	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
while	1
he	1
himself	1
needed	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
nothing.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
sources	1
of	1
human	1
vice--idleness	1
and	1
superstition,	1
and	1
only	1
two	1
virtues--activity	1
and	1
intelligence.	1
He	1
himself	1
undertook	1
his	1
daughter's	1
education,	1
and	1
to	1
develop	1
these	1
two	1
cardinal	1
virtues	1
in	1
her	1
gave	1
her	1
lessons	1
in	1
algebra	1
and	1
geometry	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
twenty,	1
and	1
arranged	1
her	1
life	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
whole	1
time	1
was	1
occupied.	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
always	1
occupied:	1
writing	1
his	1
memoirs,	1
solving	1
problems	1
in	1
higher	1
mathematics,	1
turning	1
snuffboxes	1
on	1
a	1
lathe,	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
or	1
superintending	1
the	1
building	1
that	1
was	1
always	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
his	1
estate.	1
As	1
regularity	1
is	1
a	1
prime	1
condition	1
facilitating	1
activity,	1
regularity	1
in	1
his	1
household	1
was	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
point	1
of	1
exactitude.	1
He	1
always	1
came	1
to	1
table	1
under	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
conditions,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
minute.	1
With	1
those	1
about	1
him,	1
from	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
his	1
serfs,	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
sharp	1
and	1
invariably	1
exacting,	1
so	1
that	1
without	1
being	1
a	1
hardhearted	1
man	1
he	1
inspired	1
such	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
as	1
few	1
hardhearted	1
men	1
would	1
have	1
aroused.	1
Although	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
retirement	1
and	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
influence	1
in	1
political	1
affairs,	1
every	1
high	1
official	1
appointed	1
to	1
the	1
province	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
prince's	1
estate	1
lay	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
and	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
lofty	1
antechamber	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
architect,	1
gardener,	1
or	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did,	1
till	1
the	1
prince	1
appeared	1
punctually	1
to	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour.	1
Everyone	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
antechamber	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
even	1
fear	1
when	1
the	1
enormously	1
high	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
rather	1
small	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
powdered	1
wig,	1
small	1
withered	1
hands,	1
and	1
bushy	1
gray	1
eyebrows	1
which,	1
when	1
he	1
frowned,	1
sometimes	1
hid	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
his	1
shrewd,	1
youthfully	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
couple	1
were	1
to	1
arrive,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entered	1
the	1
antechamber	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
for	1
the	1
morning	1
greeting,	1
crossing	1
herself	1
with	1
trepidation	1
and	1
repeating	1
a	1
silent	1
prayer.	1
Every	1
morning	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
like	1
that,	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
prayed	1
that	1
the	1
daily	1
interview	1
might	1
pass	1
off	1
well.	1
	1
An	1
old	1
powdered	1
manservant	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
antechamber	1
rose	1
quietly	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
"Please	1
walk	1
in."	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
regular	1
hum	1
of	1
a	1
lathe.	1
The	1
princess	1
timidly	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
moved	1
noiselessly	1
and	1
easily.	1
She	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
entrance.	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
lathe	1
and	1
after	1
glancing	1
round	1
continued	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
The	1
enormous	1
study	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
things	1
evidently	1
in	1
constant	1
use.	1
The	1
large	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
plans,	1
the	1
tall	1
glass-fronted	1
bookcases	1
with	1
keys	1
in	1
the	1
locks,	1
the	1
high	1
desk	1
for	1
writing	1
while	1
standing	1
up,	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
an	1
open	1
exercise	1
book,	1
and	1
the	1
lathe	1
with	1
tools	1
laid	1
ready	1
to	1
hand	1
and	1
shavings	1
scattered	1
around--all	1
indicated	1
continuous,	1
varied,	1
and	1
orderly	1
activity.	1
The	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
foot	1
shod	1
in	1
a	1
Tartar	1
boot	1
embroidered	1
with	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
firm	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
lean	1
sinewy	1
hand,	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
still	1
possessed	1
the	1
tenacious	1
endurance	1
and	1
vigor	1
of	1
hardy	1
old	1
age.	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
turns	1
of	1
the	1
lathe	1
he	1
removed	1
his	1
foot	1
from	1
the	1
pedal,	1
wiped	1
his	1
chisel,	1
dropped	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
leather	1
pouch	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
lathe,	1
and,	1
approaching	1
the	1
table,	1
summoned	1
his	1
daughter.	1
He	1
never	1
gave	1
his	1
children	1
a	1
blessing,	1
so	1
he	1
simply	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
bristly	1
cheek	1
(as	1
yet	1
unshaven)	1
and,	1
regarding	1
her	1
tenderly	1
and	1
attentively,	1
said	1
severely:	1
	1
"Quite	1
well?	1
All	1
right	1
then,	1
sit	1
down."	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
containing	1
lessons	1
in	1
geometry	1
written	1
by	1
himself	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
foot.	1
	1
"For	1
tomorrow!"	1
said	1
he,	1
quickly	1
finding	1
the	1
page	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
scratch	1
from	1
one	1
paragraph	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
his	1
hard	1
nail.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
here's	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
suddenly,	1
taking	1
a	1
letter	1
addressed	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
hand	1
from	1
a	1
bag	1
hanging	1
above	1
the	1
table,	1
onto	1
which	1
he	1
threw	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
red	1
patches	1
showed	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
princess'	1
face.	1
She	1
took	1
it	1
quickly	1
and	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
it.	1
	1
"From	1
Heloise?"	1
asked	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
his	1
still	1
sound,	1
yellowish	1
teeth.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
from	1
Julie,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
and	1
a	1
timid	1
smile.	1
	1
"I'll	1
let	1
two	1
more	1
letters	1
pass,	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
I'll	1
read,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
sternly;	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
you	1
write	1
much	1
nonsense.	1
I'll	1
read	1
the	1
third!"	1
	1
"Read	1
this	1
if	1
you	1
like,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
blushing	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
"The	1
third,	1
I	1
said	1
the	1
third!"	1
cried	1
the	1
prince	1
abruptly,	1
pushing	1
the	1
letter	1
away,	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
drew	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
containing	1
geometrical	1
figures.	1
	1
"Well,	1
madam,"	1
he	1
began,	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
book	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
placing	1
an	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
sat,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
surrounded	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
by	1
the	1
acrid	1
scent	1
of	1
old	1
age	1
and	1
tobacco,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
so	1
long.	1
"Now,	1
madam,	1
these	1
triangles	1
are	1
equal;	1
please	1
note	1
that	1
the	1
angle	1
ABC..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
way	1
at	1
her	1
father's	1
eyes	1
glittering	1
close	1
to	1
her;	1
the	1
red	1
patches	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
came	1
and	1
went,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
nothing	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
her	1
fear	1
would	1
prevent	1
her	1
understanding	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
further	1
explanations,	1
however	1
clear	1
they	1
might	1
be.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
teacher's	1
fault	1
or	1
the	1
pupil's,	1
this	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
every	1
day:	1
the	1
princess'	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
anything,	1
but	1
was	1
only	1
conscious	1
of	1
her	1
stern	1
father's	1
withered	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her,	1
of	1
his	1
breath	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
could	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
problem	1
in	1
peace.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
beside	1
himself:	1
moved	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
noisily	1
backward	1
and	1
forward,	1
made	1
efforts	1
to	1
control	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
become	1
vehement,	1
but	1
almost	1
always	1
did	1
become	1
vehement,	1
scolded,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
flung	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
gave	1
a	1
wrong	1
answer.	1
	1
"Well	1
now,	1
isn't	1
she	1
a	1
fool!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince,	1
pushing	1
the	1
book	1
aside	1
and	1
turning	1
sharply	1
away;	1
but	1
rising	1
immediately,	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
lightly	1
touched	1
his	1
daughter's	1
hair	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again.	1
	1
He	1
drew	1
up	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
explain.	1
	1
"This	1
won't	1
do,	1
Princess;	1
it	1
won't	1
do,"	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
having	1
taken	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
day's	1
lesson,	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
leave:	1
"Mathematics	1
are	1
most	1
important,	1
madam!	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
like	1
our	1
silly	1
ladies.	1
Get	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
you'll	1
like	1
it,"	1
and	1
he	1
patted	1
her	1
cheek.	1
"It	1
will	1
drive	1
all	1
the	1
nonsense	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
head."	1
	1
She	1
turned	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
uncut	1
book	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
desk.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
Key	1
to	1
the	1
Mysteries	1
that	1
your	1
Heloise	1
has	1
sent	1
you.	1
Religious!	1
I	1
don't	1
interfere	1
with	1
anyone's	1
belief...	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
at	1
it.	1
Take	1
it.	1
Well,	1
now	1
go.	1
Go."	1
	1
He	1
patted	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
himself	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
sad,	1
scared	1
expression	1
that	1
rarely	1
left	1
her	1
and	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
plain,	1
sickly	1
face	1
yet	1
plainer.	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
writing	1
table,	1
on	1
which	1
stood	1
miniature	1
portraits	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
littered	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
papers.	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
as	1
untidy	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
tidy.	1
She	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
geometry	1
book	1
and	1
eagerly	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
her	1
letter.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
her	1
most	1
intimate	1
friend	1
from	1
childhood;	1
that	1
same	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
name-	1
day	1
party.	1
	1
Julie	1
wrote	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
Dear	1
and	1
precious	1
Friend,	1
How	1
terrible	1
and	1
frightful	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
separation!	1
Though	1
I	1
tell	1
myself	1
that	1
half	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
half	1
my	1
happiness	1
are	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
separating	1
us	1
our	1
hearts	1
are	1
united	1
by	1
indissoluble	1
bonds,	1
my	1
heart	1
rebels	1
against	1
fate	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
and	1
distractions	1
around	1
me	1
I	1
cannot	1
overcome	1
a	1
certain	1
secret	1
sorrow	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
ever	1
since	1
we	1
parted.	1
Why	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
together	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
last	1
summer,	1
in	1
your	1
big	1
study,	1
on	1
the	1
blue	1
sofa,	1
the	1
confidential	1
sofa?	1
Why	1
cannot	1
I	1
now,	1
as	1
three	1
months	1
ago,	1
draw	1
fresh	1
moral	1
strength	1
from	1
your	1
look,	1
so	1
gentle,	1
calm,	1
and	1
penetrating,	1
a	1
look	1
I	1
loved	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
write?	1
	1
Having	1
read	1
thus	1
far,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sighed	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
mirror	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
her	1
right.	1
It	1
reflected	1
a	1
weak,	1
ungraceful	1
figure	1
and	1
thin	1
face.	1
Her	1
eyes,	1
always	1
sad,	1
now	1
looked	1
with	1
particular	1
hopelessness	1
at	1
her	1
reflection	1
in	1
the	1
glass.	1
"She	1
flatters	1
me,"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess,	1
turning	1
away	1
and	1
continuing	1
to	1
read.	1
But	1
Julie	1
did	1
not	1
flatter	1
her	1
friend,	1
the	1
princess'	1
eyes--large,	1
deep	1
and	1
luminous	1
(it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
times	1
there	1
radiated	1
from	1
them	1
shafts	1
of	1
warm	1
light)--were	1
so	1
beautiful	1
that	1
very	1
often	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
plainness	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
they	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
attraction	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
beauty.	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
beautiful	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
eyes--the	1
look	1
they	1
had	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
herself.	1
As	1
with	1
everyone,	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
forced	1
unnatural	1
expression	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
glass.	1
She	1
went	1
on	1
reading:	1
	1
All	1
Moscow	1
talks	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
war.	1
One	1
of	1
my	1
two	1
brothers	1
is	1
already	1
abroad,	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Guards,	1
who	1
are	1
starting	1
on	1
their	1
march	1
to	1
the	1
frontier.	1
Our	1
dear	1
Emperor	1
has	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
thought	1
intends	1
to	1
expose	1
his	1
precious	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
war.	1
God	1
grant	1
that	1
the	1
Corsican	1
monster	1
who	1
is	1
destroying	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
Europe	1
may	1
be	1
overthrown	1
by	1
the	1
angel	1
whom	1
it	1
has	1
pleased	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
in	1
His	1
goodness,	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
as	1
sovereign!	1
To	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
my	1
brothers,	1
this	1
war	1
has	1
deprived	1
me	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
associations	1
nearest	1
my	1
heart.	1
I	1
mean	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
enthusiasm	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
remain	1
inactive	1
and	1
has	1
left	1
the	1
university	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army.	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
to	1
you,	1
dear	1
Mary,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
extreme	1
youth	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
grief	1
to	1
me.	1
This	1
young	1
man,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
you	1
last	1
summer,	1
is	1
so	1
noble-minded	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
that	1
real	1
youthfulness	1
which	1
one	1
seldom	1
finds	1
nowadays	1
among	1
our	1
old	1
men	1
of	1
twenty	1
and,	1
particularly,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
frank	1
and	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
heart.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
pure	1
and	1
poetic	1
that	1
my	1
relations	1
with	1
him,	1
transient	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sweetest	1
comforts	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
heart,	1
which	1
has	1
already	1
suffered	1
so	1
much.	1
Someday	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
our	1
parting	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
then.	1
That	1
is	1
still	1
too	1
fresh.	1
Ah,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
you	1
are	1
happy	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
these	1
poignant	1
joys	1
and	1
sorrows.	1
You	1
are	1
fortunate,	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
are	1
generally	1
the	1
stronger!	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
Count	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
too	1
young	1
ever	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
a	1
friend,	1
but	1
this	1
sweet	1
friendship,	1
this	1
poetic	1
and	1
pure	1
intimacy,	1
were	1
what	1
my	1
heart	1
needed.	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
this!	1
The	1
chief	1
news,	1
about	1
which	1
all	1
Moscow	1
gossips,	1
is	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
old	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
Fancy!	1
The	1
three	1
princesses	1
have	1
received	1
very	1
little,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
nothing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre	1
who	1
has	1
inherited	1
all	1
the	1
property	1
and	1
has	1
besides	1
been	1
recognized	1
as	1
legitimate;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
and	1
possessor	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
fortune	1
in	1
Russia.	1
It	1
is	1
rumored	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
played	1
a	1
very	1
despicable	1
part	1
in	1
this	1
affair	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
quite	1
crestfallen.	1
	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
understand	1
very	1
little	1
about	1
all	1
these	1
matters	1
of	1
wills	1
and	1
inheritance;	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
whom	1
we	1
all	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
plain	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
has	1
become	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
fortunes	1
in	1
Russia,	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
amused	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
and	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
mammas	1
burdened	1
by	1
marriageable	1
daughters,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
themselves,	1
toward	1
him,	1
though,	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
he	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
poor	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
past	1
two	1
years	1
people	1
have	1
amused	1
themselves	1
by	1
finding	1
husbands	1
for	1
me	1
(most	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
don't	1
even	1
know),	1
the	1
matchmaking	1
chronicles	1
of	1
Moscow	1
now	1
speak	1
of	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
future	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
for	1
the	1
post.	1
A	1
propos	1
of	1
marriages:	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
while	1
ago	1
that	1
universal	1
auntie	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
told	1
me,	1
under	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
strict	1
secrecy,	1
of	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
marriage	1
for	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
than	1
with	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son	1
Anatole,	1
whom	1
they	1
wish	1
to	1
reform	1
by	1
marrying	1
him	1
to	1
someone	1
rich	1
and	1
distinguee,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
you	1
that	1
his	1
relations'	1
choice	1
has	1
fallen.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
handsome	1
and	1
a	1
terrible	1
scapegrace.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
gossip.	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
second	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
Mamma	1
has	1
sent	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
Apraksins'.	1
Read	1
the	1
mystical	1
book	1
I	1
am	1
sending	1
you;	1
it	1
has	1
an	1
enormous	1
success	1
here.	1
Though	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
in	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
the	1
feeble	1
human	1
mind	1
to	1
grasp,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
admirable	1
book	1
which	1
calms	1
and	1
elevates	1
the	1
soul.	1
Adieu!	1
Give	1
my	1
respects	1
to	1
monsieur	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
compliments	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
I	1
embrace	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
love	1
you.	1
	1
JULIE	1
	1
P.S.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
charming	1
little	1
wife.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
pondered	1
awhile	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
entirely	1
transformed.	1
Then	1
she	1
suddenly	1
rose	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
heavy	1
tread	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
She	1
took	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
and	1
her	1
hand	1
moved	1
rapidly	1
over	1
it.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
reply	1
she	1
wrote,	1
also	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
Dear	1
and	1
precious	1
Friend,	1
Your	1
letter	1
of	1
the	1
13th	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
great	1
delight.	1
So	1
you	1
still	1
love	1
me,	1
my	1
romantic	1
Julie?	1
Separation,	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
is	1
bad,	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
its	1
usual	1
effect	1
on	1
you.	1
You	1
complain	1
of	1
our	1
separation.	1
What	1
then	1
should	1
I	1
say,	1
if	1
I	1
dared	1
complain,	1
I	1
who	1
am	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
are	1
dear	1
to	1
me?	1
Ah,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
religion	1
to	1
console	1
us	1
life	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
sad.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
look	1
severely	1
on	1
your	1
affection	1
for	1
that	1
young	1
man?	1
On	1
such	1
matters	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
severe	1
with	1
myself.	1
I	1
understand	1
such	1
feelings	1
in	1
others,	1
and	1
if	1
never	1
having	1
felt	1
them	1
I	1
cannot	1
approve	1
of	1
them,	1
neither	1
do	1
I	1
condemn	1
them.	1
Only	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Christian	1
love,	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
neighbor,	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
enemy,	1
is	1
worthier,	1
sweeter,	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
the	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
can	1
inspire	1
in	1
a	1
romantic	1
and	1
loving	1
young	1
girl	1
like	1
yourself.	1
	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
death	1
reached	1
us	1
before	1
your	1
letter	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
much	1
affected	1
by	1
it.	1
He	1
says	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
representative	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
century,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
turn	1
now,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
he	1
can	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
turn	1
come	1
as	1
late	1
as	1
possible.	1
God	1
preserve	1
us	1
from	1
that	1
terrible	1
misfortune!	1
	1
I	1
cannot	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
about	1
Pierre,	1
whom	1
I	1
knew	1
as	1
a	1
child.	1
He	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
excellent	1
heart,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
quality	1
I	1
value	1
most	1
in	1
people.	1
As	1
to	1
his	1
inheritance	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
played	1
by	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
sad	1
for	1
both.	1
Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour's	1
words,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
Kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
are	1
terribly	1
true.	1
I	1
pity	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
but	1
am	1
still	1
more	1
sorry	1
for	1
Pierre.	1
So	1
young,	1
and	1
burdened	1
with	1
such	1
riches--to	1
what	1
temptations	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
exposed!	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
asked	1
what	1
I	1
desire	1
most	1
on	1
earth,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
poorer	1
than	1
the	1
poorest	1
beggar.	1
A	1
thousand	1
thanks,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
for	1
the	1
volume	1
you	1
have	1
sent	1
me	1
and	1
which	1
has	1
such	1
success	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Yet	1
since	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
among	1
some	1
good	1
things	1
it	1
contains	1
others	1
which	1
our	1
weak	1
human	1
understanding	1
cannot	1
grasp,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
rather	1
useless	1
to	1
spend	1
time	1
in	1
reading	1
what	1
is	1
unintelligible	1
and	1
can	1
therefore	1
bear	1
no	1
fruit.	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
the	1
fondness	1
some	1
people	1
have	1
for	1
confusing	1
their	1
minds	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
mystical	1
books	1
that	1
merely	1
awaken	1
their	1
doubts	1
and	1
excite	1
their	1
imagination,	1
giving	1
them	1
a	1
bent	1
for	1
exaggeration	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
Christian	1
simplicity.	1
Let	1
us	1
rather	1
read	1
the	1
Epistles	1
and	1
Gospels.	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
seek	1
to	1
penetrate	1
what	1
mysteries	1
they	1
contain;	1
for	1
how	1
can	1
we,	1
miserable	1
sinners	1
that	1
we	1
are,	1
know	1
the	1
terrible	1
and	1
holy	1
secrets	1
of	1
Providence	1
while	1
we	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
flesh	1
which	1
forms	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
veil	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
the	1
Eternal?	1
Let	1
us	1
rather	1
confine	1
ourselves	1
to	1
studying	1
those	1
sublime	1
rules	1
which	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour	1
has	1
left	1
for	1
our	1
guidance	1
here	1
below.	1
Let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
conform	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
follow	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
less	1
we	1
let	1
our	1
feeble	1
human	1
minds	1
roam,	1
the	1
better	1
we	1
shall	1
please	1
God,	1
who	1
rejects	1
all	1
knowledge	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
Him;	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
we	1
seek	1
to	1
fathom	1
what	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
conceal	1
from	1
us,	1
the	1
sooner	1
will	1
He	1
vouchsafe	1
its	1
revelation	1
to	1
us	1
through	1
His	1
divine	1
Spirit.	1
	1
My	1
father	1
has	1
not	1
spoken	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
suitor,	1
but	1
has	1
only	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
is	1
expecting	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
project	1
of	1
marriage	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,	1
dear	1
sweet	1
friend,	1
that	1
I	1
look	1
on	1
marriage	1
as	1
a	1
divine	1
institution	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
conform.	1
However	1
painful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
me,	1
should	1
the	1
Almighty	1
lay	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
wife	1
and	1
mother	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
perform	1
them	1
as	1
faithfully	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
without	1
disquieting	1
myself	1
by	1
examining	1
my	1
feelings	1
toward	1
him	1
whom	1
He	1
may	1
give	1
me	1
for	1
husband.	1
	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
brother,	1
who	1
announces	1
his	1
speedy	1
arrival	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
with	1
his	1
wife.	1
This	1
pleasure	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
brief	1
one,	1
however,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
this	1
unhappy	1
war	1
into	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
drawn,	1
God	1
knows	1
how	1
or	1
why.	1
Not	1
only	1
where	1
you	1
are--at	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
affairs	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
world--is	1
the	1
talk	1
all	1
of	1
war,	1
even	1
here	1
amid	1
fieldwork	1
and	1
the	1
calm	1
of	1
nature--which	1
townsfolk	1
consider	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
country--rumors	1
of	1
war	1
are	1
heard	1
and	1
painfully	1
felt.	1
My	1
father	1
talks	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
marches	1
and	1
countermarches,	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
understand	1
nothing;	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
during	1
my	1
daily	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
I	1
witnessed	1
a	1
heartrending	1
scene....	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
conscripts	1
enrolled	1
from	1
our	1
people	1
and	1
starting	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army.	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
mothers,	1
wives,	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
going	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
sobs.	1
It	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
mankind	1
has	1
forgotten	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
its	1
divine	1
Saviour,	1
Who	1
preached	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
injuries--	1
and	1
that	1
men	1
attribute	1
the	1
greatest	1
merit	1
to	1
skill	1
in	1
killing	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Adieu,	1
dear	1
and	1
kind	1
friend;	1
may	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour	1
and	1
His	1
most	1
Holy	1
Mother	1
keep	1
you	1
in	1
their	1
holy	1
and	1
all-powerful	1
care!	1
	1
MARY	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you	1
are	1
sending	1
off	1
a	1
letter,	1
Princess?	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
dispatched	1
mine.	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
mother,"	1
said	1
the	1
smiling	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
rapidly,	1
in	1
her	1
pleasant	1
mellow	1
tones	1
and	1
with	1
guttural	1
r's.	1
She	1
brought	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
strenuous,	1
mournful,	1
and	1
gloomy	1
world	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
atmosphere,	1
careless,	1
lighthearted,	1
and	1
self-satisfied.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
I	1
must	1
warn	1
you,"	1
she	1
added,	1
lowering	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
evidently	1
listening	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
speaking	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
grasseyement,	1
"the	1
prince	1
has	1
been	1
scolding	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich.	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
humor,	1
very	1
morose.	1
Be	1
prepared."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
dear	1
friend,"	1
replied	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
"I	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
warn	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
humor	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
in.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
judge	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
others	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
and,	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
five	1
minutes	1
late	1
in	1
starting	1
her	1
practice	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
alarm.	1
Between	1
twelve	1
and	1
two	1
o'clock,	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
mapped	1
out,	1
the	1
prince	1
rested	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
played	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XXVI	1
	1
The	1
gray-haired	1
valet	1
was	1
sitting	1
drowsily	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
snoring	1
of	1
the	1
prince,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
large	1
study.	1
From	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
doors	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
difficult	1
passages--twenty	1
times	1
repeated--of	1
a	1
sonata	1
by	1
Dussek.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
a	1
closed	1
carriage	1
and	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
hood	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
helped	1
his	1
little	1
wife	1
to	1
alight,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
before	1
him.	1
Old	1
Tikhon,	1
wearing	1
a	1
wig,	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
antechamber,	1
reported	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
hastily	1
closed	1
the	1
door.	1
Tikhon	1
knew	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
son's	1
arrival	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
unusual	1
event	1
must	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
appointed	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
apparently	1
knew	1
this	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Tikhon;	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
his	1
father's	1
habits	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
last,	1
and,	1
having	1
assured	1
himself	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
"He	1
will	1
get	1
up	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
across	1
to	1
Mary's	1
room,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
grown	1
stouter	1
during	1
this	1
time,	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
short,	1
downy,	1
smiling	1
lip	1
lifted	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
just	1
as	1
merrily	1
and	1
prettily	1
as	1
ever.	1
	1
"Why,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
palace!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
looking	1
around	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
people	1
compliment	1
their	1
host	1
at	1
a	1
ball.	1
"Let's	1
come,	1
quick,	1
quick!"	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
round,	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
Tikhon,	1
at	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
accompanied	1
them.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
Mary	1
practicing?	1
Let's	1
go	1
quietly	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
by	1
surprise."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
followed	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
courteous	1
but	1
sad	1
expression.	1
	1
"You've	1
grown	1
older,	1
Tikhon,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
passing	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
who	1
kissed	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
Before	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
clavichord	1
came,	1
the	1
pretty,	1
fair	1
haired	1
Frenchwoman,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
rushed	1
out	1
apparently	1
beside	1
herself	1
with	1
delight.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
what	1
joy	1
for	1
the	1
princess!"	1
exclaimed	1
she:	1
"At	1
last!	1
I	1
must	1
let	1
her	1
know."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
please	1
not...	1
You	1
are	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
kissing	1
her.	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
already	1
through	1
my	1
sister-in-law's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
expecting	1
us?"	1
	1
They	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
oft-repeated	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
sonata.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
grimace,	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
something	1
unpleasant.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
passage	1
broke	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
a	1
cry	1
was	1
heard,	1
then	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
heavy	1
tread	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
kissing.	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
princesses,	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
met	1
once	1
before	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
wedding,	1
were	1
in	1
each	1
other's	1
arms	1
warmly	1
pressing	1
their	1
lips	1
to	1
whatever	1
place	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
touch.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
stood	1
near	1
them	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
heart,	1
with	1
a	1
beatific	1
smile	1
and	1
obviously	1
equally	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
or	1
to	1
laugh.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
frowned,	1
as	1
lovers	1
of	1
music	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
hear	1
a	1
false	1
note.	1
The	1
two	1
women	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
late,	1
seized	1
each	1
other's	1
hands,	1
kissing	1
them	1
and	1
pulling	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
kissing	1
each	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
surprise	1
both	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
kissed	1
again.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
evidently	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cry,	1
and	1
apparently	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
their	1
heads	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
otherwise	1
at	1
this	1
meeting.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
my	1
dear!...	1
Ah!	1
Mary!"	1
they	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
then	1
laughed.	1
"I	1
dreamed	1
last	1
night..."--"You	1
were	1
not	1
expecting	1
us?..."	1
"Ah!	1
Mary,	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
thinner?..."	1
"And	1
you	1
have	1
grown	1
stouter!..."	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
the	1
princess	1
at	1
once,"	1
put	1
in	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea!..."	1
exclaimed	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Ah,	1
Andrew,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
you."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
his	1
sister,	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
kissed	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
crybaby	1
as	1
ever.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
turned	1
toward	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
through	1
her	1
tears	1
the	1
loving,	1
warm,	1
gentle	1
look	1
of	1
her	1
large	1
luminous	1
eyes,	1
very	1
beautiful	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
rested	1
on	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
talked	1
incessantly,	1
her	1
short,	1
downy	1
upper	1
lip	1
continually	1
and	1
rapidly	1
touching	1
her	1
rosy	1
nether	1
lip	1
when	1
necessary	1
and	1
drawing	1
up	1
again	1
next	1
moment	1
when	1
her	1
face	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
glittering	1
teeth	1
and	1
sparkling	1
eyes.	1
She	1
told	1
of	1
an	1
accident	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
Spasski	1
Hill	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
serious	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
condition,	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
that	1
informed	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
all	1
her	1
clothes	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
heaven	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
dress	1
in	1
here;	1
and	1
that	1
Andrew	1
had	1
quite	1
changed,	1
and	1
that	1
Kitty	1
Odyntsova	1
had	1
married	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
suitor	1
for	1
Mary,	1
a	1
real	1
one,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
later.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
still	1
looking	1
silently	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
sadness.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
following	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
independent	1
of	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
words.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
Petersburg	1
fete	1
she	1
addressed	1
her	1
brother:	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
Andrew?"	1
she	1
said	1
sighing.	1
	1
Lise	1
sighed	1
too.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
even	1
tomorrow,"	1
replied	1
her	1
brother.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
leaving	1
me	1
here,	1
God	1
knows	1
why,	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
promotion..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
but	1
continuing	1
her	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
figure.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
certain?"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
changed.	1
She	1
sighed	1
and	1
said:	1
"Yes,	1
quite	1
certain.	1
Ah!	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
dreadful..."	1
	1
Her	1
lip	1
descended.	1
She	1
brought	1
her	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"She	1
needs	1
rest,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
"Don't	1
you,	1
Lise?	1
Take	1
her	1
to	1
your	1
room	1
and	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
Father.	1
How	1
is	1
he?	1
Just	1
the	1
same?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
just	1
the	1
same.	1
Though	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
your	1
opinion	1
will	1
be,"	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
joyfully.	1
	1
"And	1
are	1
the	1
hours	1
the	1
same?	1
And	1
the	1
walks	1
in	1
the	1
avenues?	1
And	1
the	1
lathe?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
which	1
showed	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
weaknesses.	1
	1
"The	1
hours	1
are	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
the	1
lathe,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
mathematics	1
and	1
my	1
geometry	1
lessons,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
gleefully,	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
lessons	1
in	1
geometry	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
greatest	1
delights	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
had	1
elapsed	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
get	1
up,	1
Tikhon	1
came	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
young	1
prince	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
made	1
a	1
departure	1
from	1
his	1
usual	1
routine	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
arrival:	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
admit	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
apartments	1
while	1
he	1
dressed	1
for	1
dinner.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
always	1
dressed	1
in	1
old-fashioned	1
style,	1
wearing	1
an	1
antique	1
coat	1
and	1
powdered	1
hair;	1
and	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
his	1
father's	1
dressing	1
room	1
(not	1
with	1
the	1
contemptuous	1
look	1
and	1
manner	1
he	1
wore	1
in	1
drawing	1
rooms,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
animated	1
face	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
Pierre),	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
leather-covered	1
chair,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
powdering	1
mantle,	1
entrusting	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
Tikhon.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
here's	1
the	1
warrior!	1
Wants	1
to	1
vanquish	1
Buonaparte?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
shaking	1
his	1
powdered	1
head	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
tail,	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
holding	1
fast	1
to	1
plait,	1
would	1
allow.	1
	1
"You	1
at	1
least	1
must	1
tackle	1
him	1
properly,	1
or	1
else	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
he'll	1
soon	1
have	1
us,	1
too,	1
for	1
his	1
subjects!	1
How	1
are	1
you?"	1
And	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
cheek.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
after	1
his	1
nap	1
before	1
dinner.	1
(He	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
nap	1
"after	1
dinner	1
was	1
silver--before	1
dinner,	1
golden.")	1
He	1
cast	1
happy,	1
sidelong	1
glances	1
at	1
his	1
son	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
thick,	1
bushy	1
eyebrows.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
father	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
indicated	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
on	1
his	1
father's	1
favorite	1
topic--	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
more	1
particularly	1
of	1
Bonaparte.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
brought	1
my	1
wife	1
who	1
is	1
pregnant,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
following	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
face	1
with	1
an	1
eager	1
and	1
respectful	1
look.	1
"How	1
is	1
your	1
health?"	1
	1
"Only	1
fools	1
and	1
rakes	1
fall	1
ill,	1
my	1
boy.	1
You	1
know	1
me:	1
I	1
am	1
busy	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
night	1
and	1
abstemious,	1
so	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
am	1
well."	1
	1
"Thank	1
God,"	1
said	1
his	1
son	1
smiling.	1
	1
"God	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it!	1
Well,	1
go	1
on,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
hobby;	1
"tell	1
me	1
how	1
the	1
Germans	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
to	1
fight	1
Bonaparte	1
by	1
this	1
new	1
science	1
you	1
call	1
'strategy.'"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
time	1
to	1
collect	1
my	1
wits,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
his	1
father's	1
foibles	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
son	1
from	1
loving	1
and	1
honoring	1
him.	1
"Why,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
settle	1
down!"	1
	1
"Nonsense,	1
nonsense!"	1
cried	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
shaking	1
his	1
pigtail	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
firmly	1
plaited,	1
and	1
grasping	1
his	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
"The	1
house	1
for	1
your	1
wife	1
is	1
ready.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
will	1
take	1
her	1
there	1
and	1
show	1
her	1
over,	1
and	1
they'll	1
talk	1
nineteen	1
to	1
the	1
dozen.	1
That's	1
their	1
woman's	1
way!	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
her.	1
Sit	1
down	1
and	1
talk.	1
About	1
Mikhelson's	1
army	1
I	1
understand--Tolstoy's	1
too...	1
a	1
simultaneous	1
expedition....	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
southern	1
army	1
to	1
do?	1
Prussia	1
is	1
neutral...	1
I	1
know	1
that.	1
What	1
about	1
Austria?"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
followed	1
by	1
Tikhon,	1
who	1
ran	1
after	1
him,	1
handing	1
him	1
different	1
articles	1
of	1
clothing.	1
"What	1
of	1
Sweden?	1
How	1
will	1
they	1
cross	1
Pomerania?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
seeing	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
insisted,	1
began--at	1
first	1
reluctantly,	1
but	1
gradually	1
with	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animation,	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
changing	1
unconsciously	1
from	1
Russian	1
to	1
French	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on--to	1
explain	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
operation	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
campaign.	1
He	1
explained	1
how	1
an	1
army,	1
ninety	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
was	1
to	1
threaten	1
Prussia	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
neutrality	1
and	1
draw	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
war;	1
how	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
army	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
some	1
Swedish	1
forces	1
at	1
Stralsund;	1
how	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
Austrians,	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
Russians,	1
were	1
to	1
operate	1
in	1
Italy	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
Rhine;	1
how	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
Russians	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
English	1
were	1
to	1
land	1
at	1
Naples,	1
and	1
how	1
a	1
total	1
force	1
of	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
was	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
different	1
sides.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
evince	1
the	1
least	1
interest	1
during	1
this	1
explanation,	1
but	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
it	1
continued	1
to	1
dress	1
while	1
walking	1
about,	1
and	1
three	1
times	1
unexpectedly	1
interrupted.	1
Once	1
he	1
stopped	1
it	1
by	1
shouting:	1
"The	1
white	1
one,	1
the	1
white	1
one!"	1
	1
This	1
meant	1
that	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
not	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
waistcoat	1
he	1
wanted.	1
Another	1
time	1
he	1
interrupted,	1
saying:	1
	1
"And	1
will	1
she	1
soon	1
be	1
confined?"	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
reproachfully	1
said:	1
"That's	1
bad!	1
Go	1
on,	1
go	1
on."	1
	1
The	1
third	1
interruption	1
came	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
finishing	1
his	1
description.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
sing,	1
in	1
the	1
cracked	1
voice	1
of	1
old	1
age:	1
"Malbrook	1
s'en	1
va-t-en	1
guerre.	1
Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Marlborough	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
wars;	1
God	1
knows	1
when	1
he'll	1
return."	1
	1
His	1
son	1
only	1
smiled.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
say	1
it's	1
a	1
plan	1
I	1
approve	1
of,"	1
said	1
the	1
son;	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
telling	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is.	1
Napoleon	1
has	1
also	1
formed	1
his	1
plan	1
by	1
now,	1
not	1
worse	1
than	1
this	1
one."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you've	1
told	1
me	1
nothing	1
new,"	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
repeated,	1
meditatively	1
and	1
rapidly:	1
	1
"Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra.	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXVII	1
	1
At	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
the	1
prince,	1
powdered	1
and	1
shaven,	1
entered	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
his	1
daughter-in-law,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
were	1
already	1
awaiting	1
him	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
architect,	1
who	1
by	1
a	1
strange	1
caprice	1
of	1
his	1
employer's	1
was	1
admitted	1
to	1
table	1
though	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
that	1
insignificant	1
individual	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
could	1
certainly	1
not	1
have	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
honor.	1
The	1
prince,	1
who	1
generally	1
kept	1
very	1
strictly	1
to	1
social	1
distinctions	1
and	1
rarely	1
admitted	1
even	1
important	1
government	1
officials	1
to	1
his	1
table,	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
selected	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
(who	1
always	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
blow	1
his	1
nose	1
on	1
his	1
checked	1
handkerchief)	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
are	1
equals,	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
impressed	1
on	1
his	1
daughter	1
that	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
was	1
"not	1
a	1
whit	1
worse	1
than	1
you	1
or	1
I."	1
At	1
dinner	1
the	1
prince	1
usually	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
taciturn	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
to	1
anyone	1
else.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
dining	1
room,	1
which	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
lofty,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
and	1
the	1
footmen--one	1
behind	1
each	1
chair--stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
enter.	1
The	1
head	1
butler,	1
napkin	1
on	1
arm,	1
was	1
scanning	1
the	1
setting	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
the	1
footmen,	1
and	1
anxiously	1
glancing	1
from	1
the	1
clock	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
to	1
enter.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
large	1
gilt	1
frame,	1
new	1
to	1
him,	1
containing	1
the	1
genealogical	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
Princes	1
Bolkonski,	1
opposite	1
which	1
hung	1
another	1
such	1
frame	1
with	1
a	1
badly	1
painted	1
portrait	1
(evidently	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
artist	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
estate)	1
of	1
a	1
ruling	1
prince,	1
in	1
a	1
crown--an	1
alleged	1
descendant	1
of	1
Rurik	1
and	1
ancestor	1
of	1
the	1
Bolkonskis.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looking	1
again	1
at	1
that	1
genealogical	1
tree,	1
shook	1
his	1
head,	1
laughing	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
laughs	1
who	1
looks	1
at	1
a	1
portrait	1
so	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
amusing.	1
	1
"How	1
thoroughly	1
like	1
him	1
that	1
is!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
in	1
surprise.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
laughing	1
at.	1
Everything	1
her	1
father	1
did	1
inspired	1
her	1
with	1
reverence	1
and	1
was	1
beyond	1
question.	1
	1
"Everyone	1
has	1
his	1
Achilles'	1
heel,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Fancy,	1
with	1
his	1
powerful	1
mind,	1
indulging	1
in	1
such	1
nonsense!"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
criticism	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply,	1
when	1
the	1
expected	1
footsteps	1
were	1
heard	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
study.	1
The	1
prince	1
walked	1
in	1
quickly	1
and	1
jauntily	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont,	1
as	1
if	1
intentionally	1
contrasting	1
the	1
briskness	1
of	1
his	1
manners	1
with	1
the	1
strict	1
formality	1
of	1
his	1
house.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
great	1
clock	1
struck	1
two	1
and	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
shrill	1
tone	1
joined	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
prince	1
stood	1
still;	1
his	1
lively	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
from	1
under	1
their	1
thick,	1
bushy	1
eyebrows	1
sternly	1
scanned	1
all	1
present	1
and	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
She	1
felt,	1
as	1
courtiers	1
do	1
when	1
the	1
Tsar	1
enters,	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
inspired	1
in	1
all	1
around	1
him.	1
He	1
stroked	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
then	1
patted	1
her	1
awkwardly	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
neck.	1
	1
"I'm	1
glad,	1
glad,	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
looking	1
attentively	1
into	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
then	1
quickly	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
"Sit	1
down,	1
sit	1
down!	1
Sit	1
down,	1
Michael	1
Ianovich!"	1
	1
He	1
indicated	1
a	1
place	1
beside	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
daughter-in-law.	1
A	1
footman	1
moved	1
the	1
chair	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"Ho,	1
ho!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
casting	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
her	1
rounded	1
figure.	1
"You've	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
That's	1
bad!"	1
	1
He	1
laughed	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
dry,	1
cold,	1
unpleasant	1
way,	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
walk,	1
walk	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
did	1
not,	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to,	1
hear	1
his	1
words.	1
She	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
seemed	1
confused.	1
The	1
prince	1
asked	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
smile	1
and	1
talk.	1
He	1
asked	1
about	1
mutual	1
acquaintances,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
chattered	1
away	1
giving	1
him	1
greetings	1
from	1
various	1
people	1
and	1
retelling	1
the	1
town	1
gossip.	1
	1
"Countess	1
Apraksina,	1
poor	1
thing,	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
cried	1
her	1
eyes	1
out,"	1
she	1
said,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
lively.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
became	1
animated	1
the	1
prince	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
sternly,	1
and	1
suddenly,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
studied	1
her	1
sufficiently	1
and	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
definite	1
idea	1
of	1
her,	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
addressed	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
our	1
Bonaparte	1
will	1
be	1
having	1
a	1
bad	1
time	1
of	1
it.	1
Prince	1
Andrew"	1
(he	1
always	1
spoke	1
thus	1
of	1
his	1
son)	1
"has	1
been	1
telling	1
me	1
what	1
forces	1
are	1
being	1
collected	1
against	1
him!	1
While	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
much	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
know	1
when	1
"you	1
and	1
I"	1
had	1
said	1
such	1
things	1
about	1
Bonaparte,	1
but	1
understanding	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wanted	1
as	1
a	1
peg	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
hang	1
the	1
prince's	1
favorite	1
topic,	1
he	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
prince,	1
wondering	1
what	1
would	1
follow.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
tactician!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
his	1
son,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
architect.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
conversation	1
again	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
war,	1
on	1
Bonaparte,	1
and	1
the	1
generals	1
and	1
statesmen	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
seemed	1
convinced	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
mere	1
babies	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
A	1
B	1
C	1
of	1
war	1
or	1
of	1
politics,	1
and	1
that	1
Bonaparte	1
was	1
an	1
insignificant	1
little	1
Frenchy,	1
successful	1
only	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
Potemkins	1
or	1
Suvorovs	1
left	1
to	1
oppose	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
convinced	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
political	1
difficulties	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
no	1
real	1
war,	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
puppet	1
show	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
playing,	1
pretending	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
real.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gaily	1
bore	1
with	1
his	1
father's	1
ridicule	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
men,	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
on	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
evident	1
pleasure.	1
	1
"The	1
past	1
always	1
seems	1
good,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
did	1
not	1
Suvorov	1
himself	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
trap	1
Moreau	1
set	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
escape?"	1
	1
"Who	1
told	1
you	1
that?	1
Who?"	1
cried	1
the	1
prince.	1
"Suvorov!"	1
And	1
he	1
jerked	1
away	1
his	1
plate,	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
briskly	1
caught.	1
"Suvorov!...	1
Consider,	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
Two...	1
Frederick	1
and	1
Suvorov;	1
Moreau!...	1
Moreau	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
prisoner	1
if	1
Suvorov	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
free	1
hand;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath	1
on	1
his	1
hands.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
puzzled	1
the	1
devil	1
himself!	1
When	1
you	1
get	1
there	1
you'll	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
those	1
Hofs-	1
kriegs-wurst-Raths	1
are!	1
Suvorov	1
couldn't	1
manage	1
them	1
so	1
what	1
chance	1
has	1
Michael	1
Kutuzov?	1
No,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"you	1
and	1
your	1
generals	1
won't	1
get	1
on	1
against	1
Buonaparte;	1
you'll	1
have	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
the	1
French,	1
so	1
that	1
birds	1
of	1
a	1
feather	1
may	1
fight	1
together.	1
The	1
German,	1
Pahlen,	1
has	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
New	1
York	1
in	1
America,	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
Moreau,"	1
he	1
said,	1
alluding	1
to	1
the	1
invitation	1
made	1
that	1
year	1
to	1
Moreau	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
Russian	1
service....	1
"Wonderful!...	1
Were	1
the	1
Potemkins,	1
Suvorovs,	1
and	1
Orlovs	1
Germans?	1
No,	1
lad,	1
either	1
you	1
fellows	1
have	1
all	1
lost	1
your	1
wits,	1
or	1
I	1
have	1
outlived	1
mine.	1
May	1
God	1
help	1
you,	1
but	1
we'll	1
see	1
what	1
will	1
happen.	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
great	1
commander	1
among	1
them!	1
Hm!..."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
at	1
all	1
say	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
plans	1
are	1
good,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
surprised	1
at	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
Bonaparte.	1
You	1
may	1
laugh	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
Bonaparte	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
general!"	1
	1
"Michael	1
Ivanovich!"	1
cried	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
the	1
architect	1
who,	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
roast	1
meat,	1
hoped	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten:	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
Buonaparte	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
tactician?	1
Here,	1
he	1
says	1
the	1
same	1
thing."	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
the	1
architect.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
again	1
laughed	1
his	1
frigid	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Buonaparte	1
was	1
born	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
spoon	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
He	1
has	1
got	1
splendid	1
soldiers.	1
Besides	1
he	1
began	1
by	1
attacking	1
Germans.	1
And	1
only	1
idlers	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
beat	1
the	1
Germans.	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
everybody	1
has	1
beaten	1
the	1
Germans.	1
They	1
beat	1
no	1
one--except	1
one	1
another.	1
He	1
made	1
his	1
reputation	1
fighting	1
them."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
began	1
explaining	1
all	1
the	1
blunders	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
him,	1
Bonaparte	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
his	1
campaigns	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
politics.	1
His	1
son	1
made	1
no	1
rejoinder,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
whatever	1
arguments	1
were	1
presented	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
little	1
able	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
opinion.	1
He	1
listened,	1
refraining	1
from	1
a	1
reply,	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
wondered	1
how	1
this	1
old	1
man,	1
living	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years,	1
could	1
know	1
and	1
discuss	1
so	1
minutely	1
and	1
acutely	1
all	1
the	1
recent	1
European	1
military	1
and	1
political	1
events.	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
I'm	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
don't	1
understand	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
affairs?"	1
concluded	1
his	1
father.	1
"But	1
it	1
troubles	1
me.	1
I	1
don't	1
sleep	1
at	1
night.	1
Come	1
now,	1
where	1
has	1
this	1
great	1
commander	1
of	1
yours	1
shown	1
his	1
skill?"	1
he	1
concluded.	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
take	1
too	1
long	1
to	1
tell,"	1
answered	1
the	1
son.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then	1
go	1
to	1
your	1
Buonaparte!	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
here's	1
another	1
admirer	1
of	1
that	1
powder-monkey	1
emperor	1
of	1
yours,"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
excellent	1
French.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Prince,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
Bonapartist!"	1
	1
"Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra..."	1
hummed	1
the	1
prince	1
out	1
of	1
tune	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
still	1
more	1
so,	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
discussion	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
sat	1
silent,	1
glancing	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
look	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
father-in-	1
law	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
When	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
arm	1
and	1
drew	1
her	1
into	1
another	1
room.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
clever	1
man	1
your	1
father	1
is,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
kind!"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXVIII	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
next	1
evening.	1
The	1
old	1
prince,	1
not	1
altering	1
his	1
routine,	1
retired	1
as	1
usual	1
after	1
dinner.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
a	1
traveling	1
coat	1
without	1
epaulettes	1
had	1
been	1
packing	1
with	1
his	1
valet	1
in	1
the	1
rooms	1
assigned	1
to	1
him.	1
After	1
inspecting	1
the	1
carriage	1
himself	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
trunks	1
put	1
in,	1
he	1
ordered	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
harnessed.	1
Only	1
those	1
things	1
he	1
always	1
kept	1
with	1
him	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
room;	1
a	1
small	1
box,	1
a	1
large	1
canteen	1
fitted	1
with	1
silver	1
plate,	1
two	1
Turkish	1
pistols	1
and	1
a	1
saber--a	1
present	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Ochakov.	1
All	1
these	1
traveling	1
effects	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
were	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
order:	1
new,	1
clean,	1
and	1
in	1
cloth	1
covers	1
carefully	1
tied	1
with	1
tapes.	1
	1
When	1
starting	1
on	1
a	1
journey	1
or	1
changing	1
their	1
mode	1
of	1
life,	1
men	1
capable	1
of	1
reflection	1
are	1
generally	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
frame	1
of	1
mind.	1
At	1
such	1
moments	1
one	1
reviews	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
looked	1
very	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
tender.	1
With	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
him	1
he	1
paced	1
briskly	1
from	1
corner	1
to	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
thoughtfully	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
Did	1
he	1
fear	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
or	1
was	1
he	1
sad	1
at	1
leaving	1
his	1
wife?--perhaps	1
both,	1
but	1
evidently	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
mood,	1
for	1
hearing	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
unclasped	1
his	1
hands,	1
stopped	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
as	1
if	1
tying	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
box,	1
and	1
assumed	1
his	1
usual	1
tranquil	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
expression.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
heavy	1
tread	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
heard.	1
	1
"I	1
hear	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
harness,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
panting	1
(she	1
had	1
apparently	1
been	1
running),	1
"and	1
I	1
did	1
so	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
another	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
alone!	1
God	1
knows	1
how	1
long	1
we	1
may	1
again	1
be	1
parted.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
coming?	1
You	1
have	1
changed	1
so,	1
Andrusha,"	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
explain	1
such	1
a	1
question.	1
	1
She	1
smiled	1
as	1
she	1
uttered	1
his	1
pet	1
name,	1
"Andrusha."	1
It	1
was	1
obviously	1
strange	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
stern	1
handsome	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
Andrusha-	1
-the	1
slender	1
mischievous	1
boy	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
playfellow	1
in	1
childhood.	1
	1
"And	1
where	1
is	1
Lise?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
answering	1
her	1
question	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
my	1
room.	1
Oh,	1
Andrew!	1
What	1
a	1
treasure	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
you	1
have,"	1
said	1
she,	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
facing	1
her	1
brother.	1
"She	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
child:	1
such	1
a	1
dear,	1
merry	1
child.	1
I	1
have	1
grown	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
her."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
silent,	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
the	1
ironical	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
look	1
that	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"One	1
must	1
be	1
indulgent	1
to	1
little	1
weaknesses;	1
who	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
them,	1
Andrew?	1
Don't	1
forget	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
grown	1
up	1
and	1
been	1
educated	1
in	1
society,	1
and	1
so	1
her	1
position	1
now	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
rosy	1
one.	1
We	1
should	1
enter	1
into	1
everyone's	1
situation.	1
Tout	1
comprendre,	1
c'est	1
tout	1
pardonner.	1
*	1
Think	1
what	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
her,	1
poor	1
thing,	1
after	1
what	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
used	1
to,	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
in	1
her	1
condition!	1
It's	1
very	1
hard."	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
understand	1
all	1
is	1
to	1
forgive	1
all.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
sister,	1
as	1
we	1
smile	1
at	1
those	1
we	1
think	1
we	1
thoroughly	1
understand.	1
	1
"You	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
don't	1
think	1
the	1
life	1
terrible,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
	1
"I...	1
that's	1
different.	1
Why	1
speak	1
of	1
me?	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
other	1
life,	1
and	1
can't,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
other.	1
But	1
think,	1
Andrew:	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
society	1
woman	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
during	1
the	1
best	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
all	1
alone--for	1
Papa	1
is	1
always	1
busy,	1
and	1
I...	1
well,	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
poor	1
resources	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
entertaining	1
a	1
woman	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society.	1
There	1
is	1
only	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne...."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
your	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"No?	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
kind	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
she's	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied.	1
She	1
has	1
no	1
one,	1
no	1
one.	1
To	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
don't	1
need	1
her,	1
and	1
she's	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
way.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
always	1
was	1
a	1
savage,	1
and	1
now	1
am	1
even	1
more	1
so.	1
I	1
like	1
being	1
alone....	1
Father	1
likes	1
her	1
very	1
much.	1
She	1
and	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
gentle	1
and	1
kind,	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
benefactor	1
to	1
them	1
both.	1
As	1
Sterne	1
says:	1
'We	1
don't	1
love	1
people	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
us,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
them.'	1
Father	1
took	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
homeless	1
after	1
losing	1
her	1
own	1
father.	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
likes	1
her	1
way	1
of	1
reading.	1
She	1
reads	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
evenings	1
and	1
reads	1
splendidly."	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
quite	1
frank,	1
Mary,	1
I	1
expect	1
Father's	1
character	1
sometimes	1
makes	1
things	1
trying	1
for	1
you,	1
doesn't	1
it?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
suddenly.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
first	1
surprised	1
and	1
then	1
aghast	1
at	1
this	1
question.	1
	1
"For	1
me?	1
For	1
me?...	1
Trying	1
for	1
me!..."	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"He	1
always	1
was	1
rather	1
harsh;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
he's	1
getting	1
very	1
trying,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
apparently	1
speaking	1
lightly	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
puzzle	1
or	1
test	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
good	1
in	1
every	1
way,	1
Andrew,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
intellectual	1
pride,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
following	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
trend	1
of	1
the	1
conversation--"and	1
that's	1
a	1
great	1
sin.	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
judge	1
Father?	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
one	1
might,	1
what	1
feeling	1
except	1
veneration	1
could	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
evoke?	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
contented	1
and	1
happy	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
you	1
were	1
all	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
I	1
am."	1
	1
Her	1
brother	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
incredulously.	1
	1
"The	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
me...	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
Andrew...	1
is	1
Father's	1
way	1
of	1
treating	1
religious	1
subjects.	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
how	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
immense	1
intellect	1
can	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
day,	1
and	1
can	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
astray.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
makes	1
me	1
unhappy.	1
But	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
lately	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
improvement.	1
His	1
satire	1
has	1
been	1
less	1
bitter	1
of	1
late,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
monk	1
he	1
received	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
talk	1
with."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
monk	1
are	1
wasting	1
your	1
powder,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
banteringly	1
yet	1
tenderly.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
mon	1
ami,	1
I	1
only	1
pray,	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
me.	1
Andrew..."	1
she	1
said	1
timidly	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
silence,	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
favor	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
you."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
dear?"	1
	1
"No--promise	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
refuse!	1
It	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
trouble	1
and	1
is	1
nothing	1
unworthy	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
comfort	1
me.	1
Promise,	1
Andrusha!..."	1
said	1
she,	1
putting	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
her	1
reticule	1
but	1
not	1
yet	1
taking	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
inside	1
it,	1
as	1
if	1
what	1
she	1
held	1
were	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
her	1
request	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
shown	1
before	1
the	1
request	1
was	1
granted.	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
timidly	1
at	1
her	1
brother.	1
	1
"Even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble..."	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
if	1
guessing	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
about.	1
	1
"Think	1
what	1
you	1
please!	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
just	1
like	1
Father.	1
Think	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
but	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
sake!	1
Please	1
do!	1
Father's	1
father,	1
our	1
grandfather,	1
wore	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
wars."	1
(She	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
her	1
reticule.)	1
"So	1
you	1
promise?"	1
	1
"Of	1
course.	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
I	1
bless	1
you	1
with	1
this	1
icon	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
promise	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
take	1
it	1
off.	1
Do	1
you	1
promise?"	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
weigh	1
a	1
hundredweight	1
and	1
won't	1
break	1
my	1
neck...	1
To	1
please	1
you..."	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
But	1
immediately,	1
noticing	1
the	1
pained	1
expression	1
his	1
joke	1
had	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
sister's	1
face,	1
he	1
repented	1
and	1
added:	1
"I	1
am	1
glad;	1
really,	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad."	1
	1
"Against	1
your	1
will	1
He	1
will	1
save	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
Himself,	1
for	1
in	1
Him	1
alone	1
is	1
truth	1
and	1
peace,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
trembling	1
with	1
emotion,	1
solemnly	1
holding	1
up	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1
brother	1
a	1
small,	1
oval,	1
antique,	1
dark-faced	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Saviour	1
in	1
a	1
gold	1
setting,	1
on	1
a	1
finely	1
wrought	1
silver	1
chain.	1
	1
She	1
crossed	1
herself,	1
kissed	1
the	1
icon,	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Please,	1
Andrew,	1
for	1
my	1
sake!..."	1
	1
Rays	1
of	1
gentle	1
light	1
shone	1
from	1
her	1
large,	1
timid	1
eyes.	1
Those	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
thin,	1
sickly	1
face	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
beautiful.	1
Her	1
brother	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
icon,	1
but	1
she	1
stopped	1
him.	1
Andrew	1
understood,	1
crossed	1
himself	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
icon.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
tenderness,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
touched,	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
irony	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
my	1
dear."	1
She	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
	1
"As	1
I	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
you,	1
Andrew,	1
be	1
kind	1
and	1
generous	1
as	1
you	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
be.	1
Don't	1
judge	1
Lise	1
harshly,"	1
she	1
began.	1
"She	1
is	1
so	1
sweet,	1
so	1
good-	1
natured,	1
and	1
her	1
position	1
now	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
one."	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
complained	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
to	1
you,	1
Masha,	1
or	1
blamed	1
her.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
me?"	1
	1
Red	1
patches	1
appeared	1
on	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
guilty.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
talked	1
to.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
that,"	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
patches	1
grew	1
deeper	1
on	1
her	1
forehead,	1
neck,	1
and	1
cheeks.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
Her	1
brother	1
had	1
guessed	1
right:	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
been	1
crying	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
her	1
forebodings	1
about	1
her	1
confinement,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
dreaded	1
it,	1
and	1
had	1
complained	1
of	1
her	1
fate,	1
her	1
father-in-law,	1
and	1
her	1
husband.	1
After	1
crying	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"Know	1
this,	1
Masha:	1
I	1
can't	1
reproach,	1
have	1
not	1
reproached,	1
and	1
never	1
shall	1
reproach	1
my	1
wife	1
with	1
anything,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
reproach	1
myself	1
with	1
anything	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
that	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
in	1
whatever	1
circumstances	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
placed.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
truth...	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
happy?	1
No!	1
Is	1
she	1
happy?	1
No!	1
But	1
why	1
this	1
is	1
so	1
I	1
don't	1
know..."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
rose,	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
and,	1
stooping,	1
kissed	1
her	1
forehead.	1
His	1
fine	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful,	1
kindly,	1
and	1
unaccustomed	1
brightness,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
his	1
sister	1
but	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
toward	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
doorway.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
her,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
good-by.	1
Or--go	1
and	1
wake	1
and	1
I'll	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
Petrushka!"	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
valet:	1
"Come	1
here,	1
take	1
these	1
away.	1
Put	1
this	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
right."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
rose	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
then	1
stopped	1
and	1
said:	1
"Andrew,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
faith	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
asked	1
Him	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
love	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
feel,	1
and	1
your	1
prayer	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
answered."	1
	1
"Well,	1
may	1
be!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Go,	1
Masha;	1
I'll	1
come	1
immediately."	1
	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
sister's	1
room,	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
connected	1
one	1
wing	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
met	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
smiling	1
sweetly.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
day	1
that,	1
with	1
an	1
ecstatic	1
and	1
artless	1
smile,	1
she	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
secluded	1
passages.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
your	1
room,"	1
she	1
said,	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
blushing	1
and	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
anger	1
suddenly	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
forehead	1
and	1
hair,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
eyes,	1
with	1
such	1
contempt	1
that	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
blushed	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
his	1
sister's	1
room	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
already	1
awake	1
and	1
her	1
merry	1
voice,	1
hurrying	1
one	1
word	1
after	1
another,	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
door.	1
She	1
was	1
speaking	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
French,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
after	1
long	1
self-restraint	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
lost	1
time.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
imagine	1
the	1
old	1
Countess	1
Zubova,	1
with	1
false	1
curls	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
full	1
of	1
false	1
teeth,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
cheat	1
old	1
age....	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!	1
Mary!"	1
	1
This	1
very	1
sentence	1
about	1
Countess	1
Zubova	1
and	1
this	1
same	1
laugh	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
others	1
some	1
five	1
times.	1
He	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
softly.	1
The	1
little	1
princess,	1
plump	1
and	1
rosy,	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
with	1
her	1
work	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
talking	1
incessantly,	1
repeating	1
Petersburg	1
reminiscences	1
and	1
even	1
phrases.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up,	1
stroked	1
her	1
hair,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
rested	1
after	1
their	1
journey.	1
She	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
continued	1
her	1
chatter.	1
	1
The	1
coach	1
with	1
six	1
horses	1
was	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
porch.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
autumn	1
night,	1
so	1
dark	1
that	1
the	1
coachman	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
carriage	1
pole.	1
Servants	1
with	1
lanterns	1
were	1
bustling	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
porch.	1
The	1
immense	1
house	1
was	1
brilliant	1
with	1
lights	1
shining	1
through	1
its	1
lofty	1
windows.	1
The	1
domestic	1
serfs	1
were	1
crowding	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
waiting	1
to	1
bid	1
good-by	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
prince.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
were	1
all	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
hall:	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
study	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
good-by	1
to	1
him	1
alone.	1
All	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
study	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
old-age	1
spectacles	1
and	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
his	1
son,	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
writing.	1
He	1
glanced	1
round.	1
	1
"Going?"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
writing.	1
	1
"I've	1
come	1
to	1
say	1
good-by."	1
	1
"Kiss	1
me	1
here,"	1
and	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
cheek:	1
"Thanks,	1
thanks!"	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
thank	1
me	1
for?"	1
	1
"For	1
not	1
dilly-dallying	1
and	1
not	1
hanging	1
to	1
a	1
woman's	1
apron	1
strings.	1
The	1
Service	1
before	1
everything.	1
Thanks,	1
thanks!"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
writing,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
quill	1
spluttered	1
and	1
squeaked.	1
"If	1
you	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
say,	1
say	1
it.	1
These	1
two	1
things	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
together,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"About	1
my	1
wife...	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
on	1
your	1
hands..."	1
	1
"Why	1
talk	1
nonsense?	1
Say	1
what	1
you	1
want."	1
	1
"When	1
her	1
confinement	1
is	1
due,	1
send	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
an	1
accoucheur....	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
here...."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
stopped	1
writing	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding,	1
fixed	1
his	1
stern	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
help	1
if	1
nature	1
does	1
not	1
do	1
her	1
work,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
evidently	1
confused.	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
million	1
cases	1
only	1
one	1
goes	1
wrong,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
fancy	1
and	1
mine.	1
They	1
have	1
been	1
telling	1
her	1
things.	1
She	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
is	1
frightened."	1
	1
"Hm...	1
Hm..."	1
muttered	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
himself,	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
writing.	1
"I'll	1
do	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
signed	1
with	1
a	1
flourish	1
and	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
bad	1
business,	1
eh?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
bad,	1
Father?"	1
	1
"The	1
wife!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
briefly	1
and	1
significantly.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped,	1
lad,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"They're	1
all	1
like	1
that;	1
one	1
can't	1
unmarry.	1
Don't	1
be	1
afraid;	1
I	1
won't	1
tell	1
anyone,	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
yourself."	1
	1
He	1
seized	1
his	1
son	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
small	1
bony	1
fingers,	1
shook	1
it,	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
son's	1
face	1
with	1
keen	1
eyes	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
through	1
him,	1
and	1
again	1
laughed	1
his	1
frigid	1
laugh.	1
	1
The	1
son	1
sighed,	1
thus	1
admitting	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
understood	1
him.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
continued	1
to	1
fold	1
and	1
seal	1
his	1
letter,	1
snatching	1
up	1
and	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
wax,	1
the	1
seal,	1
and	1
the	1
paper,	1
with	1
his	1
accustomed	1
rapidity.	1
	1
"What's	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
She's	1
pretty!	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
everything.	1
Make	1
your	1
mind	1
easy,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
abrupt	1
sentences	1
while	1
sealing	1
his	1
letter.	1
	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
speak;	1
he	1
was	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
displeased	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
understood	1
him.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"Listen!"	1
said	1
he;	1
"don't	1
worry	1
about	1
your	1
wife:	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
shall	1
be.	1
Now	1
listen!	1
Give	1
this	1
letter	1
to	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich.	1
*	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
proper	1
places	1
and	1
not	1
keep	1
you	1
long	1
as	1
an	1
adjutant:	1
a	1
bad	1
position!	1
Tell	1
him	1
I	1
remember	1
and	1
like	1
him.	1
Write	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
he	1
receives	1
you.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
all	1
right--serve	1
him.	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski's	1
son	1
need	1
not	1
serve	1
under	1
anyone	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
disfavor.	1
Now	1
come	1
here."	1
	1
	1
*Kutuzov.	1
	1
He	1
spoke	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
half	1
his	1
words,	1
but	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
understand	1
him.	1
He	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
desk,	1
raised	1
the	1
lid,	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
drawer,	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
an	1
exercise	1
book	1
filled	1
with	1
his	1
bold,	1
tall,	1
close	1
handwriting.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
probably	1
die	1
before	1
you.	1
So	1
remember,	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
memoirs;	1
hand	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
after	1
my	1
death.	1
Now	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
Lombard	1
bond	1
and	1
a	1
letter;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
premium	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
writes	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
Suvorov's	1
wars.	1
Send	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Academy.	1
Here	1
are	1
some	1
jottings	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
read	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
gone.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
them	1
useful."	1
	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
his	1
father	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
live	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
yet.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
it.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
all,	1
Father,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now,	1
good-by!"	1
He	1
gave	1
his	1
son	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss,	1
and	1
embraced	1
him.	1
"Remember	1
this,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
if	1
they	1
kill	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
hurt	1
me,	1
your	1
old	1
father..."	1
he	1
paused	1
unexpectedly,	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
a	1
querulous	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
shrieked:	1
"but	1
if	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
behaved	1
like	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed!"	1
	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
to	1
me,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
the	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
silent.	1
	1
"I	1
also	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"if	1
I'm	1
killed	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
son,	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
you--as	1
I	1
said	1
yesterday...	1
let	1
him	1
grow	1
up	1
with	1
you....	1
Please."	1
	1
"Not	1
let	1
the	1
wife	1
have	1
him?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
They	1
stood	1
silent,	1
facing	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
old	1
man's	1
sharp	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
straight	1
on	1
his	1
son's.	1
Something	1
twitched	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
face.	1
	1
"We've	1
said	1
good-by.	1
Go!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
angry	1
voice,	1
opening	1
his	1
door.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What?"	1
asked	1
both	1
princesses	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
spectacled	1
and	1
wigless,	1
shouting	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"Well!"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
And	1
this	1
"Well!"	1
sounded	1
coldly	1
ironic,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
saying,:	1
"Now	1
go	1
through	1
your	1
performance."	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
already!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
turning	1
pale	1
and	1
looking	1
with	1
dismay	1
at	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
He	1
embraced	1
her.	1
She	1
screamed	1
and	1
fell	1
unconscious	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
	1
He	1
cautiously	1
released	1
the	1
shoulder	1
she	1
leaned	1
on,	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
carefully	1
placed	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair.	1
	1
"Adieu,	1
Mary,"	1
said	1
he	1
gently	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
taking	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
kissing	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
armchair,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
chafing	1
her	1
temples.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
supporting	1
her	1
sister-in-law,	1
still	1
looked	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
through	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
in	1
his	1
direction.	1
From	1
the	1
study,	1
like	1
pistol	1
shots,	1
came	1
the	1
frequent	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
angrily	1
blowing	1
his	1
nose.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gone	1
when	1
the	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
quickly	1
and	1
the	1
stern	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown	1
looked	1
out.	1
	1
"Gone?	1
That's	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
he;	1
and	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
unconscious	1
little	1
princess,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
reprovingly	1
and	1
slammed	1
the	1
door.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
In	1
October,	1
1805,	1
a	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
occupying	1
the	1
villages	1
and	1
towns	1
of	1
the	1
Archduchy	1
of	1
Austria,	1
and	1
yet	1
other	1
regiments	1
freshly	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia	1
were	1
settling	1
near	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
Braunau	1
and	1
burdening	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
quartered.	1
Braunau	1
was	1
the	1
headquarters	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
On	1
October	1
11,	1
1805,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
regiments	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
reached	1
Braunau	1
had	1
halted	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
town,	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
inspected	1
by	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
Despite	1
the	1
un-Russian	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
locality	1
and	1
surroundings--fruit	1
gardens,	1
stone	1
fences,	1
tiled	1
roofs,	1
and	1
hills	1
in	1
the	1
distance--and	1
despite	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
(who	1
gazed	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
the	1
soldiers)	1
were	1
not	1
Russians,	1
the	1
regiment	1
had	1
just	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
any	1
Russian	1
regiment	1
preparing	1
for	1
an	1
inspection	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
day's	1
march	1
an	1
order	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
would	1
inspect	1
the	1
regiment	1
on	1
the	1
march.	1
Though	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
were	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
arose	1
whether	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
marching	1
order	1
or	1
not,	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
at	1
a	1
consultation	1
between	1
the	1
battalion	1
commanders	1
to	1
present	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
parade	1
order,	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
better	1
to	1
"bow	1
too	1
low	1
than	1
not	1
bow	1
low	1
enough."	1
So	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
after	1
a	1
twenty-mile	1
march,	1
were	1
kept	1
mending	1
and	1
cleaning	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
without	1
closing	1
their	1
eyes,	1
while	1
the	1
adjutants	1
and	1
company	1
commanders	1
calculated	1
and	1
reckoned,	1
and	1
by	1
morning	1
the	1
regiment--instead	1
of	1
the	1
straggling,	1
disorderly	1
crowd	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
its	1
last	1
march	1
the	1
day	1
before--presented	1
a	1
well-ordered	1
array	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
each	1
of	1
whom	1
knew	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
his	1
duty,	1
had	1
every	1
button	1
and	1
every	1
strap	1
in	1
place,	1
and	1
shone	1
with	1
cleanliness.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
externally	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
order,	1
but	1
had	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
to	1
look	1
under	1
the	1
uniforms	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
knapsack	1
the	1
appointed	1
number	1
of	1
articles,	1
"awl,	1
soap,	1
and	1
all,"	1
as	1
the	1
soldiers	1
say.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
circumstance	1
concerning	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
be	1
at	1
ease.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
boots.	1
More	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
men's	1
boots	1
were	1
in	1
holes.	1
But	1
this	1
defect	1
was	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
any	1
fault	1
of	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
for	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
repeated	1
demands	1
boots	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
issued	1
by	1
the	1
Austrian	1
commissariat,	1
and	1
the	1
regiment	1
had	1
marched	1
some	1
seven	1
hundred	1
miles.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
an	1
elderly,	1
choleric,	1
stout,	1
and	1
thick-set	1
general	1
with	1
grizzled	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
whiskers,	1
and	1
wider	1
from	1
chest	1
to	1
back	1
than	1
across	1
the	1
shoulders.	1
He	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
brand-new	1
uniform	1
showing	1
the	1
creases	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
folded	1
and	1
thick	1
gold	1
epaulettes	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
stand	1
rather	1
than	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
massive	1
shoulders.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
happily	1
performing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
duties	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
walked	1
about	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
pulled	1
himself	1
up,	1
slightly	1
arching	1
his	1
back.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
admired	1
his	1
regiment,	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
mind	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
it,	1
yet	1
his	1
strut	1
seemed	1
to	1
indicate	1
that,	1
besides	1
military	1
matters,	1
social	1
interests	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
sex	1
occupied	1
no	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Michael	1
Mitrich,	1
sir?"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
battalion	1
commanders	1
who	1
smilingly	1
pressed	1
forward	1
(it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
felt	1
happy).	1
"We	1
had	1
our	1
hands	1
full	1
last	1
night.	1
However,	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
regiment	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
eh?"	1
	1
The	1
battalion	1
commander	1
perceived	1
the	1
jovial	1
irony	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
"It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
turned	1
off	1
the	1
field	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
Tsaritsin	1
Meadow."	1
	1
"What?"	1
asked	1
the	1
commander.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
on	1
which	1
signalers	1
had	1
been	1
posted,	1
two	1
men	1
appeared	1
on	1
horse	1
back.	1
They	1
were	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
	1
The	1
aide-de-camp	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
order	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
clearly	1
worded	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
namely,	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
regiment	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
march:	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats,	1
and	1
packs,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
preparation	1
whatever.	1
	1
A	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
from	1
Vienna	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
with	1
proposals	1
and	1
demands	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
join	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
Mack,	1
and	1
Kutuzov,	1
not	1
considering	1
this	1
junction	1
advisable,	1
meant,	1
among	1
other	1
arguments	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
view,	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
the	1
wretched	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia.	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
regiment;	1
so	1
the	1
worse	1
the	1
condition	1
it	1
was	1
in,	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
the	1
commander-	1
in-chief	1
would	1
be.	1
Though	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
delivered	1
the	1
definite	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats	1
and	1
in	1
marching	1
order,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
would	1
otherwise	1
be	1
dissatisfied.	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
hung	1
his	1
head,	1
silently	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
choleric	1
gesture.	1
	1
"A	1
fine	1
mess	1
we've	1
made	1
of	1
it!"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
	1
"There	1
now!	1
Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Michael	1
Mitrich,	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
'on	1
the	1
march'	1
it	1
meant	1
in	1
greatcoats?"	1
said	1
he	1
reproachfully	1
to	1
the	1
battalion	1
commander.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!"	1
he	1
added,	1
stepping	1
resolutely	1
forward.	1
"Company	1
commanders!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
accustomed	1
to	1
command.	1
"Sergeants	1
major!...	1
How	1
soon	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
politeness	1
evidently	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
personage	1
he	1
was	1
referring	1
to.	1
	1
"In	1
an	1
hour's	1
time,	1
I	1
should	1
say."	1
	1
"Shall	1
we	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
change	1
clothes?"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,	1
General...."	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
himself,	1
ordered	1
the	1
soldiers	1
to	1
change	1
into	1
their	1
greatcoats.	1
The	1
company	1
commanders	1
ran	1
off	1
to	1
their	1
companies,	1
the	1
sergeants	1
major	1
began	1
bustling	1
(the	1
greatcoats	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
condition),	1
and	1
instantly	1
the	1
squares	1
that	1
had	1
up	1
to	1
then	1
been	1
in	1
regular	1
order	1
and	1
silent	1
began	1
to	1
sway	1
and	1
stretch	1
and	1
hum	1
with	1
voices.	1
On	1
all	1
sides	1
soldiers	1
were	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
throwing	1
up	1
their	1
knapsacks	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
of	1
their	1
shoulders	1
and	1
pulling	1
the	1
straps	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
unstrapping	1
their	1
overcoats	1
and	1
drawing	1
the	1
sleeves	1
on	1
with	1
upraised	1
arms.	1
	1
In	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
all	1
was	1
again	1
in	1
order,	1
only	1
the	1
squares	1
had	1
become	1
gray	1
instead	1
of	1
black.	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
walked	1
with	1
his	1
jerky	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
examined	1
it	1
from	1
a	1
distance.	1
	1
"Whatever	1
is	1
this?	1
This!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
and	1
stood	1
still.	1
"Commander	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company!"	1
	1
"Commander	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
wanted	1
by	1
the	1
general!...	1
commander	1
to	1
the	1
general...	1
third	1
company	1
to	1
the	1
commander."	1
The	1
words	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
lines	1
and	1
an	1
adjutant	1
ran	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
missing	1
officer.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
eager	1
but	1
misrepeated	1
words	1
had	1
reached	1
their	1
destination	1
in	1
a	1
cry	1
of:	1
"The	1
general	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
company,"	1
the	1
missing	1
officer	1
appeared	1
from	1
behind	1
his	1
company	1
and,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
middle-aged	1
man	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
running,	1
trotted	1
awkwardly	1
stumbling	1
on	1
his	1
toes	1
toward	1
the	1
general.	1
The	1
captain's	1
face	1
showed	1
the	1
uneasiness	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
who	1
is	1
told	1
to	1
repeat	1
a	1
lesson	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
learned.	1
Spots	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
nose,	1
the	1
redness	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
evidently	1
due	1
to	1
intemperance,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
twitched	1
nervously.	1
The	1
general	1
looked	1
the	1
captain	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
panting,	1
slackening	1
his	1
pace	1
as	1
he	1
approached.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
dressing	1
your	1
men	1
in	1
petticoats!	1
What	1
is	1
this?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
thrusting	1
forward	1
his	1
jaw	1
and	1
pointing	1
at	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat	1
of	1
bluish	1
cloth,	1
which	1
contrasted	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
after?	1
The	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
is	1
expected	1
and	1
you	1
leave	1
your	1
place?	1
Eh?	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
dress	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
fancy	1
coats	1
for	1
a	1
parade....	1
Eh...?"	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
his	1
superior,	1
pressed	1
two	1
fingers	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rigidly	1
to	1
his	1
cap,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
this	1
pressure	1
lay	1
his	1
only	1
hope	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
"Well,	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak?	1
Whom	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
there	1
dressed	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
Hungarian?"	1
said	1
the	1
commander	1
with	1
an	1
austere	1
gibe.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
what?	1
Your	1
excellency!	1
But	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
excellency?...	1
nobody	1
knows."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
it's	1
the	1
officer	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks,"	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
softly.	1
	1
"Well?	1
Has	1
he	1
been	1
degraded	1
into	1
a	1
field	1
marshal,	1
or	1
into	1
a	1
soldier?	1
If	1
a	1
soldier,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
dressed	1
in	1
regulation	1
uniform	1
like	1
the	1
others."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
you	1
gave	1
him	1
leave	1
yourself,	1
on	1
the	1
march."	1
	1
"Gave	1
him	1
leave?	1
Leave?	1
That's	1
just	1
like	1
you	1
young	1
men,"	1
said	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
cooling	1
down	1
a	1
little.	1
"Leave	1
indeed....	1
One	1
says	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
you...	1
What?"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
renewed	1
irritation,	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
dress	1
your	1
men	1
decently."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
commander,	1
turning	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
adjutant,	1
directed	1
his	1
jerky	1
steps	1
down	1
the	1
line.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
display	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
walking	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
wished	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
further	1
excuse	1
for	1
wrath.	1
Having	1
snapped	1
at	1
an	1
officer	1
for	1
an	1
unpolished	1
badge,	1
at	1
another	1
because	1
his	1
line	1
was	1
not	1
straight,	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
third	1
company.	1
	1
"H-o-o-w	1
are	1
you	1
standing?	1
Where's	1
your	1
leg?	1
Your	1
leg?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
commander	1
with	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
voice,	1
while	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
five	1
men	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
his	1
bluish-gray	1
uniform.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
slowly	1
straightened	1
his	1
bent	1
knee,	1
looking	1
straight	1
with	1
his	1
clear,	1
insolent	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
general's	1
face.	1
	1
"Why	1
a	1
blue	1
coat?	1
Off	1
with	1
it...	1
Sergeant	1
major!	1
Change	1
his	1
coat...	1
the	1
ras..."	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
	1
"General,	1
I	1
must	1
obey	1
orders,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
endure..."	1
Dolokhov	1
hurriedly	1
interrupted.	1
	1
"No	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
ranks!...	1
No	1
talking,	1
no	1
talking!"	1
	1
"Not	1
bound	1
to	1
endure	1
insults,"	1
Dolokhov	1
concluded	1
in	1
loud,	1
ringing	1
tones.	1
	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
the	1
soldier	1
met.	1
The	1
general	1
became	1
silent,	1
angrily	1
pulling	1
down	1
his	1
tight	1
scarf.	1
	1
"I	1
request	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
change	1
your	1
coat,"	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
"He's	1
coming!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
signaler	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
flushing,	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
seized	1
the	1
stirrup	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands,	1
threw	1
his	1
body	1
across	1
the	1
saddle,	1
righted	1
himself,	1
drew	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
resolute	1
countenance,	1
opening	1
his	1
mouth	1
awry,	1
prepared	1
to	1
shout.	1
The	1
regiment	1
fluttered	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
preening	1
its	1
plumage	1
and	1
became	1
motionless.	1
	1
"Att-ention!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
in	1
a	1
soul-shaking	1
voice	1
which	1
expressed	1
joy	1
for	1
himself,	1
severity	1
for	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
welcome	1
for	1
the	1
approaching	1
chief.	1
	1
Along	1
the	1
broad	1
country	1
road,	1
edged	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
by	1
trees,	1
came	1
a	1
high,	1
light	1
blue	1
Viennese	1
caleche,	1
slightly	1
creaking	1
on	1
its	1
springs	1
and	1
drawn	1
by	1
six	1
horses	1
at	1
a	1
smart	1
trot.	1
Behind	1
the	1
caleche	1
galloped	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
Croats.	1
Beside	1
Kutuzov	1
sat	1
an	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform	1
that	1
looked	1
strange	1
among	1
the	1
Russian	1
black	1
ones.	1
The	1
caleche	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
regiment.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
were	1
talking	1
in	1
low	1
voices	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
smiled	1
slightly	1
as	1
treading	1
heavily	1
he	1
stepped	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
breathlessly	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
did	1
not	1
exist.	1
	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
rang	1
out,	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
regiment	1
quivered,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
jingling	1
sound	1
it	1
presented	1
arms.	1
Then	1
amidst	1
a	1
dead	1
silence	1
the	1
feeble	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
heard.	1
The	1
regiment	1
roared,	1
"Health	1
to	1
your	1
ex...	1
len...	1
len...	1
lency!"	1
and	1
again	1
all	1
became	1
silent.	1
At	1
first	1
Kutuzov	1
stood	1
still	1
while	1
the	1
regiment	1
moved;	1
then	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
white,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
suite,	1
walked	1
between	1
the	1
ranks.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
saluted	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
and	1
devoured	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
drawing	1
himself	1
up	1
obsequiously,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
ranks	1
behind	1
the	1
generals,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
jerky	1
movements,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
darted	1
forward	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
or	1
gesture	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
subordinate	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
zeal	1
than	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
commander.	1
Thanks	1
to	1
the	1
strictness	1
and	1
assiduity	1
of	1
its	1
commander	1
the	1
regiment,	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
others	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
Braunau	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
was	1
in	1
splendid	1
condition.	1
There	1
were	1
only	1
217	1
sick	1
and	1
stragglers.	1
Everything	1
was	1
in	1
good	1
order	1
except	1
the	1
boots.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
ranks,	1
sometimes	1
stopping	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
friendly	1
words	1
to	1
officers	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
Turkish	1
war,	1
sometimes	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
Looking	1
at	1
their	1
boots	1
he	1
several	1
times	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
sadly,	1
pointing	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
blaming	1
anyone,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
noticing	1
what	1
a	1
bad	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
it	1
was.	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
ran	1
forward	1
on	1
each	1
such	1
occasion,	1
fearing	1
to	1
miss	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
regarding	1
the	1
regiment.	1
Behind	1
Kutuzov,	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
that	1
allowed	1
every	1
softly	1
spoken	1
word	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
followed	1
some	1
twenty	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
suite.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
talked	1
among	1
themselves	1
and	1
sometimes	1
laughed.	1
Nearest	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
walked	1
a	1
handsome	1
adjutant.	1
This	1
was	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski.	1
Beside	1
him	1
was	1
his	1
comrade	1
Nesvitski,	1
a	1
tall	1
staff	1
officer,	1
extremely	1
stout,	1
with	1
a	1
kindly,	1
smiling,	1
handsome	1
face	1
and	1
moist	1
eyes.	1
Nesvitski	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
from	1
laughter	1
provoked	1
by	1
a	1
swarthy	1
hussar	1
officer	1
who	1
walked	1
beside	1
him.	1
This	1
hussar,	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
face	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
smile	1
or	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
fixed	1
eyes,	1
watched	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander's	1
back	1
and	1
mimicked	1
his	1
every	1
movement.	1
Each	1
time	1
the	1
commander	1
started	1
and	1
bent	1
forward,	1
the	1
hussar	1
started	1
and	1
bent	1
forward	1
in	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
manner.	1
Nesvitski	1
laughed	1
and	1
nudged	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
wag.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
walked	1
slowly	1
and	1
languidly	1
past	1
thousands	1
of	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
starting	1
from	1
their	1
sockets	1
to	1
watch	1
their	1
chief.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stopped.	1
His	1
suite,	1
not	1
having	1
expected	1
this,	1
involuntarily	1
came	1
closer	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Timokhin!"	1
said	1
he,	1
recognizing	1
the	1
red-nosed	1
captain	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
reprimanded	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
blue	1
greatcoat.	1
	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
more	1
than	1
Timokhin	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reprimanded	1
by	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
addressed	1
him	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
extent	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
sustained	1
it	1
had	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
evidently	1
understood	1
his	1
case	1
and	1
wished	1
him	1
nothing	1
but	1
good,	1
quickly	1
turned	1
away,	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
flitting	1
over	1
his	1
scarred	1
and	1
puffy	1
face.	1
	1
"Another	1
Ismail	1
comrade,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"A	1
brave	1
officer!	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied	1
with	1
him?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
latter--unconscious	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
hussar	1
officer	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
looking	1
glass--started,	1
moved	1
forward,	1
and	1
answered:	1
"Highly	1
satisfied,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
	1
"We	1
all	1
have	1
our	1
weaknesses,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
smiling	1
and	1
walking	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
"He	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
predilection	1
for	1
Bacchus."	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
was	1
afraid	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
blamed	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
The	1
hussar	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
noticed	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
red-nosed	1
captain	1
and	1
his	1
drawn-in	1
stomach,	1
and	1
mimicked	1
his	1
expression	1
and	1
pose	1
with	1
such	1
exactitude	1
that	1
Nesvitski	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
Kutuzov	1
turned	1
round.	1
The	1
officer	1
evidently	1
had	1
complete	1
control	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
while	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
turning	1
managed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
grimace	1
and	1
then	1
assume	1
a	1
most	1
serious,	1
deferential,	1
and	1
innocent	1
expression.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
company	1
was	1
the	1
last,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
pondered,	1
apparently	1
trying	1
to	1
recollect	1
something.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
"You	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
remind	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
officer	1
Dolokhov,	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
in	1
this	1
regiment."	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
Dolokhov?"	1
asked	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
soldier's	1
gray	1
greatcoat,	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
be	1
called.	1
The	1
shapely	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
fair-haired	1
soldier,	1
with	1
his	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
the	1
ranks,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
and	1
presented	1
arms.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
a	1
complaint	1
to	1
make?"	1
Kutuzov	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
frown.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
Dolokhov,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov.	1
"I	1
hope	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
you.	1
Do	1
your	1
duty.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
is	1
gracious,	1
and	1
I	1
shan't	1
forget	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
deserve	1
well."	1
	1
The	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
just	1
as	1
boldly	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
seeming	1
by	1
their	1
expression	1
to	1
tear	1
open	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
convention	1
that	1
separates	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
so	1
widely	1
from	1
a	1
private.	1
	1
"One	1
thing	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
Dolokhov	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
firm,	1
ringing,	1
deliberate	1
voice.	1
"I	1
ask	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
my	1
fault	1
and	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
to	1
Russia!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
turned	1
away.	1
The	1
same	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
Captain	1
Timokhin	1
again	1
flitted	1
over	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
grimace	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
everything	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
everything	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
weary	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
carriage.	1
	1
The	1
regiment	1
broke	1
up	1
into	1
companies,	1
which	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
appointed	1
quarters	1
near	1
Braunau,	1
where	1
they	1
hoped	1
to	1
receive	1
boots	1
and	1
clothes	1
and	1
to	1
rest	1
after	1
their	1
hard	1
marches.	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
bear	1
me	1
a	1
grudge,	1
Prokhor	1
Ignatych?"	1
said	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
overtaking	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
its	1
quarters	1
and	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
Captain	1
Timokhin	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
front.	1
(The	1
regimental	1
commander's	1
face	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
inspection	1
was	1
happily	1
over	1
beamed	1
with	1
irrepressible	1
delight.)	1
"It's	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
service...	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped...	1
one	1
is	1
sometimes	1
a	1
bit	1
hasty	1
on	1
parade...	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
apologize,	1
you	1
know	1
me!...	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
pleased!"	1
And	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
captain.	1
	1
"Don't	1
mention	1
it,	1
General,	1
as	1
if	1
I'd	1
be	1
so	1
bold!"	1
replied	1
the	1
captain,	1
his	1
nose	1
growing	1
redder	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
smile	1
which	1
showed	1
where	1
two	1
front	1
teeth	1
were	1
missing	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
knocked	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
butt	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
gun	1
at	1
Ismail.	1
	1
"And	1
tell	1
Mr.	1
Dolokhov	1
that	1
I	1
won't	1
forget	1
him--he	1
may	1
be	1
quite	1
easy.	1
And	1
tell	1
me,	1
please--I've	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
ask--how	1
is	1
he	1
behaving	1
himself,	1
and	1
in	1
general..."	1
	1
"As	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
service	1
goes	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
punctilious,	1
your	1
excellency;	1
but	1
his	1
character..."	1
said	1
Timokhin.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
about	1
his	1
character?"	1
asked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
	1
"It's	1
different	1
on	1
different	1
days,"	1
answered	1
the	1
captain.	1
"One	1
day	1
he	1
is	1
sensible,	1
well	1
educated,	1
and	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
he's	1
a	1
wild	1
beast....	1
In	1
Poland,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
he	1
nearly	1
killed	1
a	1
Jew."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well,	1
well!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
"Still,	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
misfortune.	1
You	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
important	1
connections...	1
Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
just..."	1
	1
"I	1
will,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Timokhin,	1
showing	1
by	1
his	1
smile	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
his	1
commander's	1
wish.	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course,	1
of	1
course!"	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
sought	1
out	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
and,	1
reining	1
in	1
his	1
horse,	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"After	1
the	1
next	1
affair...	1
epaulettes."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
looked	1
round	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
anything,	1
nor	1
did	1
the	1
mocking	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
change.	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
all	1
right,"	1
continued	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
"A	1
cup	1
of	1
vodka	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
from	1
me,"	1
he	1
added	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
soldiers	1
could	1
hear.	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all!	1
God	1
be	1
praised!"	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
past	1
that	1
company	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
next	1
one.	1
	1
"Well,	1
he's	1
really	1
a	1
good	1
fellow,	1
one	1
can	1
serve	1
under	1
him,"	1
said	1
Timokhin	1
to	1
the	1
subaltern	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
word,	1
a	1
hearty	1
one..."	1
said	1
the	1
subaltern,	1
laughing	1
(the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
was	1
nicknamed	1
King	1
of	1
Hearts).	1
	1
The	1
cheerful	1
mood	1
of	1
their	1
officers	1
after	1
the	1
inspection	1
infected	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
The	1
company	1
marched	1
on	1
gaily.	1
The	1
soldiers'	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
"And	1
they	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
blind	1
of	1
one	1
eye?"	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
he	1
is!	1
Quite	1
blind!"	1
	1
"No,	1
friend,	1
he	1
is	1
sharper-eyed	1
than	1
you	1
are.	1
Boots	1
and	1
leg	1
bands...	1
he	1
noticed	1
everything..."	1
	1
"When	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
my	1
feet,	1
friend...	1
well,	1
thinks	1
I..."	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
other	1
one	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
Austrian,	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
smeared	1
with	1
chalk--as	1
white	1
as	1
flour!	1
I	1
suppose	1
they	1
polish	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
the	1
guns."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Fedeshon!...	1
Did	1
he	1
say	1
when	1
the	1
battles	1
are	1
to	1
begin?	1
You	1
were	1
near	1
him.	1
Everybody	1
said	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
himself	1
was	1
at	1
Braunau."	1
	1
"Buonaparte	1
himself!...	1
Just	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
fool,	1
what	1
he	1
doesn't	1
know!	1
The	1
Prussians	1
are	1
up	1
in	1
arms	1
now.	1
The	1
Austrians,	1
you	1
see,	1
are	1
putting	1
them	1
down.	1
When	1
they've	1
been	1
put	1
down,	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Buonaparte	1
will	1
begin.	1
And	1
he	1
says	1
Buonaparte	1
is	1
in	1
Braunau!	1
Shows	1
you're	1
a	1
fool.	1
You'd	1
better	1
listen	1
more	1
carefully!"	1
	1
"What	1
devils	1
these	1
quartermasters	1
are!	1
See,	1
the	1
fifth	1
company	1
is	1
turning	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
already...	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
their	1
buckwheat	1
cooked	1
before	1
we	1
reach	1
our	1
quarters."	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
a	1
biscuit,	1
you	1
devil!"	1
	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
tobacco	1
yesterday?	1
That's	1
just	1
it,	1
friend!	1
Ah,	1
well,	1
never	1
mind,	1
here	1
you	1
are."	1
	1
"They	1
might	1
call	1
a	1
halt	1
here	1
or	1
we'll	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
another	1
four	1
miles	1
without	1
eating."	1
	1
"Wasn't	1
it	1
fine	1
when	1
those	1
Germans	1
gave	1
us	1
lifts!	1
You	1
just	1
sit	1
still	1
and	1
are	1
drawn	1
along."	1
	1
"And	1
here,	1
friend,	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
quite	1
beggarly.	1
There	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
Poles--all	1
under	1
the	1
Russian	1
crown--but	1
here	1
they're	1
all	1
regular	1
Germans."	1
	1
"Singers	1
to	1
the	1
front"	1
came	1
the	1
captain's	1
order.	1
	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
different	1
ranks	1
some	1
twenty	1
men	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
front.	1
A	1
drummer,	1
their	1
leader,	1
turned	1
round	1
facing	1
the	1
singers,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm,	1
began	1
a	1
long-drawn-out	1
soldiers'	1
song,	1
commencing	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Morning	1
dawned,	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
rising,"	1
and	1
concluding:	1
"On	1
then,	1
brothers,	1
on	1
to	1
glory,	1
led	1
by	1
Father	1
Kamenski."	1
This	1
song	1
had	1
been	1
composed	1
in	1
the	1
Turkish	1
campaign	1
and	1
now	1
being	1
sung	1
in	1
Austria,	1
the	1
only	1
change	1
being	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
"Father	1
Kamenski"	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
"Father	1
Kutuzov."	1
	1
Having	1
jerked	1
out	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
as	1
soldiers	1
do	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
flinging	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
the	1
drummer--a	1
lean,	1
handsome	1
soldier	1
of	1
forty--looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
the	1
singers	1
and	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
having	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
both	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
carefully	1
lifting	1
some	1
invisible	1
but	1
precious	1
object	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
and,	1
holding	1
it	1
there	1
for	1
some	1
seconds,	1
suddenly	1
flung	1
it	1
down	1
and	1
began:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
bower,	1
oh,	1
my	1
bower...!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
bower	1
new...!"	1
chimed	1
in	1
twenty	1
voices,	1
and	1
the	1
castanet	1
player,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
his	1
equipment,	1
rushed	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
and,	1
walking	1
backwards	1
before	1
the	1
company,	1
jerked	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
flourished	1
his	1
castanets	1
as	1
if	1
threatening	1
someone.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
swinging	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
keeping	1
time	1
spontaneously,	1
marched	1
with	1
long	1
steps.	1
Behind	1
the	1
company	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels,	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
springs,	1
and	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
were	1
heard.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
his	1
suite	1
were	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
town.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
continue	1
to	1
march	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
suite	1
showed	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
singing	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
dancing	1
soldier	1
and	1
the	1
gay	1
and	1
smartly	1
marching	1
men.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
file	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
flank,	1
beside	1
which	1
the	1
carriage	1
passed	1
the	1
company,	1
a	1
blue-	1
eyed	1
soldier	1
involuntarily	1
attracted	1
notice.	1
It	1
was	1
Dolokhov	1
marching	1
with	1
particular	1
grace	1
and	1
boldness	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
song	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
those	1
driving	1
past	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
pitied	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
marching	1
with	1
the	1
company.	1
The	1
hussar	1
cornet	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
suite	1
who	1
had	1
mimicked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
fell	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
Hussar	1
cornet	1
Zherkov	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time,	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
set	1
led	1
by	1
Dolokhov.	1
Zherkov	1
had	1
met	1
Dolokhov	1
abroad	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
fit	1
to	1
recognize	1
him.	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
ranker,	1
he	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cordiality	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
said	1
he	1
through	1
the	1
singing,	1
making	1
his	1
horse	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
the	1
company.	1
	1
"How	1
am	1
I?"	1
Dolokhov	1
answered	1
coldly.	1
"I	1
am	1
as	1
you	1
see."	1
	1
The	1
lively	1
song	1
gave	1
a	1
special	1
flavor	1
to	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
gaiety	1
with	1
which	1
Zherkov	1
spoke,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
intentional	1
coldness	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
reply.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
officers?"	1
inquired	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"All	1
right.	1
They	1
are	1
good	1
fellows.	1
And	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
wriggled	1
onto	1
the	1
staff?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
attached;	1
I'm	1
on	1
duty."	1
	1
Both	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"She	1
let	1
the	1
hawk	1
fly	1
upward	1
from	1
her	1
wide	1
right	1
sleeve,"	1
went	1
the	1
song,	1
arousing	1
an	1
involuntary	1
sensation	1
of	1
courage	1
and	1
cheerfulness.	1
Their	1
conversation	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
that	1
song.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
Austrians	1
have	1
been	1
beaten?"	1
asked	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
only	1
knows!	1
They	1
say	1
so."	1
	1
"I'm	1
glad,"	1
answered	1
Dolokhov	1
briefly	1
and	1
clearly,	1
as	1
the	1
song	1
demanded.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
come	1
round	1
some	1
evening	1
and	1
we'll	1
have	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
faro!"	1
said	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"Why,	1
have	1
you	1
too	1
much	1
money?"	1
	1
"Do	1
come."	1
	1
"I	1
can't.	1
I've	1
sworn	1
not	1
to.	1
I	1
won't	1
drink	1
and	1
won't	1
play	1
till	1
I	1
get	1
reinstated."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
only	1
till	1
the	1
first	1
engagement."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
see."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
again	1
silent.	1
	1
"Come	1
if	1
you	1
need	1
anything.	1
One	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
on	1
the	1
staff..."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
smiled.	1
"Don't	1
trouble.	1
If	1
I	1
want	1
anything,	1
I	1
won't	1
beg--I'll	1
take	1
it!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
never	1
mind;	1
I	1
only..."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
only..."	1
	1
"Good-bye."	1
	1
"Good	1
health..."	1
	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
long,	1
long	1
way.	1
To	1
my	1
native	1
land..."	1
	1
Zherkov	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
spurs;	1
it	1
pranced	1
excitedly	1
from	1
foot	1
to	1
foot	1
uncertain	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
start,	1
then	1
settled	1
down,	1
galloped	1
past	1
the	1
company,	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
carriage,	1
still	1
keeping	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
song.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
review,	1
Kutuzov	1
took	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
into	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
and,	1
calling	1
his	1
adjutant,	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
papers	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
on	1
their	1
arrival,	1
and	1
the	1
letters	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
advanced	1
army.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
required	1
papers.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
plan	1
was	1
spread	1
out.	1
	1
"Ah!..."	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
glancing	1
at	1
Bolkonski	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
this	1
exclamation	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
the	1
adjutant	1
to	1
wait,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"All	1
I	1
can	1
say,	1
General,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
elegance	1
of	1
expression	1
and	1
intonation	1
that	1
obliged	1
one	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
each	1
deliberately	1
spoken	1
word.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
listened	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
voice.	1
"All	1
I	1
can	1
say,	1
General,	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
matter	1
depended	1
on	1
my	1
personal	1
wishes,	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
long	1
ago.	1
I	1
should	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
joined	1
the	1
archduke.	1
And	1
believe	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
honour	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
personally	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
supreme	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
informed	1
and	1
more	1
skillful	1
general--of	1
whom	1
Austria	1
has	1
so	1
many--and	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
all	1
this	1
heavy	1
responsibility.	1
But	1
circumstances	1
are	1
sometimes	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
us,	1
General."	1
	1
And	1
Kutuzov	1
smiled	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
at	1
liberty	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
even	1
care	1
whether	1
you	1
do	1
or	1
not,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
grounds	1
for	1
telling	1
me	1
so.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
point."	1
	1
The	1
Austrian	1
general	1
looked	1
dissatisfied,	1
but	1
had	1
no	1
option	1
but	1
to	1
reply	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
querulous	1
and	1
angry	1
tone	1
that	1
contrasted	1
with	1
his	1
flattering	1
words,	1
"on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
your	1
excellency's	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
action	1
is	1
highly	1
valued	1
by	1
His	1
Majesty;	1
but	1
we	1
think	1
the	1
present	1
delay	1
is	1
depriving	1
the	1
splendid	1
Russian	1
troops	1
and	1
their	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
laurels	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
win	1
in	1
their	1
battles,"	1
he	1
concluded	1
his	1
evidently	1
prearranged	1
sentence.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
bowed	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile.	1
	1
"But	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
conviction,	1
and	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
with	1
which	1
His	1
Highness	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
has	1
honored	1
me,	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
Austrian	1
troops,	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
so	1
skillful	1
a	1
leader	1
as	1
General	1
Mack,	1
have	1
by	1
now	1
already	1
gained	1
a	1
decisive	1
victory	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
need	1
our	1
aid,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
frowned.	1
Though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
definite	1
news	1
of	1
an	1
Austrian	1
defeat,	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
circumstances	1
confirming	1
the	1
unfavorable	1
rumors	1
that	1
were	1
afloat,	1
and	1
so	1
Kutuzov's	1
suggestion	1
of	1
an	1
Austrian	1
victory	1
sounded	1
much	1
like	1
irony.	1
But	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
on	1
blandly	1
smiling	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
suppose	1
so.	1
And,	1
in	1
fact,	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
Mack's	1
army	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
and	1
stated	1
strategically	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
very	1
favorable.	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
that	1
letter,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Please	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
it"--and	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
smile	1
about	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
the	1
following	1
passage,	1
in	1
German,	1
from	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand's	1
letter:	1
	1
We	1
have	1
fully	1
concentrated	1
forces	1
of	1
nearly	1
seventy	1
thousand	1
men	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
defeat	1
the	1
enemy	1
should	1
he	1
cross	1
the	1
Lech.	1
Also,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
masters	1
of	1
Ulm,	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
commanding	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
so	1
that	1
should	1
the	1
enemy	1
not	1
cross	1
the	1
Lech,	1
we	1
can	1
cross	1
the	1
Danube,	1
throw	1
ourselves	1
on	1
his	1
line	1
of	1
communications,	1
recross	1
the	1
river	1
lower	1
down,	1
and	1
frustrate	1
his	1
intention	1
should	1
he	1
try	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
whole	1
force	1
against	1
our	1
faithful	1
ally.	1
We	1
shall	1
therefore	1
confidently	1
await	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
Imperial	1
Russian	1
army	1
will	1
be	1
fully	1
equipped,	1
and	1
shall	1
then,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
it,	1
easily	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
enemy	1
the	1
fate	1
he	1
deserves.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
on	1
finishing	1
this	1
paragraph	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
mildly	1
and	1
attentively.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
wise	1
maxim	1
your	1
excellency,	1
advising	1
one	1
to	1
expect	1
the	1
worst,"	1
said	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
jests	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
business.	1
He	1
involuntarily	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
aide-de-camp.	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me,	1
General,"	1
interrupted	1
Kutuzov,	1
also	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Look	1
here,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
get	1
from	1
Kozlovski	1
all	1
the	1
reports	1
from	1
our	1
scouts.	1
Here	1
are	1
two	1
letters	1
from	1
Count	1
Nostitz	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
one	1
from	1
His	1
Highness	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
these,"	1
he	1
said,	1
handing	1
him	1
several	1
papers,	1
"make	1
a	1
neat	1
memorandum	1
in	1
French	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
showing	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army,	1
and	1
then	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
excellency."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
having	1
understood	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
but	1
also	1
what	1
Kutuzov	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
He	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
both,	1
stepped	1
softly	1
over	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room.	1
	1
Though	1
not	1
much	1
time	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
left	1
Russia,	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
greatly	1
during	1
that	1
period.	1
In	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
in	1
his	1
movements,	1
in	1
his	1
walk,	1
scarcely	1
a	1
trace	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
affected	1
languor	1
and	1
indolence.	1
He	1
now	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
he	1
makes	1
on	1
others,	1
but	1
is	1
occupied	1
with	1
agreeable	1
and	1
interesting	1
work.	1
His	1
face	1
expressed	1
more	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
himself	1
and	1
those	1
around	1
him,	1
his	1
smile	1
and	1
glance	1
were	1
brighter	1
and	1
more	1
attractive.	1
	1
Kutuzov,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
overtaken	1
in	1
Poland,	1
had	1
received	1
him	1
very	1
kindly,	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
him,	1
distinguished	1
him	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
adjutants,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
to	1
Vienna	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
more	1
serious	1
commissions.	1
From	1
Vienna	1
Kutuzov	1
wrote	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
comrade,	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
father.	1
	1
Your	1
son	1
bids	1
fair	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
officer	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
industry,	1
firmness,	1
and	1
expedition.	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
fortunate	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
subordinate	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
On	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff,	1
among	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
generally,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society,	1
two	1
quite	1
opposite	1
reputations.	1
Some,	1
a	1
minority,	1
acknowledged	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
different	1
from	1
themselves	1
and	1
from	1
everyone	1
else,	1
expected	1
great	1
things	1
of	1
him,	1
listened	1
to	1
him,	1
admired,	1
and	1
imitated	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
natural	1
and	1
pleasant.	1
Others,	1
the	1
majority,	1
disliked	1
him	1
and	1
considered	1
him	1
conceited,	1
cold,	1
and	1
disagreeable.	1
But	1
among	1
these	1
people	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
stand	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
respected	1
and	1
even	1
feared	1
him.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
room	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
papers	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
comrade,	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
on	1
duty,	1
Kozlovski,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
with	1
a	1
book.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Prince?"	1
asked	1
Kozlovski.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
ordered	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
memorandum	1
explaining	1
why	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
advancing."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"Any	1
news	1
from	1
Mack?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
beaten,	1
news	1
would	1
have	1
come."	1
	1
"Probably,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
outer	1
door.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
tall	1
Austrian	1
general	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat,	1
with	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Maria	1
Theresa	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
bandage	1
round	1
his	1
head,	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
just	1
arrived,	1
entered	1
quickly,	1
slamming	1
the	1
door.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped	1
short.	1
	1
"Commander	1
in	1
Chief	1
Kutuzov?"	1
said	1
the	1
newly	1
arrived	1
general	1
speaking	1
quickly	1
with	1
a	1
harsh	1
German	1
accent,	1
looking	1
to	1
both	1
sides	1
and	1
advancing	1
straight	1
toward	1
the	1
inner	1
door.	1
	1
"The	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
engaged,"	1
said	1
Kozlovski,	1
going	1
hurriedly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
unknown	1
general	1
and	1
blocking	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
"Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
announce?"	1
	1
The	1
unknown	1
general	1
looked	1
disdainfully	1
down	1
at	1
Kozlovski,	1
who	1
was	1
rather	1
short,	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
that	1
anyone	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
engaged,"	1
repeated	1
Kozlovski	1
calmly.	1
	1
The	1
general's	1
face	1
clouded,	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
and	1
trembled.	1
He	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
notebook,	1
hurriedly	1
scribbled	1
something	1
in	1
pencil,	1
tore	1
out	1
the	1
leaf,	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Kozlovski,	1
stepped	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
chair,	1
gazing	1
at	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
if	1
asking,	1
"Why	1
do	1
they	1
look	1
at	1
me?"	1
Then	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
head,	1
stretched	1
his	1
neck	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
immediately,	1
with	1
affected	1
indifference,	1
began	1
to	1
hum	1
to	1
himself,	1
producing	1
a	1
queer	1
sound	1
which	1
immediately	1
broke	1
off.	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
private	1
room	1
opened	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway.	1
The	1
general	1
with	1
the	1
bandaged	1
head	1
bent	1
forward	1
as	1
though	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
some	1
danger,	1
and,	1
making	1
long,	1
quick	1
strides	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
legs,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"Vous	1
voyez	1
le	1
malheureux	1
Mack,"	1
he	1
uttered	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
voice.	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
doorway	1
remained	1
perfectly	1
immobile	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments.	1
Then	1
wrinkles	1
ran	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
wave	1
and	1
his	1
forehead	1
became	1
smooth	1
again,	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
respectfully,	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
silently	1
let	1
Mack	1
enter	1
his	1
room	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
himself	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
report	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
circulated	1
that	1
the	1
Austrians	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
had	1
surrendered	1
at	1
Ulm	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
correct.	1
Within	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
adjutants	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
in	1
various	1
directions	1
with	1
orders	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
who	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
inactive,	1
would	1
also	1
soon	1
have	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
staff	1
officers	1
whose	1
chief	1
interest	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
war.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Mack	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
disaster	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
half	1
the	1
campaign	1
was	1
lost,	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army's	1
position,	1
and	1
vividly	1
imagined	1
what	1
awaited	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
play.	1
Involuntarily	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
joyful	1
agitation	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
arrogant	1
Austria	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
week's	1
time	1
he	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
see	1
and	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
Russian	1
encounter	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
since	1
Suvorov	1
met	1
them.	1
He	1
feared	1
that	1
Bonaparte's	1
genius	1
might	1
outweigh	1
all	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
hero	1
being	1
disgraced.	1
	1
Excited	1
and	1
irritated	1
by	1
these	1
thoughts	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
toward	1
his	1
room	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
wrote	1
every	1
day.	1
In	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
met	1
Nesvitski,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
shared	1
a	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
wag	1
Zherkov;	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
usual	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
glum?"	1
asked	1
Nesvitski	1
noticing	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
gay	1
about,"	1
answered	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
met	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
Zherkov,	1
there	1
came	1
toward	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
corridor,	1
Strauch,	1
an	1
Austrian	1
general	1
who	1
on	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
provisioning	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
and	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
who	1
had	1
arrived	1
the	1
previous	1
evening.	1
There	1
was	1
room	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
corridor	1
for	1
the	1
generals	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
three	1
officers	1
quite	1
easily,	1
but	1
Zherkov,	1
pushing	1
Nesvitski	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
arm,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
breathless	1
voice,	1
	1
"They're	1
coming!...	1
they're	1
coming!...	1
Stand	1
aside,	1
make	1
way,	1
please	1
make	1
way!"	1
	1
The	1
generals	1
were	1
passing	1
by,	1
looking	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
embarrassing	1
attentions.	1
On	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
wag	1
Zherkov	1
there	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
a	1
stupid	1
smile	1
of	1
glee	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
German,	1
stepping	1
forward	1
and	1
addressing	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
congratulate	1
you."	1
	1
He	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
scraped	1
first	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
awkwardly,	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
at	1
a	1
dancing	1
lesson.	1
	1
The	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
severely	1
but,	1
seeing	1
the	1
seriousness	1
of	1
his	1
stupid	1
smile,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
moment's	1
attention.	1
He	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
showing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
listening.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
congratulate	1
you.	1
General	1
Mack	1
has	1
arrived,	1
quite	1
well,	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
bruised	1
just	1
here,"	1
he	1
added,	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile	1
to	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
frowned,	1
turned	1
away,	1
and	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
"Gott,	1
wie	1
naiv!"	1
*	1
said	1
he	1
angrily,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
few	1
steps.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Good	1
God,	1
what	1
simplicity!"	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
threw	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
but	1
Bolkonski,	1
turning	1
still	1
paler,	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Zherkov.	1
The	1
nervous	1
irritation	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
Mack,	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
defeat,	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
found	1
vent	1
in	1
anger	1
at	1
Zherkov's	1
untimely	1
jest.	1
	1
"If	1
you,	1
sir,	1
choose	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
buffoon	1
of	1
yourself,"	1
he	1
said	1
sharply,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
trembling	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
"I	1
can't	1
prevent	1
your	1
doing	1
so;	1
but	1
I	1
warn	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
fool	1
in	1
my	1
presence,	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
behave	1
yourself."	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
Zherkov	1
were	1
so	1
surprised	1
by	1
this	1
outburst	1
that	1
they	1
gazed	1
at	1
Bolkonski	1
silently	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?	1
I	1
only	1
congratulated	1
them,"	1
said	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
jesting	1
with	1
you;	1
please	1
be	1
silent!"	1
cried	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
taking	1
Nesvitski's	1
arm	1
he	1
left	1
Zherkov,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Come,	1
what's	1
the	1
matter,	1
old	1
fellow?"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
trying	1
to	1
soothe	1
him.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
exclaimed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
standing	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
excitement.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
either	1
we	1
are	1
officers	1
serving	1
our	1
Tsar	1
and	1
our	1
country,	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
successes	1
and	1
grieving	1
at	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
our	1
common	1
cause,	1
or	1
we	1
are	1
merely	1
lackeys	1
who	1
care	1
nothing	1
for	1
their	1
master's	1
business.	1
Quarante	1

et	1

*	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
strengthening	1
his	1
views	1
by	1
this	1
French	1
sentence.	1
"C'est	1
bien	1
pour	1
un	1
garcon	1
de	1
rien	1
comme	1
cet	1
individu	1
dont	1
vous	1

pour	1
vous.	1
*(2)	1
Only	1
a	1
hobbledehoy	1
could	1
amuse	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
way,"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
Russian--but	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
accent--having	1
noticed	1
that	1
Zherkov	1
could	1
still	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Forty	1
thousand	1
men	1
massacred	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
our	1
allies	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
a	1
cause	1
for	1
jesting!"	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
that	1
good-for-nothing	1
fellow	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
friend,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
you,	1
not	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
He	1
waited	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
cornet	1
would	1
answer,	1
but	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
corridor.	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
The	1
Pavlograd	1
Hussars	1
were	1
stationed	1
two	1
miles	1
from	1
Braunau.	1
The	1
squadron	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
cadet	1
was	1
quartered	1
in	1
the	1
German	1
village	1
of	1
Salzeneck.	1
The	1
best	1
quarters	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
were	1
assigned	1
to	1
cavalry-captain	1
Denisov,	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
known	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
cavalry	1
division	1
as	1
Vaska	1
Denisov.	1
Cadet	1
Rostov,	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
overtaken	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
Poland,	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander.	1
	1
On	1
October	1
11,	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
astir	1
at	1
headquarters	1
over	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
Mack's	1
defeat,	1
the	1
camp	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
this	1
squadron	1
was	1
proceeding	1
as	1
usual.	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
losing	1
at	1
cards	1
all	1
night,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
home	1
when	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
back	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
from	1
a	1
foraging	1
expedition.	1
Rostov	1
in	1
his	1
cadet	1
uniform,	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch,	1
swung	1
his	1
leg	1
over	1
the	1
saddle	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
youthful	1
movement,	1
stood	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
stirrup	1
as	1
if	1
loathe	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
sprang	1
down	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
orderly.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Bondarenko,	1
dear	1
friend!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
who	1
rushed	1
up	1
headlong	1
to	1
the	1
horse.	1
"Walk	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
with	1
that	1
gay	1
brotherly	1
cordiality	1
which	1
goodhearted	1
young	1
people	1
show	1
to	1
everyone	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
happy.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Ukrainian	1
gaily,	1
tossing	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Mind,	1
walk	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
well!"	1
	1
Another	1
hussar	1
also	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
horse,	1
but	1
Bondarenko	1
had	1
already	1
thrown	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
the	1
snaffle	1
bridle	1
over	1
the	1
horse's	1
head.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
cadet	1
was	1
liberal	1
with	1
his	1
tips	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
paid	1
to	1
serve	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
patted	1
the	1
horse's	1
neck	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
flank,	1
and	1
lingered	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
"Splendid!	1
What	1
a	1
horse	1
he	1
will	1
be!"	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
saber,	1
his	1
spurs	1
jingling,	1
he	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
porch.	1
His	1
landlord,	1
who	1
in	1
a	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
a	1
pointed	1
cap,	1
pitchfork	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
clearing	1
manure	1
from	1
the	1
cowhouse,	1
looked	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
immediately	1
brightened	1
on	1
seeing	1
Rostov.	1
"Schon	1
gut	1
Morgen!	1
Schon	1
gut	1
Morgen!"	1
*	1
he	1
said	1
winking	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
smile,	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
to	1
greet	1
the	1
young	1
man.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"A	1
very	1
good	1
morning!	1
A	1
very	1
good	1
morning!"	1
	1
"Schon	1
fleissig?"	1
*	1
said	1
Rostov	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
gay	1
brotherly	1
smile	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
his	1
eager	1
face.	1
"Hoch	1
Oestreicher!	1
Hoch	1
Russen!	1
Kaiser	1
Alexander	1
hoch!"	1
*(2)	1
said	1
he,	1
quoting	1
words	1
often	1
repeated	1
by	1
the	1
German	1
landlord.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Busy	1
already?"	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"Hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
Austrians!	1
Hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
Russians!	1
Hurrah	1
for	1
Emperor	1
Alexander!"	1
	1
The	1
German	1
laughed,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cowshed,	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
cap,	1
and	1
waving	1
it	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
cried:	1
	1
"Und	1
die	1
ganze	1
Welt	1
hoch!"	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"And	1
hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
waved	1
his	1
cap	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
the	1
German	1
and	1
cried	1
laughing,	1
"Und	1
vivat	1
die	1
ganze	1
Welt!"	1
Though	1
neither	1
the	1
German	1
cleaning	1
his	1
cowshed	1
nor	1
Rostov	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
platoon	1
from	1
foraging	1
for	1
hay	1
had	1
any	1
reason	1
for	1
rejoicing,	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
joyful	1
delight	1
and	1
brotherly	1
love,	1
wagged	1
their	1
heads	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
affection,	1
and	1
parted	1
smiling,	1
the	1
German	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
cowshed	1
and	1
Rostov	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
he	1
occupied	1
with	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"What	1
about	1
your	1
master?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Lavrushka,	1
Denisov's	1
orderly,	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
regiment	1
knew	1
for	1
a	1
rogue.	1
	1
"Hasn't	1
been	1
in	1
since	1
the	1
evening.	1
Must	1
have	1
been	1
losing,"	1
answered	1
Lavrushka.	1
"I	1
know	1
by	1
now,	1
if	1
he	1
wins	1
he	1
comes	1
back	1
early	1
to	1
brag	1
about	1
it,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
stays	1
out	1
till	1
morning	1
it	1
means	1
he's	1
lost	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
rage.	1
Will	1
you	1
have	1
coffee?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
bring	1
some."	1
	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
later	1
Lavrushka	1
brought	1
the	1
coffee.	1
"He's	1
coming!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Now	1
for	1
trouble!"	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
saw	1
Denisov	1
coming	1
home.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face,	1
sparkling	1
black	1
eyes,	1
and	1
black	1
tousled	1
mustache	1
and	1
hair.	1
He	1
wore	1
an	1
unfastened	1
cloak,	1
wide	1
breeches	1
hanging	1
down	1
in	1
creases,	1
and	1
a	1
crumpled	1
shako	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
gloomily,	1
hanging	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Lavwuska!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
loudly	1
and	1
angrily,	1
"take	1
it	1
off,	1
blockhead!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
am	1
taking	1
it	1
off,"	1
replied	1
Lavrushka's	1
voice.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you're	1
up	1
already,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
entering	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Long	1
ago,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
hay,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
Fraulein	1
Mathilde."	1
	1
"Weally!	1
And	1
I've	1
been	1
losing,	1
bwother.	1
I	1
lost	1
yesterday	1
like	1
a	1
damned	1
fool!"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
not	1
pronouncing	1
his	1
r's.	1
"Such	1
ill	1
luck!	1
Such	1
ill	1
luck.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
left,	1
it	1
began	1
and	1
went	1
on.	1
Hullo	1
there!	1
Tea!"	1
	1
Puckering	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
though	1
smiling,	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
short	1
strong	1
teeth,	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
stubby	1
fingers	1
of	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
ruffle	1
up	1
his	1
thick	1
tangled	1
black	1
hair.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
devil	1
made	1
me	1
go	1
to	1
that	1
wat?"	1
(an	1
officer	1
nicknamed	1
"the	1
rat")	1
he	1
said,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
whole	1
face	1
with	1
both	1
hands.	1
"Just	1
fancy,	1
he	1
didn't	1
let	1
me	1
win	1
a	1
single	1
cahd,	1
not	1
one	1
cahd."	1
	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
lighted	1
pipe	1
that	1
was	1
offered	1
to	1
him,	1
gripped	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
fist,	1
and	1
tapped	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
making	1
the	1
sparks	1
fly,	1
while	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
shout.	1
	1
"He	1
lets	1
one	1
win	1
the	1
singles	1
and	1
collahs	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
one	1
doubles	1
it;	1
gives	1
the	1
singles	1
and	1
snatches	1
the	1
doubles!"	1
	1
He	1
scattered	1
the	1
burning	1
tobacco,	1
smashed	1
the	1
pipe,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
away.	1
Then	1
he	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
looked	1
cheerfully	1
with	1
his	1
glittering,	1
black	1
eyes	1
at	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"If	1
at	1
least	1
we	1
had	1
some	1
women	1
here;	1
but	1
there's	1
nothing	1
foh	1
one	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
dwink.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
to	1
fighting	1
soon.	1
Hullo,	1
who's	1
there?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
tread	1
of	1
heavy	1
boots	1
and	1
the	1
clinking	1
of	1
spurs	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop,	1
and	1
a	1
respectful	1
cough.	1
	1
"The	1
squadron	1
quartermaster!"	1
said	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
Denisov's	1
face	1
puckered	1
still	1
more.	1
	1
"Wetched!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
throwing	1
down	1
a	1
purse	1
with	1
some	1
gold	1
in	1
it.	1
"Wostov,	1
deah	1
fellow,	1
just	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
there	1
is	1
left	1
and	1
shove	1
the	1
purse	1
undah	1
the	1
pillow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
quartermaster.	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
and,	1
mechanically	1
arranging	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
new	1
coins	1
in	1
separate	1
piles,	1
began	1
counting	1
them.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
Telyanin!	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do?	1
They	1
plucked	1
me	1
last	1
night,"	1
came	1
Denisov's	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
	1
"Where?	1
At	1
Bykov's,	1
at	1
the	1
rat's...	1
I	1
knew	1
it,"	1
replied	1
a	1
piping	1
voice,	1
and	1
Lieutenant	1
Telyanin,	1
a	1
small	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
squadron,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Rostov	1
thrust	1
the	1
purse	1
under	1
the	1
pillow	1
and	1
shook	1
the	1
damp	1
little	1
hand	1
which	1
was	1
offered	1
him.	1
Telyanin	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
had	1
been	1
transferred	1
from	1
the	1
Guards	1
just	1
before	1
this	1
campaign.	1
He	1
behaved	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
liked;	1
Rostov	1
especially	1
detested	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
overcome	1
or	1
conceal	1
his	1
groundless	1
antipathy	1
to	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
"Well,	1
young	1
cavalryman,	1
how	1
is	1
my	1
Rook	1
behaving?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
(Rook	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
horse	1
Telyanin	1
had	1
sold	1
to	1
Rostov.)	1
	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
never	1
looked	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face;	1
his	1
eyes	1
continually	1
wandered	1
from	1
one	1
object	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
you	1
riding	1
this	1
morning..."	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he's	1
all	1
right,	1
a	1
good	1
horse,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
though	1
the	1
horse	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
paid	1
seven	1
hundred	1
rubbles	1
was	1
not	1
worth	1
half	1
that	1
sum.	1
"He's	1
begun	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
little	1
lame	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
foreleg,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"The	1
hoof's	1
cracked!	1
That's	1
nothing.	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
show	1
you	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
rivet	1
to	1
use."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
please	1
do,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I'll	1
show	1
you,	1
I'll	1
show	1
you!	1
It's	1
not	1
a	1
secret.	1
And	1
it's	1
a	1
horse	1
you'll	1
thank	1
me	1
for."	1
	1
"Then	1
I'll	1
have	1
it	1
brought	1
round,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
wishing	1
to	1
avoid	1
Telyanin,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
order.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
passage	1
Denisov,	1
with	1
a	1
pipe,	1
was	1
squatting	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
facing	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
who	1
was	1
reporting	1
to	1
him.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Rostov,	1
Denisov	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
pointing	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
with	1
his	1
thumb	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Telyanin	1
was	1
sitting,	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
shudder	1
of	1
disgust.	1
	1
"Ugh!	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
that	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
quartermaster's	1
presence.	1
	1
Rostov	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say:	1
"Nor	1
do	1
I,	1
but	1
what's	1
one	1
to	1
do?"	1
and,	1
having	1
given	1
his	1
order,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
Telyanin	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
indolent	1
pose	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
had	1
left	1
him,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hands.	1
	1
"Well	1
there	1
certainly	1
are	1
disgusting	1
people,"	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
horse?"	1
asked	1
Telyanin,	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
looking	1
carelessly	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
have."	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
ourselves.	1
I	1
only	1
came	1
round	1
to	1
ask	1
Denisov	1
about	1
yesterday's	1
order.	1
Have	1
you	1
got	1
it,	1
Denisov?"	1
	1
"Not	1
yet.	1
But	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?"	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
teach	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
how	1
to	1
shoe	1
a	1
horse,"	1
said	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
They	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
stable.	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
explained	1
how	1
to	1
rivet	1
the	1
hoof	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
quarters.	1
	1
When	1
Rostov	1
went	1
back	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
vodka	1
and	1
a	1
sausage	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
sitting	1
there	1
scratching	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
on	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper.	1
He	1
looked	1
gloomily	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
face	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
am	1
witing	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
He	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and,	1
evidently	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
say	1
quicker	1
in	1
words	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
write,	1
told	1
Rostov	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
his	1
letter.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
fwiend,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"we	1
sleep	1
when	1
we	1
don't	1
love.	1
We	1
are	1
childwen	1
of	1
the	1
dust...	1
but	1
one	1
falls	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
a	1
God,	1
one	1
is	1
pua'	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
cweation...	1
Who's	1
that	1
now?	1
Send	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
devil,	1
I'm	1
busy!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
Lavrushka,	1
who	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
abashed.	1
	1
"Who	1
should	1
it	1
be?	1
You	1
yourself	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
come.	1
It's	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
for	1
the	1
money."	1
	1
Denisov	1
frowned	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
shout	1
some	1
reply	1
but	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Wetched	1
business,"	1
he	1
muttered	1
to	1
himself.	1
"How	1
much	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
puhse?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Seven	1
new	1
and	1
three	1
old	1
imperials."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
wetched!	1
Well,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
standing	1
there	1
for,	1
you	1
sca'cwow?	1
Call	1
the	1
quahtehmasteh,"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"Please,	1
Denisov,	1
let	1
me	1
lend	1
you	1
some:	1
I	1
have	1
some,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
blushing.	1
	1
"Don't	1
like	1
bowwowing	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
fellows,	1
I	1
don't,"	1
growled	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
you	1
won't	1
accept	1
money	1
from	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
comrade,	1
you	1
will	1
offend	1
me.	1
Really	1
I	1
have	1
some,"	1
Rostov	1
repeated.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
	1
And	1
Denisov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
purse	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
"Where	1
have	1
you	1
put	1
it,	1
Wostov?"	1
	1
"Under	1
the	1
lower	1
pillow."	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
there."	1
	1
Denisov	1
threw	1
both	1
pillows	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
The	1
purse	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
miwacle."	1
	1
"Wait,	1
haven't	1
you	1
dropped	1
it?"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
picking	1
up	1
the	1
pillows	1
one	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
shaking	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
pulled	1
off	1
the	1
quilt	1
and	1
shook	1
it.	1
The	1
purse	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
can	1
I	1
have	1
forgotten?	1
No,	1
I	1
remember	1
thinking	1
that	1
you	1
kept	1
it	1
under	1
your	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
treasure,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"I	1
put	1
it	1
just	1
here.	1
Where	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"I	1
haven't	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
where	1
you	1
put	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
isn't?..."	1
	1
"You're	1
always	1
like	1
that;	1
you	1
thwow	1
a	1
thing	1
down	1
anywhere	1
and	1
forget	1
it.	1
Feel	1
in	1
your	1
pockets."	1
	1
"No,	1
if	1
I	1
hadn't	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
being	1
a	1
treasure,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"but	1
I	1
remember	1
putting	1
it	1
there."	1
	1
Lavrushka	1
turned	1
all	1
the	1
bedding	1
over,	1
looked	1
under	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
table,	1
searched	1
everywhere,	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Denisov	1
silently	1
watched	1
Lavrushka's	1
movements,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
arms	1
in	1
surprise	1
saying	1
it	1
was	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
Denisov	1
glanced	1
at	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Wostov,	1
you've	1
not	1
been	1
playing	1
schoolboy	1
twicks..."	1
	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
Denisov's	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
instantly	1
dropped	1
them	1
again.	1
All	1
the	1
blood	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
congested	1
somewhere	1
below	1
his	1
throat	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
eyes.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
breath.	1
	1
"And	1
there	1
hasn't	1
been	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
except	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
and	1
yourselves.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
here	1
somewhere,"	1
said	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
you	1
devil's	1
puppet,	1
look	1
alive	1
and	1
hunt	1
for	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
suddenly,	1
turning	1
purple	1
and	1
rushing	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
threatening	1
gesture.	1
"If	1
the	1
purse	1
isn't	1
found	1
I'll	1
flog	1
you,	1
I'll	1
flog	1
you	1
all."	1
	1
Rostov,	1
his	1
eyes	1
avoiding	1
Denisov,	1
began	1
buttoning	1
his	1
coat,	1
buckled	1
on	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
have	1
that	1
purse,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
shaking	1
his	1
orderly	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
knocking	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
"Denisov,	1
let	1
him	1
alone,	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
going	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Denisov	1
paused,	1
thought	1
a	1
moment,	1
and,	1
evidently	1
understanding	1
what	1
Rostov	1
hinted	1
at,	1
seized	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Nonsense!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
the	1
veins	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
neck	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
cords.	1
"You	1
are	1
mad,	1
I	1
tell	1
you.	1
I	1
won't	1
allow	1
it.	1
The	1
purse	1
is	1
here!	1
I'll	1
flay	1
this	1
scoundwel	1
alive,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it,"	1
repeated	1
Rostov	1
in	1
an	1
unsteady	1
voice,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
don't	1
you	1
dahe	1
to	1
do	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
rushing	1
at	1
the	1
cadet	1
to	1
restrain	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
Rostov	1
pulled	1
away	1
his	1
arm	1
and,	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
anger	1
as	1
though	1
Denisov	1
were	1
his	1
worst	1
enemy,	1
firmly	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
directly	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
understand	1
what	1
you're	1
saying?"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice.	1
"There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
except	1
myself.	1
So	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
then..."	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
finish,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
may	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
you	1
and	1
evewybody,"	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
Rostov	1
heard.	1
	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
Telyanin's	1
quarters.	1
	1
"The	1
master	1
is	1
not	1
in,	1
he's	1
gone	1
to	1
headquarters,"	1
said	1
Telyanin's	1
orderly.	1
"Has	1
something	1
happened?"	1
he	1
added,	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
cadet's	1
troubled	1
face.	1
	1
"No,	1
nothing."	1
	1
"You've	1
only	1
just	1
missed	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
orderly.	1
	1
The	1
headquarters	1
were	1
situated	1
two	1
miles	1
away	1
from	1
Salzeneck,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
returning	1
home,	1
took	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
there.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
inn	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
which	1
the	1
officers	1
frequented.	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
saw	1
Telyanin's	1
horse	1
at	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
was	1
sitting	1
over	1
a	1
dish	1
of	1
sausages	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you've	1
come	1
here	1
too,	1
young	1
man!"	1
he	1
said,	1
smiling	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
word;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
nearest	1
table.	1
	1
Both	1
were	1
silent.	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
Germans	1
and	1
a	1
Russian	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
No	1
one	1
spoke	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
heard	1
were	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
the	1
munching	1
of	1
the	1
lieutenant.	1
	1
When	1
Telyanin	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
lunch	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
double	1
purse	1
and,	1
drawing	1
its	1
rings	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
small,	1
white,	1
turned-up	1
fingers,	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
gold	1
imperial,	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
waiter.	1
	1
"Please	1
be	1
quick,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
coin	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
one.	1
Rostov	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
your	1
purse,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
almost	1
inaudible,	1
voice.	1
	1
With	1
shifting	1
eyes	1
but	1
eyebrows	1
still	1
raised,	1
Telyanin	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
purse.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
a	1
nice	1
purse.	1
Yes,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
growing	1
suddenly	1
pale,	1
and	1
added,	1
"Look	1
at	1
it,	1
young	1
man."	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
purse	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
examined	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Telyanin.	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
was	1
looking	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
way	1
and	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
very	1
merry.	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
get	1
to	1
Vienna	1
I'll	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
but	1
in	1
these	1
wretched	1
little	1
towns	1
there's	1
nowhere	1
to	1
spend	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Well,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it,	1
young	1
man,	1
I'm	1
going."	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
speak.	1
	1
"And	1
you?	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
lunch	1
too?	1
They	1
feed	1
you	1
quite	1
decently	1
here,"	1
continued	1
Telyanin.	1
"Now	1
then,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
purse.	1
Rostov	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
it.	1
Telyanin	1
took	1
the	1
purse	1
and	1
began	1
carelessly	1
slipping	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
his	1
riding	1
breeches,	1
with	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
lifted	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
slightly	1
open,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say,	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
am	1
putting	1
my	1
purse	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
and	1
that's	1
quite	1
simple	1
and	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
else's	1
business."	1
	1
"Well,	1
young	1
man?"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
and	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
lifted	1
brows	1
he	1
glanced	1
into	1
Rostov's	1
eyes.	1
	1
Some	1
flash	1
as	1
of	1
an	1
electric	1
spark	1
shot	1
from	1
Telyanin's	1
eyes	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
and	1
back,	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
"Come	1
here,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
Telyanin's	1
arm	1
and	1
almost	1
dragging	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
"That	1
money	1
is	1
Denisov's;	1
you	1
took	1
it..."	1
he	1
whispered	1
just	1
above	1
Telyanin's	1
ear.	1
	1
"What?	1
What?	1
How	1
dare	1
you?	1
What?"	1
said	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
But	1
these	1
words	1
came	1
like	1
a	1
piteous,	1
despairing	1
cry	1
and	1
an	1
entreaty	1
for	1
pardon.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Rostov	1
heard	1
them,	1
an	1
enormous	1
load	1
of	1
doubt	1
fell	1
from	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
began	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
miserable	1
man	1
who	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
task	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
completed.	1
	1
"Heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
the	1
people	1
here	1
may	1
imagine,"	1
muttered	1
Telyanin,	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
moving	1
toward	1
a	1
small	1
empty	1
room.	1
"We	1
must	1
have	1
an	1
explanation..."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
shall	1
prove	1
it,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I..."	1
	1
Every	1
muscle	1
of	1
Telyanin's	1
pale,	1
terrified	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
quiver,	1
his	1
eyes	1
still	1
shifted	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
downward	1
look	1
not	1
rising	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
face,	1
and	1
his	1
sobs	1
were	1
audible.	1
	1
"Count!...	1
Don't	1
ruin	1
a	1
young	1
fellow...	1
here	1
is	1
this	1
wretched	1
money,	1
take	1
it..."	1
He	1
threw	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
old	1
father	1
and	1
mother!..."	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
money,	1
avoiding	1
Telyanin's	1
eyes,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
then	1
retraced	1
his	1
steps.	1
"O	1
God,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
"how	1
could	1
you	1
do	1
it?"	1
	1
"Count..."	1
said	1
Telyanin	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Don't	1
touch	1
me,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
drawing	1
back.	1
"If	1
you	1
need	1
it,	1
take	1
the	1
money,"	1
and	1
he	1
threw	1
the	1
purse	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
That	1
same	1
evening	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
animated	1
discussion	1
among	1
the	1
squadron's	1
officers	1
in	1
Denisov's	1
quarters.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Rostov,	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
apologize	1
to	1
the	1
colonel!"	1
said	1
a	1
tall,	1
grizzly-haired	1
staff	1
captain,	1
with	1
enormous	1
mustaches	1
and	1
many	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
large	1
features,	1
to	1
Rostov	1
who	1
was	1
crimson	1
with	1
excitement.	1
	1
The	1
staff	1
captain,	1
Kirsten,	1
had	1
twice	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
for	1
affairs	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
had	1
twice	1
regained	1
his	1
commission.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
allow	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
call	1
me	1
a	1
liar!"	1
cried	1
Rostov.	1
"He	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
lied,	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
lied.	1
And	1
there	1
it	1
rests.	1
He	1
may	1
keep	1
me	1
on	1
duty	1
every	1
day,	1
or	1
may	1
place	1
me	1
under	1
arrest,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
make	1
me	1
apologize,	1
because	1
if	1
he,	1
as	1
commander	1
of	1
this	1
regiment,	1
thinks	1
it	1
beneath	1
his	1
dignity	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
satisfaction,	1
then..."	1
	1
"You	1
just	1
wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
and	1
listen,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
in	1
his	1
deep	1
bass,	1
calmly	1
stroking	1
his	1
long	1
mustache.	1
"You	1
tell	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
other	1
officers	1
that	1
an	1
officer	1
has	1
stolen..."	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
other	1
officers.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
spoken	1
before	1
them,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
diplomatist.	1
That's	1
why	1
I	1
joined	1
the	1
hussars,	1
thinking	1
that	1
here	1
one	1
would	1
not	1
need	1
finesse;	1
and	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
lying--so	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
me	1
satisfaction..."	1
	1
"That's	1
all	1
right.	1
No	1
one	1
thinks	1
you	1
a	1
coward,	1
but	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
Ask	1
Denisov	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
a	1
cadet	1
to	1
demand	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
his	1
regimental	1
commander?"	1
	1
Denisov	1
sat	1
gloomily	1
biting	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation,	1
evidently	1
with	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
answered	1
the	1
staff	1
captain's	1
question	1
by	1
a	1
disapproving	1
shake	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"You	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
about	1
this	1
nasty	1
business	1
before	1
other	1
officers,"	1
continued	1
the	1
staff	1
captain,	1
"and	1
Bogdanich"	1
(the	1
colonel	1
was	1
called	1
Bogdanich)	1
"shuts	1
you	1
up."	1
	1
"He	1
did	1
not	1
shut	1
me	1
up,	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
telling	1
an	1
untruth."	1
	1
"Well,	1
have	1
it	1
so,	1
and	1
you	1
talked	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
nonsense	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
must	1
apologize."	1
	1
"Not	1
on	1
any	1
account!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
this	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
seriously	1
and	1
severely.	1
"You	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
apologize,	1
but,	1
man,	1
it's	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment--all	1
of	1
us--you're	1
to	1
blame	1
all	1
round.	1
The	1
case	1
is	1
this:	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
thought	1
the	1
matter	1
over	1
and	1
taken	1
advice;	1
but	1
no,	1
you	1
go	1
and	1
blurt	1
it	1
all	1
straight	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
officers.	1
Now	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
colonel	1
to	1
do?	1
Have	1
the	1
officer	1
tried	1
and	1
disgrace	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment?	1
Disgrace	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment	1
because	1
of	1
one	1
scoundrel?	1
Is	1
that	1
how	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
it?	1
We	1
don't	1
see	1
it	1
like	1
that.	1
And	1
Bogdanich	1
was	1
a	1
brick:	1
he	1
told	1
you	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
what	1
was	1
not	1
true.	1
It's	1
not	1
pleasant,	1
but	1
what's	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?	1
You	1
landed	1
yourself	1
in	1
it.	1
And	1
now,	1
when	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
smooth	1
the	1
thing	1
over,	1
some	1
conceit	1
prevents	1
your	1
apologizing,	1
and	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
public.	1
You	1
are	1
offended	1
at	1
being	1
put	1
on	1
duty	1
a	1
bit,	1
but	1
why	1
not	1
apologize	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
and	1
honorable	1
officer?	1
Whatever	1
Bogdanich	1
may	1
be,	1
anyway	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
honorable	1
and	1
brave	1
old	1
colonel!	1
You're	1
quick	1
at	1
taking	1
offense,	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
mind	1
disgracing	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment!"	1
The	1
staff	1
captain's	1
voice	1
began	1
to	1
tremble.	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
next	1
to	1
no	1
time,	1
my	1
lad,	1
you're	1
here	1
today	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
you'll	1
be	1
appointed	1
adjutant	1
somewhere	1
and	1
can	1
snap	1
your	1
fingers	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
'There	1
are	1
thieves	1
among	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
officers!'	1
But	1
it's	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
us!	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
right,	1
Denisov?	1
It's	1
not	1
the	1
same!"	1
	1
Denisov	1
remained	1
silent	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
move,	1
but	1
occasionally	1
looked	1
with	1
his	1
glittering	1
black	1
eyes	1
at	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"You	1
value	1
your	1
own	1
pride	1
and	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
apologize,"	1
continued	1
the	1
staff	1
captain,	1
"but	1
we	1
old	1
fellows,	1
who	1
have	1
grown	1
up	1
in	1
and,	1
God	1
willing,	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
we	1
prize	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
Bogdanich	1
knows	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
we	1
do	1
prize	1
it,	1
old	1
fellow!	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
right,	1
it's	1
not	1
right!	1
You	1
may	1
take	1
offense	1
or	1
not	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
stick	1
to	1
mother	1
truth.	1
It's	1
not	1
right!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
rose	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
Rostov.	1
	1
	1
"That's	1
twue,	1
devil	1
take	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
jumping	1
up.	1
"Now	1
then,	1
Wostov,	1
now	1
then!"	1
	1
Rostov,	1
growing	1
red	1
and	1
pale	1
alternately,	1
looked	1
first	1
at	1
one	1
officer	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"No,	1
gentlemen,	1
no...	1
you	1
mustn't	1
think...	1
I	1
quite	1
understand.	1
You're	1
wrong	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
of	1
me...	1
I...	1
for	1
me...	1
for	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
I'd...	1
Ah	1
well,	1
I'll	1
show	1
that	1
in	1
action,	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
flag...	1
Well,	1
never	1
mind,	1
it's	1
true	1
I'm	1
to	1
blame,	1
to	1
blame	1
all	1
round.	1
Well,	1
what	1
else	1
do	1
you	1
want?..."	1
	1
"Come,	1
that's	1
right,	1
Count!"	1
cried	1
the	1
staff	1
captain,	1
turning	1
round	1
and	1
clapping	1
Rostov	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
with	1
his	1
big	1
hand.	1
	1
"I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
"he's	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow."	1
	1
"That's	1
better,	1
Count,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
captain,	1
beginning	1
to	1
address	1
Rostov	1
by	1
his	1
title,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
recognition	1
of	1
his	1
confession.	1
"Go	1
and	1
apologize,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
Yes,	1
go!"	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
I'll	1
do	1
anything.	1
No	1
one	1
shall	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
me,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
in	1
an	1
imploring	1
voice,	1
"but	1
I	1
can't	1
apologize,	1
by	1
God	1
I	1
can't,	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
will!	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
apologize	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
boy	1
asking	1
forgiveness?"	1
	1
Denisov	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
	1
"It'll	1
be	1
worse	1
for	1
you.	1
Bogdanich	1
is	1
vindictive	1
and	1
you'll	1
pay	1
for	1
your	1
obstinacy,"	1
said	1
Kirsten.	1
	1
"No,	1
on	1
my	1
word	1
it's	1
not	1
obstinacy!	1
I	1
can't	1
describe	1
the	1
feeling.	1
I	1
can't..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
it's	1
as	1
you	1
like,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
captain.	1
"And	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
that	1
scoundrel?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
weported	1
himself	1
sick,	1
he's	1
to	1
be	1
stwuck	1
off	1
the	1
list	1
tomowwow,"	1
muttered	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
an	1
illness,	1
there's	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
of	1
explaining	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
captain.	1
	1
"Illness	1
or	1
not,	1
he'd	1
better	1
not	1
cwoss	1
my	1
path.	1
I'd	1
kill	1
him!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov	1
in	1
a	1
bloodthirsty	1
tone.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
Zherkov	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"What	1
brings	1
you	1
here?"	1
cried	1
the	1
officers	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
newcomer.	1
	1
"We're	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
action,	1
gentlemen!	1
Mack	1
has	1
surrendered	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
army."	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
true!"	1
	1
"I've	1
seen	1
him	1
myself!"	1
	1
"What?	1
Saw	1
the	1
real	1
Mack?	1
With	1
hands	1
and	1
feet?"	1
	1
"Into	1
action!	1
Into	1
action!	1
Bring	1
him	1
a	1
bottle	1
for	1
such	1
news!	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
here?"	1
	1
"I've	1
been	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
all	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
that	1
devil,	1
Mack.	1
An	1
Austrian	1
general	1
complained	1
of	1
me.	1
I	1
congratulated	1
him	1
on	1
Mack's	1
arrival...	1
What's	1
the	1
matter,	1
Rostov?	1
You	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you'd	1
just	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hot	1
bath."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
we're	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
stew	1
here	1
these	1
last	1
two	1
days."	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
adjutant	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
confirmed	1
the	1
news	1
brought	1
by	1
Zherkov.	1
They	1
were	1
under	1
orders	1
to	1
advance	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
"We're	1
going	1
into	1
action,	1
gentlemen!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
thank	1
God!	1
We've	1
been	1
sitting	1
here	1
too	1
long!"	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
fell	1
back	1
toward	1
Vienna,	1
destroying	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
bridges	1
over	1
the	1
rivers	1
Inn	1
(at	1
Braunau)	1
and	1
Traun	1
(near	1
Linz).	1
On	1
October	1
23	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
were	1
crossing	1
the	1
river	1
Enns.	1
At	1
midday	1
the	1
Russian	1
baggage	1
train,	1
the	1
artillery,	1
and	1
columns	1
of	1
troops	1
were	1
defiling	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Enns	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
warm,	1
rainy,	1
autumnal	1
day.	1
The	1
wide	1
expanse	1
that	1
opened	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
heights	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
batteries	1
stood	1
guarding	1
the	1
bridge	1
was	1
at	1
times	1
veiled	1
by	1
a	1
diaphanous	1
curtain	1
of	1
slanting	1
rain,	1
and	1
then,	1
suddenly	1
spread	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight,	1
far-distant	1
objects	1
could	1
be	1
clearly	1
seen	1
glittering	1
as	1
though	1
freshly	1
varnished.	1
Down	1
below,	1
the	1
little	1
town	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
with	1
its	1
white,	1
red-roofed	1
houses,	1
its	1
cathedral,	1
and	1
its	1
bridge,	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
which	1
streamed	1
jostling	1
masses	1
of	1
Russian	1
troops.	1
At	1
the	1
bend	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
vessels,	1
an	1
island,	1
and	1
a	1
castle	1
with	1
a	1
park	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
confluence	1
of	1
the	1
Enns	1
and	1
the	1
Danube	1
became	1
visible,	1
and	1
the	1
rocky	1
left	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Danube	1
covered	1
with	1
pine	1
forests,	1
with	1
a	1
mystic	1
background	1
of	1
green	1
treetops	1
and	1
bluish	1
gorges.	1
The	1
turrets	1
of	1
a	1
convent	1
stood	1
out	1
beyond	1
a	1
wild	1
virgin	1
pine	1
forest,	1
and	1
far	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Enns	1
the	1
enemy's	1
horse	1
patrols	1
could	1
be	1
discerned.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
field	1
guns	1
on	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
rearguard	1
stood	1
with	1
a	1
staff	1
officer,	1
scanning	1
the	1
country	1
through	1
his	1
fieldglass.	1
A	1
little	1
behind	1
them	1
Nesvitski,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
rearguard	1
by	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
a	1
gun	1
carriage.	1
A	1
Cossack	1
who	1
accompanied	1
him	1
had	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
knapsack	1
and	1
a	1
flask,	1
and	1
Nesvitski	1
was	1
treating	1
some	1
officers	1
to	1
pies	1
and	1
real	1
doppelkummel.	1
The	1
officers	1
gladly	1
gathered	1
round	1
him,	1
some	1
on	1
their	1
knees,	1
some	1
squatting	1
Turkish	1
fashion	1
on	1
the	1
wet	1
grass.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
Austrian	1
prince	1
who	1
built	1
that	1
castle	1
was	1
no	1
fool.	1
It's	1
a	1
fine	1
place!	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
eating	1
anything,	1
gentlemen?"	1
Nesvitski	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you	1
very	1
much,	1
Prince,"	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
staff	1
officer	1
of	1
such	1
importance.	1
"It's	1
a	1
lovely	1
place!	1
We	1
passed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
park	1
and	1
saw	1
two	1
deer...	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
splendid	1
house!"	1
	1
"Look,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
another,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
dearly	1
liked	1
to	1
take	1
another	1
pie	1
but	1
felt	1
shy,	1
and	1
therefore	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
examining	1
the	1
countryside--"See,	1
our	1
infantrymen	1
have	1
already	1
got	1
there.	1
Look	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
meadow	1
behind	1
the	1
village,	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
dragging	1
something.	1
They'll	1
ransack	1
that	1
castle,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
with	1
evident	1
approval.	1
	1
"So	1
they	1
will,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski.	1
"No,	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
like,"	1
added	1
he,	1
munching	1
a	1
pie	1
in	1
his	1
moist-lipped	1
handsome	1
mouth,	1
"would	1
be	1
to	1
slip	1
in	1
over	1
there."	1
	1
He	1
pointed	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
a	1
turreted	1
nunnery,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
narrowed	1
and	1
gleamed.	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
fine,	1
gentlemen!"	1
	1
The	1
officers	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Just	1
to	1
flutter	1
the	1
nuns	1
a	1
bit.	1
They	1
say	1
there	1
are	1
Italian	1
girls	1
among	1
them.	1
On	1
my	1
word	1
I'd	1
give	1
five	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
it!"	1
	1
"They	1
must	1
be	1
feeling	1
dull,	1
too,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bolder	1
officers,	1
laughing.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
standing	1
in	1
front	1
pointed	1
out	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
general,	1
who	1
looked	1
through	1
his	1
field	1
glass.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
so	1
it	1
is,	1
so	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
general	1
angrily,	1
lowering	1
the	1
field	1
glass	1
and	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
"so	1
it	1
is!	1
They'll	1
be	1
fired	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
crossing.	1
And	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
dawdling	1
there?"	1
	1
On	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
the	1
enemy	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
naked	1
eye,	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
battery	1
a	1
milk-white	1
cloud	1
arose.	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
distant	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
shot,	1
and	1
our	1
troops	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
hurrying	1
to	1
the	1
crossing.	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
rose,	1
puffing,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
general,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"Would	1
not	1
your	1
excellency	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
refreshment?"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
bad	1
business,"	1
said	1
the	1
general	1
without	1
answering	1
him,	1
"our	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
wasting	1
time."	1
	1
"Hadn't	1
I	1
better	1
ride	1
over,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
asked	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
please	1
do,"	1
answered	1
the	1
general,	1
and	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
order	1
that	1
had	1
already	1
once	1
been	1
given	1
in	1
detail:	1
"and	1
tell	1
the	1
hussars	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
cross	1
last	1
and	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
as	1
I	1
ordered;	1
and	1
the	1
inflammable	1
material	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
must	1
be	1
reinspected."	1
	1
"Very	1
good,"	1
answered	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
He	1
called	1
the	1
Cossack	1
with	1
his	1
horse,	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
knapsack	1
and	1
flask,	1
and	1
swung	1
his	1
heavy	1
person	1
easily	1
into	1
the	1
saddle.	1
	1
"I'll	1
really	1
call	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
nuns,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
who	1
watched	1
him	1
smilingly,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
winding	1
path	1
down	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
let's	1
see	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
will	1
carry,	1
Captain.	1
Just	1
try!"	1
said	1
the	1
general,	1
turning	1
to	1
an	1
artillery	1
officer.	1
"Have	1
a	1
little	1
fun	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
time."	1
	1
"Crew,	1
to	1
your	1
guns!"	1
commanded	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
men	1
came	1
running	1
gaily	1
from	1
their	1
campfires	1
and	1
began	1
loading.	1
	1
"One!"	1
came	1
the	1
command.	1
	1
Number	1
one	1
jumped	1
briskly	1
aside.	1
The	1
gun	1
rang	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
deafening	1
metallic	1
roar,	1
and	1
a	1
whistling	1
grenade	1
flew	1
above	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
below	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
fell	1
far	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
a	1
little	1
smoke	1
showing	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
it	1
burst.	1
	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
brightened	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sound.	1
Everyone	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
watching	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
below,	1
as	1
plainly	1
visible	1
as	1
if	1
but	1
a	1
stone's	1
throw	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
enemy	1
farther	1
off.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
sun	1
came	1
fully	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
clouds,	1
and	1
the	1
clear	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
solitary	1
shot	1
and	1
the	1
brilliance	1
of	1
the	1
bright	1
sunshine	1
merged	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
joyous	1
and	1
spirited	1
impression.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
shots	1
had	1
already	1
flown	1
across	1
the	1
bridge,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
crush.	1
Halfway	1
across	1
stood	1
Prince	1
Nesvitski,	1
who	1
had	1
alighted	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
whose	1
big	1
body	1
was	1
jammed	1
against	1
the	1
railings.	1
He	1
looked	1
back	1
laughing	1
to	1
the	1
Cossack	1
who	1
stood	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
behind	1
him	1
holding	1
two	1
horses	1
by	1
their	1
bridles.	1
Each	1
time	1
Prince	1
Nesvitski	1
tried	1
to	1
move	1
on,	1
soldiers	1
and	1
carts	1
pushed	1
him	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
pressed	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
railings,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
smile.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
you	1
are,	1
friend!"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack	1
to	1
a	1
convoy	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
wagon,	1
who	1
was	1
pressing	1
onto	1
the	1
infantrymen	1
who	1
were	1
crowded	1
together	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
wheels	1
and	1
his	1
horses.	1
"What	1
a	1
fellow!	1
You	1
can't	1
wait	1
a	1
moment!	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
general	1
wants	1
to	1
pass?"	1
	1
But	1
the	1
convoyman	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
"general"	1
and	1
shouted	1
at	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
blocking	1
his	1
way.	1
"Hi	1
there,	1
boys!	1
Keep	1
to	1
the	1
left!	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit."	1
But	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
crowded	1
together	1
shoulder	1
to	1
shoulder,	1
their	1
bayonets	1
interlocking,	1
moved	1
over	1
the	1
bridge	1
in	1
a	1
dense	1
mass.	1
Looking	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
rails	1
Prince	1
Nesvitski	1
saw	1
the	1
rapid,	1
noisy	1
little	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
Enns,	1
which	1
rippling	1
and	1
eddying	1
round	1
the	1
piles	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
chased	1
each	1
other	1
along.	1
Looking	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
he	1
saw	1
equally	1
uniform	1
living	1
waves	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
shoulder	1
straps,	1
covered	1
shakos,	1
knapsacks,	1
bayonets,	1
long	1
muskets,	1
and,	1
under	1
the	1
shakos,	1
faces	1
with	1
broad	1
cheekbones,	1
sunken	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
listless	1
tired	1
expressions,	1
and	1
feet	1
that	1
moved	1
through	1
the	1
sticky	1
mud	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Sometimes	1
through	1
the	1
monotonous	1
waves	1
of	1
men,	1
like	1
a	1
fleck	1
of	1
white	1
foam	1
on	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
Enns,	1
an	1
officer,	1
in	1
a	1
cloak	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
face	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
men,	1
squeezed	1
his	1
way	1
along;	1
sometimes	1
like	1
a	1
chip	1
of	1
wood	1
whirling	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
an	1
hussar	1
on	1
foot,	1
an	1
orderly,	1
or	1
a	1
townsman	1
was	1
carried	1
through	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
infantry;	1
and	1
sometimes	1
like	1
a	1
log	1
floating	1
down	1
the	1
river,	1
an	1
officers'	1
or	1
company's	1
baggage	1
wagon,	1
piled	1
high,	1
leather	1
covered,	1
and	1
hemmed	1
in	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
moved	1
across	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
"It's	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
dam	1
had	1
burst,"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack	1
hopelessly.	1
"Are	1
there	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come?"	1
	1
"A	1
million	1
all	1
but	1
one!"	1
replied	1
a	1
waggish	1
soldier	1
in	1
a	1
torn	1
coat,	1
with	1
a	1
wink,	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
followed	1
by	1
another,	1
an	1
old	1
man.	1
	1
"If	1
he"	1
(he	1
meant	1
the	1
enemy)	1
"begins	1
popping	1
at	1
the	1
bridge	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
soldier	1
dismally	1
to	1
a	1
comrade,	1
"you'll	1
forget	1
to	1
scratch	1
yourself."	1
	1
That	1
soldier	1
passed	1
on,	1
and	1
after	1
him	1
came	1
another	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
cart.	1
	1
"Where	1
the	1
devil	1
have	1
the	1
leg	1
bands	1
been	1
shoved	1
to?"	1
said	1
an	1
orderly,	1
running	1
behind	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
fumbling	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
passed	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
wagon.	1
Then	1
came	1
some	1
merry	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
drinking.	1
	1
"And	1
then,	1
old	1
fellow,	1
he	1
gives	1
him	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
with	1
the	1
butt	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
gun..."	1
a	1
soldier	1
whose	1
greatcoat	1
was	1
well	1
tucked	1
up	1
said	1
gaily,	1
with	1
a	1
wide	1
swing	1
of	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
ham	1
was	1
just	1
delicious..."	1
answered	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
laugh.	1
And	1
they,	1
too,	1
passed	1
on,	1
so	1
that	1
Nesvitski	1
did	1
not	1
learn	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
on	1
the	1
teeth,	1
or	1
what	1
the	1
ham	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
"Bah!	1
How	1
they	1
scurry.	1
He	1
just	1
sends	1
a	1
ball	1
and	1
they	1
think	1
they'll	1
all	1
be	1
killed,"	1
a	1
sergeant	1
was	1
saying	1
angrily	1
and	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"As	1
it	1
flies	1
past	1
me,	1
Daddy,	1
the	1
ball	1
I	1
mean,"	1
said	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
with	1
an	1
enormous	1
mouth,	1
hardly	1
refraining	1
from	1
laughing,	1
"I	1
felt	1
like	1
dying	1
of	1
fright.	1
I	1
did,	1
'pon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
got	1
that	1
frightened!"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
if	1
bragging	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
frightened.	1
	1
That	1
one	1
also	1
passed.	1
Then	1
followed	1
a	1
cart	1
unlike	1
any	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
before.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
German	1
cart	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
horses	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
German,	1
and	1
seemed	1
loaded	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
houseful	1
of	1
effects.	1
A	1
fine	1
brindled	1
cow	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
udder	1
was	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
cart	1
behind.	1
A	1
woman	1
with	1
an	1
unweaned	1
baby,	1
an	1
old	1
woman,	1
and	1
a	1
healthy	1
German	1
girl	1
with	1
bright	1
red	1
cheeks	1
were	1
sitting	1
on	1
some	1
feather	1
beds.	1
Evidently	1
these	1
fugitives	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
special	1
permission.	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
soldiers	1
turned	1
toward	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
vehicle	1
was	1
passing	1
at	1
foot	1
pace	1
all	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
remarks	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
ones.	1
Every	1
face	1
bore	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
smile,	1
expressing	1
unseemly	1
thoughts	1
about	1
the	1
women.	1
	1
"Just	1
see,	1
the	1
German	1
sausage	1
is	1
making	1
tracks,	1
too!"	1
	1
"Sell	1
me	1
the	1
missis,"	1
said	1
another	1
soldier,	1
addressing	1
the	1
German,	1
who,	1
angry	1
and	1
frightened,	1
strode	1
energetically	1
along	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes.	1
	1
"See	1
how	1
smart	1
she's	1
made	1
herself!	1
Oh,	1
the	1
devils!"	1
	1
"There,	1
Fedotov,	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
quartered	1
on	1
them!"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
as	1
much	1
before	1
now,	1
mate!"	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
asked	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer	1
who	1
was	1
eating	1
an	1
apple,	1
also	1
half	1
smiling	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
handsome	1
girl.	1
	1
The	1
German	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
signifying	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
"Take	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
like,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
giving	1
the	1
girl	1
an	1
apple.	1
	1
The	1
girl	1
smiled	1
and	1
took	1
it.	1
Nesvitski	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
women	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
passed.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
by,	1
the	1
same	1
stream	1
of	1
soldiers	1
followed,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
talk,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
all	1
stopped.	1
As	1
often	1
happens,	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
a	1
convoy	1
wagon	1
became	1
restive	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd	1
had	1
to	1
wait.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
stopping?	1
There's	1
no	1
proper	1
order!"	1
said	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
shoving	1
to?	1
Devil	1
take	1
you!	1
Can't	1
you	1
wait?	1
It'll	1
be	1
worse	1
if	1
he	1
fires	1
the	1
bridge.	1
See,	1
here's	1
an	1
officer	1
jammed	1
in	1
too"--	1
different	1
voices	1
were	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
crowd,	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
all	1
pressed	1
toward	1
the	1
exit	1
from	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
Looking	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Enns	1
under	1
the	1
bridge,	1
Nesvitski	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
a	1
sound	1
new	1
to	1
him,	1
of	1
something	1
swiftly	1
approaching...	1
something	1
big,	1
that	1
splashed	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
"Just	1
see	1
where	1
it	1
carries	1
to!"	1
a	1
soldier	1
near	1
by	1
said	1
sternly,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
sound.	1
	1
"Encouraging	1
us	1
to	1
get	1
along	1
quicker,"	1
said	1
another	1
uneasily.	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
moved	1
on	1
again.	1
Nesvitski	1
realized	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball.	1
	1
"Hey,	1
Cossack,	1
my	1
horse!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Now,	1
then,	1
you	1
there!	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way!	1
Make	1
way!"	1
	1
With	1
great	1
difficulty	1
he	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
shouting	1
continually	1
he	1
moved	1
on.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
squeezed	1
themselves	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
him,	1
but	1
again	1
pressed	1
on	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
jammed	1
his	1
leg,	1
and	1
those	1
nearest	1
him	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
themselves	1
pressed	1
still	1
harder	1
from	1
behind.	1
	1
"Nesvitski,	1
Nesvitski!	1
you	1
numskull!"	1
came	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
from	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
saw,	1
some	1
fifteen	1
paces	1
away	1
but	1
separated	1
by	1
the	1
living	1
mass	1
of	1
moving	1
infantry,	1
Vaska	1
Denisov,	1
red	1
and	1
shaggy,	1
with	1
his	1
cap	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
black	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
cloak	1
hanging	1
jauntily	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"Tell	1
these	1
devils,	1
these	1
fiends,	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
pass!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov	1
evidently	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
rage,	1
his	1
coal-black	1
eyes	1
with	1
their	1
bloodshot	1
whites	1
glittering	1
and	1
rolling	1
as	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
sheathed	1
saber	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
bare	1
hand	1
as	1
red	1
as	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Vaska!"	1
joyfully	1
replied	1
Nesvitski.	1
"What's	1
up	1
with	1
you?"	1
	1
"The	1
squadwon	1
can't	1
pass,"	1
shouted	1
Vaska	1
Denisov,	1
showing	1
his	1
white	1
teeth	1
fiercely	1
and	1
spurring	1
his	1
black	1
thoroughbred	1
Arab,	1
which	1
twitched	1
its	1
ears	1
as	1
the	1
bayonets	1
touched	1
it,	1
and	1
snorted,	1
spurting	1
white	1
foam	1
from	1
his	1
bit,	1
tramping	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
with	1
his	1
hoofs,	1
and	1
apparently	1
ready	1
to	1
jump	1
over	1
the	1
railings	1
had	1
his	1
rider	1
let	1
him.	1
"What	1
is	1
this?	1
They're	1
like	1
sheep!	1
Just	1
like	1
sheep!	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
way!...	1
Let	1
us	1
pass!...	1
Stop	1
there,	1
you	1
devil	1
with	1
the	1
cart!	1
I'll	1
hack	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
saber!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
actually	1
drawing	1
his	1
saber	1
from	1
its	1
scabbard	1
and	1
flourishing	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
crowded	1
against	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
terrified	1
faces,	1
and	1
Denisov	1
joined	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"How's	1
it	1
you're	1
not	1
drunk	1
today?"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
when	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
ridden	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"They	1
don't	1
even	1
give	1
one	1
time	1
to	1
dwink!"	1
answered	1
Vaska	1
Denisov.	1
"They	1
keep	1
dwagging	1
the	1
wegiment	1
to	1
and	1
fwo	1
all	1
day.	1
If	1
they	1
mean	1
to	1
fight,	1
let's	1
fight.	1
But	1
the	1
devil	1
knows	1
what	1
this	1
is."	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
dandy	1
you	1
are	1
today!"	1
said	1
Nesvitski,	1
looking	1
at	1
Denisov's	1
new	1
cloak	1
and	1
saddlecloth.	1
	1
Denisov	1
smiled,	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sabretache	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
that	1
diffused	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
perfume,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
Nesvitski's	1
nose.	1
	1
"Of	1
course.	1
I'm	1
going	1
into	1
action!	1
I've	1
shaved,	1
bwushed	1
my	1
teeth,	1
and	1
scented	1
myself."	1
	1
The	1
imposing	1
figure	1
of	1
Nesvitski	1
followed	1
by	1
his	1
Cossack,	1
and	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
Denisov	1
who	1
flourished	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
shouted	1
frantically,	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
effect	1
that	1
they	1
managed	1
to	1
squeeze	1
through	1
to	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
stopped	1
the	1
infantry.	1
Beside	1
the	1
bridge	1
Nesvitski	1
found	1
the	1
colonel	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
deliver	1
the	1
order,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
this	1
he	1
rode	1
back.	1
	1
Having	1
cleared	1
the	1
way	1
Denisov	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Carelessly	1
holding	1
in	1
his	1
stallion	1
that	1
was	1
neighing	1
and	1
pawing	1
the	1
ground,	1
eager	1
to	1
rejoin	1
its	1
fellows,	1
he	1
watched	1
his	1
squadron	1
draw	1
nearer.	1
Then	1
the	1
clang	1
of	1
hoofs,	1
as	1
of	1
several	1
horses	1
galloping,	1
resounded	1
on	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
the	1
squadron,	1
officers	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
men	1
four	1
abreast,	1
spread	1
across	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
emerge	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
infantry	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
stopped	1
crowded	1
near	1
the	1
bridge	1
in	1
the	1
trampled	1
mud	1
and	1
gazed	1
with	1
that	1
particular	1
feeling	1
of	1
ill-will,	1
estrangement,	1
and	1
ridicule	1
with	1
which	1
troops	1
of	1
different	1
arms	1
usually	1
encounter	1
one	1
another	1
at	1
the	1
clean,	1
smart	1
hussars	1
who	1
moved	1
past	1
them	1
in	1
regular	1
order.	1
	1
"Smart	1
lads!	1
Only	1
fit	1
for	1
a	1
fair!"	1
said	1
one.	1
	1
"What	1
good	1
are	1
they?	1
They're	1
led	1
about	1
just	1
for	1
show!"	1
remarked	1
another.	1
	1
"Don't	1
kick	1
up	1
the	1
dust,	1
you	1
infantry!"	1
jested	1
an	1
hussar	1
whose	1
prancing	1
horse	1
had	1
splashed	1
mud	1
over	1
some	1
foot	1
soldiers.	1
	1
"I'd	1
like	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
on	1
a	1
two	1
days'	1
march	1
with	1
a	1
knapsack!	1
Your	1
fine	1
cords	1
would	1
soon	1
get	1
a	1
bit	1
rubbed,"	1
said	1
an	1
infantryman,	1
wiping	1
the	1
mud	1
off	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
sleeve.	1
"Perched	1
up	1
there,	1
you're	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
than	1
a	1
man."	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
Zikin,	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
on	1
a	1
horse.	1
You'd	1
look	1
fine,"	1
said	1
a	1
corporal,	1
chaffing	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
soldier	1
who	1
bent	1
under	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
knapsack.	1
	1
"Take	1
a	1
stick	1
between	1
your	1
legs,	1
that'll	1
suit	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
horse!"	1
the	1
hussar	1
shouted	1
back.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
hurriedly	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge,	1
squeezing	1
together	1
as	1
they	1
approached	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
passing	1
through	1
a	1
funnel.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
baggage	1
wagons	1
had	1
all	1
crossed,	1
the	1
crush	1
was	1
less,	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
battalion	1
came	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Only	1
Denisov's	1
squadron	1
of	1
hussars	1
remained	1
on	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
facing	1
the	1
enemy,	1
who	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
bank	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
visible	1
from	1
the	1
bridge,	1
for	1
the	1
horizon	1
as	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
valley	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
river	1
flowed	1
was	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
rising	1
ground	1
only	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
away.	1
At	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
lay	1
wasteland	1
over	1
which	1
a	1
few	1
groups	1
of	1
our	1
Cossack	1
scouts	1
were	1
moving.	1
Suddenly	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
ground,	1
artillery	1
and	1
troops	1
in	1
blue	1
uniform	1
were	1
seen.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
French.	1
A	1
group	1
of	1
Cossack	1
scouts	1
retired	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
a	1
trot.	1
All	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
squadron,	1
though	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
and	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
other	1
directions,	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
hilltop,	1
and	1
kept	1
constantly	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
patches	1
appearing	1
on	1
the	1
skyline,	1
which	1
they	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
enemy's	1
troops.	1
The	1
weather	1
had	1
cleared	1
again	1
since	1
noon	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
descending	1
brightly	1
upon	1
the	1
Danube	1
and	1
the	1
dark	1
hills	1
around	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
calm,	1
and	1
at	1
intervals	1
the	1
bugle	1
calls	1
and	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
hill.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
now	1
between	1
the	1
squadron	1
and	1
the	1
enemy	1
except	1
a	1
few	1
scattered	1
skirmishers.	1
An	1
empty	1
space	1
of	1
some	1
seven	1
hundred	1
yards	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
separated	1
them.	1
The	1
enemy	1
ceased	1
firing,	1
and	1
that	1
stern,	1
threatening,	1
inaccessible,	1
and	1
intangible	1
line	1
which	1
separates	1
two	1
hostile	1
armies	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
clearly	1
felt.	1
	1
"One	1
step	1
beyond	1
that	1
boundary	1
line	1
which	1
resembles	1
the	1
line	1
dividing	1
the	1
living	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
lies	1
uncertainty,	1
suffering,	1
and	1
death.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
there?	1
Who	1
is	1
there?--there	1
beyond	1
that	1
field,	1
that	1
tree,	1
that	1
roof	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
sun?	1
No	1
one	1
knows,	1
but	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
know.	1
You	1
fear	1
and	1
yet	1
long	1
to	1
cross	1
that	1
line,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
crossed	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
is	1
there,	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
inevitably	1
have	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
lies	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
death.	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
strong,	1
healthy,	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
excited,	1
and	1
are	1
surrounded	1
by	1
other	1
such	1
excitedly	1
animated	1
and	1
healthy	1
men."	1
So	1
thinks,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
feels,	1
anyone	1
who	1
comes	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
that	1
feeling	1
gives	1
a	1
particular	1
glamour	1
and	1
glad	1
keenness	1
of	1
impression	1
to	1
everything	1
that	1
takes	1
place	1
at	1
such	1
moments.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
high	1
ground	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
was,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
cannon	1
rose,	1
and	1
a	1
ball	1
flew	1
whistling	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
hussar	1
squadron.	1
The	1
officers	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
together	1
rode	1
off	1
to	1
their	1
places.	1
The	1
hussars	1
began	1
carefully	1
aligning	1
their	1
horses.	1
Silence	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
squadron.	1
All	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
enemy	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
awaiting	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command.	1
A	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
cannon	1
ball	1
flew	1
past.	1
Evidently	1
they	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
hussars,	1
but	1
the	1
balls	1
with	1
rapid	1
rhythmic	1
whistle	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
and	1
fell	1
somewhere	1
beyond	1
them.	1
The	1
hussars	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
each	1
shot,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
the	1
whole	1
squadron	1
with	1
its	1
rows	1
of	1
faces	1
so	1
alike	1
yet	1
so	1
different,	1
holding	1
its	1
breath	1
while	1
the	1
ball	1
flew	1
past,	1
rose	1
in	1
the	1
stirrups	1
and	1
sank	1
back	1
again.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
without	1
turning	1
their	1
heads	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
curious	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
comrades'	1
impression.	1
Every	1
face,	1
from	1
Denisov's	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
bugler,	1
showed	1
one	1
common	1
expression	1
of	1
conflict,	1
irritation,	1
and	1
excitement,	1
around	1
chin	1
and	1
mouth.	1
The	1
quartermaster	1
frowned,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
soldiers	1
as	1
if	1
threatening	1
to	1
punish	1
them.	1
Cadet	1
Mironov	1
ducked	1
every	1
time	1
a	1
ball	1
flew	1
past.	1
Rostov	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank,	1
mounted	1
on	1
his	1
Rook--a	1
handsome	1
horse	1
despite	1
its	1
game	1
leg--had	1
the	1
happy	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
called	1
up	1
before	1
a	1
large	1
audience	1
for	1
an	1
examination	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
feels	1
sure	1
he	1
will	1
distinguish	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
glancing	1
at	1
everyone	1
with	1
a	1
clear,	1
bright	1
expression,	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
notice	1
how	1
calmly	1
he	1
sat	1
under	1
fire.	1
But	1
despite	1
himself,	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
too	1
that	1
same	1
indication	1
of	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
stern	1
showed	1
round	1
the	1
mouth.	1
	1
"Who's	1
that	1
curtseying	1
there?	1
Cadet	1
Miwonov!	1
That's	1
not	1
wight!	1
Look	1
at	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Denisov	1
who,	1
unable	1
to	1
keep	1
still	1
on	1
one	1
spot,	1
kept	1
turning	1
his	1
horse	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
squadron.	1
	1
The	1
black,	1
hairy,	1
snub-nosed	1
face	1
of	1
Vaska	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
short	1
sturdy	1
figure	1
with	1
the	1
sinewy	1
hairy	1
hand	1
and	1
stumpy	1
fingers	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
naked	1
saber,	1
looked	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
usually	1
did,	1
especially	1
toward	1
evening	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
emptied	1
his	1
second	1
bottle;	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
redder	1
than	1
usual.	1
With	1
his	1
shaggy	1
head	1
thrown	1
back	1
like	1
birds	1
when	1
they	1
drink,	1
pressing	1
his	1
spurs	1
mercilessly	1
into	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
horse,	1
Bedouin,	1
and	1
sitting	1
as	1
though	1
falling	1
backwards	1
in	1
the	1
saddle,	1
he	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
squadron	1
and	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
their	1
pistols.	1
He	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Kirsten.	1
The	1
staff	1
captain	1
on	1
his	1
broad-backed,	1
steady	1
mare	1
came	1
at	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
His	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
mustache	1
was	1
serious	1
as	1
always,	1
only	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
brighter	1
than	1
usual.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
about	1
it?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
"It	1
won't	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
fight.	1
You'll	1
see--we	1
shall	1
retire."	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
they're	1
about!"	1
muttered	1
Denisov.	1
"Ah,	1
Wostov,"	1
he	1
cried	1
noticing	1
the	1
cadet's	1
bright	1
face,	1
"you've	1
got	1
it	1
at	1
last."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
smiled	1
approvingly,	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
cadet.	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
happy.	1
Just	1
then	1
the	1
commander	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Denisov	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!	1
Let	1
us	1
attack	1
them!	1
I'll	1
dwive	1
them	1
off."	1
	1
"Attack	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
a	1
bored	1
voice,	1
puckering	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
driving	1
off	1
a	1
troublesome	1
fly.	1
"And	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
stopping	1
here?	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
skirmishers	1
are	1
retreating?	1
Lead	1
the	1
squadron	1
back."	1
	1
The	1
squadron	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
drew	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
of	1
fire	1
without	1
having	1
lost	1
a	1
single	1
man.	1
The	1
second	1
squadron	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
followed	1
them	1
across	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
Cossacks	1
quitted	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
Pavlograd	1
squadrons,	1
having	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge,	1
retired	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other.	1
Their	1
colonel,	1
Karl	1
Bogdanich	1
Schubert,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Denisov's	1
squadron	1
and	1
rode	1
at	1
a	1
footpace	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
taking	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
him	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
meeting	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
their	1
encounter	1
concerning	1
Telyanin.	1
Rostov,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
toward	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
admitted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
blame,	1
did	1
not	1
lift	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
colonel's	1
athletic	1
back,	1
his	1
nape	1
covered	1
with	1
light	1
hair,	1
and	1
his	1
red	1
neck.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Rostov	1
that	1
Bogdanich	1
was	1
only	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
aim	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
cadet's	1
courage,	1
so	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
merrily;	1
then	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Bogdanich	1
rode	1
so	1
near	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
his	1
courage.	1
Next	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
his	1
enemy	1
would	1
send	1
the	1
squadron	1
on	1
a	1
desperate	1
attack	1
just	1
to	1
punish	1
him--Rostov.	1
Then	1
he	1
imagined	1
how,	1
after	1
the	1
attack,	1
Bogdanich	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
wounded	1
and	1
would	1
magnanimously	1
extend	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
reconciliation.	1
	1
The	1
high-shouldered	1
figure	1
of	1
Zherkov,	1
familiar	1
to	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
recently	1
left	1
their	1
regiment,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
colonel.	1
After	1
his	1
dismissal	1
from	1
headquarters	1
Zherkov	1
had	1
not	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
saying	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
fool	1
as	1
to	1
slave	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
more	1
rewards	1
by	1
doing	1
nothing	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
and	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
attaching	1
himself	1
as	1
an	1
orderly	1
officer	1
to	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
He	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
chief	1
with	1
an	1
order	1
from	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
rear	1
guard.	1
	1
"Colonel,"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
Rostov's	1
enemy	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
gloomy	1
gravity	1
and	1
glancing	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
comrades,	1
"there	1
is	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge."	1
	1
"An	1
order	1
to	1
who?"	1
asked	1
the	1
colonel	1
morosely.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
myself	1
know	1
'to	1
who,'"	1
replied	1
the	1
cornet	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
tone,	1
"but	1
the	1
prince	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
'go	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
colonel	1
that	1
the	1
hussars	1
must	1
return	1
quickly	1
and	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge.'"	1
	1
Zherkov	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
who	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
order.	1
After	1
him	1
the	1
stout	1
Nesvitski	1
came	1
galloping	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
Cossack	1
horse	1
that	1
could	1
scarcely	1
carry	1
his	1
weight.	1
	1
"How's	1
this,	1
Colonel?"	1
he	1
shouted	1
as	1
he	1
approached.	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
now	1
someone	1
has	1
gone	1
and	1
blundered;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
beside	1
themselves	1
over	1
there	1
and	1
one	1
can't	1
make	1
anything	1
out."	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
deliberately	1
stopped	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"You	1
spoke	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
inflammable	1
material,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
you	1
said	1
nothing	1
about	1
firing	1
it."	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
up,	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
smoothing	1
his	1
hair	1
wet	1
with	1
perspiration	1
with	1
his	1
plump	1
hand,	1
"wasn't	1
I	1
telling	1
you	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge,	1
when	1
inflammable	1
material	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
in	1
position?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
your	1
'dear	1
sir,'	1
Mr.	1
Staff	1
Officer,	1
and	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
bridge!	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
service,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
habit	1
orders	1
strictly	1
to	1
obey.	1
You	1
said	1
the	1
bridge	1
would	1
be	1
burned,	1
but	1
who	1
would	1
it	1
burn,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
spirit!"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
that's	1
always	1
the	1
way!"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
hand.	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
here?"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
same	1
business.	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
damp!	1
Let	1
me	1
wring	1
you	1
out!"	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
saying,	1
Mr.	1
Staff	1
Officer..."	1
continued	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone.	1
	1
"Colonel,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
"You	1
must	1
be	1
quick	1
or	1
the	1
enemy	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
his	1
guns	1
to	1
use	1
grapeshot."	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
looked	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
at	1
the	1
stout	1
staff	1
officer,	1
and	1
at	1
Zherkov,	1
and	1
he	1
frowned.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
the	1
bridge	1
fire,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
solemn	1
tone	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
endure	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
do	1
the	1
right	1
thing.	1
	1
Striking	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
muscular	1
legs	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
everything,	1
the	1
colonel	1
moved	1
forward	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
second	1
squadron,	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
was	1
serving	1
under	1
Denisov,	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
"There,	1
it's	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
thought,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
to	1
himself.	1
"He	1
wishes	1
to	1
test	1
me!"	1
His	1
heart	1
contracted	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face.	1
"Let	1
him	1
see	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
coward!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
Again	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
bright	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
squadron	1
the	1
serious	1
expression	1
appeared	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
worn	1
when	1
under	1
fire.	1
Rostov	1
watched	1
his	1
enemy,	1
the	1
colonel,	1
closely--to	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
conjecture,	1
but	1
the	1
colonel	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
glance	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
front,	1
solemn	1
and	1
stern.	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command.	1
	1
"Look	1
sharp!	1
Look	1
sharp!"	1
several	1
voices	1
repeated	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
Their	1
sabers	1
catching	1
in	1
the	1
bridles	1
and	1
their	1
spurs	1
jingling,	1
the	1
hussars	1
hastily	1
dismounted,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
men	1
were	1
crossing	1
themselves.	1
Rostov	1
no	1
longer	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
colonel,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time.	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
falling	1
behind	1
the	1
hussars,	1
so	1
much	1
afraid	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
stood	1
still.	1
His	1
hand	1
trembled	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
horse	1
into	1
an	1
orderly's	1
charge,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
with	1
a	1
thud.	1
Denisov	1
rode	1
past	1
him,	1
leaning	1
back	1
and	1
shouting	1
something.	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
hussars	1
running	1
all	1
around	1
him,	1
their	1
spurs	1
catching	1
and	1
their	1
sabers	1
clattering.	1
	1
"Stretchers!"	1
shouted	1
someone	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
what	1
this	1
call	1
for	1
stretchers	1
meant;	1
he	1
ran	1
on,	1
trying	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
others;	1
but	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
bridge,	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
ground,	1
he	1
came	1
on	1
some	1
sticky,	1
trodden	1
mud,	1
stumbled,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
hands.	1
The	1
others	1
outstripped	1
him.	1
	1
"At	1
boss	1
zides,	1
Captain,"	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
colonel,	1
who,	1
having	1
ridden	1
ahead,	1
had	1
pulled	1
up	1
his	1
horse	1
near	1
the	1
bridge,	1
with	1
a	1
triumphant,	1
cheerful	1
face.	1
	1
Rostov	1
wiping	1
his	1
muddy	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
breeches	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
enemy	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
run	1
on,	1
thinking	1
that	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
the	1
better.	1
But	1
Bogdanich,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
or	1
recognizing	1
Rostov,	1
shouted	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"Who's	1
that	1
running	1
on	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
bridge?	1
To	1
the	1
right!	1
Come	1
back,	1
Cadet!"	1
he	1
cried	1
angrily;	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Denisov,	1
who,	1
showing	1
off	1
his	1
courage,	1
had	1
ridden	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge:	1
	1
"Why	1
run	1
risks,	1
Captain?	1
You	1
should	1
dismount,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
every	1
bullet	1
has	1
its	1
billet,"	1
answered	1
Vaska	1
Denisov,	1
turning	1
in	1
his	1
saddle.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Nesvitski,	1
Zherkov,	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
were	1
standing	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
of	1
the	1
shots,	1
watching,	1
now	1
the	1
small	1
group	1
of	1
men	1
with	1
yellow	1
shakos,	1
dark-green	1
jackets	1
braided	1
with	1
cord,	1
and	1
blue	1
riding	1
breeches,	1
who	1
were	1
swarming	1
near	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
approaching	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
opposite	1
side--the	1
blue	1
uniforms	1
and	1
groups	1
with	1
horses,	1
easily	1
recognizable	1
as	1
artillery.	1
	1
"Will	1
they	1
burn	1
the	1
bridge	1
or	1
not?	1
Who'll	1
get	1
there	1
first?	1
Will	1
they	1
get	1
there	1
and	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
or	1
will	1
the	1
French	1
get	1
within	1
grapeshot	1
range	1
and	1
wipe	1
them	1
out?"	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
questions	1
each	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
ground	1
above	1
the	1
bridge	1
involuntarily	1
asked	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart--watching	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
the	1
hussars	1
in	1
the	1
bright	1
evening	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
blue	1
tunics	1
advancing	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
with	1
their	1
bayonets	1
and	1
guns.	1
	1
"Ugh.	1
The	1
hussars	1
will	1
get	1
it	1
hot!"	1
said	1
Nesvitski;	1
"they	1
are	1
within	1
grapeshot	1
range	1
now."	1
	1
"He	1
shouldn't	1
have	1
taken	1
so	1
many	1
men,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite.	1
	1
"True	1
enough,"	1
answered	1
Nesvitski;	1
"two	1
smart	1
fellows	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
job	1
just	1
as	1
well."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
put	1
in	1
Zherkov,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
hussars,	1
but	1
still	1
with	1
that	1
naive	1
air	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
in	1
jest	1
or	1
in	1
earnest.	1
"Ah,	1
your	1
excellency!	1
How	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
things!	1
Send	1
two	1
men?	1
And	1
who	1
then	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
Vladimir	1
medal	1
and	1
ribbon?	1
But	1
now,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
get	1
peppered,	1
the	1
squadron	1
may	1
be	1
recommended	1
for	1
honors	1
and	1
he	1
may	1
get	1
a	1
ribbon.	1
Our	1
Bogdanich	1
knows	1
how	1
things	1
are	1
done."	1
	1
"There	1
now!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
"that's	1
grapeshot."	1
	1
He	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
guns,	1
the	1
limbers	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
being	1
detached	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
removed.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
French	1
side,	1
amid	1
the	1
groups	1
with	1
cannon,	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
appeared,	1
then	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
almost	1
simultaneously,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
report	1
was	1
heard	1
a	1
fourth	1
was	1
seen.	1
Then	1
two	1
reports	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
and	1
a	1
third.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
groaned	1
Nesvitski	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
fierce	1
pain,	1
seizing	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
by	1
the	1
arm.	1
"Look!	1
A	1
man	1
has	1
fallen!	1
Fallen,	1
fallen!"	1
	1
"Two,	1
I	1
think."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
were	1
Tsar	1
I	1
would	1
never	1
go	1
to	1
war,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski,	1
turning	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
guns	1
were	1
hastily	1
reloaded.	1
The	1
infantry	1
in	1
their	1
blue	1
uniforms	1
advanced	1
toward	1
the	1
bridge	1
at	1
a	1
run.	1
Smoke	1
appeared	1
again	1
but	1
at	1
irregular	1
intervals,	1
and	1
grapeshot	1
cracked	1
and	1
rattled	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge.	1
But	1
this	1
time	1
Nesvitski	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
there,	1
as	1
a	1
dense	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
arose	1
from	1
it.	1
The	1
hussars	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
setting	1
it	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
batteries	1
were	1
now	1
firing	1
at	1
them,	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
hinder	1
them	1
but	1
because	1
the	1
guns	1
were	1
trained	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
someone	1
to	1
fire	1
at.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
fire	1
three	1
rounds	1
of	1
grapeshot	1
before	1
the	1
hussars	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
horses.	1
Two	1
were	1
misdirected	1
and	1
the	1
shot	1
went	1
too	1
high,	1
but	1
the	1
last	1
round	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
hussars	1
and	1
knocked	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
over.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
absorbed	1
by	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Bogdanich,	1
had	1
paused	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
hew	1
down	1
(as	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
imagined	1
battles	1
to	1
himself),	1
nor	1
could	1
he	1
help	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
brought	1
any	1
burning	1
straw	1
with	1
him	1
like	1
the	1
other	1
soldiers.	1
He	1
stood	1
looking	1
about	1
him,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
rattle	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
as	1
if	1
nuts	1
were	1
being	1
spilt,	1
and	1
the	1
hussar	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
fell	1
against	1
the	1
rails	1
with	1
a	1
groan.	1
Rostov	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
Again	1
someone	1
shouted,	1
"Stretchers!"	1
Four	1
men	1
seized	1
the	1
hussar	1
and	1
began	1
lifting	1
him.	1
	1
"Oooh!	1
For	1
Christ's	1
sake	1
let	1
me	1
alone!"	1
cried	1
the	1
wounded	1
man,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
was	1
lifted	1
and	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
stretcher.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
turned	1
away	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
searching	1
for	1
something,	1
gazed	1
into	1
the	1
distance,	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
at	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
sun.	1
How	1
beautiful	1
the	1
sky	1
looked;	1
how	1
blue,	1
how	1
calm,	1
and	1
how	1
deep!	1
How	1
bright	1
and	1
glorious	1
was	1
the	1
setting	1
sun!	1
With	1
what	1
soft	1
glitter	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
distant	1
Danube	1
shone.	1
And	1
fairer	1
still	1
were	1
the	1
faraway	1
blue	1
mountains	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
the	1
nunnery,	1
the	1
mysterious	1
gorges,	1
and	1
the	1
pine	1
forests	1
veiled	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
their	1
summits...	1
There	1
was	1
peace	1
and	1
happiness...	1
"I	1
should	1
wish	1
for	1
nothing	1
else,	1
nothing,	1
if	1
only	1
I	1
were	1
there,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
"In	1
myself	1
alone	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
sunshine	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
happiness;	1
but	1
here...	1
groans,	1
suffering,	1
fear,	1
and	1
this	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
hurry...	1
There--they	1
are	1
shouting	1
again,	1
and	1
again	1
are	1
all	1
running	1
back	1
somewhere,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
run	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
it,	1
death,	1
is	1
here	1
above	1
me	1
and	1
around...	1
Another	1
instant	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
again	1
see	1
the	1
sun,	1
this	1
water,	1
that	1
gorge!..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
sun	1
began	1
to	1
hide	1
behind	1
the	1
clouds,	1
and	1
other	1
stretchers	1
came	1
into	1
view	1
before	1
Rostov.	1
And	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stretchers,	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
of	1
life,	1
all	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
feeling	1
of	1
sickening	1
agitation.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord	1
God!	1
Thou	1
who	1
art	1
in	1
that	1
heaven,	1
save,	1
forgive,	1
and	1
protect	1
me!"	1
Rostov	1
whispered.	1
	1
The	1
hussars	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
held	1
their	1
horses;	1
their	1
voices	1
sounded	1
louder	1
and	1
calmer,	1
the	1
stretchers	1
disappeared	1
from	1
sight.	1
	1
"Well,	1
fwiend?	1
So	1
you've	1
smelt	1
powdah!"	1
shouted	1
Vaska	1
Denisov	1
just	1
above	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
over;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
coward--yes,	1
a	1
coward!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
sighing	1
deeply	1
he	1
took	1
Rook,	1
his	1
horse,	1
which	1
stood	1
resting	1
one	1
foot,	1
from	1
the	1
orderly	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
mount.	1
	1
"Was	1
that	1
grapeshot?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Yes	1
and	1
no	1
mistake!"	1
cried	1
Denisov.	1
"You	1
worked	1
like	1
wegular	1
bwicks	1
and	1
it's	1
nasty	1
work!	1
An	1
attack's	1
pleasant	1
work!	1
Hacking	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
dogs!	1
But	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
devil,	1
with	1
them	1
shooting	1
at	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
target."	1
	1
And	1
Denisov	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
group	1
that	1
had	1
stopped	1
near	1
Rostov,	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
colonel,	1
Nesvitski,	1
Zherkov,	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
from	1
the	1
suite.	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
noticed,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
true.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
taken	1
any	1
notice,	1
for	1
everyone	1
knew	1
the	1
sensation	1
which	1
the	1
cadet	1
under	1
fire	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
had	1
experienced.	1
	1
"Here's	1
something	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
report,"	1
said	1
Zherkov.	1
"See	1
if	1
I	1
don't	1
get	1
promoted	1
to	1
a	1
sublieutenancy."	1
	1
"Inform	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
bridge	1
fired!"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
triumphantly	1
and	1
gaily.	1
	1
"And	1
if	1
he	1
asks	1
about	1
the	1
losses?"	1
	1
"A	1
trifle,"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
his	1
bass	1
voice:	1
"two	1
hussars	1
wounded,	1
and	1
one	1
knocked	1
out,"	1
he	1
added,	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
a	1
happy	1
smile,	1
and	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
phrase	1
"knocked	1
out"	1
with	1
ringing	1
distinctness.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Pursued	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Bonaparte,	1
encountering	1
a	1
population	1
that	1
was	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
it,	1
losing	1
confidence	1
in	1
its	1
allies,	1
suffering	1
from	1
shortness	1
of	1
supplies,	1
and	1
compelled	1
to	1
act	1
under	1
conditions	1
of	1
war	1
unlike	1
anything	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
foreseen,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
of	1
thirty-five	1
thousand	1
men	1
commanded	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
hurriedly	1
retreating	1
along	1
the	1
Danube,	1
stopping	1
where	1
overtaken	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
fighting	1
rearguard	1
actions	1
only	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
necessary	1
to	1
enable	1
it	1
to	1
retreat	1
without	1
losing	1
its	1
heavy	1
equipment.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
actions	1
at	1
Lambach,	1
Amstetten,	1
and	1
Melk;	1
but	1
despite	1
the	1
courage	1
and	1
endurance--acknowledged	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
enemy--with	1
which	1
the	1
Russians	1
fought,	1
the	1
only	1
consequence	1
of	1
these	1
actions	1
was	1
a	1
yet	1
more	1
rapid	1
retreat.	1
Austrian	1
troops	1
that	1
had	1
escaped	1
capture	1
at	1
Ulm	1
and	1
had	1
joined	1
Kutuzov	1
at	1
Braunau	1
now	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
left	1
with	1
only	1
his	1
own	1
weak	1
and	1
exhausted	1
forces.	1
The	1
defense	1
of	1
Vienna	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of.	1
Instead	1
of	1
an	1
offensive,	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
which,	1
carefully	1
prepared	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
modern	1
science	1
of	1
strategics,	1
had	1
been	1
handed	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Vienna	1
by	1
the	1
Austrian	1
Hofkriegsrath,	1
the	1
sole	1
and	1
almost	1
unattainable	1
aim	1
remaining	1
for	1
him	1
was	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
junction	1
with	1
the	1
forces	1
that	1
were	1
advancing	1
from	1
Russia,	1
without	1
losing	1
his	1
army	1
as	1
Mack	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Ulm.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
of	1
October	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
crossed	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Danube	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
river	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
main	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
On	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
he	1
attacked	1
Mortier's	1
division,	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
bank,	1
and	1
broke	1
it	1
up.	1
In	1
this	1
action	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
trophies	1
were	1
taken:	1
banners,	1
cannon,	1
and	1
two	1
enemy	1
generals.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
after	1
a	1
fortnight's	1
retreat,	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
had	1
halted	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
fight	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
held	1
the	1
field	1
but	1
had	1
repulsed	1
the	1
French.	1
Though	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
ill-clad,	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
in	1
killed,	1
wounded,	1
sick,	1
and	1
stragglers;	1
though	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Danube	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
entrusted	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
humanity	1
of	1
the	1
enemy;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
big	1
hospitals	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
in	1
Krems	1
converted	1
into	1
military	1
hospitals	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
accommodate	1
all	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded,	1
yet	1
the	1
stand	1
made	1
at	1
Krems	1
and	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
Mortier	1
raised	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
considerably.	1
Throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
and	1
at	1
headquarters	1
most	1
joyful	1
though	1
erroneous	1
rumors	1
were	1
rife	1
of	1
the	1
imaginary	1
approach	1
of	1
columns	1
from	1
Russia,	1
of	1
some	1
victory	1
gained	1
by	1
the	1
Austrians,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
the	1
frightened	1
Bonaparte.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
during	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
the	1
Austrian	1
General	1
Schmidt,	1
who	1
was	1
killed	1
in	1
the	1
action.	1
His	1
horse	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
under	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
arm	1
slightly	1
grazed	1
by	1
a	1
bullet.	1
As	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
special	1
favor	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
this	1
victory	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
court,	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
at	1
Vienna	1
(which	1
was	1
threatened	1
by	1
the	1
French)	1
but	1
at	1
Brunn.	1
Despite	1
his	1
apparently	1
delicate	1
build	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
endure	1
physical	1
fatigue	1
far	1
better	1
than	1
many	1
very	1
muscular	1
men,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
battle,	1
having	1
arrived	1
at	1
Krems	1
excited	1
but	1
not	1
weary,	1
with	1
dispatches	1
from	1
Dokhturov	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
immediately	1
with	1
a	1
special	1
dispatch	1
to	1
Brunn.	1
To	1
be	1
so	1
sent	1
meant	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
reward	1
but	1
an	1
important	1
step	1
toward	1
promotion.	1
	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
dark	1
but	1
starry,	1
the	1
road	1
showed	1
black	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
the	1
previous	1
day--the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
Reviewing	1
his	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
recent	1
battle,	1
picturing	1
pleasantly	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
impression	1
his	1
news	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
would	1
create,	1
or	1
recalling	1
the	1
send-off	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
and	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
galloping	1
along	1
in	1
a	1
post	1
chaise	1
enjoying	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
at	1
length	1
begun	1
to	1
attain	1
a	1
long-desired	1
happiness.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
his	1
ears	1
seemed	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
victory.	1
Then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
running	1
away	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
killed,	1
but	1
he	1
quickly	1
roused	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy,	1
as	1
if	1
learning	1
afresh	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
but	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
run	1
away.	1
He	1
again	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
victory	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
calm	1
courage	1
during	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
feeling	1
reassured	1
he	1
dozed	1
off....	1
The	1
dark	1
starry	1
night	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
bright	1
cheerful	1
morning.	1
The	1
snow	1
was	1
thawing	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine,	1
the	1
horses	1
galloped	1
quickly,	1
and	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
were	1
forests	1
of	1
different	1
kinds,	1
fields,	1
and	1
villages.	1
	1
At	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
stations	1
he	1
overtook	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
Russian	1
wounded.	1
The	1
Russian	1
officer	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
transport	1
lolled	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
cart,	1
shouting	1
and	1
scolding	1
a	1
soldier	1
with	1
coarse	1
abuse.	1
In	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
German	1
carts	1
six	1
or	1
more	1
pale,	1
dirty,	1
bandaged	1
men	1
were	1
being	1
jolted	1
over	1
the	1
stony	1
road.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
talking	1
(he	1
heard	1
Russian	1
words),	1
others	1
were	1
eating	1
bread;	1
the	1
more	1
severely	1
wounded	1
looked	1
silently,	1
with	1
the	1
languid	1
interest	1
of	1
sick	1
children,	1
at	1
the	1
envoy	1
hurrying	1
past	1
them.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
told	1
his	1
driver	1
to	1
stop,	1
and	1
asked	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
what	1
action	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
wounded.	1
"Day	1
before	1
yesterday,	1
on	1
the	1
Danube,"	1
answered	1
the	1
soldier.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
soldier	1
three	1
gold	1
pieces.	1
	1
"That's	1
for	1
them	1
all,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
who	1
came	1
up.	1
	1
"Get	1
well	1
soon,	1
lads!"	1
he	1
continued,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
"There's	1
plenty	1
to	1
do	1
still."	1
	1
"What	1
news,	1
sir?"	1
asked	1
the	1
officer,	1
evidently	1
anxious	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation.	1
	1
"Good	1
news!...	1
Go	1
on!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
driver,	1
and	1
they	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
quite	1
dark	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rattled	1
over	1
the	1
paved	1
streets	1
of	1
Brunn	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
high	1
buildings,	1
the	1
lights	1
of	1
shops,	1
houses,	1
and	1
street	1
lamps,	1
fine	1
carriages,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
active	1
town	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
attractive	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
after	1
camp	1
life.	1
Despite	1
his	1
rapid	1
journey	1
and	1
sleepless	1
night,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
when	1
he	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
felt	1
even	1
more	1
vigorous	1
and	1
alert	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
Only	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
feverishly	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
followed	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
clearness	1
and	1
rapidity.	1
He	1
again	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
battle,	1
no	1
longer	1
dim,	1
but	1
definite	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
concise	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
imagined	1
himself	1
stating	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis.	1
He	1
vividly	1
imagined	1
the	1
casual	1
questions	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
answers	1
he	1
would	1
give.	1
He	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
once	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
At	1
the	1
chief	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
palace,	1
however,	1
an	1
official	1
came	1
running	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
learning	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
special	1
messenger	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
another	1
entrance.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
right	1
from	1
the	1
corridor,	1
Euer	1
Hochgeboren!	1
There	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
adjutant	1
on	1
duty,"	1
said	1
the	1
official.	1
"He	1
will	1
conduct	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War."	1
	1
The	1
adjutant	1
on	1
duty,	1
meeting	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
wait,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War.	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
he	1
returned	1
and	1
bowing	1
with	1
particular	1
courtesy	1
ushered	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
before	1
him	1
along	1
a	1
corridor	1
to	1
the	1
cabinet	1
where	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
was	1
at	1
work.	1
The	1
adjutant	1
by	1
his	1
elaborate	1
courtesy	1
appeared	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
ward	1
off	1
any	1
attempt	1
at	1
familiarity	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
messenger.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
joyous	1
feeling	1
was	1
considerably	1
weakened	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
minister's	1
room.	1
He	1
felt	1
offended,	1
and	1
without	1
his	1
noticing	1
it	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
offense	1
immediately	1
turned	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
disdain	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
uncalled	1
for.	1
His	1
fertile	1
mind	1
instantly	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
despise	1
the	1
adjutant	1
and	1
the	1
minister.	1
"Away	1
from	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
powder,	1
they	1
probably	1
think	1
it	1
easy	1
to	1
gain	1
victories!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
His	1
eyes	1
narrowed	1
disdainfully,	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
with	1
peculiarly	1
deliberate	1
steps.	1
This	1
feeling	1
of	1
disdain	1
was	1
heightened	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
minister	1
seated	1
at	1
a	1
large	1
table	1
reading	1
some	1
papers	1
and	1
making	1
pencil	1
notes	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
minutes	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
arrival.	1
A	1
wax	1
candle	1
stood	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
minister's	1
bent	1
bald	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
temples.	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps.	1
	1
"Take	1
this	1
and	1
deliver	1
it,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant,	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
still	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
special	1
messenger.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
either	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
army	1
interested	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
less	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
matters	1
he	1
was	1
concerned	1
with,	1
or	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Russian	1
special	1
messenger	1
that	1
impression.	1
"But	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
to	1
me,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
The	1
minister	1
drew	1
the	1
remaining	1
papers	1
together,	1
arranged	1
them	1
evenly,	1
and	1
then	1
raised	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
intellectual	1
and	1
distinctive	1
head,	1
but	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
the	1
firm,	1
intelligent	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
changed	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
evidently	1
deliberate	1
and	1
habitual	1
to	1
him.	1
His	1
face	1
took	1
on	1
the	1
stupid	1
artificial	1
smile	1
(which	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
attempt	1
to	1
hide	1
its	1
artificiality)	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
continually	1
receiving	1
many	1
petitioners	1
one	1
after	1
another.	1
	1
"From	1
General	1
Field	1
Marshal	1
Kutuzov?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"I	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
news?	1
There	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
encounter	1
with	1
Mortier?	1
A	1
victory?	1
It	1
was	1
high	1
time!"	1
	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
dispatch	1
which	1
was	1
addressed	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
mournful	1
expression.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
My	1
God!	1
Schmidt!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
German.	1
"What	1
a	1
calamity!	1
What	1
a	1
calamity!"	1
	1
Having	1
glanced	1
through	1
the	1
dispatch	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
evidently	1
considering	1
something.	1
	1
"Ah	1
what	1
a	1
calamity!	1
You	1
say	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
decisive?	1
But	1
Mortier	1
is	1
not	1
captured."	1
Again	1
he	1
pondered.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
brought	1
good	1
news,	1
though	1
Schmidt's	1
death	1
is	1
a	1
heavy	1
price	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
victory.	1
His	1
Majesty	1
will	1
no	1
doubt	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
but	1
not	1
today.	1
I	1
thank	1
you!	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
rest.	1
Be	1
at	1
the	1
levee	1
tomorrow	1
after	1
the	1
parade.	1
However,	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
stupid	1
smile,	1
which	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
face	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
speaking,	1
reappeared.	1
	1
"Au	1
revoir!	1
Thank	1
you	1
very	1
much.	1
His	1
Majesty	1
will	1
probably	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
he	1
added,	1
bowing	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
left	1
the	1
palace	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
happiness	1
the	1
victory	1
had	1
afforded	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
now	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
indifferent	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
and	1
the	1
polite	1
adjutant.	1
The	1
whole	1
tenor	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
instantaneously	1
changed;	1
the	1
battle	1
seemed	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
a	1
remote	1
event	1
long	1
past.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stayed	1
at	1
Brunn	1
with	1
Bilibin,	1
a	1
Russian	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
his	1
in	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
service.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
prince!	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
more	1
welcome	1
visitor,"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Franz,	1
put	1
the	1
prince's	1
things	1
in	1
my	1
bedroom,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
was	1
ushering	1
Bolkonski	1
in.	1
"So	1
you're	1
a	1
messenger	1
of	1
victory,	1
eh?	1
Splendid!	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sitting	1
here	1
ill,	1
as	1
you	1
see."	1
	1
After	1
washing	1
and	1
dressing,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
diplomat's	1
luxurious	1
study	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dinner	1
prepared	1
for	1
him.	1
Bilibin	1
settled	1
down	1
comfortably	1
beside	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
After	1
his	1
journey	1
and	1
the	1
campaign	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
cleanliness	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
refinements	1
of	1
life,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
a	1
pleasant	1
sense	1
of	1
repose	1
among	1
luxurious	1
surroundings	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
from	1
childhood.	1
Besides	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant,	1
after	1
his	1
reception	1
by	1
the	1
Austrians,	1
to	1
speak	1
if	1
not	1
in	1
Russian	1
(for	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
French)	1
at	1
least	1
with	1
a	1
Russian	1
who	1
would,	1
he	1
supposed,	1
share	1
the	1
general	1
Russian	1
antipathy	1
to	1
the	1
Austrians	1
which	1
was	1
then	1
particularly	1
strong.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
thirty-five,	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
circle	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
They	1
had	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
previously	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
but	1
had	1
become	1
more	1
intimate	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
in	1
Vienna	1
with	1
Kutuzov.	1
Just	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
gave	1
promise	1
of	1
rising	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
military	1
profession,	1
so	1
to	1
an	1
even	1
greater	1
extent	1
Bilibin	1
gave	1
promise	1
of	1
rising	1
in	1
his	1
diplomatic	1
career.	1
He	1
still	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
but	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
young	1
diplomat,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
service	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
sixteen,	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Paris	1
and	1
Copenhagen,	1
and	1
now	1
held	1
a	1
rather	1
important	1
post	1
in	1
Vienna.	1
Both	1
the	1
foreign	1
minister	1
and	1
our	1
ambassador	1
in	1
Vienna	1
knew	1
him	1
and	1
valued	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
many	1
diplomats	1
who	1
are	1
esteemed	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
certain	1
negative	1
qualities,	1
avoid	1
doing	1
certain	1
things,	1
and	1
speak	1
French.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those,	1
who,	1
liking	1
work,	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
indolence	1
would	1
sometimes	1
spend	1
a	1
whole	1
night	1
at	1
his	1
writing	1
table.	1
He	1
worked	1
well	1
whatever	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
his	1
work.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
question	1
"What	1
for?"	1
but	1
the	1
question	1
"How?"	1
that	1
interested	1
him.	1
What	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
matter	1
might	1
be	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care,	1
but	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
great	1
pleasure	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
circular,	1
memorandum,	1
or	1
report,	1
skillfully,	1
pointedly,	1
and	1
elegantly.	1
Bilibin's	1
services	1
were	1
valued	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
wrote,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
his	1
skill	1
in	1
dealing	1
and	1
conversing	1
with	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spheres.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
liked	1
conversation	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
work,	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
elegantly	1
witty.	1
In	1
society	1
he	1
always	1
awaited	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
striking	1
and	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
conversation	1
only	1
when	1
that	1
was	1
possible.	1
His	1
conversation	1
was	1
always	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
wittily	1
original,	1
finished	1
phrases	1
of	1
general	1
interest.	1
These	1
sayings	1
were	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
inner	1
laboratory	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
in	1
a	1
portable	1
form	1
as	1
if	1
intentionally,	1
so	1
that	1
insignificant	1
society	1
people	1
might	1
carry	1
them	1
from	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
drawing	1
room.	1
And,	1
in	1
fact,	1
Bilibin's	1
witticisms	1
were	1
hawked	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
Viennese	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
and	1
often	1
had	1
an	1
influence	1
on	1
matters	1
considered	1
important.	1
	1
His	1
thin,	1
worn,	1
sallow	1
face	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
deep	1
wrinkles,	1
which	1
always	1
looked	1
as	1
clean	1
and	1
well	1
washed	1
as	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
one's	1
fingers	1
after	1
a	1
Russian	1
bath.	1
The	1
movement	1
of	1
these	1
wrinkles	1
formed	1
the	1
principal	1
play	1
of	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
Now	1
his	1
forehead	1
would	1
pucker	1
into	1
deep	1
folds	1
and	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
were	1
lifted,	1
then	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
would	1
descend	1
and	1
deep	1
wrinkles	1
would	1
crease	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
His	1
small,	1
deep-set	1
eyes	1
always	1
twinkled	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
straight.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
exploits,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Bolkonski,	1
very	1
modestly	1
without	1
once	1
mentioning	1
himself,	1
described	1
the	1
engagement	1
and	1
his	1
reception	1
by	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War.	1
	1
"They	1
received	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
news	1
as	1
one	1
receives	1
a	1
dog	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
skittles,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
conclusion.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
smiled	1
and	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
disappeared.	1
	1
"Cependant,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
examining	1
his	1
nails	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
and	1
puckering	1
the	1
skin	1
above	1
his	1
left	1
eye,	1
"malgre	1
la	1
haute	1
estime	1
que	1
je	1
professe	1
pour	1
the	1
Orthodox	1
Russian	1
army,	1
j'avoue	1
que	1
votre	1
victoire	1
n'est	1
pas	1
des	1
plus	1
victorieuses."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"But	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
Orthodox	1
Russian	1
army,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
that	1
your	1
victory	1
was	1
not	1
particularly	1
victorious."	1
	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
French,	1
uttering	1
only	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
Russian	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
emphasis.	1
	1
"Come	1
now!	1
You	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
forces	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
Mortier	1
and	1
his	1
one	1
division,	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
Mortier	1
slips	1
through	1
your	1
fingers!	1
Where's	1
the	1
victory?"	1
	1
"But	1
seriously,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"we	1
can	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
say	1
without	1
boasting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
better	1
than	1
at	1
Ulm..."	1
	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
capture	1
one,	1
just	1
one,	1
marshal	1
for	1
us?"	1
	1
"Because	1
not	1
everything	1
happens	1
as	1
one	1
expects	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
smoothness	1
of	1
a	1
parade.	1
We	1
had	1
expected,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
their	1
rear	1
by	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
reached	1
it	1
by	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning?	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning,"	1
returned	1
Bilibin	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"You	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
impressing	1
on	1
Bonaparte	1
by	1
diplomatic	1
methods	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
better	1
leave	1
Genoa	1
alone?"	1
retorted	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone.	1
	1
"I	1
know,"	1
interrupted	1
Bilibin,	1
"you're	1
thinking	1
it's	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
take	1
marshals,	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
by	1
the	1
fire!	1
That	1
is	1
true,	1
but	1
still	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
capture	1
him?	1
So	1
don't	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
but	1
also	1
his	1
Most	1
August	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
King	1
Francis	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
delighted	1
by	1
your	1
victory.	1
Even	1
I,	1
a	1
poor	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
Embassy,	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
any	1
need	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
my	1
joy	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
Franz	1
a	1
thaler,	1
or	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
with	1
his	1
Liebchen	1
to	1
the	1
Prater...	1
True,	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
Prater	1
here..."	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
straight	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
suddenly	1
unwrinkled	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
now	1
my	1
turn	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
'why?'	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
said	1
Bolkonski.	1
"I	1
confess	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand:	1
perhaps	1
there	1
are	1
diplomatic	1
subtleties	1
here	1
beyond	1
my	1
feeble	1
intelligence,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
it	1
out.	1
Mack	1
loses	1
a	1
whole	1
army,	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Karl	1
give	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
make	1
blunder	1
after	1
blunder.	1
Kutuzov	1
alone	1
at	1
last	1
gains	1
a	1
real	1
victory,	1
destroying	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
invincibility	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
care	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
details."	1
	1
"That's	1
just	1
it,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
You	1
see	1
it's	1
hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
Tsar,	1
for	1
Russia,	1
for	1
the	1
Orthodox	1
Greek	1
faith!	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
beautiful,	1
but	1
what	1
do	1
we,	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
Austrian	1
court,	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
victories?	1
Bring	1
us	1
nice	1
news	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
by	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Karl	1
or	1
Ferdinand	1
(one	1
archduke's	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
another,	1
as	1
you	1
know)	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
over	1
a	1
fire	1
brigade	1
of	1
Bonaparte's,	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
another	1
story	1
and	1
we'll	1
fire	1
off	1
some	1
cannon!	1
But	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
seems	1
done	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
vex	1
us.	1
The	1
Archduke	1
Karl	1
does	1
nothing,	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
disgraces	1
himself.	1
You	1
abandon	1
Vienna,	1
give	1
up	1
its	1
defense--as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say:	1
'Heaven	1
is	1
with	1
us,	1
but	1
heaven	1
help	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
capital!'	1
The	1
one	1
general	1
whom	1
we	1
all	1
loved,	1
Schmidt,	1
you	1
expose	1
to	1
a	1
bullet,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
congratulate	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
victory!	1
Admit	1
that	1
more	1
irritating	1
news	1
than	1
yours	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
conceived.	1
It's	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
on	1
purpose,	1
on	1
purpose.	1
Besides,	1
suppose	1
you	1
did	1
gain	1
a	1
brilliant	1
victory,	1
if	1
even	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Karl	1
gained	1
a	1
victory,	1
what	1
effect	1
would	1
that	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
events?	1
It's	1
too	1
late	1
now	1
when	1
Vienna	1
is	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
army!"	1
	1
"What?	1
Occupied?	1
Vienna	1
occupied?"	1
	1
"Not	1
only	1
occupied,	1
but	1
Bonaparte	1
is	1
at	1
Schonbrunn,	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
our	1
dear	1
Count	1
Vrbna,	1
goes	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
orders."	1
	1
After	1
the	1
fatigues	1
and	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
journey,	1
his	1
reception,	1
and	1
especially	1
after	1
having	1
dined,	1
Bolkonski	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
heard.	1
	1
"Count	1
Lichtenfels	1
was	1
here	1
this	1
morning,"	1
Bilibin	1
continued,	1
"and	1
showed	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
parade	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
Vienna	1
was	1
fully	1
described:	1
Prince	1
Murat	1
et	1
tout	1
le	1
tremblement...	1
You	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
victory	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
for	1
great	1
rejoicing	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
can't	1
be	1
received	1
as	1
a	1
savior."	1
	1
"Really	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
about	1
that,	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
beginning	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
his	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
before	1
Krems	1
was	1
really	1
of	1
small	1
importance	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
such	1
events	1
as	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Austria's	1
capital.	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
Vienna	1
was	1
taken?	1
What	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
its	1
celebrated	1
bridgehead	1
and	1
Prince	1
Auersperg?	1
We	1
heard	1
reports	1
that	1
Prince	1
Auersperg	1
was	1
defending	1
Vienna?"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Prince	1
Auersperg	1
is	1
on	1
this,	1
on	1
our	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
is	1
defending	1
us--doing	1
it	1
very	1
badly,	1
I	1
think,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
is	1
defending	1
us.	1
But	1
Vienna	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
No,	1
the	1
bridge	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
taken	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
mined	1
and	1
orders	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
blow	1
it	1
up.	1
Otherwise	1
we	1
should	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Bohemia,	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
spent	1
a	1
bad	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
between	1
two	1
fires."	1
	1
"But	1
still	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
campaign	1
is	1
over,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is.	1
The	1
bigwigs	1
here	1
think	1
so	1
too,	1
but	1
they	1
daren't	1
say	1
so.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
your	1
skirmishing	1
at	1
Durrenstein,	1
or	1
gunpowder	1
at	1
all,	1
that	1
will	1
decide	1
the	1
matter,	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
devised	1
it,"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
quoting	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mots,	1
releasing	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
pausing.	1
"The	1
only	1
question	1
is	1
what	1
will	1
come	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
in	1
Berlin?	1
If	1
Prussia	1
joins	1
the	1
Allies,	1
Austria's	1
hand	1
will	1
be	1
forced	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
war.	1
If	1
not	1
it	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
settling	1
where	1
the	1
preliminaries	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Campo	1
Formio	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
up."	1
	1
"What	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
genius!"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
clenching	1
his	1
small	1
hand	1
and	1
striking	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
it,	1
"and	1
what	1
luck	1
the	1
man	1
has!"	1
	1
"Buonaparte?"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
inquiringly,	1
puckering	1
up	1
his	1
forehead	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
witty.	1
"Buonaparte?"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
accentuating	1
the	1
u:	1
"I	1
think,	1
however,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
lays	1
down	1
laws	1
for	1
Austria	1
at	1
Schonbrunn,	1
il	1
faut	1
lui	1
faire	1
grace	1
de	1
l'u!	1
*	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
adopt	1
an	1
innovation	1
and	1
call	1
him	1
simply	1
Bonaparte!"	1
	1
	1
*	1
"We	1
must	1
let	1
him	1
off	1
the	1
u!"	1
	1
"But	1
joking	1
apart,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"do	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
the	1
campaign	1
is	1
over?"	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
think.	1
Austria	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
it.	1
She	1
will	1
retaliate.	1
And	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
fooled	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
because	1
her	1
provinces	1
have	1
been	1
pillaged--they	1
say	1
the	1
Holy	1
Russian	1
army	1
loots	1
terribly--her	1
army	1
is	1
destroyed,	1
her	1
capital	1
taken,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
for	1
the	1
beaux	1
yeux	1
*	1
of	1
His	1
Sardinian	1
Majesty.	1
And	1
therefore--this	1
is	1
between	1
ourselves--I	1
instinctively	1
feel	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
being	1
deceived,	1
my	1
instinct	1
tells	1
me	1
of	1
negotiations	1
with	1
France	1
and	1
projects	1
for	1
peace,	1
a	1
secret	1
peace	1
concluded	1
separately."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Fine	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Impossible!"	1
cried	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
base."	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
live	1
we	1
shall	1
see,"	1
replied	1
Bilibin,	1
his	1
face	1
again	1
becoming	1
smooth	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
reached	1
the	1
room	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt	1
on	1
the	1
feather	1
bed	1
with	1
its	1
warmed	1
and	1
fragrant	1
pillows,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
tidings	1
was	1
far,	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
The	1
alliance	1
with	1
Prussia,	1
Austria's	1
treachery,	1
Bonaparte's	1
new	1
triumph,	1
tomorrow's	1
levee	1
and	1
parade,	1
and	1
the	1
audience	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
occupied	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
immediately	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
cannonading,	1
of	1
musketry	1
and	1
the	1
rattling	1
of	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
his	1
ears,	1
and	1
now	1
again	1
drawn	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
thin	1
line	1
the	1
musketeers	1
were	1
descending	1
the	1
hill,	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
firing,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
heart	1
palpitating	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
forward	1
beside	1
Schmidt	1
with	1
the	1
bullets	1
merrily	1
whistling	1
all	1
around,	1
and	1
he	1
experienced	1
tenfold	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
living,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
since	1
childhood.	1
	1
He	1
woke	1
up...	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
all	1
happened!"	1
he	1
said,	1
and,	1
smiling	1
happily	1
to	1
himself	1
like	1
a	1
child,	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
deep,	1
youthful	1
slumber.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
he	1
woke	1
late.	1
Recalling	1
his	1
recent	1
impressions,	1
the	1
first	1
thought	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
that	1
today	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis;	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War,	1
the	1
polite	1
Austrian	1
adjutant,	1
Bilibin,	1
and	1
last	1
night's	1
conversation.	1
Having	1
dressed	1
for	1
his	1
attendance	1
at	1
court	1
in	1
full	1
parade	1
uniform,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
worn	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
Bilibin's	1
study	1
fresh,	1
animated,	1
and	1
handsome,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
bandaged.	1
In	1
the	1
study	1
were	1
four	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
corps.	1
With	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
Kuragin,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
secretary	1
to	1
the	1
embassy,	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
already	1
acquainted.	1
Bilibin	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
assembled	1
at	1
Bilibin's	1
were	1
young,	1
wealthy,	1
gay	1
society	1
men,	1
who	1
here,	1
as	1
in	1
Vienna,	1
formed	1
a	1
special	1
set	1
which	1
Bilibin,	1
their	1
leader,	1
called	1
les	1
notres.	1
*	1
This	1
set,	1
consisting	1
almost	1
exclusively	1
of	1
diplomats,	1
evidently	1
had	1
its	1
own	1
interests	1
which	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
war	1
or	1
politics	1
but	1
related	1
to	1
high	1
society,	1
to	1
certain	1
women,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
official	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
service.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
received	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
themselves,	1
an	1
honor	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
extend	1
to	1
many.	1
From	1
politeness	1
and	1
to	1
start	1
conversation,	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
talk	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
merry	1
jests	1
and	1
gossip.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Ours.	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
was,"	1
said	1
one,	1
telling	1
of	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
a	1
fellow	1
diplomat,	1
"that	1
the	1
Chancellor	1
told	1
him	1
flatly	1
that	1
his	1
appointment	1
to	1
London	1
was	1
a	1
promotion	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
to	1
regard	1
it.	1
Can	1
you	1
fancy	1
the	1
figure	1
he	1
cut?..."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it,	1
gentlemen--I	1
am	1
giving	1
Kuragin	1
away	1
to	1
you--is	1
that	1
that	1
man	1
suffers,	1
and	1
this	1
Don	1
Juan,	1
wicked	1
fellow,	1
is	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
was	1
lolling	1
in	1
a	1
lounge	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
over	1
its	1
arm.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me	1
about	1
that!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
Don	1
Juan!	1
You	1
serpent!"	1
cried	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"You,	1
Bolkonski,	1
don't	1
know,"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"that	1
all	1
the	1
atrocities	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
(I	1
nearly	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army)	1
are	1
nothing	1
compared	1
to	1
what	1
this	1
man	1
has	1
been	1
doing	1
among	1
the	1
women!"	1
	1
"La	1
femme	1
est	1
la	1
compagne	1
de	1
l'homme,"	1
*	1
announced	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
through	1
a	1
lorgnette	1
at	1
his	1
elevated	1
legs.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Woman	1
is	1
man's	1
companion."	1
	1
Bilibin	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
"ours"	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
in	1
Hippolyte's	1
face,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
that	1
Hippolyte,	1
of	1
whom--he	1
had	1
to	1
admit--he	1
had	1
almost	1
been	1
jealous	1
on	1
his	1
wife's	1
account,	1
was	1
the	1
butt	1
of	1
this	1
set.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
must	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
treat,"	1
Bilibin	1
whispered	1
to	1
Bolkonski.	1
"Kuragin	1
is	1
exquisite	1
when	1
he	1
discusses	1
politics--you	1
should	1
see	1
his	1
gravity!"	1
	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Hippolyte	1
and	1
wrinkling	1
his	1
forehead	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
politics.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
gathered	1
round	1
these	1
two.	1
	1
"The	1
Berlin	1
cabinet	1
cannot	1
express	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
alliance,"	1
began	1
Hippolyte	1
gazing	1
round	1
with	1
importance	1
at	1
the	1
others,	1
"without	1
expressing...	1
as	1
in	1
its	1
last	1
note...	1
you	1
understand...	1
Besides,	1
unless	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
derogates	1
from	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
our	1
alliance...	1
	1
"Wait,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
finished..."	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
"I	1
believe	1
that	1
intervention	1
will	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
nonintervention.	1
And..."	1
he	1
paused.	1
"Finally	1
one	1
cannot	1
impute	1
the	1
nonreceipt	1
of	1
our	1
dispatch	1
of	1
November	1
18.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
end."	1
And	1
he	1
released	1
Bolkonski's	1
arm	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
quite	1
finished.	1
	1
"Demosthenes,	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
pebble	1
thou	1
secretest	1
in	1
thy	1
golden	1
mouth!"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
and	1
the	1
mop	1
of	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
moved	1
with	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
Everybody	1
laughed,	1
and	1
Hippolyte	1
louder	1
than	1
anyone.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
distressed,	1
and	1
breathed	1
painfully,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
the	1
wild	1
laughter	1
that	1
convulsed	1
his	1
usually	1
impassive	1
features.	1
	1
"Well	1
now,	1
gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
"Bolkonski	1
is	1
my	1
guest	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
and	1
in	1
Brunn	1
itself.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
entertain	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
life	1
here.	1
If	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
Vienna	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easy,	1
but	1
here,	1
in	1
this	1
wretched	1
Moravian	1
hole,	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
difficult,	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
help	1
me.	1
Brunn's	1
attractions	1
must	1
be	1
shown	1
him.	1
You	1
can	1
undertake	1
the	1
theater,	1
I	1
society,	1
and	1
you,	1
Hippolyte,	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
women."	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
Amelie,	1
she's	1
exquisite!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
"ours,"	1
kissing	1
his	1
finger	1
tips.	1
	1
"In	1
general	1
we	1
must	1
turn	1
this	1
bloodthirsty	1
soldier	1
to	1
more	1
humane	1
interests,"	1
said	1
Bilibin.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
scarcely	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
your	1
hospitality,	1
gentlemen,	1
it	1
is	1
already	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
go,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
	1
"Where	1
to?"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
Emperor."	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Well,	1
au	1
revoir,	1
Bolkonski!	1
Au	1
revoir,	1
Prince!	1
Come	1
back	1
early	1
to	1
dinner,"	1
cried	1
several	1
voices.	1
"We'll	1
take	1
you	1
in	1
hand."	1
	1
"When	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
try	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
to	1
praise	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
provisions	1
are	1
supplied	1
and	1
the	1
routes	1
indicated,"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
accompanying	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
hall.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
speak	1
well	1
of	1
them,	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
facts,	1
I	1
can't,"	1
replied	1
Bolkonski,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"Well,	1
talk	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
anyway.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
passion	1
for	1
giving	1
audiences,	1
but	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
talking	1
himself	1
and	1
can't	1
do	1
it,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
see."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
At	1
the	1
levee	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
Austrian	1
officers	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
to,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
merely	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
just	1
nodded	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
head.	1
But	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
over,	1
the	1
adjutant	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
ceremoniously	1
informed	1
Bolkonski	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
desired	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
audience.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
received	1
him	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Before	1
the	1
conversation	1
began	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
seemed	1
confused	1
and	1
blushed	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
when	1
did	1
the	1
battle	1
begin?"	1
he	1
asked	1
hurriedly.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
replied.	1
Then	1
followed	1
other	1
questions	1
just	1
as	1
simple:	1
"Was	1
Kutuzov	1
well?	1
When	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
Krems?"	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
spoke	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
sole	1
aim	1
were	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
given	1
number	1
of	1
questions--the	1
answers	1
to	1
these	1
questions,	1
as	1
was	1
only	1
too	1
evident,	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him.	1
	1
"At	1
what	1
o'clock	1
did	1
the	1
battle	1
begin?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
inform	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
at	1
what	1
o'clock	1
the	1
battle	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
front,	1
but	1
at	1
Durrenstein,	1
where	1
I	1
was,	1
our	1
attack	1
began	1
after	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,"	1
replied	1
Bolkonski	1
growing	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
expecting	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
reliable	1
account,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
had	1
seen.	1
But	1
the	1
Emperor	1
smiled	1
and	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"How	1
many	1
miles?"	1
	1
"From	1
where	1
to	1
where,	1
Your	1
Majesty?"	1
	1
"From	1
Durrenstein	1
to	1
Krems."	1
	1
"Three	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
miles,	1
Your	1
Majesty."	1
	1
"The	1
French	1
have	1
abandoned	1
the	1
left	1
bank?"	1
	1
"According	1
to	1
the	1
scouts	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
them	1
crossed	1
on	1
rafts	1
during	1
the	1
night."	1
	1
"Is	1
there	1
sufficient	1
forage	1
in	1
Krems?"	1
	1
"Forage	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
supplied	1
to	1
the	1
extent..."	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"At	1
what	1
o'clock	1
was	1
General	1
Schmidt	1
killed?"	1
	1
"At	1
seven	1
o'clock,	1
I	1
believe."	1
	1
"At	1
seven	1
o'clock?	1
It's	1
very	1
sad,	1
very	1
sad!"	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
thanked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
bowed.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
withdrew	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
surrounded	1
by	1
courtiers	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
Everywhere	1
he	1
saw	1
friendly	1
looks	1
and	1
heard	1
friendly	1
words.	1
Yesterday's	1
adjutant	1
reproached	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
stayed	1
at	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
The	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
congratulated	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
Maria	1
Theresa	1
Order	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
grade,	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
conferring	1
on	1
him.	1
The	1
Empress'	1
chamberlain	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
Her	1
Majesty.	1
The	1
archduchess	1
also	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whom	1
to	1
answer,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
collected	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
Then	1
the	1
Russian	1
ambassador	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Contrary	1
to	1
Bilibin's	1
forecast	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
was	1
joyfully	1
received.	1
A	1
thanksgiving	1
service	1
was	1
arranged,	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
awarded	1
the	1
Grand	1
Cross	1
of	1
Maria	1
Theresa,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
received	1
rewards.	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
invited	1
everywhere,	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
principal	1
Austrian	1
dignitaries.	1
Between	1
four	1
and	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
having	1
made	1
all	1
his	1
calls,	1
he	1
was	1
returning	1
to	1
Bilibin's	1
house	1
thinking	1
out	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
about	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
Brunn.	1
At	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
vehicle	1
half	1
full	1
of	1
luggage.	1
Franz,	1
Bilibin's	1
man,	1
was	1
dragging	1
a	1
portmanteau	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
	1
Before	1
returning	1
to	1
Bilibin's	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
bookshop	1
to	1
provide	1
himself	1
with	1
some	1
books	1
for	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
shop.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
said	1
Franz,	1
with	1
difficulty	1
rolling	1
the	1
portmanteau	1
into	1
the	1
vehicle,	1
"we	1
are	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
still	1
farther.	1
The	1
scoundrel	1
is	1
again	1
at	1
our	1
heels!"	1
	1
"Eh?	1
What?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
His	1
usually	1
calm	1
face	1
showed	1
excitement.	1
	1
"There	1
now!	1
Confess	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
delightful,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"This	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
Thabor	1
Bridge,	1
at	1
Vienna....	1
They	1
have	1
crossed	1
without	1
striking	1
a	1
blow!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
"But	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
from	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
every	1
coachman	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
knows?"	1
	1
"I	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
archduchess'.	1
I	1
heard	1
nothing	1
there."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
didn't	1
see	1
that	1
everybody	1
is	1
packing	1
up?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not...	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
about?"	1
inquired	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
impatiently.	1
	1
"What's	1
it	1
all	1
about?	1
Why,	1
the	1
French	1
have	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge	1
that	1
Auersperg	1
was	1
defending,	1
and	1
the	1
bridge	1
was	1
not	1
blown	1
up:	1
so	1
Murat	1
is	1
now	1
rushing	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Brunn	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two."	1
	1
"What?	1
Here?	1
But	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
mined?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
ask	1
you.	1
No	1
one,	1
not	1
even	1
Bonaparte,	1
knows	1
why."	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
the	1
bridge	1
is	1
crossed	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
too	1
is	1
lost?	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
cut	1
off,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"That's	1
just	1
it,"	1
answered	1
Bilibin.	1
"Listen!	1
The	1
French	1
entered	1
Vienna	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you.	1
Very	1
well.	1
Next	1
day,	1
which	1
was	1
yesterday,	1
those	1
gentlemen,	1
messieurs	1
les	1
marechaux,	1
*	1
Murat,	1
Lannes,	1
and	1
Belliard,	1
mount	1
and	1
ride	1
to	1
the	1
bridge.	1
(Observe	1
that	1
all	1
three	1
are	1
Gascons.)	1
'Gentlemen,'	1
says	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
'you	1
know	1
the	1
Thabor	1
Bridge	1
is	1
mined	1
and	1
doubly	1
mined	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
menacing	1
fortifications	1
at	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
men	1
has	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
cross?	1
But	1
it	1
will	1
please	1
our	1
sovereign	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon	1
if	1
we	1
take	1
this	1
bridge,	1
so	1
let	1
us	1
three	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
it!'	1
'Yes,	1
let's!'	1
say	1
the	1
others.	1
And	1
off	1
they	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
bridge,	1
cross	1
it,	1
and	1
now	1
with	1
their	1
whole	1
army	1
are	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
marching	1
on	1
us,	1
you,	1
and	1
your	1
lines	1
of	1
communication."	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
marshalls.	1
	1
"Stop	1
jesting,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sadly	1
and	1
seriously.	1
This	1
news	1
grieved	1
him	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
pleased.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hopeless	1
situation	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
lead	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
position;	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
the	1
Toulon	1
that	1
would	1
lift	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
obscure	1
officers	1
and	1
offer	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
to	1
fame!	1
Listening	1
to	1
Bilibin	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
imagining	1
how	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
an	1
opinion	1
at	1
the	1
war	1
council	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
that	1
could	1
save	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
alone	1
would	1
be	1
entrusted	1
with	1
the	1
executing	1
of	1
the	1
plan.	1
	1
"Stop	1
this	1
jesting,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
jesting,"	1
Bilibin	1
went	1
on.	1
"Nothing	1
is	1
truer	1
or	1
sadder.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
ride	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge	1
alone	1
and	1
wave	1
white	1
handkerchiefs;	1
they	1
assure	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
duty	1
that	1
they,	1
the	1
marshals,	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
negotiate	1
with	1
Prince	1
Auersperg.	1
He	1
lets	1
them	1
enter	1
the	1
tête-de-pont.	1
*	1
They	1
spin	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
gasconades,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
is	1
over,	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
is	1
arranging	1
a	1
meeting	1
with	1
Bonaparte,	1
that	1
they	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
Prince	1
Auersperg,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
The	1
officer	1
sends	1
for	1
Auersperg;	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
embrace	1
the	1
officers,	1
crack	1
jokes,	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
cannon,	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
a	1
French	1
battalion	1
gets	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
unobserved,	1
flings	1
the	1
bags	1
of	1
incendiary	1
material	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
approaches	1
the	1
tête-de-pont.	1
At	1
length	1
appears	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
general,	1
our	1
dear	1
Prince	1
Auersperg	1
von	1
Mautern	1
himself.	1
'Dearest	1
foe!	1
Flower	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army,	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
Turkish	1
wars	1
Hostilities	1
are	1
ended,	1
we	1
can	1
shake	1
one	1
another's	1
hand....	1
The	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon	1
burns	1
with	1
impatience	1
to	1
make	1
Prince	1
Auersperg's	1
acquaintance.'	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
those	1
gentlemen,	1
Gascons	1
indeed,	1
so	1
bewildered	1
him	1
with	1
fine	1
words,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
rapidly	1
established	1
intimacy	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
marshals,	1
and	1
so	1
dazzled	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Murat's	1
mantle	1
and	1
ostrich	1
plumes,	1
qu'il	1
n'y	1
voit	1
que	1
du	1
feu,	1
et	1
oublie	1
celui	1
qu'il	1
devait	1
faire	1
faire	1
sur	1
l'ennemi!"	1
*(2)	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
animation	1
of	1
his	1
speech,	1
Bilibin	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
pause	1
after	1
this	1
mot	1
to	1
give	1
time	1
for	1
its	1
due	1
appreciation.	1
"The	1
French	1
battalion	1
rushes	1
to	1
the	1
bridgehead,	1
spikes	1
the	1
guns,	1
and	1
the	1
bridge	1
is	1
taken!	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
best	1
of	1
all,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
his	1
excitement	1
subsiding	1
under	1
the	1
delightful	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
story,	1
"is	1
that	1
the	1
sergeant	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
cannon	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
signal	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
mines	1
and	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge,	1
this	1
sergeant,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
were	1
running	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge,	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
fire,	1
but	1
Lannes	1
stayed	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
sergeant,	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
wiser	1
than	1
his	1
general,	1
goes	1
up	1
to	1
Auersperg	1
and	1
says:	1
'Prince,	1
you	1
are	1
being	1
deceived,	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
French!'	1
Murat,	1
seeing	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
lost	1
if	1
the	1
sergeant	1
is	1
allowed	1
to	1
speak,	1
turns	1
to	1
Auersperg	1
with	1
feigned	1
astonishment	1
(he	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
Gascon)	1
and	1
says:	1
'I	1
don't	1
recognize	1
the	1
world-famous	1
Austrian	1
discipline,	1
if	1
you	1
allow	1
a	1
subordinate	1
to	1
address	1
you	1
like	1
that!'	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
stroke	1
of	1
genius.	1
Prince	1
Auersperg	1
feels	1
his	1
dignity	1
at	1
stake	1
and	1
orders	1
the	1
sergeant	1
to	1
be	1
arrested.	1
Come,	1
you	1
must	1
own	1
that	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
Thabor	1
Bridge	1
is	1
delightful!	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
exactly	1
stupidity,	1
nor	1
rascality...."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Bridgehead.	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
That	1
their	1
fire	1
gets	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
forgets	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
treachery,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
vividly	1
imagining	1
the	1
gray	1
overcoats,	1
wounds,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
gunpowder,	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
awaited	1
him.	1
	1
"Not	1
that	1
either.	1
That	1
puts	1
the	1
court	1
in	1
too	1
bad	1
a	1
light,"	1
replied	1
Bilibin.	1
"It's	1
not	1
treachery	1
nor	1
rascality	1
nor	1
stupidity:	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
at	1
Ulm...	1
it	1
is..."--he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
right	1
expression.	1
"C'est...	1
c'est	1
du	1
Mack.	1
Nous	1
sommes	1
mackes	1
(It	1
is...	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
Mack.	1
We	1
are	1
Macked),"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
produced	1
a	1
good	1
epigram,	1
a	1
fresh	1
one	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
repeated.	1
His	1
hitherto	1
puckered	1
brow	1
became	1
smooth	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
examine	1
his	1
nails.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?"	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
toward	1
his	1
room.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
away."	1
	1
"Where	1
to?"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
army."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
stay	1
another	1
two	1
days?"	1
	1
"But	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
at	1
once."	1
	1
And	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
after	1
giving	1
directions	1
about	1
his	1
departure	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
room.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
following	1
him,	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you.	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
	1
And	1
in	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
conclusiveness	1
of	1
his	1
opinion	1
all	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
vanished	1
from	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
going?	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
your	1
duty	1
to	1
gallop	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
danger.	1
I	1
understand	1
that.	1
Mon	1
cher,	1
it	1
is	1
heroism!"	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"But	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
philosopher,	1
be	1
a	1
consistent	1
one,	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
duty,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself.	1
Leave	1
it	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
fit	1
for	1
anything	1
else....	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
dismissed	1
from	1
here;	1
therefore,	1
you	1
can	1
stay	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
us	1
wherever	1
our	1
ill	1
luck	1
takes	1
us.	1
They	1
say	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Olmutz,	1
and	1
Olmutz	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
decent	1
town.	1
You	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
travel	1
comfortably	1
in	1
my	1
caleche."	1
	1
"Do	1
stop	1
joking,	1
Bilibin,"	1
cried	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
speaking	1
sincerely	1
as	1
a	1
friend!	1
Consider!	1
Where	1
and	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going,	1
when	1
you	1
might	1
remain	1
here?	1
You	1
are	1
faced	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
things,"	1
and	1
the	1
skin	1
over	1
his	1
left	1
temple	1
puckered,	1
"either	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
reach	1
your	1
regiment	1
before	1
peace	1
is	1
concluded,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
share	1
defeat	1
and	1
disgrace	1
with	1
Kutuzov's	1
whole	1
army."	1
	1
And	1
Bilibin	1
unwrinkled	1
his	1
temple,	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
dilemma	1
was	1
insoluble.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
argue	1
about	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
coldly,	1
but	1
he	1
thought:	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
army."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
hero!"	1
said	1
Bilibin.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
That	1
same	1
night,	1
having	1
taken	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War,	1
Bolkonski	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
rejoin	1
the	1
army,	1
not	1
knowing	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
it	1
and	1
fearing	1
to	1
be	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Krems.	1
	1
In	1
Brunn	1
everybody	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
packing	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
baggage	1
was	1
already	1
being	1
dispatched	1
to	1
Olmutz.	1
Near	1
Hetzelsdorf	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
struck	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
moving	1
with	1
great	1
haste	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
disorder.	1
The	1
road	1
was	1
so	1
obstructed	1
with	1
carts	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
by	1
in	1
a	1
carriage.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
took	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
a	1
Cossack	1
from	1
a	1
Cossack	1
commander,	1
and	1
hungry	1
and	1
weary,	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
past	1
the	1
baggage	1
wagons,	1
rode	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
luggage.	1
Very	1
sinister	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
reached	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
along,	1
and	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
in	1
their	1
disorderly	1
flight	1
confirmed	1
these	1
rumors.	1
	1
"Cette	1
armee	1
russe	1
que	1
l'or	1
de	1
l'Angleterre	1
a	1
transportee	1
des	1
extremites	1
de	1
l'univers,	1
nous	1
allons	1
lui	1
faire	1
eprouver	1
le	1
meme	1
sort--(le	1
sort	1
de	1
l'armee	1
d'Ulm)."	1
*	1
He	1
remembered	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
Bonaparte's	1
address	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
they	1
awoke	1
in	1
him	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
his	1
hero,	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
wounded	1
pride,	1
and	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
glory.	1
"And	1
should	1
there	1
be	1
nothing	1
left	1
but	1
to	1
die?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Well,	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
it	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
others."	1
	1
	1
*	1
"That	1
Russian	1
army	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
English	1
gold,	1
we	1
shall	1
cause	1
to	1
share	1
the	1
same	1
fate--(the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
Ulm)."	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
with	1
disdain	1
at	1
the	1
endless	1
confused	1
mass	1
of	1
detachments,	1
carts,	1
guns,	1
artillery,	1
and	1
again	1
baggage	1
wagons	1
and	1
vehicles	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
overtaking	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
blocking	1
the	1
muddy	1
road,	1
three	1
and	1
sometimes	1
four	1
abreast.	1
From	1
all	1
sides,	1
behind	1
and	1
before,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
ear	1
could	1
reach,	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
wheels,	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
carts	1
and	1
gun	1
carriages,	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses,	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
whips,	1
shouts,	1
the	1
urging	1
of	1
horses,	1
and	1
the	1
swearing	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
orderlies,	1
and	1
officers.	1
All	1
along	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
fallen	1
horses	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
some	1
flayed,	1
some	1
not,	1
and	1
broken-down	1
carts	1
beside	1
which	1
solitary	1
soldiers	1
sat	1
waiting	1
for	1
something,	1
and	1
again	1
soldiers	1
straggling	1
from	1
their	1
companies,	1
crowds	1
of	1
whom	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
neighboring	1
villages,	1
or	1
returned	1
from	1
them	1
dragging	1
sheep,	1
fowls,	1
hay,	1
and	1
bulging	1
sacks.	1
At	1
each	1
ascent	1
or	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
crowds	1
were	1
yet	1
denser	1
and	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
shouting	1
more	1
incessant.	1
Soldiers	1
floundering	1
knee-deep	1
in	1
mud	1
pushed	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
wagons	1
themselves.	1
Whips	1
cracked,	1
hoofs	1
slipped,	1
traces	1
broke,	1
and	1
lungs	1
were	1
strained	1
with	1
shouting.	1
The	1
officers	1
directing	1
the	1
march	1
rode	1
backward	1
and	1
forward	1
between	1
the	1
carts.	1
Their	1
voices	1
were	1
but	1
feebly	1
heard	1
amid	1
the	1
uproar	1
and	1
one	1
saw	1
by	1
their	1
faces	1
that	1
they	1
despaired	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
checking	1
this	1
disorder.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
our	1
dear	1
Orthodox	1
Russian	1
army,"	1
thought	1
Bolkonski,	1
recalling	1
Bilibin's	1
words.	1
	1
Wishing	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was,	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
convoy.	1
Directly	1
opposite	1
to	1
him	1
came	1
a	1
strange	1
one-horse	1
vehicle,	1
evidently	1
rigged	1
up	1
by	1
soldiers	1
out	1
of	1
any	1
available	1
materials	1
and	1
looking	1
like	1
something	1
between	1
a	1
cart,	1
a	1
cabriolet,	1
and	1
a	1
caleche.	1
A	1
soldier	1
was	1
driving,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
enveloped	1
in	1
shawls	1
sat	1
behind	1
the	1
apron	1
under	1
the	1
leather	1
hood	1
of	1
the	1
vehicle.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
up	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
putting	1
his	1
question	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
when	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
diverted	1
by	1
the	1
desperate	1
shrieks	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
vehicle.	1
An	1
officer	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
transport	1
was	1
beating	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
driving	1
the	1
woman's	1
vehicle	1
for	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
ahead	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
the	1
strokes	1
of	1
his	1
whip	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
apron	1
of	1
the	1
equipage.	1
The	1
woman	1
screamed	1
piercingly.	1
Seeing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
she	1
leaned	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
apron	1
and,	1
waving	1
her	1
thin	1
arms	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
woolen	1
shawl,	1
cried:	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Aide-de-camp!	1
Mr.	1
Aide-de-camp!...	1
For	1
heaven's	1
sake...	1
Protect	1
me!	1
What	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
us?	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
of	1
the	1
Seventh	1
Chasseurs....	1
They	1
won't	1
let	1
us	1
pass,	1
we	1
are	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
have	1
lost	1
our	1
people..."	1
	1
"I'll	1
flatten	1
you	1
into	1
a	1
pancake!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
angry	1
officer	1
to	1
the	1
soldier.	1
"Turn	1
back	1
with	1
your	1
slut!"	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Aide-de-camp!	1
Help	1
me!...	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
all	1
mean?"	1
screamed	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife.	1
	1
"Kindly	1
let	1
this	1
cart	1
pass.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
it's	1
a	1
woman?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
glanced	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
without	1
replying	1
turned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
soldier.	1
"I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
push	1
on!...	1
Back!"	1
	1
"Let	1
them	1
pass,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
compressing	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
are	1
you?"	1
cried	1
the	1
officer,	1
turning	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
tipsy	1
rage,	1
"who	1
are	1
you?	1
Are	1
you	1
in	1
command	1
here?	1
Eh?	1
I	1
am	1
commander	1
here,	1
not	1
you!	1
Go	1
back	1
or	1
I'll	1
flatten	1
you	1
into	1
a	1
pancake,"	1
repeated	1
he.	1
This	1
expression	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
him.	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
a	1
nice	1
snub	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
aide-de-camp,"	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
behind.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
officer	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
senseless,	1
tipsy	1
rage	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
saying.	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
championship	1
of	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife	1
in	1
her	1
queer	1
trap	1
might	1
expose	1
him	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
dreaded	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world--to	1
ridicule;	1
but	1
his	1
instinct	1
urged	1
him	1
on.	1
Before	1
the	1
officer	1
finished	1
his	1
sentence	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
his	1
face	1
distorted	1
with	1
fury,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
riding	1
whip.	1
	1
"Kind...ly	1
let--them--pass!"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
flourished	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
hastily	1
rode	1
away.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
these	1
fellows	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
that	1
there's	1
this	1
disorder,"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
"Do	1
as	1
you	1
like."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes	1
rode	1
hastily	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife,	1
who	1
was	1
calling	1
him	1
her	1
deliverer,	1
and	1
recalling	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
disgust	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
of	1
this	1
humiliating	1
scene	1
he	1
galloped	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was.	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
village	1
he	1
dismounted	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
house,	1
intending	1
to	1
rest	1
if	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
eat	1
something,	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
sort	1
out	1
the	1
stinging	1
and	1
tormenting	1
thoughts	1
that	1
confused	1
his	1
mind.	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
mob	1
of	1
scoundrels	1
and	1
not	1
an	1
army,"	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
house,	1
when	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
called	1
him	1
by	1
name.	1
	1
He	1
turned	1
round.	1
Nesvitski's	1
handsome	1
face	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
window.	1
Nesvitski,	1
moving	1
his	1
moist	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
chewed	1
something,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm,	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
enter.	1
	1
"Bolkonski!	1
Bolkonski!...	1
Don't	1
you	1
hear?	1
Eh?	1
Come	1
quick..."	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
Entering	1
the	1
house,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
another	1
adjutant	1
having	1
something	1
to	1
eat.	1
They	1
hastily	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
him	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
news.	1
On	1
their	1
familiar	1
faces	1
he	1
read	1
agitation	1
and	1
alarm.	1
This	1
was	1
particularly	1
noticeable	1
on	1
Nesvitski's	1
usually	1
laughing	1
countenance.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
commander-in-chief?"	1
asked	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Here,	1
in	1
that	1
house,"	1
answered	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"Well,	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
it's	1
peace	1
and	1
capitulation?"	1
asked	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
you.	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
except	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
here."	1
	1
"And	1
we,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy!	1
It's	1
terrible!	1
I	1
was	1
wrong	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
Mack,	1
we're	1
getting	1
it	1
still	1
worse,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski.	1
"But	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
eat."	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
either	1
your	1
baggage	1
or	1
anything	1
else	1
now,	1
Prince.	1
And	1
God	1
only	1
knows	1
where	1
your	1
man	1
Peter	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
headquarters?"	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
Znaim."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
all	1
I	1
need	1
into	1
packs	1
for	1
two	1
horses,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski.	1
"They've	1
made	1
up	1
splendid	1
packs	1
for	1
me--fit	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
Bohemian	1
mountains	1
with.	1
It's	1
a	1
bad	1
lookout,	1
old	1
fellow!	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
ill	1
to	1
shiver	1
like	1
that,"	1
he	1
added,	1
noticing	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
winced	1
as	1
at	1
an	1
electric	1
shock.	1
	1
"It's	1
nothing,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
remembered	1
his	1
recent	1
encounter	1
with	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
convoy	1
officer.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
doing	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
make	1
out	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
is	1
that	1
everything	1
is	1
abominable,	1
abominable,	1
quite	1
abominable!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was.	1
	1
Passing	1
by	1
Kutuzov's	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
exhausted	1
saddle	1
horses	1
of	1
his	1
suite,	1
with	1
their	1
Cossacks	1
who	1
were	1
talking	1
loudly	1
together,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
passage.	1
Kutuzov	1
himself,	1
he	1
was	1
told,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
and	1
Weyrother.	1
Weyrother	1
was	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
succeeded	1
Schmidt.	1
In	1
the	1
passage	1
little	1
Kozlovski	1
was	1
squatting	1
on	1
his	1
heels	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
clerk.	1
The	1
clerk,	1
with	1
cuffs	1
turned	1
up,	1
was	1
hastily	1
writing	1
at	1
a	1
tub	1
turned	1
bottom	1
upwards.	1
Kozlovski's	1
face	1
looked	1
worn--he	1
too	1
had	1
evidently	1
not	1
slept	1
all	1
night.	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
nod	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Second	1
line...	1
have	1
you	1
written	1
it?"	1
he	1
continued	1
dictating	1
to	1
the	1
clerk.	1
"The	1
Kiev	1
Grenadiers,	1
Podolian..."	1
	1
"One	1
can't	1
write	1
so	1
fast,	1
your	1
honor,"	1
said	1
the	1
clerk,	1
glancing	1
angrily	1
and	1
disrespectfully	1
at	1
Kozlovski.	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
voice,	1
excited	1
and	1
dissatisfied,	1
interrupted	1
by	1
another,	1
an	1
unfamiliar	1
voice.	1
From	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
these	1
voices,	1
the	1
inattentive	1
way	1
Kozlovski	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
the	1
disrespectful	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
exhausted	1
clerk,	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
clerk	1
and	1
Kozlovski	1
were	1
squatting	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
by	1
a	1
tub	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
noisy	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
holding	1
the	1
horses	1
near	1
the	1
window,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
important	1
and	1
disastrous	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen.	1
	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
Kozlovski	1
with	1
urgent	1
questions.	1
	1
"Immediately,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Kozlovski.	1
"Dispositions	1
for	1
Bagration."	1
	1
"What	1
about	1
capitulation?"	1
	1
"Nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
Orders	1
are	1
issued	1
for	1
a	1
battle."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
from	1
whence	1
voices	1
were	1
heard.	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
open	1
it	1
the	1
sounds	1
ceased,	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
his	1
eagle	1
nose	1
and	1
puffy	1
face	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stood	1
right	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Kutuzov	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief's	1
one	1
sound	1
eye	1
showed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
thoughts	1
and	1
anxieties	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
oblivious	1
of	1
his	1
presence.	1
He	1
looked	1
straight	1
at	1
his	1
adjutant's	1
face	1
without	1
recognizing	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
have	1
you	1
finished?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Kozlovski.	1
	1
"One	1
moment,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
Bagration,	1
a	1
gaunt	1
middle-aged	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
with	1
a	1
firm,	1
impassive	1
face	1
of	1
Oriental	1
type,	1
came	1
out	1
after	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
present	1
myself,"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rather	1
loudly,	1
handing	1
Kutuzov	1
an	1
envelope.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
from	1
Vienna?	1
Very	1
good.	1
Later,	1
later!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
with	1
Bagration.	1
	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Bagration.	1
"My	1
blessing,	1
and	1
may	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
great	1
endeavor!"	1
	1
His	1
face	1
suddenly	1
softened	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes.	1
With	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
he	1
drew	1
Bagration	1
toward	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
right,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
ring,	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
over	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
evidently	1
habitual,	1
offering	1
his	1
puffy	1
cheek,	1
but	1
Bagration	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
neck	1
instead.	1
	1
"Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you!"	1
Kutuzov	1
repeated	1
and	1
went	1
toward	1
his	1
carriage.	1
"Get	1
in	1
with	1
me,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
here.	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
Prince	1
Bagration's	1
detachment."	1
	1
"Get	1
in,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
Bolkonski	1
still	1
delayed,	1
he	1
added:	1
"I	1
need	1
good	1
officers	1
myself,	1
need	1
them	1
myself!"	1
	1
They	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
drove	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
still	1
much,	1
much	1
before	1
us,"	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
penetration	1
he	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
Bolkonski's	1
mind.	1
"If	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
detachment	1
returns	1
I	1
shall	1
thank	1
God,"	1
he	1
added	1
as	1
if	1
speaking	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
glanced	1
at	1
Kutuzov's	1
face	1
only	1
a	1
foot	1
distant	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
noticed	1
the	1
carefully	1
washed	1
seams	1
of	1
the	1
scar	1
near	1
his	1
temple,	1
where	1
an	1
Ismail	1
bullet	1
had	1
pierced	1
his	1
skull,	1
and	1
the	1
empty	1
eye	1
socket.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
speak	1
so	1
calmly	1
of	1
those	1
men's	1
death,"	1
thought	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
beg	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
that	1
detachment,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
saying,	1
and	1
sat	1
plunged	1
in	1
thought.	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later,	1
gently	1
swaying	1
on	1
the	1
soft	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
agitation	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
With	1
delicate	1
irony	1
he	1
questioned	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
about	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
about	1
the	1
remarks	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
at	1
court	1
concerning	1
the	1
Krems	1
affair,	1
and	1
about	1
some	1
ladies	1
they	1
both	1
knew.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
On	1
November	1
1	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
received,	1
through	1
a	1
spy,	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
commanded	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
almost	1
hopeless	1
position.	1
The	1
spy	1
reported	1
that	1
the	1
French,	1
after	1
crossing	1
the	1
bridge	1
at	1
Vienna,	1
were	1
advancing	1
in	1
immense	1
force	1
upon	1
Kutuzov's	1
line	1
of	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
that	1
were	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia.	1
If	1
Kutuzov	1
decided	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Krems,	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
of	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
men	1
would	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
completely	1
and	1
surround	1
his	1
exhausted	1
army	1
of	1
forty	1
thousand,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Mack	1
at	1
Ulm.	1
If	1
Kutuzov	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
road	1
connecting	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
march	1
with	1
no	1
road	1
into	1
unknown	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Bohemian	1
mountains,	1
defending	1
himself	1
against	1
superior	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
abandoning	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
junction	1
with	1
Buxhowden.	1
If	1
Kutuzov	1
decided	1
to	1
retreat	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
Krems	1
to	1
Olmutz,	1
to	1
unite	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia,	1
he	1
risked	1
being	1
forestalled	1
on	1
that	1
road	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
Vienna	1
bridge,	1
and	1
encumbered	1
by	1
his	1
baggage	1
and	1
transport,	1
having	1
to	1
accept	1
battle	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
against	1
an	1
enemy	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
strong,	1
who	1
would	1
hem	1
him	1
in	1
from	1
two	1
sides.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
chose	1
this	1
latter	1
course.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
the	1
spy	1
reported,	1
having	1
crossed	1
the	1
Vienna	1
bridge,	1
were	1
advancing	1
by	1
forced	1
marches	1
toward	1
Znaim,	1
which	1
lay	1
sixty-six	1
miles	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
retreat.	1
If	1
he	1
reached	1
Znaim	1
before	1
the	1
French,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
great	1
hope	1
of	1
saving	1
the	1
army;	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
French	1
forestall	1
him	1
at	1
Znaim	1
meant	1
the	1
exposure	1
of	1
his	1
whole	1
army	1
to	1
a	1
disgrace	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
Ulm,	1
or	1
to	1
utter	1
destruction.	1
But	1
to	1
forestall	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
army	1
was	1
impossible.	1
The	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
Vienna	1
to	1
Znaim	1
was	1
shorter	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
Russians	1
from	1
Krems	1
to	1
Znaim.	1
	1
The	1
night	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
news,	1
Kutuzov	1
sent	1
Bagration's	1
vanguard,	1
four	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
hills	1
from	1
the	1
Krems-Znaim	1
to	1
the	1
Vienna-Znaim	1
road.	1
Bagration	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
march	1
without	1
resting,	1
and	1
to	1
halt	1
facing	1
Vienna	1
with	1
Znaim	1
to	1
his	1
rear,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
forestalling	1
the	1
French	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
delay	1
them	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible.	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
transport	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Znaim.	1
	1
Marching	1
thirty	1
miles	1
that	1
stormy	1
night	1
across	1
roadless	1
hills,	1
with	1
his	1
hungry,	1
ill-shod	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
losing	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
his	1
men	1
as	1
stragglers	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
Bagration	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
Vienna-Znaim	1
road	1
at	1
Hollabrunn	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
were	1
approaching	1
Hollabrunn	1
from	1
Vienna.	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
his	1
transport	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
march	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
reach	1
Znaim.	1
Hence	1
Bagration	1
with	1
his	1
four	1
thousand	1
hungry,	1
exhausted	1
men	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
detain	1
for	1
days	1
the	1
whole	1
enemy	1
army	1
that	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
Hollabrunn,	1
which	1
was	1
clearly	1
impossible.	1
But	1
a	1
freak	1
of	1
fate	1
made	1
the	1
impossible	1
possible.	1
The	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
trick	1
that	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
Vienna	1
bridge	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
without	1
a	1
fight	1
led	1
Murat	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
deceive	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
way.	1
Meeting	1
Bagration's	1
weak	1
detachment	1
on	1
the	1
Znaim	1
road	1
he	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
Kutuzov's	1
whole	1
army.	1
To	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
crush	1
it	1
absolutely	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
Vienna,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
object	1
offered	1
a	1
three	1
days'	1
truce	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
both	1
armies	1
should	1
remain	1
in	1
position	1
without	1
moving.	1
Murat	1
declared	1
that	1
negotiations	1
for	1
peace	1
were	1
already	1
proceeding,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
therefore	1
offered	1
this	1
truce	1
to	1
avoid	1
unnecessary	1
bloodshed.	1
Count	1
Nostitz,	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
occupying	1
the	1
advanced	1
posts,	1
believed	1
Murat's	1
emissary	1
and	1
retired,	1
leaving	1
Bagration's	1
division	1
exposed.	1
Another	1
emissary	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
line	1
to	1
announce	1
the	1
peace	1
negotiations	1
and	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
the	1
three	1
days'	1
truce.	1
Bagration	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
authorized	1
either	1
to	1
accept	1
or	1
refuse	1
a	1
truce	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
adjutant	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
report	1
the	1
offer	1
he	1
had	1
received.	1
	1
A	1
truce	1
was	1
Kutuzov's	1
sole	1
chance	1
of	1
gaining	1
time,	1
giving	1
Bagration's	1
exhausted	1
troops	1
some	1
rest,	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
transport	1
and	1
heavy	1
convoys	1
(whose	1
movements	1
were	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
French)	1
advance	1
if	1
but	1
one	1
stage	1
nearer	1
Znaim.	1
The	1
offer	1
of	1
a	1
truce	1
gave	1
the	1
only,	1
and	1
a	1
quite	1
unexpected,	1
chance	1
of	1
saving	1
the	1
army.	1
On	1
receiving	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
immediately	1
dispatched	1
Adjutant	1
General	1
Wintzingerode,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
him,	1
to	1
the	1
enemy	1
camp.	1
Wintzingerode	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
the	1
truce	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
offer	1
terms	1
of	1
capitulation,	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
Kutuzov	1
sent	1
his	1
adjutants	1
back	1
to	1
hasten	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
baggage	1
trains	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
army	1
along	1
the	1
Krems-Znaim	1
road.	1
Bagration's	1
exhausted	1
and	1
hungry	1
detachment,	1
which	1
alone	1
covered	1
this	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
transport	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
had	1
to	1
remain	1
stationary	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
enemy	1
eight	1
times	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
itself.	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
expectations	1
that	1
the	1
proposals	1
of	1
capitulation	1
(which	1
were	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
binding)	1
might	1
give	1
time	1
for	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
transport	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
Murat's	1
mistake	1
would	1
very	1
soon	1
be	1
discovered,	1
proved	1
correct.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Bonaparte	1
(who	1
was	1
at	1
Schonbrunn,	1
sixteen	1
miles	1
from	1
Hollabrunn)	1
received	1
Murat's	1
dispatch	1
with	1
the	1
proposal	1
of	1
a	1
truce	1
and	1
a	1
capitulation,	1
he	1
detected	1
a	1
ruse	1
and	1
wrote	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
to	1
Murat:	1
	1
Schonbrunn,	1
25th	1
Brumaire,	1
1805,	1
	1
at	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
	1
To	1
PRINCE	1
MURAT,	1
	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
words	1
to	1
express	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
displeasure.	1
You	1
command	1
only	1
my	1
advance	1
guard,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
arrange	1
an	1
armistice	1
without	1
my	1
order.	1
You	1
are	1
causing	1
me	1
to	1
lose	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
a	1
campaign.	1
Break	1
the	1
armistice	1
immediately	1
and	1
march	1
on	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Inform	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
signed	1
that	1
capitulation	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Russia	1
has	1
that	1
right.	1
	1
If,	1
however,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Russia	1
ratifies	1
that	1
convention,	1
I	1
will	1
ratify	1
it;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
trick.	1
March	1
on,	1
destroy	1
the	1
Russian	1
army....	1
You	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
seize	1
its	1
baggage	1
and	1
artillery.	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
Emperor's	1
aide-de-camp	1
is	1
an	1
impostor.	1
Officers	1
are	1
nothing	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
powers;	1
this	1
one	1
had	1
none....	1
The	1
Austrians	1
let	1
themselves	1
be	1
tricked	1
at	1
the	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Vienna	1
bridge,	1
you	1
are	1
letting	1
yourself	1
be	1
tricked	1
by	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
NAPOLEON	1
	1
Bonaparte's	1
adjutant	1
rode	1
full	1
gallop	1
with	1
this	1
menacing	1
letter	1
to	1
Murat.	1
Bonaparte	1
himself,	1
not	1
trusting	1
to	1
his	1
generals,	1
moved	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
Guards	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
afraid	1
of	1
letting	1
a	1
ready	1
victim	1
escape,	1
and	1
Bagration's	1
four	1
thousand	1
men	1
merrily	1
lighted	1
campfires,	1
dried	1
and	1
warmed	1
themselves,	1
cooked	1
their	1
porridge	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
for	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
or	1
imagined	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
him.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
Between	1
three	1
and	1
four	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
persisted	1
in	1
his	1
request	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
arrived	1
at	1
Grunth	1
and	1
reported	1
himself	1
to	1
Bagration.	1
Bonaparte's	1
adjutant	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
reached	1
Murat's	1
detachment	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
begun.	1
In	1
Bagration's	1
detachment	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
position	1
of	1
affairs.	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
peace	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
its	1
possibility;	1
others	1
talked	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
but	1
also	1
disbelieved	1
in	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
an	1
engagement.	1
Bagration,	1
knowing	1
Bolkonski	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
favorite	1
and	1
trusted	1
adjutant,	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
distinction	1
and	1
special	1
marks	1
of	1
favor,	1
explaining	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
probably	1
be	1
an	1
engagement	1
that	1
day	1
or	1
the	1
next,	1
and	1
giving	1
him	1
full	1
liberty	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
battle	1
or	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
rearguard	1
and	1
have	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
retreat,	1
"which	1
is	1
also	1
very	1
important."	1
	1
"However,	1
there	1
will	1
hardly	1
be	1
an	1
engagement	1
today,"	1
said	1
Bagration	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
reassure	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
little	1
staff	1
dandies	1
sent	1
to	1
earn	1
a	1
medal	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
his	1
reward	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
rearguard,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
me,	1
let	1
him...	1
he'll	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
here	1
if	1
he's	1
a	1
brave	1
officer,"	1
thought	1
Bagration.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
without	1
replying,	1
asked	1
the	1
prince's	1
permission	1
to	1
ride	1
round	1
the	1
position	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
forces,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
bearings	1
should	1
he	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
execute	1
an	1
order.	1
The	1
officer	1
on	1
duty,	1
a	1
handsome,	1
elegantly	1
dressed	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
diamond	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
forefinger,	1
who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
speaking	1
French	1
though	1
he	1
spoke	1
it	1
badly,	1
offered	1
to	1
conduct	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
On	1
all	1
sides	1
they	1
saw	1
rain-soaked	1
officers	1
with	1
dejected	1
faces	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
seeking	1
something,	1
and	1
soldiers	1
dragging	1
doors,	1
benches,	1
and	1
fencing	1
from	1
the	1
village.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
Prince!	1
We	1
can't	1
stop	1
those	1
fellows,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
"The	1
officers	1
don't	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
hand.	1
And	1
there,"	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
sutler's	1
tent,	1
"they	1
crowd	1
in	1
and	1
sit.	1
This	1
morning	1
I	1
turned	1
them	1
all	1
out	1
and	1
now	1
look,	1
it's	1
full	1
again.	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
there,	1
Prince,	1
and	1
scare	1
them	1
a	1
bit.	1
It	1
won't	1
take	1
a	1
moment."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
let's	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
myself	1
a	1
roll	1
and	1
some	1
cheese,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
eat	1
anything.	1
	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
mention	1
it,	1
Prince?	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
offered	1
you	1
something."	1
	1
They	1
dismounted	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
tent.	1
Several	1
officers,	1
with	1
flushed	1
and	1
weary	1
faces,	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking.	1
	1
"Now	1
what	1
does	1
this	1
mean,	1
gentlemen?"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer,	1
in	1
the	1
reproachful	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
more	1
than	1
once.	1
"You	1
know	1
it	1
won't	1
do	1
to	1
leave	1
your	1
posts	1
like	1
this.	1
The	1
prince	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
leave	1
his	1
post.	1
Now	1
you,	1
Captain,"	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
thin,	1
dirty	1
little	1
artillery	1
officer	1
who	1
without	1
his	1
boots	1
(he	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
canteen	1
keeper	1
to	1
dry),	1
in	1
only	1
his	1
stockings,	1
rose	1
when	1
they	1
entered,	1
smiling	1
not	1
altogether	1
comfortably.	1
	1
"Well,	1
aren't	1
you	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself,	1
Captain	1
Tushin?"	1
he	1
continued.	1
"One	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
as	1
an	1
artillery	1
officer	1
you	1
would	1
set	1
a	1
good	1
example,	1
yet	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
without	1
your	1
boots!	1
The	1
alarm	1
will	1
be	1
sounded	1
and	1
you'll	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
pretty	1
position	1
without	1
your	1
boots!"	1
(The	1
staff	1
officer	1
smiled.)	1
"Kindly	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
posts,	1
gentlemen,	1
all	1
of	1
you,	1
all!"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
command.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
involuntarily	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
artillery	1
officer	1
Tushin,	1
who	1
silent	1
and	1
smiling,	1
shifting	1
from	1
one	1
stockinged	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
with	1
his	1
large,	1
intelligent,	1
kindly	1
eyes	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
officer.	1
	1
"The	1
soldiers	1
say	1
it	1
feels	1
easier	1
without	1
boots,"	1
said	1
Captain	1
Tushin	1
smiling	1
shyly	1
in	1
his	1
uncomfortable	1
position,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
adopt	1
a	1
jocular	1
tone.	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
jest	1
was	1
unacceptable	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
off.	1
He	1
grew	1
confused.	1
	1
"Kindly	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
posts,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
trying	1
to	1
preserve	1
his	1
gravity.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
artillery	1
officer's	1
small	1
figure.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
peculiar	1
about	1
it,	1
quite	1
unsoldierly,	1
rather	1
comic,	1
but	1
extremely	1
attractive.	1
	1
The	1
staff	1
officer	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
mounted	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
rode	1
on.	1
	1
Having	1
ridden	1
beyond	1
the	1
village,	1
continually	1
meeting	1
and	1
overtaking	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
various	1
regiments,	1
they	1
saw	1
on	1
their	1
left	1
some	1
entrenchments	1
being	1
thrown	1
up,	1
the	1
freshly	1
dug	1
clay	1
of	1
which	1
showed	1
up	1
red.	1
Several	1
battalions	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
in	1
their	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
despite	1
the	1
cold	1
wind,	1
swarmed	1
in	1
these	1
earthworks	1
like	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
white	1
ants;	1
spadefuls	1
of	1
red	1
clay	1
were	1
continually	1
being	1
thrown	1
up	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
bank	1
by	1
unseen	1
hands.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
rode	1
up,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
entrenchment,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
again.	1
Just	1
behind	1
it	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
some	1
dozens	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
continually	1
replaced	1
by	1
others,	1
who	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
entrenchment.	1
They	1
had	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
noses	1
and	1
put	1
their	1
horses	1
to	1
a	1
trot	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
poisoned	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
these	1
latrines.	1
	1
"Voila	1
l'agrement	1
des	1
camps,	1
monsieur	1
le	1
Prince,"	1
*	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
pleasure	1
one	1
gets	1
in	1
camp,	1
Prince."	1
	1
They	1
rode	1
up	1
the	1
opposite	1
hill.	1
From	1
there	1
the	1
French	1
could	1
already	1
be	1
seen.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped	1
and	1
began	1
examining	1
the	1
position.	1
	1
"That's	1
our	1
battery,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
indicating	1
the	1
highest	1
point.	1
"It's	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
queer	1
fellow	1
we	1
saw	1
without	1
his	1
boots.	1
You	1
can	1
see	1
everything	1
from	1
there;	1
let's	1
go	1
there,	1
Prince."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you	1
very	1
much,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
on	1
alone,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
wishing	1
to	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
this	1
staff	1
officer's	1
company,	1
"please	1
don't	1
trouble	1
yourself	1
further."	1
	1
The	1
staff	1
officer	1
remained	1
behind	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
on	1
alone.	1
	1
The	1
farther	1
forward	1
and	1
nearer	1
the	1
enemy	1
he	1
went,	1
the	1
more	1
orderly	1
and	1
cheerful	1
were	1
the	1
troops.	1
The	1
greatest	1
disorder	1
and	1
depression	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
baggage	1
train	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
that	1
morning	1
on	1
the	1
Znaim	1
road	1
seven	1
miles	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
French.	1
At	1
Grunth	1
also	1
some	1
apprehension	1
and	1
alarm	1
could	1
be	1
felt,	1
but	1
the	1
nearer	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
lines	1
the	1
more	1
confident	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
our	1
troops.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats	1
were	1
ranged	1
in	1
lines,	1
the	1
sergeants	1
major	1
and	1
company	1
officers	1
were	1
counting	1
the	1
men,	1
poking	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
in	1
each	1
section	1
in	1
the	1
ribs	1
and	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
hand	1
up.	1
Soldiers	1
scattered	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
were	1
dragging	1
logs	1
and	1
brushwood	1
and	1
were	1
building	1
shelters	1
with	1
merry	1
chatter	1
and	1
laughter;	1
around	1
the	1
fires	1
sat	1
others,	1
dressed	1
and	1
undressed,	1
drying	1
their	1
shirts	1
and	1
leg	1
bands	1
or	1
mending	1
boots	1
or	1
overcoats	1
and	1
crowding	1
round	1
the	1
boilers	1
and	1
porridge	1
cookers.	1
In	1
one	1
company	1
dinner	1
was	1
ready,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
gazing	1
eagerly	1
at	1
the	1
steaming	1
boiler,	1
waiting	1
till	1
the	1
sample,	1
which	1
a	1
quartermaster	1
sergeant	1
was	1
carrying	1
in	1
a	1
wooden	1
bowl	1
to	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
log	1
before	1
his	1
shelter,	1
had	1
been	1
tasted.	1
	1
Another	1
company,	1
a	1
lucky	1
one	1
for	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
companies	1
had	1
vodka,	1
crowded	1
round	1
a	1
pockmarked,	1
broad-shouldered	1
sergeant	1
major	1
who,	1
tilting	1
a	1
keg,	1
filled	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
the	1
canteen	1
lids	1
held	1
out	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
lifted	1
the	1
canteen	1
lids	1
to	1
their	1
lips	1
with	1
reverential	1
faces,	1
emptied	1
them,	1
rolling	1
the	1
vodka	1
in	1
their	1
mouths,	1
and	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major	1
with	1
brightened	1
expressions,	1
licking	1
their	1
lips	1
and	1
wiping	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sleeves	1
of	1
their	1
greatcoats.	1
All	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
as	1
serene	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
this	1
were	1
happening	1
at	1
home	1
awaiting	1
peaceful	1
encampment,	1
and	1
not	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
before	1
an	1
action	1
in	1
which	1
at	1
least	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
field.	1
After	1
passing	1
a	1
chasseur	1
regiment	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
Kiev	1
grenadiers--fine	1
fellows	1
busy	1
with	1
similar	1
peaceful	1
affairs--near	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
higher	1
than	1
and	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
others,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
platoon	1
of	1
grenadiers	1
before	1
whom	1
lay	1
a	1
naked	1
man.	1
Two	1
soldiers	1
held	1
him	1
while	1
two	1
others	1
were	1
flourishing	1
their	1
switches	1
and	1
striking	1
him	1
regularly	1
on	1
his	1
bare	1
back.	1
The	1
man	1
shrieked	1
unnaturally.	1
A	1
stout	1
major	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
line,	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
screams	1
kept	1
repeating:	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
a	1
soldier	1
to	1
steal;	1
a	1
soldier	1
must	1
be	1
honest,	1
honorable,	1
and	1
brave,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
robs	1
his	1
fellows	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
honor	1
in	1
him,	1
he's	1
a	1
scoundrel.	1
Go	1
on!	1
Go	1
on!"	1
	1
So	1
the	1
swishing	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
strokes,	1
and	1
the	1
desperate	1
but	1
unnatural	1
screams,	1
continued.	1
	1
"Go	1
on,	1
go	1
on!"	1
said	1
the	1
major.	1
	1
A	1
young	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bewildered	1
and	1
pained	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
stepped	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
the	1
adjutant	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
by.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
front	1
line,	1
rode	1
along	1
it.	1
Our	1
front	1
line	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
were	1
far	1
apart	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
flanks,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
where	1
the	1
men	1
with	1
a	1
flag	1
of	1
truce	1
had	1
passed	1
that	1
morning,	1
the	1
lines	1
were	1
so	1
near	1
together	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
could	1
see	1
one	1
another's	1
faces	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
Besides	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
formed	1
the	1
picket	1
line	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
curious	1
onlookers	1
who,	1
jesting	1
and	1
laughing,	1
stared	1
at	1
their	1
strange	1
foreign	1
enemies.	1
	1
Since	1
early	1
morning--despite	1
an	1
injunction	1
not	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
picket	1
line--the	1
officers	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
keep	1
sight-seers	1
away.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
forming	1
the	1
picket	1
line,	1
like	1
showmen	1
exhibiting	1
a	1
curiosity,	1
no	1
longer	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
but	1
paid	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
sight-seers	1
and	1
grew	1
weary	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
relieved.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
halted	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
"Look!	1
Look	1
there!"	1
one	1
soldier	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
another,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
Russian	1
musketeer	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
picket	1
line	1
with	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
was	1
rapidly	1
and	1
excitedly	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
French	1
grenadier.	1
"Hark	1
to	1
him	1
jabbering!	1
Fine,	1
isn't	1
it?	1
It's	1
all	1
the	1
Frenchy	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
him.	1
There	1
now,	1
Sidorov!"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
listen.	1
It's	1
fine!"	1
answered	1
Sidorov,	1
who	1
was	1
considered	1
an	1
adept	1
at	1
French.	1
	1
The	1
soldier	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
laughers	1
referred	1
was	1
Dolokhov.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
stopped	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
where	1
their	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed,	1
with	1
his	1
captain.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
go	1
on,	1
go	1
on!"	1
incited	1
the	1
officer,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
speech	1
which	1
was	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
him.	1
"More,	1
please:	1
more!	1
What's	1
he	1
saying?"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
the	1
captain;	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
into	1
a	1
hot	1
dispute	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
grenadier.	1
They	1
were	1
naturally	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
campaign.	1
The	1
Frenchman,	1
confusing	1
the	1
Austrians	1
with	1
the	1
Russians,	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
surrendered	1
and	1
had	1
fled	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
from	1
Ulm,	1
while	1
Dolokhov	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
not	1
surrendered	1
but	1
had	1
beaten	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
orders	1
to	1
drive	1
you	1
off	1
here,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
drive	1
you	1
off,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Only	1
take	1
care	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
Cossacks	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
captured!"	1
said	1
the	1
French	1
grenadier.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
onlookers	1
and	1
listeners	1
laughed.	1
	1
"We'll	1
make	1
you	1
dance	1
as	1
we	1
did	1
under	1
Suvorov...,"	1
*	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"On	1
vous	1
fera	1
danser."	1
	1
"Qu'	1
est-ce	1
qu'il	1
chante?"	1
*	1
asked	1
a	1
Frenchman.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"What's	1
he	1
singing	1
about?"	1
	1
"It's	1
ancient	1
history,"	1
said	1
another,	1
guessing	1
that	1
it	1
referred	1
to	1
a	1
former	1
war.	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
will	1
teach	1
your	1
Suvara	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
taught	1
the	1
others..."	1
	1
"Bonaparte..."	1
began	1
Dolokhov,	1
but	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Not	1
Bonaparte.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
Emperor!	1
Sacre	1
nom...!"	1
cried	1
he	1
angrily.	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
skin	1
your	1
Emperor."	1
	1
And	1
Dolokhov	1
swore	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
coarse	1
soldier's	1
Russian	1
and	1
shouldering	1
his	1
musket	1
walked	1
away.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go,	1
Ivan	1
Lukich,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
captain.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
talk	1
French,"	1
said	1
the	1
picket	1
soldiers.	1
"Now,	1
Sidorov,	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
try!"	1
	1
Sidorov,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
French,	1
winked,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
jabber	1
meaningless	1
sounds	1
very	1
fast:	1
"Kari,	1
mala,	1
tafa,	1
safi,	1
muter,	1
Kaska,"	1
he	1
said,	1
trying	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
expressive	1
intonation	1
to	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"Ho!	1
ho!	1
ho!	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
Ouh!	1
ouh!"	1
came	1
peals	1
of	1
such	1
healthy	1
and	1
good-humored	1
laughter	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers	1
that	1
it	1
infected	1
the	1
French	1
involuntarily,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
left	1
to	1
do	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
unload	1
the	1
muskets,	1
explode	1
the	1
ammunition,	1
and	1
all	1
return	1
home	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
guns	1
remained	1
loaded,	1
the	1
loopholes	1
in	1
blockhouses	1
and	1
entrenchments	1
looked	1
out	1
just	1
as	1
menacingly,	1
and	1
the	1
unlimbered	1
cannon	1
confronted	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
before.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Having	1
ridden	1
round	1
the	1
whole	1
line	1
from	1
right	1
flank	1
to	1
left,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
battery	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
field	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
Here	1
he	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
stopped	1
beside	1
the	1
farthest	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
unlimbered	1
cannon.	1
Before	1
the	1
guns	1
an	1
artillery	1
sentry	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down;	1
he	1
stood	1
at	1
attention	1
when	1
the	1
officer	1
arrived,	1
but	1
at	1
a	1
sign	1
resumed	1
his	1
measured,	1
monotonous	1
pacing.	1
Behind	1
the	1
guns	1
were	1
their	1
limbers	1
and	1
still	1
farther	1
back	1
picket	1
ropes	1
and	1
artillerymen's	1
bonfires.	1
To	1
the	1
left,	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
farthest	1
cannon,	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
newly	1
constructed	1
wattle	1
shed	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
officers'	1
voices	1
in	1
eager	1
conversation.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
a	1
view	1
over	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
position	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
opened	1
out	1
from	1
this	1
battery.	1
Just	1
facing	1
it,	1
on	1
the	1
crest	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
hill,	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
could	1
be	1
seen,	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
places	1
to	1
left	1
and	1
right	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
their	1
campfires,	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
evidently	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
itself	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
hill.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
that	1
village,	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke,	1
was	1
something	1
resembling	1
a	1
battery,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
clearly	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
eye.	1
Our	1
right	1
flank	1
was	1
posted	1
on	1
a	1
rather	1
steep	1
incline	1
which	1
dominated	1
the	1
French	1
position.	1
Our	1
infantry	1
were	1
stationed	1
there,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
farthest	1
point	1
the	1
dragoons.	1
In	1
the	1
center,	1
where	1
Tushin's	1
battery	1
stood	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
surveying	1
the	1
position,	1
was	1
the	1
easiest	1
and	1
most	1
direct	1
descent	1
and	1
ascent	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
separating	1
us	1
from	1
Schon	1
Grabern.	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
our	1
troops	1
were	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
copse,	1
in	1
which	1
smoked	1
the	1
bonfires	1
of	1
our	1
infantry	1
who	1
were	1
felling	1
wood.	1
The	1
French	1
line	1
was	1
wider	1
than	1
ours,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
easily	1
outflank	1
us	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
Behind	1
our	1
position	1
was	1
a	1
steep	1
and	1
deep	1
dip,	1
making	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
artillery	1
and	1
cavalry	1
to	1
retire.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
notebook	1
and,	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
cannon,	1
sketched	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
position.	1
He	1
made	1
some	1
notes	1
on	1
two	1
points,	1
intending	1
to	1
mention	1
them	1
to	1
Bagration.	1
His	1
idea	1
was,	1
first,	1
to	1
concentrate	1
all	1
the	1
artillery	1
in	1
the	1
center,	1
and	1
secondly,	1
to	1
withdraw	1
the	1
cavalry	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
dip.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
being	1
always	1
near	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
closely	1
following	1
the	1
mass	1
movements	1
and	1
general	1
orders,	1
and	1
constantly	1
studying	1
historical	1
accounts	1
of	1
battles,	1
involuntarily	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
the	1
forthcoming	1
action	1
in	1
broad	1
outline.	1
He	1
imagined	1
only	1
important	1
possibilities:	1
"If	1
the	1
enemy	1
attacks	1
the	1
right	1
flank,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"the	1
Kiev	1
grenadiers	1
and	1
the	1
Podolsk	1
chasseurs	1
must	1
hold	1
their	1
position	1
till	1
reserves	1
from	1
the	1
center	1
come	1
up.	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
the	1
dragoons	1
could	1
successfully	1
make	1
a	1
flank	1
counterattack.	1
If	1
they	1
attack	1
our	1
center	1
we,	1
having	1
the	1
center	1
battery	1
on	1
this	1
high	1
ground,	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
under	1
its	1
cover,	1
and	1
retreat	1
to	1
the	1
dip	1
by	1
echelons."	1
So	1
he	1
reasoned....	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
beside	1
the	1
gun,	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
distinctly,	1
but	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying.	1
Suddenly,	1
however,	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
voice	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
shed,	1
and	1
its	1
tone	1
was	1
so	1
sincere	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
listen.	1
	1
"No,	1
friend,"	1
said	1
a	1
pleasant	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice,	1
"what	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
beyond	1
death,	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
would	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
it.	1
That's	1
so,	1
friend."	1
	1
Another,	1
a	1
younger	1
voice,	1
interrupted	1
him:	1
"Afraid	1
or	1
not,	1
you	1
can't	1
escape	1
it	1
anyhow."	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same,	1
one	1
is	1
afraid!	1
Oh,	1
you	1
clever	1
people,"	1
said	1
a	1
third	1
manly	1
voice	1
interrupting	1
them	1
both.	1
"Of	1
course	1
you	1
artillery	1
men	1
are	1
very	1
wise,	1
because	1
you	1
can	1
take	1
everything	1
along	1
with	1
you--vodka	1
and	1
snacks."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
manly	1
voice,	1
evidently	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer,	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
one	1
is	1
afraid,"	1
continued	1
the	1
first	1
speaker,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
familiar	1
voice.	1
"One	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
unknown,	1
that's	1
what	1
it	1
is.	1
Whatever	1
we	1
may	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
soul	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
sky...	1
we	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sky	1
but	1
only	1
an	1
atmosphere."	1
	1
The	1
manly	1
voice	1
again	1
interrupted	1
the	1
artillery	1
officer.	1
	1
"Well,	1
stand	1
us	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
herb	1
vodka,	1
Tushin,"	1
it	1
said.	1
	1
"Why,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"that's	1
the	1
captain	1
who	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sutler's	1
hut	1
without	1
his	1
boots."	1
He	1
recognized	1
the	1
agreeable,	1
philosophizing	1
voice	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
	1
"Some	1
herb	1
vodka?	1
Certainly!"	1
said	1
Tushin.	1
"But	1
still,	1
to	1
conceive	1
a	1
future	1
life..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
Just	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
whistle	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer,	1
faster	1
and	1
louder,	1
louder	1
and	1
faster,	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
saying	1
what	1
was	1
necessary,	1
thudded	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
near	1
the	1
shed	1
with	1
super	1
human	1
force,	1
throwing	1
up	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
earth.	1
The	1
ground	1
seemed	1
to	1
groan	1
at	1
the	1
terrible	1
impact.	1
	1
And	1
immediately	1
Tushin,	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
pipe	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
his	1
kind,	1
intelligent	1
face	1
rather	1
pale,	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
manly	1
voice,	1
a	1
dashing	1
infantry	1
officer	1
who	1
hurried	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
company,	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
ran.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Mounting	1
his	1
horse	1
again	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lingered	1
with	1
the	1
battery,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
puff	1
from	1
the	1
gun	1
that	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
ball.	1
His	1
eyes	1
ran	1
rapidly	1
over	1
the	1
wide	1
space,	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
hitherto	1
motionless	1
masses	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
now	1
swayed	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
really	1
was	1
a	1
battery	1
to	1
their	1
left.	1
The	1
smoke	1
above	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed.	1
Two	1
mounted	1
Frenchmen,	1
probably	1
adjutants,	1
were	1
galloping	1
up	1
the	1
hill.	1
A	1
small	1
but	1
distinctly	1
visible	1
enemy	1
column	1
was	1
moving	1
down	1
the	1
hill,	1
probably	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
front	1
line.	1
The	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
shot	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed	1
before	1
another	1
puff	1
appeared,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
report.	1
The	1
battle	1
had	1
begun!	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
back	1
to	1
Grunth	1
to	1
find	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
cannonade	1
behind	1
him	1
growing	1
louder	1
and	1
more	1
frequent.	1
Evidently	1
our	1
guns	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
reply.	1
From	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
slope,	1
where	1
the	1
parleys	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
came	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
musketry.	1
	1
Lemarrois	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
with	1
Bonaparte's	1
stern	1
letter,	1
and	1
Murat,	1
humiliated	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
expiate	1
his	1
fault,	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
moved	1
his	1
forces	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
center	1
and	1
outflank	1
both	1
the	1
Russian	1
wings,	1
hoping	1
before	1
evening	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
crush	1
the	1
contemptible	1
detachment	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
"It	1
has	1
begun.	1
Here	1
it	1
is!"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
feeling	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
"But	1
where	1
and	1
how	1
will	1
my	1
Toulon	1
present	1
itself?"	1
	1
Passing	1
between	1
the	1
companies	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
eating	1
porridge	1
and	1
drinking	1
vodka	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
before,	1
he	1
saw	1
everywhere	1
the	1
same	1
rapid	1
movement	1
of	1
soldiers	1
forming	1
ranks	1
and	1
getting	1
their	1
muskets	1
ready,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
faces	1
he	1
recognized	1
the	1
same	1
eagerness	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
heart.	1
"It	1
has	1
begun!	1
Here	1
it	1
is,	1
dreadful	1
but	1
enjoyable!"	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
each	1
soldier	1
and	1
each	1
officer	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
Before	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
embankments	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
thrown	1
up,	1
he	1
saw,	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
dull	1
autumn	1
evening,	1
mounted	1
men	1
coming	1
toward	1
him.	1
The	1
foremost,	1
wearing	1
a	1
Cossack	1
cloak	1
and	1
lambskin	1
cap	1
and	1
riding	1
a	1
white	1
horse,	1
was	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped,	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up;	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
recognizing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
nodded	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
still	1
looked	1
ahead	1
while	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
The	1
feeling,	1
"It	1
has	1
begun!	1
Here	1
it	1
is!"	1
was	1
seen	1
even	1
on	1
Prince	1
Bagration's	1
hard	1
brown	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
half-closed,	1
dull,	1
sleepy	1
eyes.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gazed	1
with	1
anxious	1
curiosity	1
at	1
that	1
impassive	1
face	1
and	1
wished	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
what,	1
if	1
anything,	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
"Is	1
there	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
behind	1
that	1
impassive	1
face?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
looked.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
sign	1
of	1
agreement	1
with	1
what	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Very	1
good!"	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
imply	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
and	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
foreseen.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
with	1
his	1
rapid	1
ride,	1
spoke	1
quickly.	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
uttering	1
his	1
words	1
with	1
an	1
Oriental	1
accent,	1
spoke	1
particularly	1
slowly,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
impress	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
hurry.	1
However,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
a	1
trot	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Tushin's	1
battery.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
followed	1
with	1
the	1
suite.	1
Behind	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
rode	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
the	1
prince's	1
personal	1
adjutant,	1
Zherkov,	1
an	1
orderly	1
officer,	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
on	1
duty,	1
riding	1
a	1
fine	1
bobtailed	1
horse,	1
and	1
a	1
civilian--an	1
accountant	1
who	1
had	1
asked	1
permission	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity.	1
The	1
accountant,	1
a	1
stout,	1
full-	1
faced	1
man,	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
naive	1
smile	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
presented	1
a	1
strange	1
appearance	1
among	1
the	1
hussars,	1
Cossacks,	1
and	1
adjutants,	1
in	1
his	1
camlet	1
coat,	1
as	1
he	1
jolted	1
on	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
convoy	1
officer's	1
saddle.	1
	1
"He	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
battle,"	1
said	1
Zherkov	1
to	1
Bolkonski,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
accountant,	1
"but	1
he	1
feels	1
a	1
pain	1
in	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
his	1
stomach	1
already."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
leave	1
off!"	1
said	1
the	1
accountant	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
but	1
rather	1
cunning	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
flattered	1
at	1
being	1
made	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
Zherkov's	1
joke,	1
and	1
purposely	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
stupider	1
than	1
he	1
really	1
was.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
strange,	1
mon	1
Monsieur	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer.	1
(He	1
remembered	1
that	1
in	1
French	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
peculiar	1
way	1
of	1
addressing	1
a	1
prince,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
it	1
quite	1
right.)	1
	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
approaching	1
Tushin's	1
battery,	1
and	1
a	1
ball	1
struck	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"What's	1
that	1
that	1
has	1
fallen?"	1
asked	1
the	1
accountant	1
with	1
a	1
naive	1
smile.	1
	1
"A	1
French	1
pancake,"	1
answered	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"So	1
that's	1
what	1
they	1
hit	1
with?"	1
asked	1
the	1
accountant.	1
"How	1
awful!"	1
	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
swell	1
with	1
satisfaction.	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
finished	1
speaking	1
when	1
they	1
again	1
heard	1
an	1
unexpectedly	1
violent	1
whistling	1
which	1
suddenly	1
ended	1
with	1
a	1
thud	1
into	1
something	1
soft...	1
f-f-flop!	1
and	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
riding	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
their	1
right	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
accountant,	1
crashed	1
to	1
earth	1
with	1
his	1
horse.	1
Zherkov	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
bent	1
over	1
their	1
saddles	1
and	1
turned	1
their	1
horses	1
away.	1
The	1
accountant	1
stopped,	1
facing	1
the	1
Cossack,	1
and	1
examined	1
him	1
with	1
attentive	1
curiosity.	1
The	1
Cossack	1
was	1
dead,	1
but	1
the	1
horse	1
still	1
struggled.	1
	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
looked	1
round,	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
confusion,	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
indifference,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say,	1
"Is	1
it	1
worth	1
while	1
noticing	1
trifles?"	1
He	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
a	1
skillful	1
rider	1
and,	1
slightly	1
bending	1
over,	1
disengaged	1
his	1
saber	1
which	1
had	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
cloak.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
old-fashioned	1
saber	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
general	1
use.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remembered	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Suvorov	1
giving	1
his	1
saber	1
to	1
Bagration	1
in	1
Italy,	1
and	1
the	1
recollection	1
was	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
They	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
battery	1
at	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
	1
"Whose	1
company?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
of	1
an	1
artilleryman	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
ammunition	1
wagon.	1
	1
He	1
asked,	1
"Whose	1
company?"	1
but	1
he	1
really	1
meant,	1
"Are	1
you	1
frightened	1
here?"	1
and	1
the	1
artilleryman	1
understood	1
him.	1
	1
"Captain	1
Tushin's,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
red-haired,	1
freckled	1
gunner	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
voice,	1
standing	1
to	1
attention.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
muttered	1
Bagration	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
something,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
past	1
the	1
limbers	1
to	1
the	1
farthest	1
cannon.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
approached,	1
a	1
ringing	1
shot	1
issued	1
from	1
it	1
deafening	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
suite,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
smoke	1
that	1
suddenly	1
surrounded	1
the	1
gun	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
gunners	1
who	1
had	1
seized	1
it	1
straining	1
to	1
roll	1
it	1
quickly	1
back	1
to	1
its	1
former	1
position.	1
A	1
huge,	1
broad-shouldered	1
gunner,	1
Number	1
One,	1
holding	1
a	1
mop,	1
his	1
legs	1
far	1
apart,	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
wheel;	1
while	1
Number	1
Two	1
with	1
a	1
trembling	1
hand	1
placed	1
a	1
charge	1
in	1
the	1
cannon's	1
mouth.	1
The	1
short,	1
round-	1
shouldered	1
Captain	1
Tushin,	1
stumbling	1
over	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
gun	1
carriage,	1
moved	1
forward	1
and,	1
not	1
noticing	1
the	1
general,	1
looked	1
out	1
shading	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
hand.	1
	1
"Lift	1
it	1
two	1
lines	1
more	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
right,"	1
cried	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
feeble	1
voice	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
impart	1
a	1
dashing	1
note,	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
his	1
weak	1
figure.	1
"Number	1
Two!"	1
he	1
squeaked.	1
"Fire,	1
Medvedev!"	1
	1
Bagration	1
called	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
Tushin,	1
raising	1
three	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
bashful	1
and	1
awkward	1
gesture	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
a	1
military	1
salute	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
priest's	1
benediction,	1
approached	1
the	1
general.	1
Though	1
Tushin's	1
guns	1
had	1
been	1
intended	1
to	1
cannonade	1
the	1
valley,	1
he	1
was	1
firing	1
incendiary	1
balls	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
visible	1
just	1
opposite,	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
which	1
large	1
masses	1
of	1
French	1
were	1
advancing.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
given	1
Tushin	1
orders	1
where	1
and	1
at	1
what	1
to	1
fire,	1
but	1
after	1
consulting	1
his	1
sergeant	1
major,	1
Zakharchenko,	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
respect,	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
to	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
village.	1
"Very	1
good!"	1
said	1
Bagration	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
officer's	1
report,	1
and	1
began	1
deliberately	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
whole	1
battlefield	1
extended	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
advanced	1
nearest	1
on	1
our	1
right.	1
Below	1
the	1
height	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Kiev	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed,	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
where	1
the	1
rivulet	1
flowed,	1
the	1
soul-stirring	1
rolling	1
and	1
crackling	1
of	1
musketry	1
was	1
heard,	1
and	1
much	1
farther	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
beyond	1
the	1
dragoons,	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
Bagration	1
a	1
French	1
column	1
that	1
was	1
outflanking	1
us.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
the	1
horizon	1
bounded	1
by	1
the	1
adjacent	1
wood.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
ordered	1
two	1
battalions	1
from	1
the	1
center	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
reinforce	1
the	1
right	1
flank.	1
The	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
ventured	1
to	1
remark	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
if	1
these	1
battalions	1
went	1
away,	1
the	1
guns	1
would	1
remain	1
without	1
support.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
dull	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
that	1
the	1
officer's	1
remark	1
was	1
just	1
and	1
that	1
really	1
no	1
answer	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
it.	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
and	1
news	1
that	1
immense	1
masses	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
coming	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
regiment	1
was	1
in	1
disorder	1
and	1
was	1
retreating	1
upon	1
the	1
Kiev	1
grenadiers.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
sign	1
of	1
assent	1
and	1
approval.	1
He	1
rode	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
sent	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
the	1
dragoons	1
with	1
orders	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French.	1
But	1
this	1
adjutant	1
returned	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
dragoons	1
had	1
already	1
retreated	1
beyond	1
the	1
dip	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
as	1
a	1
heavy	1
fire	1
had	1
been	1
opened	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
losing	1
men	1
uselessly,	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
hastened	1
to	1
throw	1
some	1
sharpshooters	1
into	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
"Very	1
good!"	1
said	1
Bagration.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
battery,	1
firing	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
also,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
himself,	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
sent	1
Zherkov	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
command	1
(the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
paraded	1
his	1
regiment	1
before	1
Kutuzov	1
at	1
Braunau)	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
retreat	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
behind	1
the	1
hollow	1
in	1
the	1
rear,	1
as	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
would	1
probably	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
the	1
enemy's	1
attack	1
very	1
long.	1
About	1
Tushin	1
and	1
the	1
battalion	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
battery	1
all	1
was	1
forgotten.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
Bagration's	1
colloquies	1
with	1
the	1
commanding	1
officers	1
and	1
the	1
orders	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
and,	1
to	1
his	1
surprise,	1
found	1
that	1
no	1
orders	1
were	1
really	1
given,	1
but	1
that	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
appear	1
that	1
everything	1
done	1
by	1
necessity,	1
by	1
accident,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
subordinate	1
commanders	1
was	1
done,	1
if	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
direct	1
command,	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
his	1
intentions.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
noticed,	1
however,	1
that	1
though	1
what	1
happened	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
chance	1
and	1
was	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
commander's	1
will,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
tact	1
Bagration	1
showed,	1
his	1
presence	1
was	1
very	1
valuable.	1
Officers	1
who	1
approached	1
him	1
with	1
disturbed	1
countenances	1
became	1
calm;	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
greeted	1
him	1
gaily,	1
grew	1
more	1
cheerful	1
in	1
his	1
presence,	1
and	1
were	1
evidently	1
anxious	1
to	1
display	1
their	1
courage	1
before	1
him.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
highest	1
point	1
of	1
our	1
right	1
flank,	1
began	1
riding	1
downhill	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
musketry	1
was	1
heard	1
but	1
where	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
The	1
nearer	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
hollow	1
the	1
less	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
felt	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
the	1
actual	1
battlefield.	1
They	1
began	1
to	1
meet	1
wounded	1
men.	1
One	1
with	1
a	1
bleeding	1
head	1
and	1
no	1
cap	1
was	1
being	1
dragged	1
along	1
by	1
two	1
soldiers	1
who	1
supported	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
arms.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
gurgle	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
spitting	1
blood.	1
A	1
bullet	1
had	1
evidently	1
hit	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
throat	1
or	1
mouth.	1
Another	1
was	1
walking	1
sturdily	1
by	1
himself	1
but	1
without	1
his	1
musket,	1
groaning	1
aloud	1
and	1
swinging	1
his	1
arm	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
hurt,	1
while	1
blood	1
from	1
it	1
was	1
streaming	1
over	1
his	1
greatcoat	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
bottle.	1
He	1
had	1
that	1
moment	1
been	1
wounded	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
showed	1
fear	1
rather	1
than	1
suffering.	1
Crossing	1
a	1
road	1
they	1
descended	1
a	1
steep	1
incline	1
and	1
saw	1
several	1
men	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
ground;	1
they	1
also	1
met	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
unwounded.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
were	1
ascending	1
the	1
hill	1
breathing	1
heavily,	1
and	1
despite	1
the	1
general's	1
presence	1
were	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
gesticulating.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
rows	1
of	1
gray	1
cloaks	1
were	1
already	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
Bagration	1
rushed	1
shouting	1
after	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
retreating	1
soldiers,	1
ordering	1
them	1
back.	1
Bagration	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
along	1
which	1
shots	1
crackled	1
now	1
here	1
and	1
now	1
there,	1
drowning	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
and	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
command.	1
The	1
whole	1
air	1
reeked	1
with	1
smoke.	1
The	1
excited	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
blackened	1
with	1
it.	1
Some	1
were	1
using	1
their	1
ramrods,	1
others	1
putting	1
powder	1
on	1
the	1
touchpans	1
or	1
taking	1
charges	1
from	1
their	1
pouches,	1
while	1
others	1
were	1
firing,	1
though	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
for	1
the	1
smoke	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
wind	1
to	1
carry	1
away.	1
A	1
pleasant	1
humming	1
and	1
whistling	1
of	1
bullets	1
were	1
often	1
heard.	1
"What	1
is	1
this?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
approaching	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers.	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
an	1
attack,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
moving;	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
a	1
square--for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
drawn	1
up	1
for	1
that."	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment,	1
a	1
thin,	1
feeble-looking	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile--his	1
eyelids	1
drooping	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
over	1
his	1
old	1
eyes,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
mild	1
expression,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Bagration	1
and	1
welcomed	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
host	1
welcomes	1
an	1
honored	1
guest.	1
He	1
reported	1
that	1
his	1
regiment	1
had	1
been	1
attacked	1
by	1
French	1
cavalry	1
and	1
that,	1
though	1
the	1
attack	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed,	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
his	1
men.	1
He	1
said	1
the	1
attack	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed,	1
employing	1
this	1
military	1
term	1
to	1
describe	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
his	1
regiment,	1
but	1
in	1
reality	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
during	1
that	1
half-hour	1
to	1
the	1
troops	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
with	1
certainty	1
whether	1
the	1
attack	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed	1
or	1
his	1
regiment	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
up.	1
All	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
balls	1
and	1
shells	1
began	1
flying	1
all	1
over	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
hitting	1
men	1
and	1
that	1
afterwards	1
someone	1
had	1
shouted	1
"Cavalry!"	1
and	1
our	1
men	1
had	1
begun	1
firing.	1
They	1
were	1
still	1
firing,	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
cavalry	1
which	1
had	1
disappeared,	1
but	1
at	1
French	1
infantry	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
hollow	1
and	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
our	1
men.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
desired	1
and	1
expected.	1
Turning	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant	1
he	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
two	1
battalions	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Chasseurs	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
passed.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
changed	1
expression	1
on	1
Prince	1
Bagration's	1
face	1
at	1
this	1
moment.	1
It	1
expressed	1
the	1
concentrated	1
and	1
happy	1
resolution	1
you	1
see	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
day	1
takes	1
a	1
final	1
run	1
before	1
plunging	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
dull,	1
sleepy	1
expression	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there,	1
nor	1
the	1
affectation	1
of	1
profound	1
thought.	1
The	1
round,	1
steady,	1
hawk's	1
eyes	1
looked	1
before	1
him	1
eagerly	1
and	1
rather	1
disdainfully,	1
not	1
resting	1
on	1
anything	1
although	1
his	1
movements	1
were	1
still	1
slow	1
and	1
measured.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
turned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
dangerous	1
to	1
remain	1
where	1
they	1
were.	1
"Please,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
he	1
kept	1
saying,	1
glancing	1
for	1
support	1
at	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
who	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
"There,	1
you	1
see!"	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
bullets	1
whistling,	1
singing,	1
and	1
hissing	1
continually	1
around	1
them.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
entreaty	1
and	1
reproach	1
that	1
a	1
carpenter	1
uses	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
has	1
picked	1
up	1
an	1
ax:	1
"We	1
are	1
used	1
to	1
it,	1
but	1
you,	1
sir,	1
will	1
blister	1
your	1
hands."	1
He	1
spoke	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
bullets	1
could	1
not	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
gave	1
still	1
more	1
persuasiveness	1
to	1
his	1
words.	1
The	1
staff	1
officer	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
colonel's	1
appeals,	1
but	1
Bagration	1
did	1
not	1
reply;	1
he	1
only	1
gave	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
cease	1
firing	1
and	1
re-form,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
approaching	1
battalions.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
speaking,	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
smoke	1
that	1
had	1
concealed	1
the	1
hollow,	1
driven	1
by	1
a	1
rising	1
wind,	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
as	1
if	1
drawn	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
hill	1
opposite,	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
moving	1
about	1
on	1
it,	1
opened	1
out	1
before	1
them.	1
All	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
involuntarily	1
on	1
this	1
French	1
column	1
advancing	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
winding	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
uneven	1
ground.	1
One	1
could	1
already	1
see	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
shaggy	1
caps,	1
distinguish	1
the	1
officers	1
from	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
standard	1
flapping	1
against	1
its	1
staff.	1
	1
"They	1
march	1
splendidly,"	1
remarked	1
someone	1
in	1
Bagration's	1
suite.	1
	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
column	1
had	1
already	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
hollow.	1
The	1
clash	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
it...	1
	1
The	1
remains	1
of	1
our	1
regiment	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
action	1
rapidly	1
formed	1
up	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
right;	1
from	1
behind	1
it,	1
dispersing	1
the	1
laggards,	1
came	1
two	1
battalions	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Chasseurs	1
in	1
fine	1
order.	1
Before	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
Bagration,	1
the	1
weighty	1
tread	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
men	1
marching	1
in	1
step	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
On	1
their	1
left	1
flank,	1
nearest	1
to	1
Bagration,	1
marched	1
a	1
company	1
commander,	1
a	1
fine	1
round-faced	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
stupid	1
and	1
happy	1
expression--the	1
same	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wattle	1
shed.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
clearly	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
how	1
dashing	1
a	1
fellow	1
he	1
would	1
appear	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
the	1
commander.	1
	1
With	1
the	1
self-satisfaction	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
parade,	1
he	1
stepped	1
lightly	1
with	1
his	1
muscular	1
legs	1
as	1
if	1
sailing	1
along,	1
stretching	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
full	1
height	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
effort,	1
his	1
ease	1
contrasting	1
with	1
the	1
heavy	1
tread	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
keeping	1
step	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
carried	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
leg	1
a	1
narrow	1
unsheathed	1
sword	1
(small,	1
curved,	1
and	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
real	1
weapon)	1
and	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
superior	1
officers	1
and	1
now	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
without	1
losing	1
step,	1
his	1
whole	1
powerful	1
body	1
turning	1
flexibly.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
were	1
concentrated	1
on	1
passing	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
manner,	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
it	1
well	1
he	1
was	1
happy.	1
"Left...	1
left...	1
left..."	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
repeat	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
each	1
alternate	1
step;	1
and	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
this,	1
with	1
stern	1
but	1
varied	1
faces,	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
soldiers	1
burdened	1
with	1
knapsacks	1
and	1
muskets	1
marched	1
in	1
step,	1
and	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
hundreds	1
of	1
soldiers	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
each	1
alternate	1
step,	1
"Left...	1
left...	1
left..."	1
A	1
fat	1
major	1
skirted	1
a	1
bush,	1
puffing	1
and	1
falling	1
out	1
of	1
step;	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind,	1
his	1
face	1
showing	1
alarm	1
at	1
his	1
defection,	1
ran	1
at	1
a	1
trot,	1
panting	1
to	1
catch	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
company.	1
A	1
cannon	1
ball,	1
cleaving	1
the	1
air,	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
Bagration	1
and	1
his	1
suite,	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
column	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
"Left...	1
left!"	1
"Close	1
up!"	1
came	1
the	1
company	1
commander's	1
voice	1
in	1
jaunty	1
tones.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
passed	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle	1
round	1
something	1
where	1
the	1
ball	1
had	1
fallen,	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
trooper	1
on	1
the	1
flank,	1
a	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
stopped	1
beside	1
the	1
dead	1
men,	1
ran	1
to	1
catch	1
up	1
his	1
line	1
and,	1
falling	1
into	1
step	1
with	1
a	1
hop,	1
looked	1
back	1
angrily,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
ominous	1
silence	1
and	1
the	1
regular	1
tramp	1
of	1
feet	1
beating	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
unison,	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
left...	1
left...	1
left.	1
	1
"Well	1
done,	1
lads!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
	1
"Glad	1
to	1
do	1
our	1
best,	1
your	1
ex'len-lency!"	1
came	1
a	1
confused	1
shout	1
from	1
the	1
ranks.	1
A	1
morose	1
soldier	1
marching	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Bagration	1
as	1
he	1
shouted,	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"We	1
know	1
that	1
ourselves!"	1
Another,	1
without	1
looking	1
round,	1
as	1
though	1
fearing	1
to	1
relax,	1
shouted	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
wide	1
open	1
and	1
passed	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
order	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
halt	1
and	1
down	1
knapsacks.	1
	1
Bagration	1
rode	1
round	1
the	1
ranks	1
that	1
had	1
marched	1
past	1
him	1
and	1
dismounted.	1
He	1
gave	1
the	1
reins	1
to	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
took	1
off	1
and	1
handed	1
over	1
his	1
felt	1
coat,	1
stretched	1
his	1
legs,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
cap	1
straight.	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
column,	1
with	1
its	1
officers	1
leading,	1
appeared	1
from	1
below	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
"Forward,	1
with	1
God!"	1
said	1
Bagration,	1
in	1
a	1
resolute,	1
sonorous	1
voice,	1
turning	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
line,	1
and	1
slightly	1
swinging	1
his	1
arms,	1
he	1
went	1
forward	1
uneasily	1
over	1
the	1
rough	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
awkward	1
gait	1
of	1
a	1
cavalryman.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
an	1
invisible	1
power	1
was	1
leading	1
him	1
forward,	1
and	1
experienced	1
great	1
happiness.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
already	1
near.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
walking	1
beside	1
Bagration,	1
could	1
clearly	1
distinguish	1
their	1
bandoliers,	1
red	1
epaulets,	1
and	1
even	1
their	1
faces.	1
(He	1
distinctly	1
saw	1
an	1
old	1
French	1
officer	1
who,	1
with	1
gaitered	1
legs	1
and	1
turned-out	1
toes,	1
climbed	1
the	1
hill	1
with	1
difficulty.)	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
gave	1
no	1
further	1
orders	1
and	1
silently	1
continued	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
ranks.	1
Suddenly	1
one	1
shot	1
after	1
another	1
rang	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
smoke	1
appeared	1
all	1
along	1
their	1
uneven	1
ranks,	1
and	1
musket	1
shots	1
sounded.	1
Several	1
of	1
our	1
men	1
fell,	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
round-faced	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
marched	1
so	1
gaily	1
and	1
complacently.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
first	1
report	1
was	1
heard,	1
Bagration	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
shouted,	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
"Hurrah--ah!--ah!"	1
rang	1
a	1
long-drawn	1
shout	1
from	1
our	1
ranks,	1
and	1
passing	1
Bagration	1
and	1
racing	1
one	1
another	1
they	1
rushed	1
in	1
an	1
irregular	1
but	1
joyous	1
and	1
eager	1
crowd	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
their	1
disordered	1
foe.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
The	1
attack	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Chasseurs	1
secured	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
our	1
right	1
flank.	1
In	1
the	1
center	1
Tushin's	1
forgotten	1
battery,	1
which	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
village,	1
delayed	1
the	1
French	1
advance.	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
putting	1
out	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
spreading,	1
and	1
thus	1
gave	1
us	1
time	1
to	1
retreat.	1
The	1
retirement	1
of	1
the	1
center	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
dip	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
the	1
rear	1
was	1
hurried	1
and	1
noisy,	1
but	1
the	1
different	1
companies	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
mixed.	1
But	1
our	1
left--which	1
consisted	1
of	1
the	1
Azov	1
and	1
Podolsk	1
infantry	1
and	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars--was	1
simultaneously	1
attacked	1
and	1
outflanked	1
by	1
superior	1
French	1
forces	1
under	1
Lannes	1
and	1
was	1
thrown	1
into	1
confusion.	1
Bagration	1
had	1
sent	1
Zherkov	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
commanding	1
that	1
left	1
flank	1
with	1
orders	1
to	1
retreat	1
immediately.	1
	1
Zherkov,	1
not	1
removing	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
his	1
cap,	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
about	1
and	1
galloped	1
off.	1
But	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
Bagration	1
than	1
his	1
courage	1
failed	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
panic	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
dangerous.	1
	1
Having	1
reached	1
the	1
left	1
flank,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
where	1
the	1
firing	1
was,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
his	1
staff	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
be,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
deliver	1
the	1
order.	1
	1
The	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
belonged	1
by	1
seniority	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
reviewed	1
at	1
Braunau	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
serving	1
as	1
a	1
private.	1
But	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
extreme	1
left	1
flank	1
had	1
been	1
assigned	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
was	1
serving,	1
and	1
a	1
misunderstanding	1
arose.	1
The	1
two	1
commanders	1
were	1
much	1
exasperated	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
and,	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
action	1
had	1
begun	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
already	1
advancing,	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
discussion	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
offending	1
one	1
another.	1
But	1
the	1
regiments,	1
both	1
cavalry	1
and	1
infantry,	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
impending	1
action.	1
From	1
privates	1
to	1
general	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
expecting	1
a	1
battle	1
and	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
peaceful	1
occupations,	1
the	1
cavalry	1
feeding	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
infantry	1
collecting	1
wood.	1
	1
"He	1
higher	1
iss	1
dan	1
I	1
in	1
rank,"	1
said	1
the	1
German	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
hussars,	1
flushing	1
and	1
addressing	1
an	1
adjutant	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
up,	1
"so	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
vill,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
hussars...	1
Bugler,	1
sount	1
ze	1
retreat!"	1
	1
But	1
haste	1
was	1
becoming	1
imperative.	1
Cannon	1
and	1
musketry,	1
mingling	1
together,	1
thundered	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
center,	1
while	1
the	1
capotes	1
of	1
Lannes'	1
sharpshooters	1
were	1
already	1
seen	1
crossing	1
the	1
milldam	1
and	1
forming	1
up	1
within	1
twice	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
a	1
musket	1
shot.	1
The	1
general	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
went	1
toward	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
jerky	1
steps,	1
and	1
having	1
mounted	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
very	1
straight	1
and	1
tall	1
and	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
commander.	1
The	1
commanders	1
met	1
with	1
polite	1
bows	1
but	1
with	1
secret	1
malevolence	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
"Once	1
again,	1
Colonel,"	1
said	1
the	1
general,	1
"I	1
can't	1
leave	1
half	1
my	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
wood.	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
you,"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
"to	1
occupy	1
the	1
position	1
and	1
prepare	1
for	1
an	1
attack."	1
	1
"I	1
peg	1
of	1
you	1
yourself	1
not	1
to	1
mix	1
in	1
vot	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
business!"	1
suddenly	1
replied	1
the	1
irate	1
colonel.	1
"If	1
you	1
vere	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry..."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry,	1
Colonel,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Russian	1
general	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
fact..."	1
	1
"Quite	1
avare,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
suddenly	1
shouted	1
the	1
colonel,	1
touching	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
turning	1
purple	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
"Vill	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
goot	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
ze	1
front	1
and	1
see	1
dat	1
zis	1
position	1
iss	1
no	1
goot?	1
I	1
don't	1
vish	1
to	1
destroy	1
my	1
men	1
for	1
your	1
pleasure!"	1
	1
"You	1
forget	1
yourself,	1
Colonel.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
considering	1
my	1
own	1
pleasure	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
allow	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
said!"	1
	1
Taking	1
the	1
colonel's	1
outburst	1
as	1
a	1
challenge	1
to	1
his	1
courage,	1
the	1
general	1
expanded	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
rode,	1
frowning,	1
beside	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
line,	1
as	1
if	1
their	1
differences	1
would	1
be	1
settled	1
there	1
amongst	1
the	1
bullets.	1
They	1
reached	1
the	1
front,	1
several	1
bullets	1
sped	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
halted	1
in	1
silence.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
fresh	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
line,	1
for	1
from	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
cavalry	1
to	1
act	1
among	1
the	1
bushes	1
and	1
broken	1
ground,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
outflanking	1
our	1
left.	1
The	1
general	1
and	1
colonel	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
significantly	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
like	1
two	1
fighting	1
cocks	1
preparing	1
for	1
battle,	1
each	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
detect	1
signs	1
of	1
cowardice	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
Both	1
passed	1
the	1
examination	1
successfully.	1
As	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
said,	1
and	1
neither	1
wished	1
to	1
give	1
occasion	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
alleged	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
fire,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
testing	1
each	1
other's	1
courage	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
that	1
just	1
then	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
musketry	1
and	1
a	1
muffled	1
shout	1
almost	1
behind	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wood.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
men	1
collecting	1
wood	1
in	1
the	1
copse.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible	1
for	1
the	1
hussars	1
to	1
retreat	1
with	1
the	1
infantry.	1
They	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
retreat	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
French.	1
However	1
inconvenient	1
the	1
position,	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
necessary	1
to	1
attack	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
cut	1
a	1
way	1
through	1
for	1
themselves.	1
	1
The	1
squadron	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
was	1
serving	1
had	1
scarcely	1
time	1
to	1
mount	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
halted	1
facing	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Again,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
Enns	1
bridge,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
between	1
the	1
squadron	1
and	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
again	1
that	1
terrible	1
dividing	1
line	1
of	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
fear--resembling	1
the	1
line	1
separating	1
the	1
living	1
from	1
the	1
dead--lay	1
between	1
them.	1
All	1
were	1
conscious	1
of	1
this	1
unseen	1
line,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
cross	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
cross	1
it,	1
agitated	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
angrily	1
gave	1
some	1
reply	1
to	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
officers,	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
desperately	1
insisting	1
on	1
having	1
his	1
own	1
way,	1
gave	1
an	1
order.	1
No	1
one	1
said	1
anything	1
definite,	1
but	1
the	1
rumor	1
of	1
an	1
attack	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
squadron.	1
The	1
command	1
to	1
form	1
up	1
rang	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
sabers	1
whizzed	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
drawn	1
from	1
their	1
scabbards.	1
Still	1
no	1
one	1
moved.	1
The	1
troops	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
flank,	1
infantry	1
and	1
hussars	1
alike,	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
this	1
irresolution	1
communicated	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
men.	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
quick!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
feeling	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
experience	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
fellow	1
hussars.	1
	1
"Fo'ward,	1
with	1
God,	1
lads!"	1
rang	1
out	1
Denisov's	1
voice.	1
"At	1
a	1
twot	1
fo'ward!"	1
	1
The	1
horses'	1
croups	1
began	1
to	1
sway	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line.	1
Rook	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
started	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord.	1
	1
Before	1
him,	1
on	1
the	1
right,	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
front	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
hussars	1
and	1
still	1
farther	1
ahead	1
a	1
dark	1
line	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
distinctly	1
but	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Shots	1
could	1
be	1
heard,	1
but	1
some	1
way	1
off.	1
	1
"Faster!"	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
Rook's	1
flanks	1
drooping	1
as	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
gallop.	1
	1
Rostov	1
anticipated	1
his	1
horse's	1
movements	1
and	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
elated.	1
He	1
had	1
noticed	1
a	1
solitary	1
tree	1
ahead	1
of	1
him.	1
This	1
tree	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
so	1
terrible--and	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
crossed	1
that	1
line	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
there	1
nothing	1
terrible,	1
but	1
everything	1
was	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
happy	1
and	1
animated.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
I	1
will	1
slash	1
at	1
him!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
gripping	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
saber.	1
	1
"Hur-a-a-a-ah!"	1
came	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
voices.	1
"Let	1
anyone	1
come	1
my	1
way	1
now,"	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
driving	1
his	1
spurs	1
into	1
Rook	1
and	1
letting	1
him	1
go	1
at	1
a	1
full	1
gallop	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
outstripped	1
the	1
others.	1
Ahead,	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
already	1
visible.	1
Suddenly	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
birch	1
broom	1
seemed	1
to	1
sweep	1
over	1
the	1
squadron.	1
Rostov	1
raised	1
his	1
saber,	1
ready	1
to	1
strike,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
trooper	1
Nikitenko,	1
who	1
was	1
galloping	1
ahead,	1
shot	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
forward	1
with	1
unnatural	1
speed	1
but	1
yet	1
stayed	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
spot.	1
From	1
behind	1
him	1
Bondarchuk,	1
an	1
hussar	1
he	1
knew,	1
jolted	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
him.	1
Bondarchuk's	1
horse	1
swerved	1
and	1
galloped	1
past.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
moving?	1
I	1
have	1
fallen,	1
I	1
am	1
killed!"	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
and	1
answered	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant.	1
He	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
field.	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
horses	1
and	1
hussars'	1
backs,	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
motionless	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
stubble	1
around	1
him.	1
There	1
was	1
warm	1
blood	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
wounded	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
is	1
killed."	1
Rook	1
tried	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
his	1
forelegs	1
but	1
fell	1
back,	1
pinning	1
his	1
rider's	1
leg.	1
Blood	1
was	1
flowing	1
from	1
his	1
head;	1
he	1
struggled	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
rise.	1
Rostov	1
also	1
tried	1
to	1
rise	1
but	1
fell	1
back,	1
his	1
sabretache	1
having	1
become	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
saddle.	1
Where	1
our	1
men	1
were,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
French,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
near.	1
	1
Having	1
disentangled	1
his	1
leg,	1
he	1
rose.	1
"Where,	1
on	1
which	1
side,	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
line	1
that	1
had	1
so	1
sharply	1
divided	1
the	1
two	1
armies?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
answer.	1
"Can	1
something	1
bad	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
me?"	1
he	1
wondered	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
up:	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
superfluous	1
was	1
hanging	1
on	1
his	1
benumbed	1
left	1
arm.	1
The	1
wrist	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
his.	1
He	1
examined	1
his	1
hand	1
carefully,	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
blood	1
on	1
it.	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
are	1
people	1
coming,"	1
he	1
thought	1
joyfully,	1
seeing	1
some	1
men	1
running	1
toward	1
him.	1
"They	1
will	1
help	1
me!"	1
In	1
front	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
wearing	1
a	1
strange	1
shako	1
and	1
a	1
blue	1
cloak,	1
swarthy,	1
sunburned,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
hooked	1
nose.	1
Then	1
came	1
two	1
more,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
running	1
behind.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
something	1
strange,	1
not	1
in	1
Russian.	1
In	1
among	1
the	1
hindmost	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
wearing	1
similar	1
shakos	1
was	1
a	1
Russian	1
hussar.	1
He	1
was	1
being	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
arms	1
and	1
his	1
horse	1
was	1
being	1
led	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
ours,	1
a	1
prisoner.	1
Yes.	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
too?	1
Who	1
are	1
these	1
men?"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
scarcely	1
believing	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Can	1
they	1
be	1
French?"	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
approaching	1
Frenchmen,	1
and	1
though	1
but	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
galloping	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
hack	1
them	1
to	1
pieces,	1
their	1
proximity	1
now	1
seemed	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Who	1
are	1
they?	1
Why	1
are	1
they	1
running?	1
Can	1
they	1
be	1
coming	1
at	1
me?	1
And	1
why?	1
To	1
kill	1
me?	1
Me	1
whom	1
everyone	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of?"	1
He	1
remembered	1
his	1
mother's	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
family's,	1
and	1
his	1
friends',	1
and	1
the	1
enemy's	1
intention	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
seemed	1
impossible.	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
it!"	1
For	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
seconds	1
he	1
stood	1
not	1
moving	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
or	1
realizing	1
the	1
situation.	1
The	1
foremost	1
Frenchman,	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
hooked	1
nose,	1
was	1
already	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
And	1
the	1
excited,	1
alien	1
face	1
of	1
that	1
man,	1
his	1
bayonet	1
hanging	1
down,	1
holding	1
his	1
breath,	1
and	1
running	1
so	1
lightly,	1
frightened	1
Rostov.	1
He	1
seized	1
his	1
pistol	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
firing	1
it,	1
flung	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
toward	1
the	1
bushes.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
run	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
doubt	1
and	1
conflict	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
trodden	1
the	1
Enns	1
bridge,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
hare	1
fleeing	1
from	1
the	1
hounds.	1
One	1
single	1
sentiment,	1
that	1
of	1
fear	1
for	1
his	1
young	1
and	1
happy	1
life,	1
possessed	1
his	1
whole	1
being.	1
Rapidly	1
leaping	1
the	1
furrows,	1
he	1
fled	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
impetuosity	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
show	1
at	1
catchplay,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
his	1
good-natured,	1
pale,	1
young	1
face	1
to	1
look	1
back.	1
A	1
shudder	1
of	1
terror	1
went	1
through	1
him:	1
"No,	1
better	1
not	1
look,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
but	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
bushes	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
once	1
more.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
changed	1
his	1
run	1
to	1
a	1
walk	1
and,	1
turning,	1
shouted	1
something	1
loudly	1
to	1
a	1
comrade	1
farther	1
back.	1
Rostov	1
paused.	1
"No,	1
there's	1
some	1
mistake,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"They	1
can't	1
have	1
wanted	1
to	1
kill	1
me."	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
his	1
left	1
arm	1
felt	1
as	1
heavy	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
seventy-pound	1
weight	1
were	1
tied	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
could	1
run	1
no	1
more.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
also	1
stopped	1
and	1
took	1
aim.	1
Rostov	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
stooped	1
down.	1
One	1
bullet	1
and	1
then	1
another	1
whistled	1
past	1
him.	1
He	1
mustered	1
his	1
last	1
remaining	1
strength,	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
right,	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
bushes.	1
Behind	1
these	1
were	1
some	1
Russian	1
sharpshooters.	1

CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
The	1
infantry	1
regiments	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
unawares	1
in	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
different	1
companies	1
getting	1
mixed,	1
and	1
retreated	1
as	1
a	1
disorderly	1
crowd.	1
One	1
soldier,	1
in	1
his	1
fear,	1
uttered	1
the	1
senseless	1
cry,	1
"Cut	1
off!"	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
terrible	1
in	1
battle,	1
and	1
that	1
word	1
infected	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
panic.	1
	1
"Surrounded!	1
Cut	1
off?	1
We're	1
lost!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
fugitives.	1
	1
The	1
moment	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
firing	1
and	1
the	1
cry	1
from	1
behind,	1
the	1
general	1
realized	1
that	1
something	1
dreadful	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
his	1
regiment,	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he,	1
an	1
exemplary	1
officer	1
of	1
many	1
years'	1
service	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
to	1
blame,	1
might	1
be	1
held	1
responsible	1
at	1
headquarters	1
for	1
negligence	1
or	1
inefficiency	1
so	1
staggered	1
him	1
that,	1
forgetting	1
the	1
recalcitrant	1
cavalry	1
colonel,	1
his	1
own	1
dignity	1
as	1
a	1
general,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
the	1
danger	1
and	1
all	1
regard	1
for	1
self-preservation,	1
he	1
clutched	1
the	1
crupper	1
of	1
his	1
saddle	1
and,	1
spurring	1
his	1
horse,	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
under	1
a	1
hail	1
of	1
bullets	1
which	1
fell	1
around,	1
but	1
fortunately	1
missed	1
him.	1
His	1
one	1
desire	1
was	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
and	1
at	1
any	1
cost	1
correct,	1
or	1
remedy,	1
the	1
mistake	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
one,	1
so	1
that	1
he,	1
an	1
exemplary	1
officer	1
of	1
twenty-two	1
years'	1
service,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
censured,	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
held	1
to	1
blame.	1
	1
Having	1
galloped	1
safely	1
through	1
the	1
French,	1
he	1
reached	1
a	1
field	1
behind	1
the	1
copse	1
across	1
which	1
our	1
men,	1
regardless	1
of	1
orders,	1
were	1
running	1
and	1
descending	1
the	1
valley.	1
That	1
moment	1
of	1
moral	1
hesitation	1
which	1
decides	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
battles	1
had	1
arrived.	1
Would	1
this	1
disorderly	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
their	1
commander,	1
or	1
would	1
they,	1
disregarding	1
him,	1
continue	1
their	1
flight?	1
Despite	1
his	1
desperate	1
shouts	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
seem	1
so	1
terrible	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
despite	1
his	1
furious	1
purple	1
countenance	1
distorted	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
likeness	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
self,	1
and	1
the	1
flourishing	1
of	1
his	1
saber,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
all	1
continued	1
to	1
run,	1
talking,	1
firing	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
disobeying	1
orders.	1
The	1
moral	1
hesitation	1
which	1
decided	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
battles	1
was	1
evidently	1
culminating	1
in	1
a	1
panic.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
had	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
coughing	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
shouting	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
powder	1
smoke	1
and	1
stopped	1
in	1
despair.	1
Everything	1
seemed	1
lost.	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
were	1
attacking,	1
suddenly	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
apparent	1
reason,	1
ran	1
back	1
and	1
disappeared	1
from	1
the	1
outskirts,	1
and	1
Russian	1
sharpshooters	1
showed	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
copse.	1
It	1
was	1
Timokhin's	1
company,	1
which	1
alone	1
had	1
maintained	1
its	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
and,	1
having	1
lain	1
in	1
ambush	1
in	1
a	1
ditch,	1
now	1
attacked	1
the	1
French	1
unexpectedly.	1
Timokhin,	1
armed	1
only	1
with	1
a	1
sword,	1
had	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
enemy	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
desperate	1
cry	1
and	1
such	1
mad,	1
drunken	1
determination	1
that,	1
taken	1
by	1
surprise,	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
thrown	1
down	1
their	1
muskets	1
and	1
run.	1
Dolokhov,	1
running	1
beside	1
Timokhin,	1
killed	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
at	1
close	1
quarters	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
surrendering	1
French	1
officer	1
by	1
his	1
collar.	1
Our	1
fugitives	1
returned,	1
the	1
battalions	1
re-formed,	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
nearly	1
cut	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
in	1
half	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
repulsed.	1
Our	1
reserve	1
units	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
join	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
fight	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
and	1
Major	1
Ekonomov	1
had	1
stopped	1
beside	1
a	1
bridge,	1
letting	1
the	1
retreating	1
companies	1
pass	1
by	1
them,	1
when	1
a	1
soldier	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
commander's	1
stirrup,	1
almost	1
leaning	1
against	1
him.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
bluish	1
coat	1
of	1
broadcloth,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
knapsack	1
or	1
cap,	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
bandaged,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
a	1
French	1
munition	1
pouch	1
was	1
slung.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
officer's	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
soldier	1
was	1
pale,	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
looked	1
impudently	1
into	1
the	1
commander's	1
face,	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
were	1
smiling.	1
Though	1
the	1
commander	1
was	1
occupied	1
in	1
giving	1
instructions	1
to	1
Major	1
Ekonomov,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
taking	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
soldier.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
here	1
are	1
two	1
trophies,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
sword	1
and	1
pouch.	1
"I	1
have	1
taken	1
an	1
officer	1
prisoner.	1
I	1
stopped	1
the	1
company."	1
Dolokhov	1
breathed	1
heavily	1
from	1
weariness	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
abrupt	1
sentences.	1
"The	1
whole	1
company	1
can	1
bear	1
witness.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
remember	1
this,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,"	1
replied	1
the	1
commander,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Major	1
Ekonomov.	1
	1
But	1
Dolokhov	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
away;	1
he	1
untied	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
around	1
his	1
head,	1
pulled	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
blood	1
congealed	1
on	1
his	1
hair.	1
	1
"A	1
bayonet	1
wound.	1
I	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
front.	1
Remember,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
	1
Tushin's	1
battery	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
and	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
did	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
still	1
hearing	1
the	1
cannonade	1
in	1
the	1
center,	1
send	1
his	1
orderly	1
staff	1
officer,	1
and	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
also,	1
to	1
order	1
the	1
battery	1
to	1
retire	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
When	1
the	1
supports	1
attached	1
to	1
Tushin's	1
battery	1
had	1
been	1
moved	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
by	1
someone's	1
order,	1
the	1
battery	1
had	1
continued	1
firing	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
not	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
because	1
the	1
enemy	1
could	1
not	1
surmise	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
effrontery	1
to	1
continue	1
firing	1
from	1
four	1
quite	1
undefended	1
guns.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
energetic	1
action	1
of	1
that	1
battery	1
led	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
here--in	1
the	1
center--the	1
main	1
Russian	1
forces	1
were	1
concentrated.	1
Twice	1
they	1
had	1
attempted	1
to	1
attack	1
this	1
point,	1
but	1
on	1
each	1
occasion	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
back	1
by	1
grapeshot	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
isolated	1
guns	1
on	1
the	1
hillock.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
had	1
left	1
him,	1
Tushin	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
setting	1
fire	1
to	1
Schon	1
Grabern.	1
	1
"Look	1
at	1
them	1
scurrying!	1
It's	1
burning!	1
Just	1
see	1
the	1
smoke!	1
Fine!	1
Grand!	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
smoke,	1
the	1
smoke!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
artillerymen,	1
brightening	1
up.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
guns,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
orders,	1
were	1
being	1
fired	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
conflagration.	1
As	1
if	1
urging	1
each	1
other	1
on,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
cried	1
at	1
each	1
shot:	1
"Fine!	1
That's	1
good!	1
Look	1
at	1
it...	1
Grand!"	1
The	1
fire,	1
fanned	1
by	1
the	1
breeze,	1
was	1
rapidly	1
spreading.	1
The	1
French	1
columns	1
that	1
had	1
advanced	1
beyond	1
the	1
village	1
went	1
back;	1
but	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
revenge	1
for	1
this	1
failure,	1
the	1
enemy	1
placed	1
ten	1
guns	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
began	1
firing	1
them	1
at	1
Tushin's	1
battery.	1
	1
In	1
their	1
childlike	1
glee,	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
their	1
luck	1
in	1
successfully	1
cannonading	1
the	1
French,	1
our	1
artillerymen	1
only	1
noticed	1
this	1
battery	1
when	1
two	1
balls,	1
and	1
then	1
four	1
more,	1
fell	1
among	1
our	1
guns,	1
one	1
knocking	1
over	1
two	1
horses	1
and	1
another	1
tearing	1
off	1
a	1
munition-wagon	1
driver's	1
leg.	1
Their	1
spirits	1
once	1
roused	1
were,	1
however,	1
not	1
diminished,	1
but	1
only	1
changed	1
character.	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
others	1
from	1
a	1
reserve	1
gun	1
carriage,	1
the	1
wounded	1
were	1
carried	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
guns	1
were	1
turned	1
against	1
the	1
ten-gun	1
battery.	1
Tushin's	1
companion	1
officer	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
engagement	1
and	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
seventeen	1
of	1
the	1
forty	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
guns'	1
crews	1
had	1
been	1
disabled,	1
but	1
the	1
artillerymen	1
were	1
still	1
as	1
merry	1
and	1
lively	1
as	1
ever.	1
Twice	1
they	1
noticed	1
the	1
French	1
appearing	1
below	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
fired	1
grapeshot	1
at	1
them.	1
	1
Little	1
Tushin,	1
moving	1
feebly	1
and	1
awkwardly,	1
kept	1
telling	1
his	1
orderly	1
to	1
"refill	1
my	1
pipe	1
for	1
that	1
one!"	1
and	1
then,	1
scattering	1
sparks	1
from	1
it,	1
ran	1
forward	1
shading	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
hand	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
"Smack	1
at	1
'em,	1
lads!"	1
he	1
kept	1
saying,	1
seizing	1
the	1
guns	1
by	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
working	1
the	1
screws	1
himself.	1
	1
Amid	1
the	1
smoke,	1
deafened	1
by	1
the	1
incessant	1
reports	1
which	1
always	1
made	1
him	1
jump,	1
Tushin	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
pipe	1
from	1
his	1
mouth	1
ran	1
from	1
gun	1
to	1
gun,	1
now	1
aiming,	1
now	1
counting	1
the	1
charges,	1
now	1
giving	1
orders	1
about	1
replacing	1
dead	1
or	1
wounded	1
horses	1
and	1
harnessing	1
fresh	1
ones,	1
and	1
shouting	1
in	1
his	1
feeble	1
voice,	1
so	1
high	1
pitched	1
and	1
irresolute.	1
His	1
face	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
Only	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
killed	1
or	1
wounded	1
did	1
he	1
frown	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sight,	1
shouting	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
who,	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case,	1
hesitated	1
about	1
lifting	1
the	1
injured	1
or	1
dead.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
handsome	1
fellows	1
and,	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
an	1
artillery	1
company,	1
a	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders	1
taller	1
and	1
twice	1
as	1
broad	1
as	1
their	1
officer--all	1
looked	1
at	1
their	1
commander	1
like	1
children	1
in	1
an	1
embarrassing	1
situation,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
invariably	1
reflected	1
on	1
theirs.	1
	1
Owing	1
to	1
the	1
terrible	1
uproar	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
concentration	1
and	1
activity,	1
Tushin	1
did	1
not	1
experience	1
the	1
slightest	1
unpleasant	1
sense	1
of	1
fear,	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
killed	1
or	1
badly	1
wounded	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
elated.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time	1
ago,	1
almost	1
a	1
day,	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
seen	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
fired	1
the	1
first	1
shot,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
he	1
stood	1
on	1
was	1
well-known	1
and	1
familiar	1
ground.	1
Though	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
everything,	1
considered	1
everything,	1
and	1
did	1
everything	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
officers	1
could	1
do	1
in	1
his	1
position,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
akin	1
to	1
feverish	1
delirium	1
or	1
drunkenness.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
deafening	1
sounds	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
guns	1
around	1
him,	1
the	1
whistle	1
and	1
thud	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
cannon	1
balls,	1
from	1
the	1
flushed	1
and	1
perspiring	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
bustling	1
round	1
the	1
guns,	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
horses,	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
puffs	1
of	1
smoke	1
on	1
the	1
enemy's	1
side	1
(always	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
ball	1
flying	1
past	1
and	1
striking	1
the	1
earth,	1
a	1
man,	1
a	1
gun,	1
a	1
horse),	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
a	1
fantastic	1
world	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
brain	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
afforded	1
him	1
pleasure.	1
The	1
enemy's	1
guns	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
fancy	1
not	1
guns	1
but	1
pipes	1
from	1
which	1
occasional	1
puffs	1
were	1
blown	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
smoker.	1
	1
"There...	1
he's	1
puffing	1
again,"	1
muttered	1
Tushin	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
a	1
small	1
cloud	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
was	1
borne	1
in	1
a	1
streak	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
"Now	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
ball...	1
we'll	1
throw	1
it	1
back."	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
your	1
honor?"	1
asked	1
an	1
artilleryman,	1
standing	1
close	1
by,	1
who	1
heard	1
him	1
muttering.	1
	1
"Nothing...	1
only	1
a	1
shell..."	1
he	1
answered.	1
	1
"Come	1
along,	1
our	1
Matvevna!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Matvevna"	1
*	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
his	1
fancy	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
farthest	1
gun	1
of	1
the	1
battery,	1
which	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
pattern.	1
The	1
French	1
swarming	1
round	1
their	1
guns	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
ants.	1
In	1
that	1
world,	1
the	1
handsome	1
drunkard	1
Number	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
gun's	1
crew	1
was	1
"uncle";	1
Tushin	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
at	1
anyone	1
else	1
and	1
took	1
delight	1
in	1
his	1
every	1
movement.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
musketry	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
now	1
diminishing,	1
now	1
increasing,	1
seemed	1
like	1
someone's	1
breathing.	1
He	1
listened	1
intently	1
to	1
the	1
ebb	1
and	1
flow	1
of	1
these	1
sounds.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Daughter	1
of	1
Matthew.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
Breathing	1
again,	1
breathing!"	1
he	1
muttered	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
He	1
imagined	1
himself	1
as	1
an	1
enormously	1
tall,	1
powerful	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
throwing	1
cannon	1
balls	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
both	1
hands.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
Matvevna,	1
dear	1
old	1
lady,	1
don't	1
let	1
me	1
down!"	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
gun,	1
when	1
a	1
strange,	1
unfamiliar	1
voice	1
called	1
above	1
his	1
head:	1
"Captain	1
Tushin!	1
Captain!"	1
	1
Tushin	1
turned	1
round	1
in	1
dismay.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
turned	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
booth	1
at	1
Grunth.	1
He	1
was	1
shouting	1
in	1
a	1
gasping	1
voice:	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
mad?	1
You	1
have	1
twice	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
retreat,	1
and	1
you..."	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
they	1
down	1
on	1
me?"	1
thought	1
Tushin,	1
looking	1
in	1
alarm	1
at	1
his	1
superior.	1
	1
"I...	1
don't..."	1
he	1
muttered,	1
holding	1
up	1
two	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
cap.	1
"I..."	1
	1
But	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say.	1
A	1
cannon	1
ball,	1
flying	1
close	1
to	1
him,	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
duck	1
and	1
bend	1
over	1
his	1
horse.	1
He	1
paused,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
more,	1
another	1
ball	1
stopped	1
him.	1
He	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
off.	1
	1
"Retire!	1
All	1
to	1
retire!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
from	1
a	1
distance.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
laughed.	1
A	1
moment	1
later,	1
an	1
adjutant	1
arrived	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
order.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
on	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
space	1
where	1
Tushin's	1
guns	1
were	1
stationed	1
was	1
an	1
unharnessed	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
leg,	1
that	1
lay	1
screaming	1
piteously	1
beside	1
the	1
harnessed	1
horses.	1
Blood	1
was	1
gushing	1
from	1
its	1
leg	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
spring.	1
Among	1
the	1
limbers	1
lay	1
several	1
dead	1
men.	1
One	1
ball	1
after	1
another	1
passed	1
over	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
nervous	1
shudder	1
run	1
down	1
his	1
spine.	1
But	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
afraid	1
roused	1
him	1
again.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
be	1
afraid,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
and	1
dismounted	1
slowly	1
among	1
the	1
guns.	1
He	1
delivered	1
the	1
order	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
battery.	1
He	1
decided	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
guns	1
removed	1
from	1
their	1
positions	1
and	1
withdrawn	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
Together	1
with	1
Tushin,	1
stepping	1
across	1
the	1
bodies	1
and	1
under	1
a	1
terrible	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
he	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1
guns.	1
	1
"A	1
staff	1
officer	1
was	1
here	1
a	1
minute	1
ago,	1
but	1
skipped	1
off,"	1
said	1
an	1
artilleryman	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Not	1
like	1
your	1
honor!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
Tushin.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
so	1
busy	1
as	1
to	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
one	1
another.	1
When	1
having	1
limbered	1
up	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
cannon	1
that	1
remained	1
uninjured	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
four,	1
they	1
began	1
moving	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
(one	1
shattered	1
gun	1
and	1
one	1
unicorn	1
were	1
left	1
behind),	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Tushin.	1
	1
"Well,	1
till	1
we	1
meet	1
again..."	1
he	1
said,	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
Tushin.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Tushin.	1
"Dear	1
soul!	1
Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
unknown	1
reason	1
tears	1
suddenly	1
filled	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
The	1
wind	1
had	1
fallen	1
and	1
black	1
clouds,	1
merging	1
with	1
the	1
powder	1
smoke,	1
hung	1
low	1
over	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
on	1
the	1
horizon.	1
It	1
was	1
growing	1
dark	1
and	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
two	1
conflagrations	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
conspicuous.	1
The	1
cannonade	1
was	1
dying	1
down,	1
but	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
musketry	1
behind	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
sounded	1
oftener	1
and	1
nearer.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Tushin	1
with	1
his	1
guns,	1
continually	1
driving	1
round	1
or	1
coming	1
upon	1
wounded	1
men,	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
had	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
dip,	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
staff,	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
and	1
Zherkov,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
twice	1
sent	1
to	1
Tushin's	1
battery	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
reached	1
it.	1
Interrupting	1
one	1
another,	1
they	1
all	1
gave,	1
and	1
transmitted,	1
orders	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
to	1
proceed,	1
reprimanding	1
and	1
reproaching	1
him.	1
Tushin	1
gave	1
no	1
orders,	1
and,	1
silently--	1
fearing	1
to	1
speak	1
because	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
felt	1
ready	1
to	1
weep	1
without	1
knowing	1
why--rode	1
behind	1
on	1
his	1
artillery	1
nag.	1
Though	1
the	1
orders	1
were	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
wounded,	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
dragged	1
themselves	1
after	1
troops	1
and	1
begged	1
for	1
seats	1
on	1
the	1
gun	1
carriages.	1
The	1
jaunty	1
infantry	1
officer	1
who	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
Tushin's	1
wattle	1
shed	1
was	1
laid,	1
with	1
a	1
bullet	1
in	1
his	1
stomach,	1
on	1
"Matvevna's"	1
carriage.	1
At	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
a	1
pale	1
hussar	1
cadet,	1
supporting	1
one	1
hand	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Tushin	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
seat.	1
	1
"Captain,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!	1
I've	1
hurt	1
my	1
arm,"	1
he	1
said	1
timidly.	1
"For	1
God's	1
sake...	1
I	1
can't	1
walk.	1
For	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
this	1
cadet	1
had	1
already	1
repeatedly	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
lift	1
and	1
been	1
refused.	1
He	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
hesitating,	1
piteous	1
voice.	1
	1
"Tell	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
seat,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
	1
"Give	1
him	1
a	1
seat,"	1
said	1
Tushin.	1
"Lay	1
a	1
cloak	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
on,	1
lad,"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
his	1
favorite	1
soldier.	1
"And	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
wounded	1
officer?"	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
set	1
down.	1
He	1
died,"	1
replied	1
someone.	1
	1
"Help	1
him	1
up.	1
Sit	1
down,	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
sit	1
down!	1
Spread	1
out	1
the	1
cloak,	1
Antonov."	1
	1
The	1
cadet	1
was	1
Rostov.	1
With	1
one	1
hand	1
he	1
supported	1
the	1
other;	1
he	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
his	1
jaw	1
trembled,	1
shivering	1
feverishly.	1
He	1
was	1
placed	1
on	1
"Matvevna,"	1
the	1
gun	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
removed	1
the	1
dead	1
officer.	1
The	1
cloak	1
they	1
spread	1
under	1
him	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
blood	1
which	1
stained	1
his	1
breeches	1
and	1
arm.	1
	1
"What,	1
are	1
you	1
wounded,	1
my	1
lad?"	1
said	1
Tushin,	1
approaching	1
the	1
gun	1
on	1
which	1
Rostov	1
sat.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
a	1
sprain."	1
	1
"Then	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
blood	1
on	1
the	1
gun	1
carriage?"	1
inquired	1
Tushin.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
the	1
officer,	1
your	1
honor,	1
stained	1
it,"	1
answered	1
the	1
artilleryman,	1
wiping	1
away	1
the	1
blood	1
with	1
his	1
coat	1
sleeve,	1
as	1
if	1
apologizing	1
for	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
gun.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
guns	1
up	1
the	1
rise	1
aided	1
by	1
the	1
infantry,	1
and	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Gruntersdorf	1
they	1
halted.	1
It	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
dark	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
the	1
uniforms	1
ten	1
paces	1
off,	1
and	1
the	1
firing	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
subside.	1
Suddenly,	1
near	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
right,	1
shouting	1
and	1
firing	1
were	1
again	1
heard.	1
Flashes	1
of	1
shot	1
gleamed	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
French	1
attack	1
and	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
sheltered	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
houses.	1
They	1
all	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
again,	1
but	1
Tushin's	1
guns	1
could	1
not	1
move,	1
and	1
the	1
artillerymen,	1
Tushin,	1
and	1
the	1
cadet	1
exchanged	1
silent	1
glances	1
as	1
they	1
awaited	1
their	1
fate.	1
The	1
firing	1
died	1
down	1
and	1
soldiers,	1
talking	1
eagerly,	1
streamed	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
side	1
street.	1
	1
"Not	1
hurt,	1
Petrov?"	1
asked	1
one.	1
	1
"We've	1
given	1
it	1
'em	1
hot,	1
mate!	1
They	1
won't	1
make	1
another	1
push	1
now,"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
"You	1
couldn't	1
see	1
a	1
thing.	1
How	1
they	1
shot	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
fellows!	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
Pitch-dark,	1
brother!	1
Isn't	1
there	1
something	1
to	1
drink?"	1
	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
And	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
complete	1
darkness	1
Tushin's	1
guns	1
moved	1
forward,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
humming	1
infantry	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
frame.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
darkness,	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
gloomy	1
unseen	1
river	1
was	1
flowing	1
always	1
in	1
one	1
direction,	1
humming	1
with	1
whispers	1
and	1
talk	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
wheels.	1
Amid	1
the	1
general	1
rumble,	1
the	1
groans	1
and	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
were	1
more	1
distinctly	1
heard	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
The	1
gloom	1
that	1
enveloped	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
their	1
groans,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
melt	1
into	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
moving	1
mass	1
became	1
agitated,	1
someone	1
rode	1
past	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
horse	1
followed	1
by	1
his	1
suite,	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
passing:	1
"What	1
did	1
he	1
say?	1
Where	1
to,	1
now?	1
Halt,	1
is	1
it?	1
Did	1
he	1
thank	1
us?"	1
came	1
eager	1
questions	1
from	1
all	1
sides.	1
The	1
whole	1
moving	1
mass	1
began	1
pressing	1
closer	1
together	1
and	1
a	1
report	1
spread	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
ordered	1
to	1
halt:	1
evidently	1
those	1
in	1
front	1
had	1
halted.	1
All	1
remained	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
muddy	1
road.	1
	1
Fires	1
were	1
lighted	1
and	1
the	1
talk	1
became	1
more	1
audible.	1
Captain	1
Tushin,	1
having	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
his	1
company,	1
sent	1
a	1
soldier	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
dressing	1
station	1
or	1
a	1
doctor	1
for	1
the	1
cadet,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
bonfire	1
the	1
soldiers	1
had	1
kindled	1
on	1
the	1
road.	1
Rostov,	1
too,	1
dragged	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
fire.	1
From	1
pain,	1
cold,	1
and	1
damp,	1
a	1
feverish	1
shivering	1
shook	1
his	1
whole	1
body.	1
Drowsiness	1
was	1
irresistibly	1
mastering	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
awake	1
by	1
an	1
excruciating	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
arm,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
satisfactory	1
position.	1
He	1
kept	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
fire,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
dazzlingly	1
red,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
feeble,	1
round-shouldered	1
figure	1
of	1
Tushin	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
cross-legged	1
like	1
a	1
Turk	1
beside	1
him.	1
Tushin's	1
large,	1
kind,	1
intelligent	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
with	1
sympathy	1
and	1
commiseration	1
on	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
saw	1
that	1
Tushin	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
heart	1
wished	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
From	1
all	1
sides	1
were	1
heard	1
the	1
footsteps	1
and	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
infantry,	1
who	1
were	1
walking,	1
driving	1
past,	1
and	1
settling	1
down	1
all	1
around.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
voices,	1
the	1
tramping	1
feet,	1
the	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
moving	1
in	1
mud,	1
the	1
crackling	1
of	1
wood	1
fires	1
near	1
and	1
afar,	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
tremulous	1
rumble.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
longer,	1
as	1
before,	1
a	1
dark,	1
unseen	1
river	1
flowing	1
through	1
the	1
gloom,	1
but	1
a	1
dark	1
sea	1
swelling	1
and	1
gradually	1
subsiding	1
after	1
a	1
storm.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
and	1
listened	1
listlessly	1
to	1
what	1
passed	1
before	1
and	1
around	1
him.	1
An	1
infantryman	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
squatted	1
on	1
his	1
heels,	1
held	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
blaze,	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
mind	1
your	1
honor?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Tushin.	1
"I've	1
lost	1
my	1
company,	1
your	1
honor.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
where...	1
such	1
bad	1
luck!"	1
	1
With	1
the	1
soldier,	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
cheek	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bonfire,	1
and	1
addressing	1
Tushin	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
guns	1
moved	1
a	1
trifle	1
to	1
let	1
a	1
wagon	1
go	1
past.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
gone,	1
two	1
soldiers	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
campfire.	1
They	1
were	1
quarreling	1
and	1
fighting	1
desperately,	1
each	1
trying	1
to	1
snatch	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
boot	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
holding	1
on	1
to.	1
	1
"You	1
picked	1
it	1
up?...	1
I	1
dare	1
say!	1
You're	1
very	1
smart!"	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
shouted	1
hoarsely.	1
	1
Then	1
a	1
thin,	1
pale	1
soldier,	1
his	1
neck	1
bandaged	1
with	1
a	1
bloodstained	1
leg	1
band,	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
angry	1
tones	1
asked	1
the	1
artillerymen	1
for	1
water.	1
	1
"Must	1
one	1
die	1
like	1
a	1
dog?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Tushin	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
man	1
some	1
water.	1
Then	1
a	1
cheerful	1
soldier	1
ran	1
up,	1
begging	1
a	1
little	1
fire	1
for	1
the	1
infantry.	1
	1
"A	1
nice	1
little	1
hot	1
torch	1
for	1
the	1
infantry!	1
Good	1
luck	1
to	1
you,	1
fellow	1
countrymen.	1
Thanks	1
for	1
the	1
fire--we'll	1
return	1
it	1
with	1
interest,"	1
said	1
he,	1
carrying	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
a	1
glowing	1
stick.	1
	1
Next	1
came	1
four	1
soldiers,	1
carrying	1
something	1
heavy	1
on	1
a	1
cloak,	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
fire.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
stumbled.	1
	1
"Who	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
put	1
the	1
logs	1
on	1
the	1
road?"	1
snarled	1
he.	1
	1
"He's	1
dead--why	1
carry	1
him?"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
"Shut	1
up!"	1
	1
And	1
they	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
with	1
their	1
load.	1
	1
"Still	1
aching?"	1
Tushin	1
asked	1
Rostov	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
you're	1
wanted	1
by	1
the	1
general.	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
hut	1
here,"	1
said	1
a	1
gunner,	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
Tushin.	1
	1
"Coming,	1
friend."	1
	1
Tushin	1
rose	1
and,	1
buttoning	1
his	1
greatcoat	1
and	1
pulling	1
it	1
straight,	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
Not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
artillery	1
campfire,	1
in	1
a	1
hut	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
him,	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
sat	1
at	1
dinner,	1
talking	1
with	1
some	1
commanding	1
officers	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
at	1
his	1
quarters.	1
The	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
was	1
there	1
greedily	1
gnawing	1
a	1
mutton	1
bone,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
served	1
blamelessly	1
for	1
twenty-two	1
years,	1
flushed	1
by	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
vodka	1
and	1
the	1
dinner;	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
with	1
the	1
signet	1
ring,	1
and	1
Zherkov,	1
uneasily	1
glancing	1
at	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
pale,	1
with	1
compressed	1
lips	1
and	1
feverishly	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
stood	1
a	1
standard	1
captured	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
the	1
accountant	1
with	1
the	1
naive	1
face	1
was	1
feeling	1
its	1
texture,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
perplexity--perhaps	1
because	1
the	1
banner	1
really	1
interested	1
him,	1
perhaps	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
for	1
him,	1
hungry	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
dinner	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
hut	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
French	1
colonel	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
by	1
our	1
dragoons.	1
Our	1
officers	1
were	1
flocking	1
in	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
was	1
thanking	1
the	1
individual	1
commanders	1
and	1
inquiring	1
into	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
our	1
losses.	1
The	1
general	1
whose	1
regiment	1
had	1
been	1
inspected	1
at	1
Braunau	1
was	1
informing	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
action	1
began	1
he	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
the	1
wood,	1
mustered	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
woodcutting,	1
and,	1
allowing	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
pass	1
him,	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
bayonet	1
charge	1
with	1
two	1
battalions	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
up	1
the	1
French	1
troops.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
saw,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
that	1
their	1
first	1
battalion	1
was	1
disorganized,	1
I	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
thought:	1
'I'll	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
on	1
and	1
will	1
meet	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
battalion'--and	1
that's	1
what	1
I	1
did."	1
	1
The	1
general	1
had	1
so	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
sorry	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
managed	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
really	1
happened.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
might	1
really	1
have	1
been	1
so?	1
Could	1
one	1
possibly	1
make	1
out	1
amid	1
all	1
that	1
confusion	1
what	1
did	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
happen?	1
	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
I	1
should	1
inform	1
you,"	1
he	1
continued--	1
remembering	1
Dolokhov's	1
conversation	1
with	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
his	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
gentleman-ranker--"that	1
Private	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks,	1
took	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
prisoner	1
in	1
my	1
presence	1
and	1
particularly	1
distinguished	1
himself."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars	1
attack	1
there,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
Zherkov,	1
looking	1
uneasily	1
around.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
hussars	1
all	1
that	1
day,	1
but	1
had	1
heard	1
about	1
them	1
from	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer.	1
"They	1
broke	1
up	1
two	1
squares,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
Several	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
smiled	1
at	1
Zherkov's	1
words,	1
expecting	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
jokes,	1
but	1
noticing	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
redounded	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
arms	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
day's	1
work,	1
they	1
assumed	1
a	1
serious	1
expression,	1
though	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
a	1
lie	1
devoid	1
of	1
any	1
foundation.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
colonel:	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
all;	1
all	1
arms	1
have	1
behaved	1
heroically:	1
infantry,	1
cavalry,	1
and	1
artillery.	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
two	1
guns	1
were	1
abandoned	1
in	1
the	1
center?"	1
he	1
inquired,	1
searching	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
for	1
someone.	1
(Prince	1
Bagration	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
about	1
the	1
guns	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank;	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
guns	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
action.)	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
sent	1
you?"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
on	1
duty.	1
	1
"One	1
was	1
damaged,"	1
answered	1
the	1
staff	1
officer,	1
"and	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
can't	1
understand.	1
I	1
was	1
there	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
giving	1
orders	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
left....	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hot	1
there,"	1
he	1
added,	1
modestly.	1
	1
Someone	1
mentioned	1
that	1
Captain	1
Tushin	1
was	1
bivouacking	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
sent	1
for.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
you	1
were	1
there?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Of	1
course,	1
we	1
only	1
just	1
missed	1
one	1
another,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
you,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
coldly	1
and	1
abruptly.	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
Tushin	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
threshold	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
timidly	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
generals.	1
As	1
he	1
stepped	1
past	1
the	1
generals	1
in	1
the	1
crowded	1
hut,	1
feeling	1
embarrassed	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
superiors,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
banner	1
and	1
stumbled	1
over	1
it.	1
Several	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
laughed.	1
	1
"How	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
gun	1
was	1
abandoned?"	1
asked	1
Bagration,	1
frowning,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
the	1
captain	1
as	1
at	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
laughing,	1
among	1
whom	1
Zherkov	1
laughed	1
loudest.	1
	1
Only	1
now,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
confronted	1
by	1
the	1
stern	1
authorities,	1
did	1
his	1
guilt	1
and	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
having	1
lost	1
two	1
guns	1
and	1
yet	1
remaining	1
alive	1
present	1
themselves	1
to	1
Tushin	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
horror.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
excited	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
about	1
it	1
until	1
that	1
moment.	1
The	1
officers'	1
laughter	1
confused	1
him	1
still	1
more.	1
He	1
stood	1
before	1
Bagration	1
with	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
trembling	1
and	1
was	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
mutter:	1
"I	1
don't	1
know...	1
your	1
excellency...	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
men...	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"You	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
some	1
from	1
the	1
covering	1
troops."	1
	1
Tushin	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
covering	1
troops,	1
though	1
that	1
was	1
perfectly	1
true.	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
some	1
other	1
officer	1
into	1
trouble,	1
and	1
silently	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Bagration	1
as	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
who	1
has	1
blundered	1
looks	1
at	1
an	1
examiner.	1
	1
The	1
silence	1
lasted	1
some	1
time.	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
apparently	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
severe,	1
found	1
nothing	1
to	1
say;	1
the	1
others	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
intervene.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
Tushin	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
his	1
fingers	1
twitched	1
nervously.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
broke	1
the	1
silence	1
with	1
his	1
abrupt	1
voice,	1
"you	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
Captain	1
Tushin's	1
battery.	1
I	1
went	1
there	1
and	1
found	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
horses	1
knocked	1
out,	1
two	1
guns	1
smashed,	1
and	1
no	1
supports	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
and	1
Tushin	1
looked	1
with	1
equal	1
intentness	1
at	1
Bolkonski,	1
who	1
spoke	1
with	1
suppressed	1
agitation.	1
	1
"And,	1
if	1
your	1
excellency	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
opinion,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"we	1
owe	1
today's	1
success	1
chiefly	1
to	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
that	1
battery	1
and	1
the	1
heroic	1
endurance	1
of	1
Captain	1
Tushin	1
and	1
his	1
company,"	1
and	1
without	1
awaiting	1
a	1
reply,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
looked	1
at	1
Tushin,	1
evidently	1
reluctant	1
to	1
show	1
distrust	1
in	1
Bolkonski's	1
emphatic	1
opinion	1
yet	1
not	1
feeling	1
able	1
fully	1
to	1
credit	1
it,	1
bent	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
told	1
Tushin	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
go.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you;	1
you	1
saved	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
said	1
Tushin.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
look,	1
but	1
said	1
nothing	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
He	1
felt	1
sad	1
and	1
depressed.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
strange,	1
so	1
unlike	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
hoped.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
they?	1
Why	1
are	1
they	1
here?	1
What	1
do	1
they	1
want?	1
And	1
when	1
will	1
all	1
this	1
end?"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
changing	1
shadows	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
arm	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
intense.	1
Irresistible	1
drowsiness	1
overpowered	1
him,	1
red	1
rings	1
danced	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
those	1
voices	1
and	1
faces	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
loneliness	1
merged	1
with	1
the	1
physical	1
pain.	1
It	1
was	1
they,	1
these	1
soldiers--wounded	1
and	1
unwounded--it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
were	1
crushing,	1
weighing	1
down,	1
and	1
twisting	1
the	1
sinews	1
and	1
scorching	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
sprained	1
arm	1
and	1
shoulder.	1
To	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
dozed,	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
short	1
interval	1
innumerable	1
things	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream:	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
large	1
white	1
hand,	1
Sonya's	1
thin	1
little	1
shoulders,	1
Natasha's	1
eyes	1
and	1
laughter,	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
mustache,	1
and	1
Telyanin	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
affair	1
with	1
Telyanin	1
and	1
Bogdanich.	1
That	1
affair	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
this	1
soldier	1
with	1
the	1
harsh	1
voice,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
affair	1
and	1
this	1
soldier	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
agonizingly,	1
incessantly	1
pulling	1
and	1
pressing	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
always	1
dragging	1
it	1
in	1
one	1
direction.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
let	1
his	1
shoulder	1
move	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
ache--it	1
would	1
be	1
well--if	1
only	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
pull	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
up.	1
The	1
black	1
canopy	1
of	1
night	1
hung	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
yard	1
above	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
charcoal.	1
Flakes	1
of	1
falling	1
snow	1
were	1
fluttering	1
in	1
that	1
light.	1
Tushin	1
had	1
not	1
returned,	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
not	1
come.	1
He	1
was	1
alone	1
now,	1
except	1
for	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
naked	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
warming	1
his	1
thin	1
yellow	1
body.	1
	1
"Nobody	1
wants	1
me!"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
or	1
pity	1
me.	1
Yet	1
I	1
was	1
once	1
at	1
home,	1
strong,	1
happy,	1
and	1
loved."	1
He	1
sighed	1
and,	1
doing	1
so,	1
groaned	1
involuntarily.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
is	1
anything	1
hurting	1
you?"	1
asked	1
the	1
soldier,	1
shaking	1
his	1
shirt	1
out	1
over	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
grunt	1
and	1
added:	1
"What	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
crippled	1
today--frightful!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
soldier.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
snowflakes	1
fluttering	1
above	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
remembered	1
a	1
Russian	1
winter	1
at	1
his	1
warm,	1
bright	1
home,	1
his	1
fluffy	1
fur	1
coat,	1
his	1
quickly	1
gliding	1
sleigh,	1
his	1
healthy	1
body,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
affection	1
and	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
family.	1
"And	1
why	1
did	1
I	1
come	1
here?"	1
he	1
wondered.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
did	1
not	1
renew	1
their	1
attack,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Bagration's	1
detachment	1
was	1
reunited	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
army.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
deliberately	1
thought	1
out	1
his	1
plans.	1
Still	1
less	1
did	1
he	1
think	1
of	1
injuring	1
anyone	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
advantage.	1
He	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
on	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
getting	1
on	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
habit.	1
Schemes	1
and	1
devices	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
rightly	1
accounted	1
to	1
himself,	1
but	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
were	1
constantly	1
shaping	1
themselves	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
circumstances	1
and	1
persons	1
he	1
met.	1
Of	1
these	1
plans	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
but	1
dozens,	1
some	1
only	1
beginning	1
to	1
form	1
themselves,	1
some	1
approaching	1
achievement,	1
and	1
some	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
disintegration.	1
He	1
did	1
not,	1
for	1
instance,	1
say	1
to	1
himself:	1
"This	1
man	1
now	1
has	1
influence,	1
I	1
must	1
gain	1
his	1
confidence	1
and	1
friendship	1
and	1
through	1
him	1
obtain	1
a	1
special	1
grant."	1
Nor	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
to	1
himself:	1
"Pierre	1
is	1
a	1
rich	1
man,	1
I	1
must	1
entice	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
my	1
daughter	1
and	1
lend	1
me	1
the	1
forty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
I	1
need."	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
position	1
his	1
instinct	1
immediately	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
could	1
be	1
useful,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
premeditation	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
took	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
to	1
gain	1
his	1
confidence,	1
flatter	1
him,	1
become	1
intimate	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
finally	1
make	1
his	1
request.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
Pierre	1
at	1
hand	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
procured	1
for	1
him	1
an	1
appointment	1
as	1
Gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
Bedchamber,	1
which	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
conferred	1
the	1
status	1
of	1
Councilor	1
of	1
State,	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
accompanying	1
him	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
staying	1
at	1
his	1
house.	1
With	1
apparent	1
absent-mindedness,	1
yet	1
with	1
unhesitating	1
assurance	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
right	1
thing,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
did	1
everything	1
to	1
get	1
Pierre	1
to	1
marry	1
his	1
daughter.	1
Had	1
he	1
thought	1
out	1
his	1
plans	1
beforehand	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
natural	1
and	1
shown	1
such	1
unaffected	1
familiarity	1
in	1
intercourse	1
with	1
everybody	1
both	1
above	1
and	1
below	1
him	1
in	1
social	1
standing.	1
Something	1
always	1
drew	1
him	1
toward	1
those	1
richer	1
and	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
rare	1
skill	1
in	1
seizing	1
the	1
most	1
opportune	1
moment	1
for	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
people.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
on	1
unexpectedly	1
becoming	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
and	1
a	1
rich	1
man,	1
felt	1
himself	1
after	1
his	1
recent	1
loneliness	1
and	1
freedom	1
from	1
cares	1
so	1
beset	1
and	1
preoccupied	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
bed	1
was	1
he	1
able	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
himself.	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
sign	1
papers,	1
to	1
present	1
himself	1
at	1
government	1
offices,	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1
question	1
his	1
chief	1
steward,	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
to	1
receive	1
many	1
people	1
who	1
formerly	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
but	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
offended	1
and	1
grieved	1
had	1
he	1
chosen	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
These	1
different	1
people--	1
businessmen,	1
relations,	1
and	1
acquaintances	1
alike--were	1
all	1
disposed	1
to	1
treat	1
the	1
young	1
heir	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
flattering	1
manner:	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
evidently	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
noble	1
qualities.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
hearing	1
such	1
words	1
as:	1
"With	1
your	1
remarkable	1
kindness,"	1
or,	1
"With	1
your	1
excellent	1
heart,"	1
"You	1
are	1
yourself	1
so	1
honorable	1
Count,"	1
or,	1
"Were	1
he	1
as	1
clever	1
as	1
you,"	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
till	1
he	1
began	1
sincerely	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
exceptional	1
kindness	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
intelligence,	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
very	1
kind	1
and	1
intelligent.	1
Even	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
spiteful	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
evidently	1
unfriendly	1
now	1
became	1
gentle	1
and	1
affectionate.	1
The	1
angry	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
waist	1
and	1
hair	1
plastered	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
doll's,	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
room	1
after	1
the	1
funeral.	1
With	1
drooping	1
eyes	1
and	1
frequent	1
blushes	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
sorry	1
about	1
their	1
past	1
misunderstandings	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
feel	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
anything,	1
except	1
only	1
for	1
permission,	1
after	1
the	1
blow	1
she	1
had	1
received,	1
to	1
remain	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
she	1
so	1
loved	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
sacrificed	1
so	1
much.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
weeping	1
at	1
these	1
words.	1
Touched	1
that	1
this	1
statuesque	1
princess	1
could	1
so	1
change,	1
Pierre	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
begged	1
her	1
forgiveness,	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
for.	1
From	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
quite	1
changed	1
toward	1
Pierre	1
and	1
began	1
knitting	1
a	1
striped	1
scarf	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
"Do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
mon	1
cher;	1
after	1
all,	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
from	1
the	1
deceased,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
him,	1
handing	1
him	1
a	1
deed	1
to	1
sign	1
for	1
the	1
princess'	1
benefit.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
throw	1
this	1
bone--a	1
bill	1
for	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
rubles--to	1
the	1
poor	1
princess	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
inlaid	1
portfolio.	1
Pierre	1
signed	1
the	1
deed	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
grew	1
still	1
kinder.	1
The	1
younger	1
sisters	1
also	1
became	1
affectionate	1
to	1
him,	1
especially	1
the	1
youngest,	1
the	1
pretty	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
mole,	1
who	1
often	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
confused	1
by	1
her	1
smiles	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
confusion	1
when	1
meeting	1
him.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
so	1
natural	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
everyone	1
should	1
like	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
so	1
unnatural	1
had	1
anyone	1
disliked	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
those	1
around	1
him.	1
Besides,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
himself	1
whether	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
sincere	1
or	1
not.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
busy	1
and	1
always	1
felt	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
mild	1
and	1
cheerful	1
intoxication.	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
some	1
important	1
and	1
general	1
movement;	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
constantly	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
he	1
would	1
grieve	1
and	1
disappoint	1
many	1
people,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
and	1
that,	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
what	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
still	1
that	1
happy	1
result	1
always	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
	1
More	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
affairs	1
and	1
of	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
in	1
those	1
early	1
days.	1
From	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
his	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
lad.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
oppressed	1
by	1
business,	1
weary	1
and	1
suffering,	1
who	1
yet	1
would	1
not,	1
for	1
pity's	1
sake,	1
leave	1
this	1
helpless	1
youth	1
who,	1
after	1
all,	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
and	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
such	1
enormous	1
wealth,	1
to	1
the	1
caprice	1
of	1
fate	1
and	1
the	1
designs	1
of	1
rogues.	1
During	1
the	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
spent	1
in	1
Moscow	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
Pierre,	1
or	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
himself,	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
assurance,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
adding	1
every	1
time:	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
business	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
purely	1
out	1
of	1
charity	1
that	1
I	1
trouble	1
myself	1
about	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
also	1
know	1
quite	1
well	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
propose	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
possible."	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
are	1
off	1
at	1
last,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
one	1
day,	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
fingering	1
Pierre's	1
elbow,	1
speaking	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
saying	1
something	1
which	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
agreed	1
upon	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
altered.	1
"We	1
start	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
I'm	1
giving	1
you	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
my	1
carriage.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad.	1
All	1
our	1
important	1
business	1
here	1
is	1
now	1
settled,	1
and	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
off	1
long	1
ago.	1
Here	1
is	1
something	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
chancellor.	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
entered	1
in	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
corps	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
Gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
Bedchamber.	1
The	1
diplomatic	1
career	1
now	1
lies	1
open	1
before	1
you."	1
	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
wearied	1
assurance	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
pronounced,	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
considering	1
his	1
career,	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
suggestion.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
interrupted	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
special	1
deep	1
cooing	1
tone,	1
precluding	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
interrupting	1
his	1
speech,	1
which	1
he	1
used	1
in	1
extreme	1
cases	1
when	1
special	1
persuasion	1
was	1
needed.	1
	1
"Mais,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
I	1
did	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sake,	1
to	1
satisfy	1
my	1
conscience,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
thank	1
me	1
for.	1
No	1
one	1
has	1
ever	1
complained	1
yet	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
much	1
loved;	1
and	1
besides,	1
you	1
are	1
free,	1
you	1
could	1
throw	1
it	1
up	1
tomorrow.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
everything	1
for	1
yourself	1
when	1
you	1
get	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
It	1
is	1
high	1
time	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
these	1
terrible	1
recollections."	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sighed.	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
my	1
boy.	1
And	1
my	1
valet	1
can	1
go	1
in	1
your	1
carriage.	1
Ah!	1
I	1
was	1
nearly	1
forgetting,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"You	1
know,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
some	1
accounts	1
to	1
settle,	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
from	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
estate	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
it;	1
you	1
won't	1
require	1
it.	1
We'll	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
accounts	1
later."	1
	1
By	1
"what	1
was	1
due	1
from	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
estate"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
meant	1
several	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
quitrent	1
received	1
from	1
Pierre's	1
peasants,	1
which	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
retained	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
In	1
Petersburg,	1
as	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
Pierre	1
found	1
the	1
same	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
gentleness	1
and	1
affection.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
the	1
post,	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
rank	1
(for	1
he	1
did	1
nothing),	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
procured	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
acquaintances,	1
invitations,	1
and	1
social	1
occupations	1
were	1
so	1
numerous	1
that,	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
bewilderment,	1
bustle,	1
and	1
continual	1
expectation	1
of	1
some	1
good,	1
always	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
never	1
attained.	1
	1
Of	1
his	1
former	1
bachelor	1
acquaintances	1
many	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
The	1
Guards	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
front;	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks;	1
Anatole	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
provinces;	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
abroad;	1
so	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
nights	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
like	1
to	1
spend	1
them,	1
or	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
mind	1
by	1
intimate	1
talks	1
with	1
a	1
friend	1
older	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
respected.	1
His	1
whole	1
time	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
dinners	1
and	1
balls	1
and	1
was	1
spent	1
chiefly	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
stout	1
princess,	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
beautiful	1
daughter	1
Helene.	1
	1
Like	1
the	1
others,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
attitude	1
toward	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
Formerly	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
presence,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
place,	1
tactless	1
and	1
unsuitable,	1
that	1
remarks	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
clever	1
while	1
they	1
formed	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
became	1
foolish	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
them,	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
Hippolyte's	1
stupidest	1
remarks	1
came	1
out	1
clever	1
and	1
apt.	1
Now	1
everything	1
Pierre	1
said	1
was	1
charmant.	1
Even	1
if	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
so,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
and	1
only	1
refrained	1
out	1
of	1
regard	1
for	1
his	1
modesty.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
1805-6	1
Pierre	1
received	1
one	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
usual	1
pink	1
notes	1
with	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
which	1
was	1
added:	1
"You	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene	1
here,	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
delightful	1
to	1
see."	1
	1
When	1
he	1
read	1
that	1
sentence,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
some	1
link	1
which	1
other	1
people	1
recognized	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
Helene,	1
and	1
that	1
thought	1
both	1
alarmed	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
obligation	1
were	1
being	1
imposed	1
on	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fulfill,	1
and	1
pleased	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
entertaining	1
supposition.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
"At	1
Home"	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
former	1
one,	1
only	1
the	1
novelty	1
she	1
offered	1
her	1
guests	1
this	1
time	1
was	1
not	1
Mortemart,	1
but	1
a	1
diplomatist	1
fresh	1
from	1
Berlin	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
latest	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
visit	1
to	1
Potsdam,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
two	1
august	1
friends	1
had	1
pledged	1
themselves	1
in	1
an	1
indissoluble	1
alliance	1
to	1
uphold	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
justice	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
received	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
melancholy,	1
evidently	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
recent	1
loss	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
(everyone	1
constantly	1
considered	1
it	1
a	1
duty	1
to	1
assure	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
greatly	1
afflicted	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
father	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
known),	1
and	1
her	1
melancholy	1
was	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
august	1
melancholy	1
she	1
showed	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
her	1
most	1
august	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
flattered	1
by	1
this.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
arranged	1
the	1
different	1
groups	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
her	1
habitual	1
skill.	1
The	1
large	1
group,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
generals,	1
had	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
diplomat.	1
Another	1
group	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table.	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
former,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna--who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
excited	1
condition	1
of	1
a	1
commander	1
on	1
a	1
battlefield	1
to	1
whom	1
thousands	1
of	1
new	1
and	1
brilliant	1
ideas	1
occur	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
hardly	1
time	1
to	1
put	1
in	1
action--seeing	1
Pierre,	1
touched	1
his	1
sleeve	1
with	1
her	1
finger,	1
saying:	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
in	1
view	1
for	1
you	1
this	1
evening."	1
(She	1
glanced	1
at	1
Helene	1
and	1
smiled	1
at	1
her.)	1
"My	1
dear	1
Helene,	1
be	1
charitable	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
aunt	1
who	1
adores	1
you.	1
Go	1
and	1
keep	1
her	1
company	1
for	1
ten	1
minutes.	1
And	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
dull,	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
dear	1
count	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
accompany	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
beauty	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
aunt,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
detained	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
final	1
necessary	1
instructions.	1
	1
"Isn't	1
she	1
exquisite?"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
stately	1
beauty	1
as	1
she	1
glided	1
away.	1
"And	1
how	1
she	1
carries	1
herself!	1
For	1
so	1
young	1
a	1
girl,	1
such	1
tact,	1
such	1
masterly	1
perfection	1
of	1
manner!	1
It	1
comes	1
from	1
her	1
heart.	1
Happy	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
wins	1
her!	1
With	1
her	1
the	1
least	1
worldly	1
of	1
men	1
would	1
occupy	1
a	1
most	1
brilliant	1
position	1
in	1
society.	1
Don't	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
let	1
Pierre	1
go.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
in	1
reply,	1
sincerely	1
agreed	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
Helene's	1
perfection	1
of	1
manner.	1
If	1
he	1
ever	1
thought	1
of	1
Helene,	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
her	1
remarkable	1
skill	1
in	1
appearing	1
silently	1
dignified	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
aunt	1
received	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
people	1
in	1
her	1
corner,	1
but	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
of	1
hiding	1
her	1
adoration	1
for	1
Helene	1
and	1
inclined	1
rather	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
fear	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
niece,	1
as	1
if	1
inquiring	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
these	1
people.	1
On	1
leaving	1
them,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
again	1
touched	1
Pierre's	1
sleeve,	1
saying:	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
won't	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
dull	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
again,"	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
Helene.	1
	1
Helene	1
smiled,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
implying	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
anyone	1
seeing	1
her	1
without	1
being	1
enchanted.	1
The	1
aunt	1
coughed,	1
swallowed,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
Helene,	1
then	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
of	1
welcome	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
look.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
dull	1
and	1
halting	1
conversation,	1
Helene	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
beautiful	1
bright	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
to	1
everyone.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
smile,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
so	1
little	1
meaning	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
aunt	1
was	1
just	1
speaking	1
of	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
snuffboxes	1
that	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
father,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
showed	1
them	1
her	1
own	1
box.	1
Princess	1
Helene	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
aunt's	1
husband	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
lid.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
probably	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Vinesse,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
mentioning	1
a	1
celebrated	1
miniaturist,	1
and	1
he	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
while	1
trying	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
table.	1
	1
He	1
half	1
rose,	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
round,	1
but	1
the	1
aunt	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
snuffbox,	1
passing	1
it	1
across	1
Helene's	1
back.	1
Helene	1
stooped	1
forward	1
to	1
make	1
room,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
She	1
was,	1
as	1
always	1
at	1
evening	1
parties,	1
wearing	1
a	1
dress	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
then	1
fashionable,	1
cut	1
very	1
low	1
at	1
front	1
and	1
back.	1
Her	1
bust,	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
like	1
marble	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
shortsighted	1
eyes	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
perceive	1
the	1
living	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders,	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
only	1
have	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
have	1
touched	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
her	1
body,	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
perfume,	1
and	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
her	1
corset	1
as	1
she	1
moved.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
marble	1
beauty	1
forming	1
a	1
complete	1
whole	1
with	1
her	1
dress,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
body	1
only	1
covered	1
by	1
her	1
garments.	1
And	1
having	1
once	1
seen	1
this	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it,	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
cannot	1
renew	1
an	1
illusion	1
we	1
have	1
once	1
seen	1
through.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
noticed	1
before	1
how	1
beautiful	1
I	1
am?"	1
Helene	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
"You	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
woman?	1
Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
may	1
belong	1
to	1
anyone--to	1
you	1
too,"	1
said	1
her	1
glance.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
Helene	1
not	1
only	1
could,	1
but	1
must,	1
be	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise.	1
	1
He	1
knew	1
this	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
with	1
her.	1
How	1
and	1
when	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
(he	1
even	1
felt,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
thing),	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
happen.	1
	1
Pierre	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes,	1
lifted	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
wished	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
distant	1
beauty	1
far	1
removed	1
from	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
every	1
day	1
until	1
then,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
do	1
it.	1
He	1
could	1
not,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
steppe	1
grass	1
through	1
the	1
mist	1
and	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
tree	1
can	1
again	1
take	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
tree	1
after	1
he	1
has	1
once	1
recognized	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
grass.	1
She	1
was	1
terribly	1
close	1
to	1
him.	1
She	1
already	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
him,	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
barrier	1
except	1
the	1
barrier	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
will.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
little	1
corner,"	1
came	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
voice,	1
"I	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
right	1
there."	1
	1
And	1
Pierre,	1
anxiously	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
anything	1
reprehensible,	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
blush.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
everyone	1
knew	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
himself.	1
	1
A	1
little	1
later	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
circle,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"I	1
hear	1
you	1
are	1
refitting	1
your	1
Petersburg	1
house?"	1
	1
This	1
was	1
true.	1
The	1
architect	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
was	1
having	1
his	1
enormous	1
Petersburg	1
house	1
done	1
up.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
but	1
don't	1
move	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili's.	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
friend	1
like	1
the	1
prince,"	1
she	1
said,	1
smiling	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
"I	1
know	1
something	1
about	1
that.	1
Don't	1
I?	1
And	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
so	1
young.	1
You	1
need	1
advice.	1
Don't	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
exercising	1
an	1
old	1
woman's	1
privilege."	1
	1
She	1
paused,	1
as	1
women	1
always	1
do,	1
expecting	1
something	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
mentioned	1
their	1
age.	1
"If	1
you	1
marry	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
different	1
thing,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
uniting	1
them	1
both	1
in	1
one	1
glance.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
Helene	1
nor	1
she	1
at	1
him.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
terribly	1
close	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
muttered	1
something	1
and	1
colored.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
home	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
for	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened.	1
What	1
had	1
happened?	1
Nothing.	1
He	1
had	1
merely	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
of	1
whom	1
when	1
her	1
beauty	1
was	1
mentioned	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
absent-mindedly:	1
"Yes,	1
she's	1
good	1
looking,"	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
might	1
belong	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
she's	1
stupid.	1
I	1
have	1
myself	1
said	1
she	1
is	1
stupid,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"There	1
is	1
something	1
nasty,	1
something	1
wrong,	1
in	1
the	1
feeling	1
she	1
excites	1
in	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
Anatole	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
scandal	1
and	1
that	1
that's	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
away.	1
Hippolyte	1
is	1
her	1
brother...	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
is	1
her	1
father...	1
It's	1
bad...."	1
he	1
reflected,	1
but	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
this	1
(the	1
reflection	1
was	1
still	1
incomplete),	1
he	1
caught	1
himself	1
smiling	1
and	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
another	1
line	1
of	1
thought	1
had	1
sprung	1
up,	1
and	1
while	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
worthlessness	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
dreaming	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
wife,	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
love	1
him	1
become	1
quite	1
different,	1
and	1
how	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
and	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
might	1
be	1
false.	1
And	1
he	1
again	1
saw	1
her	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
but	1
visualized	1
her	1
whole	1
body	1
only	1
veiled	1
by	1
its	1
gray	1
dress.	1
"But	1
no!	1
Why	1
did	1
this	1
thought	1
never	1
occur	1
to	1
me	1
before?"	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
something	1
unnatural,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
dishonorable,	1
in	1
this	1
marriage.	1
He	1
recalled	1
her	1
former	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
together.	1
He	1
recalled	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
house,	1
recalled	1
thousands	1
of	1
such	1
hints	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
others,	1
and	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
terror	1
lest	1
he	1
had	1
already,	1
in	1
some	1
way,	1
bound	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
evidently	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
do.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
expressing	1
this	1
conviction	1
to	1
himself,	1
in	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
her	1
image	1
rose	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
womanly	1
beauty.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
In	1
November,	1
1805,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
inspection	1
in	1
four	1
different	1
provinces.	1
He	1
had	1
arranged	1
this	1
for	1
himself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
neglected	1
estates	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
and	1
pick	1
up	1
his	1
son	1
Anatole	1
where	1
his	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
visit	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
that	1
rich	1
old	1
man.	1
But	1
before	1
leaving	1
home	1
and	1
undertaking	1
these	1
new	1
affairs,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
to	1
settle	1
matters	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
who,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
had	1
latterly	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
at	1
home,	1
that	1
is,	1
in	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
staying,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
absurd,	1
excited,	1
and	1
foolish	1
in	1
Helene's	1
presence	1
(as	1
a	1
lover	1
should	1
be),	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
proposed	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
fine,	1
but	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
settled,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
himself,	1
with	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
sigh,	1
one	1
morning,	1
feeling	1
that	1
Pierre	1
who	1
was	1
under	1
such	1
obligations	1
to	1
him	1
("But	1
never	1
mind	1
that")	1
was	1
not	1
behaving	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
"Youth,	1
frivolity...	1
well,	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
him,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
relishing	1
his	1
own	1
goodness	1
of	1
heart,	1
"but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
head.	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
will	1
be	1
Lelya's	1
name	1
day.	1
I	1
will	1
invite	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
people,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
then	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
affair--yes,	1
my	1
affair.	1
I	1
am	1
her	1
father."	1
	1
Six	1
weeks	1
after	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
"At	1
Home"	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
sleepless	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
that	1
to	1
marry	1
Helene	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
calamity	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
avoid	1
her	1
and	1
go	1
away,	1
Pierre,	1
despite	1
that	1
decision,	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
and	1
felt	1
with	1
terror	1
that	1
in	1
people's	1
eyes	1
he	1
was	1
every	1
day	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
connected	1
with	1
her,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
conception	1
of	1
her,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
break	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
unite	1
his	1
fate	1
with	1
hers.	1
He	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
free	1
himself	1
but	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
(who	1
had	1
rarely	1
before	1
given	1
receptions)	1
now	1
hardly	1
let	1
a	1
day	1
go	1
by	1
without	1
having	1
an	1
evening	1
party	1
at	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
unless	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
spoil	1
the	1
general	1
pleasure	1
and	1
disappoint	1
everyone's	1
expectation.	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
in	1
the	1
rare	1
moments	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
would	1
take	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
in	1
passing	1
and	1
draw	1
it	1
downwards,	1
or	1
absent-mindedly	1
hold	1
out	1
his	1
wrinkled,	1
clean-	1
shaven	1
cheek	1
for	1
Pierre	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
would	1
say:	1
"Till	1
tomorrow,"	1
or,	1
"Be	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
you,"	1
or,	1
"I	1
am	1
staying	1
in	1
for	1
your	1
sake,"	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
And	1
though	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
when	1
he	1
stayed	1
in	1
(as	1
he	1
said)	1
for	1
Pierre's	1
sake,	1
hardly	1
exchanged	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
words	1
with	1
him,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
unable	1
to	1
disappoint	1
him.	1
Every	1
day	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thing:	1
"It	1
is	1
time	1
I	1
understood	1
her	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
what	1
she	1
really	1
is.	1
Was	1
I	1
mistaken	1
before,	1
or	1
am	1
I	1
mistaken	1
now?	1
No,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
stupid,	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
girl,"	1
he	1
sometimes	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
"she	1
never	1
makes	1
a	1
mistake,	1
never	1
says	1
anything	1
stupid.	1
She	1
says	1
little,	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
does	1
say	1
is	1
always	1
clear	1
and	1
simple,	1
so	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
stupid.	1
She	1
never	1
was	1
abashed	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
abashed	1
now,	1
so	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
woman!"	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
begun	1
to	1
make	1
reflections	1
or	1
think	1
aloud	1
in	1
her	1
company,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
answered	1
him	1
either	1
by	1
a	1
brief	1
but	1
appropriate	1
remark--showing	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
her--or	1
by	1
a	1
silent	1
look	1
and	1
smile	1
which	1
more	1
palpably	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
her	1
superiority.	1
She	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
regarding	1
all	1
arguments	1
as	1
nonsense	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
that	1
smile.	1
	1
She	1
always	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
radiantly	1
confiding	1
smile	1
meant	1
for	1
him	1
alone,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
significant	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
smile	1
that	1
usually	1
brightened	1
her	1
face.	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
cross	1
a	1
certain	1
line,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
he	1
would	1
step	1
across	1
it,	1
but	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
terror	1
seized	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
dreadful	1
step.	1
A	1
thousand	1
times	1
during	1
that	1
month	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
while	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
drawn	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
that	1
dreadful	1
abyss,	1
Pierre	1
said	1
to	1
himself:	1
"What	1
am	1
I	1
doing?	1
I	1
need	1
resolution.	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
none?"	1
	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
decision,	1
but	1
felt	1
with	1
dismay	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
he	1
lacked	1
that	1
strength	1
of	1
will	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
himself	1
and	1
really	1
possessed.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
only	1
strong	1
when	1
they	1
feel	1
themselves	1
quite	1
innocent,	1
and	1
since	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
desire	1
while	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's,	1
an	1
unacknowledged	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
that	1
desire	1
paralyzed	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
On	1
Helene's	1
name	1
day,	1
a	1
small	1
party	1
of	1
just	1
their	1
own	1
people--as	1
his	1
wife	1
said--met	1
for	1
supper	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili's.	1
All	1
these	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
would	1
be	1
decided	1
that	1
evening.	1
The	1
visitors	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
supper.	1
Princess	1
Kuragina,	1
a	1
portly	1
imposing	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
handsome,	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
On	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
sat	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
guests--an	1
old	1
general	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer.	1
At	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
sat	1
the	1
younger	1
and	1
less	1
important	1
guests,	1
and	1
there	1
too	1
sat	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene,	1
side	1
by	1
side.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
supper:	1
he	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
mood,	1
sitting	1
down	1
now	1
by	1
one,	1
now	1
by	1
another,	1
of	1
the	1
guests.	1
To	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
made	1
some	1
careless	1
and	1
agreeable	1
remark	1
except	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene,	1
whose	1
presence	1
he	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
notice.	1
He	1
enlivened	1
the	1
whole	1
party.	1
The	1
wax	1
candles	1
burned	1
brightly,	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
crystal	1
gleamed,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
ladies'	1
toilets	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
of	1
the	1
men's	1
epaulets;	1
servants	1
in	1
scarlet	1
liveries	1
moved	1
round	1
the	1
table,	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
plates,	1
knives,	1
and	1
glasses	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
animated	1
hum	1
of	1
several	1
conversations.	1
At	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
the	1
old	1
chamberlain	1
was	1
heard	1
assuring	1
an	1
old	1
baroness	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
passionately,	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
laughed;	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
some	1
Mary	1
Viktorovna	1
or	1
other.	1
At	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
attracted	1
everybody's	1
attention.	1
With	1
a	1
facetious	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
he	1
was	1
telling	1
the	1
ladies	1
about	1
last	1
Wednesday's	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
Council,	1
at	1
which	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich	1
Vyazmitinov,	1
the	1
new	1
military	1
governor	1
general	1
of	1
Petersburg,	1
had	1
received	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
then	1
famous	1
rescript	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
receiving	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
declarations	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
loyalty,	1
that	1
the	1
declaration	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
gave	1
him	1
particular	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nation	1
and	1
would	1
endeavor	1
to	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
it.	1
This	1
rescript	1
began	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
From	1
all	1
sides	1
reports	1
reach	1
me,"	1
etc.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
never	1
got	1
farther	1
than:	1
'Sergey	1
Kuzmich'?"	1
asked	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies.	1
	1
"Exactly,	1
not	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth	1
farther,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
laughing,	1
"'Sergey	1
Kuzmich...	1
From	1
all	1
sides...	1
From	1
all	1
sides...	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich...'	1
Poor	1
Vyazmitinov	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
any	1
farther!	1
He	1
began	1
the	1
rescript	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
'Sergey'	1
he	1
sobbed,	1
'Kuz-mi-ch,'	1
tears,	1
and	1
'From	1
all	1
sides'	1
was	1
smothered	1
in	1
sobs	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
farther.	1
And	1
again	1
his	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
again:	1
'Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
From	1
all	1
sides,'...	1
and	1
tears,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
somebody	1
else	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
read	1
it."	1
	1
"Kuzmich...	1
From	1
all	1
sides...	1
and	1
then	1
tears,"	1
someone	1
repeated	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Don't	1
be	1
unkind,"	1
cried	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
from	1
her	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
holding	1
up	1
a	1
threatening	1
finger.	1
"He	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
worthy	1
and	1
excellent	1
man,	1
our	1
dear	1
Vyazmitinov...."	1
	1
Everybody	1
laughed	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
At	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
where	1
the	1
honored	1
guests	1
sat,	1
everyone	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
exciting	1
sensations.	1
Only	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene	1
sat	1
silently	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
a	1
suppressed	1
smile	1
brightening	1
both	1
their	1
faces,	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich--a	1
smile	1
of	1
bashfulness	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
feelings.	1
But	1
much	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
laughed,	1
talked,	1
and	1
joked,	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
enjoyed	1
their	1
Rhine	1
wine,	1
saute,	1
and	1
ices,	1
and	1
however	1
they	1
avoided	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
couple,	1
and	1
heedless	1
and	1
unobservant	1
as	1
they	1
seemed	1
of	1
them,	1
one	1
could	1
feel	1
by	1
the	1
occasional	1
glances	1
they	1
gave	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
about	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
the	1
laughter,	1
and	1
the	1
food	1
were	1
all	1
a	1
pretense,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
attention	1
of	1
that	1
company	1
was	1
directed	1
to--	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
mimicked	1
the	1
sobbing	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
his	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
toward	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
laughed	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
clearly	1
said:	1
"Yes...	1
it's	1
getting	1
on,	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
settled	1
today."	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
threatened	1
him	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
"our	1
dear	1
Vyazmitinov,"	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
which,	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
glanced	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
read	1
a	1
congratulation	1
on	1
his	1
future	1
son-in-law	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
daughter's	1
happiness.	1
The	1
old	1
princess	1
sighed	1
sadly	1
as	1
she	1
offered	1
some	1
wine	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
next	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
glanced	1
angrily	1
at	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
her	1
sigh	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"Yes,	1
there's	1
nothing	1
left	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me	1
but	1
to	1
sip	1
sweet	1
wine,	1
my	1
dear,	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
for	1
these	1
young	1
ones	1
to	1
be	1
thus	1
boldly,	1
provocatively	1
happy."	1
"And	1
what	1
nonsense	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
saying!"	1
thought	1
a	1
diplomatist,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
happy	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
lovers.	1
"That's	1
happiness!"	1
	1
Into	1
the	1
insignificant,	1
trifling,	1
and	1
artificial	1
interests	1
uniting	1
that	1
society	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
simple	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
attraction	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
and	1
handsome	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
for	1
one	1
another.	1
And	1
this	1
human	1
feeling	1
dominated	1
everything	1
else	1
and	1
soared	1
above	1
all	1
their	1
affected	1
chatter.	1
Jests	1
fell	1
flat,	1
news	1
was	1
not	1
interesting,	1
and	1
the	1
animation	1
was	1
evidently	1
forced.	1
Not	1
only	1
the	1
guests	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
footmen	1
waiting	1
at	1
table	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
this,	1
and	1
they	1
forgot	1
their	1
duties	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene	1
with	1
her	1
radiant	1
face	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
red,	1
broad,	1
and	1
happy	1
though	1
uneasy	1
face	1
of	1
Pierre.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
very	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
candles	1
was	1
focused	1
on	1
those	1
two	1
happy	1
faces	1
alone.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
this	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
some	1
occupation.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
see,	1
hear,	1
or	1
understand	1
anything	1
clearly.	1
Only	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
detached	1
ideas	1
and	1
impressions	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
reality	1
shot	1
unexpectedly	1
through	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
finished!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"And	1
how	1
has	1
it	1
all	1
happened?	1
How	1
quickly!	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
her	1
alone,	1
nor	1
of	1
myself	1
alone,	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
everyone,	1
it	1
must	1
inevitably	1
come	1
about.	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
expecting	1
it,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
sure	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
happen	1
that	1
I	1
cannot,	1
I	1
cannot,	1
disappoint	1
them.	1
But	1
how	1
will	1
it	1
be?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
certainly	1
happen!"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
glancing	1
at	1
those	1
dazzling	1
shoulders	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
Or	1
he	1
would	1
suddenly	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
of	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
awkward	1
to	1
attract	1
everyone's	1
attention	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
a	1
lucky	1
man	1
and,	1
with	1
his	1
plain	1
face,	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Paris	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
Helen.	1
"But	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
always	1
is	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
so!"	1
he	1
consoled	1
himself.	1
"And	1
besides,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
about?	1
How	1
did	1
it	1
begin?	1
I	1
traveled	1
from	1
Moscow	1
with	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
nothing.	1
So	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
not	1
stay	1
at	1
his	1
house?	1
Then	1
I	1
played	1
cards	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
her	1
reticule	1
and	1
drove	1
out	1
with	1
her.	1
How	1
did	1
it	1
begin,	1
when	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
come	1
about?"	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
as	1
her	1
betrothed,	1
seeing,	1
hearing,	1
feeling	1
her	1
nearness,	1
her	1
breathing,	1
her	1
movements,	1
her	1
beauty.	1
Then	1
it	1
would	1
suddenly	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
she	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
unusually	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
they	1
all	1
looked	1
so	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
flattered	1
by	1
this	1
general	1
admiration	1
he	1
would	1
expand	1
his	1
chest,	1
raise	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
at	1
his	1
good	1
fortune.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
repeating	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
was	1
so	1
absorbed	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
asking	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
last	1
heard	1
from	1
Bolkonski,"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
a	1
third	1
time.	1
"How	1
absent-minded	1
you	1
are,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
smiled,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
smiling	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
Helene.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
all	1
know	1
it?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"What	1
of	1
it?	1
It's	1
the	1
truth!"	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
smiled	1
his	1
gentle	1
childlike	1
smile,	1
and	1
Helene	1
smiled	1
too.	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
the	1
letter?	1
Was	1
it	1
from	1
Olmutz?"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
pretended	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
this	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
settle	1
a	1
dispute.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
one	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
trifles?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
from	1
Olmutz,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
After	1
supper	1
Pierre	1
with	1
his	1
partner	1
followed	1
the	1
others	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
disperse,	1
some	1
without	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Helene.	1
Some,	1
as	1
if	1
unwilling	1
to	1
distract	1
her	1
from	1
an	1
important	1
occupation,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
refusing	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
see	1
them	1
off.	1
The	1
diplomatist	1
preserved	1
a	1
mournful	1
silence	1
as	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
He	1
pictured	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
his	1
diplomatic	1
career	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
Pierre's	1
happiness.	1
The	1
old	1
general	1
grumbled	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
how	1
his	1
leg	1
was.	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
old	1
fool,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"That	1
Princess	1
Helene	1
will	1
be	1
beautiful	1
still	1
when	1
she's	1
fifty."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
congratulate	1
you,"	1
whispered	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
princess,	1
kissing	1
her	1
soundly.	1
"If	1
I	1
hadn't	1
this	1
headache	1
I'd	1
have	1
stayed	1
longer."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
she	1
was	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy	1
of	1
her	1
daughter's	1
happiness.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
taking	1
their	1
leave	1
Pierre	1
remained	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
alone	1
with	1
Helene	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
sitting.	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
before,	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
six	1
weeks,	1
remained	1
alone	1
with	1
her,	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
love.	1
Now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
inevitable,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
final	1
step.	1
He	1
felt	1
ashamed;	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
occupying	1
someone	1
else's	1
place	1
here	1
beside	1
Helene.	1
"This	1
happiness	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
you,"	1
some	1
inner	1
voice	1
whispered	1
to	1
him.	1
"This	1
happiness	1
is	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
in	1
them	1
what	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
you."	1
	1
But,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
he	1
began	1
by	1
asking	1
her	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
party.	1
She	1
replied	1
in	1
her	1
usual	1
simple	1
manner	1
that	1
this	1
name	1
day	1
of	1
hers	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
had.	1
	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
relatives	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
left.	1
They	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
with	1
languid	1
footsteps.	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
late.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
stern	1
inquiry,	1
as	1
though	1
what	1
Pierre	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
in.	1
But	1
then	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
severity	1
changed,	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
downwards,	1
made	1
him	1
sit	1
down,	1
and	1
smiled	1
affectionately.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Lelya?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
instantly	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
addressing	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
careless	1
tone	1
of	1
habitual	1
tenderness	1
natural	1
to	1
parents	1
who	1
have	1
petted	1
their	1
children	1
from	1
babyhood,	1
but	1
which	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
only	1
acquired	1
by	1
imitating	1
other	1
parents.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
again	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Sergey	1
Kuzmich--From	1
all	1
sides-"	1
he	1
said,	1
unbuttoning	1
the	1
top	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
waistcoat.	1
	1
Pierre	1
smiled,	1
but	1
his	1
smile	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
story	1
about	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich	1
that	1
interested	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
just	1
then,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
saw	1
that	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
this.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
muttered	1
something	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
disconcerted.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
discomposure	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
touched	1
Pierre:	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Helene	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
seemed	1
disconcerted,	1
and	1
her	1
look	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
fault."	1
	1
"The	1
step	1
must	1
be	1
taken	1
but	1
I	1
cannot,	1
I	1
cannot!"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
he	1
again	1
began	1
speaking	1
about	1
indifferent	1
matters,	1
about	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
asking	1
what	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
it	1
properly.	1
Helene	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
missed	1
it.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
the	1
princess,	1
his	1
wife,	1
was	1
talking	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
to	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
about	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Of	1
course,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
brilliant	1
match,	1
but	1
happiness,	1
my	1
dear..."	1
	1
"Marriages	1
are	1
made	1
in	1
heaven,"	1
replied	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
passed	1
by,	1
seeming	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
ladies,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
in	1
a	1
far	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
dozing.	1
His	1
head	1
sank	1
forward	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
roused	1
himself.	1
	1
"Aline,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
"go	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
about."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
passed	1
by	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
dignified	1
and	1
indifferent	1
air,	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene	1
still	1
sat	1
talking	1
just	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
"Still	1
the	1
same,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
frowned,	1
twisting	1
his	1
mouth,	1
his	1
cheeks	1
quivered	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
coarse,	1
unpleasant	1
expression	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him.	1
Shaking	1
himself,	1
he	1
rose,	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps	1
went	1
past	1
the	1
ladies	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room.	1
With	1
quick	1
steps	1
he	1
went	1
joyfully	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
unusually	1
triumphant	1
that	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
in	1
alarm	1
on	1
seeing	1
it.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
"My	1
wife	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
everything!"	1
(He	1
put	1
one	1
arm	1
around	1
Pierre	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
around	1
his	1
daughter.)--"My	1
dear	1
boy...	1
Lelya...	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
pleased."	1
(His	1
voice	1
trembled.)	1
"I	1
loved	1
your	1
father...	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
wife...	1
God	1
bless	1
you!..."	1
	1
He	1
embraced	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
malodorous	1
mouth.	1
Tears	1
actually	1
moistened	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
come	1
here!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
princess	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
also	1
wept.	1
The	1
elderly	1
lady	1
was	1
using	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
too.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
kissed,	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene's	1
hand	1
several	1
times.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
again.	1
	1
"All	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"so	1
it	1
is	1
useless	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
because	1
it's	1
definite	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
tormenting	1
doubt."	1
Pierre	1
held	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
betrothed	1
in	1
silence,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
beautiful	1
bosom	1
as	1
it	1
rose	1
and	1
fell.	1
	1
"Helene!"	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
and	1
paused.	1
	1
"Something	1
special	1
is	1
always	1
said	1
in	1
such	1
cases,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
people	1
say.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
face.	1
She	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
him.	1
Her	1
face	1
flushed.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
take	1
those	1
off...	1
those..."	1
she	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes,	1
besides	1
the	1
strange	1
look	1
eyes	1
have	1
from	1
which	1
spectacles	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
removed,	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
frightened	1
and	1
inquiring	1
look.	1
He	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
stoop	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kiss	1
it,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
rapid,	1
almost	1
brutal	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
she	1
intercepted	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
own.	1
Her	1
face	1
struck	1
Pierre,	1
by	1
its	1
altered,	1
unpleasantly	1
excited	1
expression.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
too	1
late	1
now,	1
it's	1
done;	1
besides	1
I	1
love	1
her,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Je	1
vous	1
aime!"	1
*	1
he	1
said,	1
remembering	1
what	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
at	1
such	1
moments:	1
but	1
his	1
words	1
sounded	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"I	1
love	1
you."	1
	1
Six	1
weeks	1
later	1
he	1
was	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Old	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
November,	1
1805,	1
announcing	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
would	1
be	1
paying	1
him	1
a	1
visit.	1
"I	1
am	1
starting	1
on	1
a	1
journey	1
of	1
inspection,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
shall	1
think	1
nothing	1
of	1
an	1
extra	1
seventy	1
miles	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
my	1
honored	1
benefactor,"	1
wrote	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
"My	1
son	1
Anatole	1
is	1
accompanying	1
me	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
so	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
him	1
personally	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
deep	1
respect	1
that,	1
emulating	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
feels	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
that	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
bring	1
Mary	1
out,	1
suitors	1
are	1
coming	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord,"	1
incautiously	1
remarked	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
news.	1
	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
frowned,	1
but	1
said	1
nothing.	1
	1
A	1
fortnight	1
after	1
the	1
letter	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
servants	1
came	1
one	1
evening	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
arrived	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
Old	1
Bolkonski	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
poor	1
opinion	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
character,	1
but	1
more	1
so	1
recently,	1
since	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
reigns	1
of	1
Paul	1
and	1
Alexander	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
high	1
position	1
and	1
honors.	1
And	1
now,	1
from	1
the	1
hints	1
contained	1
in	1
his	1
letter	1
and	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
he	1
saw	1
which	1
way	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
blowing,	1
and	1
his	1
low	1
opinion	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
contemptuous	1
ill	1
will.	1
He	1
snorted	1
whenever	1
he	1
mentioned	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
arrival,	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
particularly	1
discontented	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
temper.	1
Whether	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
because	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
coming,	1
or	1
whether	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
made	1
him	1
specially	1
annoyed	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
visit,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Tikhon	1
had	1
already	1
advised	1
the	1
architect	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
his	1
report.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
hear	1
how	1
he's	1
walking?"	1
said	1
Tikhon,	1
drawing	1
the	1
architect's	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
prince's	1
footsteps.	1
"Stepping	1
flat	1
on	1
his	1
heels--we	1
know	1
what	1
that	1
means...."	1
	1
However,	1
at	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
the	1
prince,	1
in	1
his	1
velvet	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
sable	1
collar	1
and	1
cap,	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
his	1
usual	1
walk.	1
It	1
had	1
snowed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
hothouse,	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
walking,	1
had	1
been	1
swept:	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
broom	1
were	1
still	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
a	1
shovel	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
sticking	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soft	1
snowbanks	1
that	1
bordered	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
path.	1
The	1
prince	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
conservatories,	1
the	1
serfs'	1
quarters,	1
and	1
the	1
outbuildings,	1
frowning	1
and	1
silent.	1
	1
"Can	1
a	1
sleigh	1
pass?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
overseer,	1
a	1
venerable	1
man,	1
resembling	1
his	1
master	1
in	1
manners	1
and	1
looks,	1
who	1
was	1
accompanying	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"The	1
snow	1
is	1
deep.	1
I	1
am	1
having	1
the	1
avenue	1
swept,	1
your	1
honor."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
"God	1
be	1
thanked,"	1
thought	1
the	1
overseer,	1
"the	1
storm	1
has	1
blown	1
over!"	1
	1
"It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
hard	1
to	1
drive	1
up,	1
your	1
honor,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"I	1
heard,	1
your	1
honor,	1
that	1
a	1
minister	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
visit	1
your	1
honor."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
overseer	1
and	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
him,	1
frowning.	1
	1
"What?	1
A	1
minister?	1
What	1
minister?	1
Who	1
gave	1
orders?"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
shrill,	1
harsh	1
voice.	1
"The	1
road	1
is	1
not	1
swept	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
my	1
daughter,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
minister!	1
For	1
me,	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
ministers!"	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
I	1
thought..."	1
	1
"You	1
thought!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince,	1
his	1
words	1
coming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rapidly	1
and	1
indistinctly.	1
"You	1
thought!...	1
Rascals!	1
Blackguards!...	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
think!"	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
stick	1
he	1
swung	1
it	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
hit	1
Alpatych,	1
the	1
overseer,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
latter	1
instinctively	1
avoided	1
the	1
blow.	1
"Thought...	1
Blackguards..."	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince	1
rapidly.	1
	1
But	1
although	1
Alpatych,	1
frightened	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
temerity	1
in	1
avoiding	1
the	1
stroke,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prince,	1
bowing	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
resignedly	1
before	1
him,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason,	1
the	1
prince,	1
though	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
shout:	1
"Blackguards!...	1
Throw	1
the	1
snow	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
road!"	1
did	1
not	1
lift	1
his	1
stick	1
again	1
but	1
hurried	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
Before	1
dinner,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
who	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
humor,	1
stood	1
awaiting	1
him;	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
face	1
that	1
said:	1
"I	1
know	1
nothing,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
usual,"	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
pale,	1
frightened,	1
and	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes.	1
What	1
she	1
found	1
hardest	1
to	1
bear	1
was	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
behave	1
like	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
She	1
thought:	1
"If	1
I	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
he	1
will	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
sympathize	1
with	1
him;	1
if	1
I	1
seem	1
sad	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
spirits	1
myself,	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
(as	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
before)	1
that	1
I'm	1
in	1
the	1
dumps."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
daughter's	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
snorted.	1
	1
"Fool...	1
or	1
dummy!"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
is	1
not	1
here.	1
They've	1
been	1
telling	1
tales,"	1
he	1
thought-	1
-referring	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
princess?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Hiding?"	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
well,"	1
answered	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
smile,	1
"so	1
she	1
won't	1
come	1
down.	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
in	1
her	1
state."	1
	1
"Hm!	1
Hm!"	1
muttered	1
the	1
prince,	1
sitting	1
down.	1
	1
His	1
plate	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
quite	1
clean,	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
spot	1
he	1
flung	1
it	1
away.	1
Tikhon	1
caught	1
it	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
footman.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
not	1
unwell,	1
but	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
overpowering	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
that,	1
hearing	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
humor,	1
she	1
had	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
appear.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
for	1
the	1
baby,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne:	1
"Heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
a	1
fright	1
might	1
do."	1
	1
In	1
general	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
lived	1
in	1
constant	1
fear,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
antipathy	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
because	1
the	1
fear	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
stronger	1
feeling.	1
The	1
prince	1
reciprocated	1
this	1
antipathy,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
her.	1
When	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
to	1
life	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
special	1
fancy	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
with	1
her,	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
and	1
often	1
talked	1
with	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
criticized	1
him.	1
	1
"So	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
visitors,	1
mon	1
prince?"	1
remarked	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
unfolding	1
her	1
white	1
napkin	1
with	1
her	1
rosy	1
fingers.	1
"His	1
Excellency	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
I	1
understand?"	1
she	1
said	1
inquiringly.	1
	1
"Hm!--his	1
excellency	1
is	1
a	1
puppy....	1
I	1
got	1
him	1
his	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
service,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
disdainfully.	1
"Why	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
coming	1
I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
Perhaps	1
Princess	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
know.	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
him."	1
(He	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
blushing	1
daughter.)	1
"Are	1
you	1
unwell	1
today?	1
Eh?	1
Afraid	1
of	1
the	1
'minister'	1
as	1
that	1
idiot	1
Alpatych	1
called	1
him	1
this	1
morning?"	1
	1
"No,	1
mon	1
pere."	1
	1
Though	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
unsuccessful	1
in	1
her	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
subject,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
talking,	1
but	1
chattered	1
about	1
the	1
conservatories	1
and	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
flower	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
opened,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
soup	1
the	1
prince	1
became	1
more	1
genial.	1
	1
After	1
dinner,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
daughter-in-law.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
table,	1
chattering	1
with	1
Masha,	1
her	1
maid.	1
She	1
grew	1
pale	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
father-in-law.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
much	1
altered.	1
She	1
was	1
now	1
plain	1
rather	1
than	1
pretty.	1
Her	1
cheeks	1
had	1
sunk,	1
her	1
lip	1
was	1
drawn	1
up,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
drawn	1
down.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
feel	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
oppression,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
prince's	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
she	1
felt.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
want	1
anything?"	1
	1
"No,	1
merci,	1
mon	1
pere."	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
right,	1
all	1
right."	1
	1
He	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
where	1
Alpatych	1
stood	1
with	1
bowed	1
head.	1
	1
"Has	1
the	1
snow	1
been	1
shoveled	1
back?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake...	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
my	1
stupidity."	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
prince,	1
and	1
laughing	1
his	1
unnatural	1
way,	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
Alpatych	1
to	1
kiss,	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
arrived	1
that	1
evening.	1
He	1
was	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
avenue	1
by	1
coachmen	1
and	1
footmen,	1
who,	1
with	1
loud	1
shouts,	1
dragged	1
his	1
sleighs	1
up	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lodges	1
over	1
the	1
road	1
purposely	1
laden	1
with	1
snow.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
Anatole	1
had	1
separate	1
rooms	1
assigned	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
Anatole,	1
having	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
overcoat,	1
sat	1
with	1
arms	1
akimbo	1
before	1
a	1
table	1
on	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
smilingly	1
and	1
absent-mindedly	1
fixed	1
his	1
large	1
and	1
handsome	1
eyes.	1
He	1
regarded	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
continual	1
round	1
of	1
amusement	1
which	1
someone	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
had	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
a	1
churlish	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
rich	1
and	1
ugly	1
heiress	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
All	1
this	1
might,	1
he	1
thought,	1
turn	1
out	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
amusingly.	1
"And	1
why	1
not	1
marry	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
really	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
money?	1
That	1
never	1
does	1
any	1
harm,"	1
thought	1
Anatole.	1
	1
He	1
shaved	1
and	1
scented	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
elegance	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
his	1
handsome	1
head	1
held	1
high,	1
entered	1
his	1
father's	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
good-humored	1
and	1
victorious	1
air	1
natural	1
to	1
him.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
two	1
valets	1
were	1
busy	1
dressing	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
much	1
animation	1
and	1
cheerfully	1
nodded	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
entered,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say:	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
how	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
look."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Father,	1
joking	1
apart,	1
is	1
she	1
very	1
hideous?"	1
Anatole	1
asked,	1
as	1
if	1
continuing	1
a	1
conversation	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
mentioned	1
during	1
the	1
journey.	1
	1
"Enough!	1
What	1
nonsense!	1
Above	1
all,	1
try	1
to	1
be	1
respectful	1
and	1
cautious	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
prince."	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
starts	1
a	1
row	1
I'll	1
go	1
away,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Anatole.	1
"I	1
can't	1
bear	1
those	1
old	1
men!	1
Eh?"	1
	1
"Remember,	1
for	1
you	1
everything	1
depends	1
on	1
this."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
it	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
maidservants'	1
rooms	1
that	1
the	1
minister	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
arrived,	1
but	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
both	1
had	1
been	1
minutely	1
described.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
sitting	1
alone	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
master	1
her	1
agitation.	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
they	1
write,	1
why	1
did	1
Lise	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it?	1
It	1
can	1
never	1
happen!"	1
she	1
said,	1
looking	1
at	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
glass.	1
"How	1
shall	1
I	1
enter	1
the	1
drawing	1
room?	1
Even	1
if	1
I	1
like	1
him	1
I	1
can't	1
now	1
be	1
myself	1
with	1
him."	1
The	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
look	1
filled	1
her	1
with	1
terror.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
had	1
already	1
received	1
from	1
Masha,	1
the	1
lady's	1
maid,	1
the	1
necessary	1
report	1
of	1
how	1
handsome	1
the	1
minister's	1
son	1
was,	1
with	1
his	1
rosy	1
cheeks	1
and	1
dark	1
eyebrows,	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
difficulty	1
the	1
father	1
had	1
dragged	1
his	1
legs	1
upstairs	1
while	1
the	1
son	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
like	1
an	1
eagle,	1
three	1
steps	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
Having	1
received	1
this	1
information,	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
whose	1
chattering	1
voices	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
corridor,	1
went	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
they've	1
come,	1
Marie?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
waddling	1
in,	1
and	1
sinking	1
heavily	1
into	1
an	1
armchair.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
loose	1
gown	1
she	1
generally	1
wore	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
but	1
had	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
best	1
dresses.	1
Her	1
hair	1
was	1
carefully	1
done	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
animated,	1
which,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
conceal	1
its	1
sunken	1
and	1
faded	1
outlines.	1
Dressed	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society,	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
noticeable	1
how	1
much	1
plainer	1
she	1
had	1
become.	1
Some	1
unobtrusive	1
touch	1
had	1
been	1
added	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
toilet	1
which	1
rendered	1
her	1
fresh	1
and	1
pretty	1
face	1
yet	1
more	1
attractive.	1
	1
"What!	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
remain	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
dear	1
princess?"	1
she	1
began.	1
"They'll	1
be	1
announcing	1
that	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
smartened	1
yourself	1
up	1
at	1
all!"	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
got	1
up,	1
rang	1
for	1
the	1
maid,	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
merrily	1
began	1
to	1
devise	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
how	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
should	1
be	1
dressed.	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
self-esteem	1
was	1
wounded	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
suitor	1
agitated	1
her,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
by	1
both	1
her	1
companions'	1
not	1
having	1
the	1
least	1
conception	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
otherwise.	1
To	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
betray	1
her	1
agitation,	1
while	1
to	1
decline	1
their	1
offers	1
to	1
dress	1
her	1
would	1
prolong	1
their	1
banter	1
and	1
insistence.	1
She	1
flushed,	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim,	1
red	1
blotches	1
came	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
it	1
took	1
on	1
the	1
unattractive	1
martyrlike	1
expression	1
it	1
so	1
often	1
wore,	1
as	1
she	1
submitted	1
herself	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
Lise.	1
Both	1
these	1
women	1
quite	1
sincerely	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
look	1
pretty.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
plain	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
rival,	1
so	1
they	1
began	1
dressing	1
her	1
with	1
perfect	1
sincerity,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
naive	1
and	1
firm	1
conviction	1
women	1
have	1
that	1
dress	1
can	1
make	1
a	1
face	1
pretty.	1
	1
"No	1
really,	1
my	1
dear,	1
this	1
dress	1
is	1
not	1
pretty,"	1
said	1
Lise,	1
looking	1
sideways	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
distance.	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
maroon	1
dress,	1
have	1
it	1
fetched.	1
Really!	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
your	1
whole	1
life	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
stake.	1
But	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
too	1
light,	1
it's	1
not	1
becoming!"	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
dress,	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
figure	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
pretty,	1
but	1
neither	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
nor	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
felt	1
this;	1
they	1
still	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
blue	1
ribbon	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
hair,	1
the	1
hair	1
combed	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
blue	1
scarf	1
arranged	1
lower	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
maroon	1
dress,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well.	1
They	1
forgot	1
that	1
the	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
figure	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
altered,	1
and	1
that	1
however	1
they	1
might	1
change	1
the	1
setting	1
and	1
adornment	1
of	1
that	1
face,	1
it	1
would	1
still	1
remain	1
piteous	1
and	1
plain.	1
After	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
changes	1
to	1
which	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
meekly	1
submitted,	1
just	1
as	1
her	1
hair	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
(a	1
style	1
that	1
quite	1
altered	1
and	1
spoiled	1
her	1
looks)	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
maroon	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1
pale-blue	1
scarf,	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
walked	1
twice	1
round	1
her,	1
now	1
adjusting	1
a	1
fold	1
of	1
the	1
dress	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
hand,	1
now	1
arranging	1
the	1
scarf	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
bent	1
first	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
then	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do,"	1
she	1
said	1
decidedly,	1
clasping	1
her	1
hands.	1
"No,	1
Mary,	1
really	1
this	1
dress	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
you.	1
I	1
prefer	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
little	1
gray	1
everyday	1
dress.	1
Now	1
please,	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
sake.	1
Katie,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
"bring	1
the	1
princess	1
her	1
gray	1
dress,	1
and	1
you'll	1
see,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
how	1
I	1
shall	1
arrange	1
it,"	1
she	1
added,	1
smiling	1
with	1
a	1
foretaste	1
of	1
artistic	1
pleasure.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
Katie	1
brought	1
the	1
required	1
dress,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
remained	1
sitting	1
motionless	1
before	1
the	1
glass,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
her	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
quivering,	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
	1
"Come,	1
dear	1
princess,"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
"just	1
one	1
more	1
little	1
effort."	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess,	1
taking	1
the	1
dress	1
from	1
the	1
maid,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
we'll	1
arrange	1
something	1
quite	1
simple	1
and	1
becoming,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
three	1
voices,	1
hers,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's,	1
and	1
Katie's,	1
who	1
was	1
laughing	1
at	1
something,	1
mingled	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
sound,	1
like	1
the	1
chirping	1
of	1
birds.	1
	1
"No,	1
leave	1
me	1
alone,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Her	1
voice	1
sounded	1
so	1
serious	1
and	1
so	1
sad	1
that	1
the	1
chirping	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
was	1
silenced	1
at	1
once.	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful,	1
large,	1
thoughtful	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
of	1
thoughts,	1
gazing	1
shiningly	1
and	1
imploringly	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
understood	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
and	1
even	1
cruel	1
to	1
insist.	1
	1
"At	1
least,	1
change	1
your	1
coiffure,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
reproachfully	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
"Mary's	1
is	1
a	1
face	1
which	1
such	1
a	1
coiffure	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
Not	1
in	1
the	1
least!	1
Please	1
change	1
it."	1
	1
"Leave	1
me	1
alone,	1
please	1
leave	1
me	1
alone!	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
quite	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me,"	1
answered	1
a	1
voice	1
struggling	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
to	1
own	1
to	1
themselves	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
this	1
guise	1
looked	1
very	1
plain,	1
worse	1
than	1
usual,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late.	1
She	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
they	1
both	1
knew,	1
an	1
expression	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
sad.	1
This	1
expression	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
frighten	1
them	1
(she	1
never	1
inspired	1
fear	1
in	1
anyone),	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
appeared	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
she	1
became	1
mute	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
in	1
her	1
determination.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
change	1
it,	1
won't	1
you?"	1
said	1
Lise.	1
And	1
as	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
gave	1
no	1
answer,	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
left	1
alone.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
comply	1
with	1
Lise's	1
request,	1
she	1
not	1
only	1
left	1
her	1
hair	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
glass.	1
Letting	1
her	1
arms	1
fall	1
helplessly,	1
she	1
sat	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
and	1
pondered.	1
A	1
husband,	1
a	1
man,	1
a	1
strong	1
dominant	1
and	1
strangely	1
attractive	1
being	1
rose	1
in	1
her	1
imagination,	1
and	1
carried	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
totally	1
different	1
happy	1
world	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
She	1
fancied	1
a	1
child,	1
her	1
own--such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
her	1
nurse's	1
daughter--at	1
her	1
own	1
breast,	1
the	1
husband	1
standing	1
by	1
and	1
gazing	1
tenderly	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
child.	1
"But	1
no,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
ugly,"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
"Please	1
come	1
to	1
tea.	1
The	1
prince	1
will	1
be	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
moment,"	1
came	1
the	1
maid's	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
She	1
roused	1
herself,	1
and	1
felt	1
appalled	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking,	1
and	1
before	1
going	1
down	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
icons	1
hung	1
and,	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
dark	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Saviour	1
lit	1
by	1
a	1
lamp,	1
she	1
stood	1
before	1
it	1
with	1
folded	1
hands	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments.	1
A	1
painful	1
doubt	1
filled	1
her	1
soul.	1
Could	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
love,	1
of	1
earthly	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
be	1
for	1
her?	1
In	1
her	1
thoughts	1
of	1
marriage	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
dreamed	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
of	1
children,	1
but	1
her	1
strongest,	1
most	1
deeply	1
hidden	1
longing	1
was	1
for	1
earthly	1
love.	1
The	1
more	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
this	1
feeling	1
from	1
others	1
and	1
even	1
from	1
herself,	1
the	1
stronger	1
it	1
grew.	1
"O	1
God,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
stifle	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
these	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil?	1
How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
renounce	1
forever	1
these	1
vile	1
fancies,	1
so	1
as	1
peacefully	1
to	1
fulfill	1
Thy	1
will?"	1
And	1
scarcely	1
had	1
she	1
put	1
that	1
question	1
than	1
God	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
answer	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
heart.	1
"Desire	1
nothing	1
for	1
thyself,	1
seek	1
nothing,	1
be	1
not	1
anxious	1
or	1
envious.	1
Man's	1
future	1
and	1
thy	1
own	1
fate	1
must	1
remain	1
hidden	1
from	1
thee,	1
but	1
live	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
anything.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
God's	1
will	1
to	1
prove	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
marriage,	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
fulfill	1
His	1
will."	1
With	1
this	1
consoling	1
thought	1
(but	1
yet	1
with	1
a	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
her	1
forbidden	1
earthly	1
longing)	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sighed,	1
and	1
having	1
crossed	1
herself	1
went	1
down,	1
thinking	1
neither	1
of	1
her	1
gown	1
and	1
coiffure	1
nor	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
in	1
nor	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say.	1
What	1
could	1
all	1
that	1
matter	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
without	1
Whose	1
care	1
not	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
man's	1
head	1
can	1
fall?	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
came	1
down,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
When	1
she	1
entered	1
with	1
her	1
heavy	1
step,	1
treading	1
on	1
her	1
heels,	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
rose	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
indicating	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
gentlemen,	1
said:	1
"Voila	1
Marie!"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
saw	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
detail.	1
She	1
saw	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
face,	1
serious	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her,	1
but	1
immediately	1
smiling	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
curiously	1
noting	1
the	1
impression	1
"Marie"	1
produced	1
on	1
the	1
visitors.	1
And	1
she	1
saw	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
with	1
her	1
ribbon	1
and	1
pretty	1
face,	1
and	1
her	1
unusually	1
animated	1
look	1
which	1
was	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see,	1
she	1
only	1
saw	1
something	1
large,	1
brilliant,	1
and	1
handsome	1
moving	1
toward	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
approached	1
first,	1
and	1
she	1
kissed	1
the	1
bold	1
forehead	1
that	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
answered	1
his	1
question	1
by	1
saying	1
that,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
she	1
remembered	1
him	1
quite	1
well.	1
Then	1
Anatole	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him.	1
She	1
only	1
felt	1
a	1
soft	1
hand	1
taking	1
hers	1
firmly,	1
and	1
she	1
touched	1
with	1
her	1
lips	1
a	1
white	1
forehead,	1
over	1
which	1
was	1
beautiful	1
light-	1
brown	1
hair	1
smelling	1
of	1
pomade.	1
When	1
she	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
his	1
beauty.	1
Anatole	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
thumb	1
under	1
a	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
uniform,	1
his	1
chest	1
expanded	1
and	1
his	1
back	1
drawn	1
in,	1
slightly	1
swinging	1
one	1
foot,	1
and,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
bent,	1
looked	1
with	1
beaming	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
without	1
speaking	1
and	1
evidently	1
not	1
thinking	1
about	1
her	1
at	1
all.	1
Anatole	1
was	1
not	1
quick-witted,	1
nor	1
ready	1
or	1
eloquent	1
in	1
conversation,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
faculty,	1
so	1
invaluable	1
in	1
society,	1
of	1
composure	1
and	1
imperturbable	1
self-possession.	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
lacking	1
in	1
self-confidence	1
remains	1
dumb	1
on	1
a	1
first	1
introduction	1
and	1
betrays	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
such	1
silence	1
and	1
an	1
anxiety	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
effect	1
is	1
bad.	1
But	1
Anatole	1
was	1
dumb,	1
swung	1
his	1
foot,	1
and	1
smilingly	1
examined	1
the	1
princess'	1
hair.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
silent	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time.	1
"If	1
anyone	1
finds	1
this	1
silence	1
inconvenient,	1
let	1
him	1
talk,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to,"	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
in	1
his	1
behavior	1
to	1
women	1
Anatole	1
had	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
particularly	1
inspires	1
in	1
them	1
curiosity,	1
awe,	1
and	1
even	1
love--a	1
supercilious	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
superiority.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them:	1
"I	1
know	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you,	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
bother	1
about	1
you?	1
You'd	1
be	1
only	1
too	1
glad,	1
of	1
course."	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
think	1
this	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
women--even	1
probably	1
he	1
did	1
not,	1
for	1
in	1
general	1
he	1
thought	1
very	1
little--but	1
his	1
looks	1
and	1
manner	1
gave	1
that	1
impression.	1
The	1
princess	1
felt	1
this,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
dare	1
expect	1
to	1
interest	1
him,	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
general	1
and	1
animated,	1
thanks	1
to	1
Princess	1
Lise's	1
voice	1
and	1
little	1
downy	1
lip	1
that	1
lifted	1
over	1
her	1
white	1
teeth.	1
She	1
met	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
with	1
that	1
playful	1
manner	1
often	1
employed	1
by	1
lively	1
chatty	1
people,	1
and	1
consisting	1
in	1
the	1
assumption	1
that	1
between	1
the	1
person	1
they	1
so	1
address	1
and	1
themselves	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
semi-private,	1
long-established	1
jokes	1
and	1
amusing	1
reminiscences,	1
though	1
no	1
such	1
reminiscences	1
really	1
exist--just	1
as	1
none	1
existed	1
in	1
this	1
case.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
readily	1
adopted	1
her	1
tone	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
also	1
drew	1
Anatole,	1
whom	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew,	1
into	1
these	1
amusing	1
recollections	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
never	1
occurred.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
also	1
shared	1
them	1
and	1
even	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
felt	1
herself	1
pleasantly	1
made	1
to	1
share	1
in	1
these	1
merry	1
reminiscences.	1
	1
"Here	1
at	1
least	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
your	1
company	1
all	1
to	1
ourselves,	1
dear	1
prince,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
(of	1
course,	1
in	1
French)	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
"It's	1
not	1
as	1
at	1
Annette's	1
*	1
receptions	1
where	1
you	1
always	1
ran	1
away;	1
you	1
remember	1
cette	1
chere	1
Annette!"	1
	1
	1
*	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
but	1
you	1
won't	1
talk	1
politics	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
Annette!"	1
	1
"And	1
our	1
little	1
tea	1
table?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!"	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
were	1
never	1
at	1
Annette's?"	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
asked	1
Anatole.	1
"Ah,	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
glance,	1
"your	1
brother	1
Hippolyte	1
told	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
goings	1
on.	1
Oh!"	1
and	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
finger	1
at	1
him,	1
"I	1
have	1
even	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
doings	1
in	1
Paris!"	1
	1
"And	1
didn't	1
Hippolyte	1
tell	1
you?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
arm	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
managed	1
to	1
catch	1
her,	1
"didn't	1
he	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
pining	1
for	1
the	1
dear	1
princess,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
door?	1
Oh,	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
pearl	1
among	1
women,	1
Princess,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
When	1
Paris	1
was	1
mentioned,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
for	1
her	1
part	1
seized	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
joining	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
current	1
of	1
recollections.	1
	1
She	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
inquiring	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
Anatole	1
had	1
left	1
Paris	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
liked	1
that	1
city.	1
Anatole	1
answered	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
very	1
readily	1
and,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
native	1
land.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
pretty	1
little	1
Bourienne,	1
Anatole	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
find	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
dull	1
either.	1
"Not	1
at	1
all	1
bad!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
examining	1
her,	1
"not	1
at	1
all	1
bad,	1
that	1
little	1
companion!	1
I	1
hope	1
she	1
will	1
bring	1
her	1
along	1
with	1
her	1
when	1
we're	1
married,	1
la	1
petite	1
est	1
gentille."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
little	1
one	1
is	1
charming.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
dressed	1
leisurely	1
in	1
his	1
study,	1
frowning	1
and	1
considering	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
coming	1
of	1
these	1
visitors	1
annoyed	1
him.	1
"What	1
are	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
that	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
to	1
me?	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
is	1
a	1
shallow	1
braggart	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
specimen,"	1
he	1
grumbled	1
to	1
himself.	1
What	1
angered	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
these	1
visitors	1
revived	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
an	1
unsettled	1
question	1
he	1
always	1
tried	1
to	1
stifle,	1
one	1
about	1
which	1
he	1
always	1
deceived	1
himself.	1
The	1
question	1
was	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
ever	1
bring	1
himself	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
husband.	1
The	1
prince	1
never	1
directly	1
asked	1
himself	1
that	1
question,	1
knowing	1
beforehand	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
answer	1
it	1
justly,	1
and	1
justice	1
clashed	1
not	1
only	1
with	1
his	1
feelings	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
possibility	1
of	1
life.	1
Life	1
without	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
little	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
value	1
her,	1
was	1
unthinkable	1
to	1
him.	1
"And	1
why	1
should	1
she	1
marry?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"To	1
be	1
unhappy	1
for	1
certain.	1
There's	1
Lise,	1
married	1
to	1
Andrew--a	1
better	1
husband	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
found	1
nowadays--but	1
is	1
she	1
contented	1
with	1
her	1
lot?	1
And	1
who	1
would	1
marry	1
Marie	1
for	1
love?	1
Plain	1
and	1
awkward!	1
They'll	1
take	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
connections	1
and	1
wealth.	1
Are	1
there	1
no	1
women	1
living	1
unmarried,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
happier	1
for	1
it?"	1
So	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
while	1
dressing,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
putting	1
off	1
demanded	1
an	1
immediate	1
answer.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
brought	1
his	1
son	1
with	1
the	1
evident	1
intention	1
of	1
proposing,	1
and	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
would	1
probably	1
ask	1
for	1
an	1
answer.	1
His	1
birth	1
and	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
were	1
not	1
bad.	1
"Well,	1
I've	1
nothing	1
against	1
it,"	1
the	1
prince	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"but	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
her.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
see."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
see!	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
see!"	1
he	1
added	1
aloud.	1
	1
He	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
alert	1
step,	1
glancing	1
rapidly	1
round	1
the	1
company.	1
He	1
noticed	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
dress,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
ribbon,	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
unbecoming	1
coiffure,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
and	1
Anatole's	1
smiles,	1
and	1
the	1
loneliness	1
of	1
his	1
daughter	1
amid	1
the	1
general	1
conversation.	1
"Got	1
herself	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
fool!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
looking	1
irritably	1
at	1
her.	1
"She	1
is	1
shameless,	1
and	1
he	1
ignores	1
her!"	1
	1
He	1
went	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"Well!	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do?	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do?	1
Glad	1
to	1
see	1
you!"	1
	1
"Friendship	1
laughs	1
at	1
distance,"	1
began	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
rapid,	1
self-confident,	1
familiar	1
tone.	1
"Here	1
is	1
my	1
second	1
son;	1
please	1
love	1
and	1
befriend	1
him."	1
	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
surveyed	1
Anatole.	1
	1
"Fine	1
young	1
fellow!	1
Fine	1
young	1
fellow!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Well,	1
come	1
and	1
kiss	1
me,"	1
and	1
he	1
offered	1
his	1
cheek.	1
	1
Anatole	1
kissed	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
curiosity	1
and	1
perfect	1
composure,	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
display	1
of	1
the	1
eccentricities	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
expect.	1
	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
and,	1
drawing	1
up	1
an	1
armchair	1
for	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
pointed	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
him	1
about	1
political	1
affairs	1
and	1
news.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
listen	1
attentively	1
to	1
what	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said,	1
but	1
kept	1
glancing	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
they	1
are	1
writing	1
from	1
Potsdam	1
already?"	1
he	1
said,	1
repeating	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
last	1
words.	1
Then	1
rising,	1
he	1
suddenly	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
for	1
visitors	1
you've	1
got	1
yourself	1
up	1
like	1
that,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Fine,	1
very	1
fine!	1
You	1
have	1
done	1
up	1
your	1
hair	1
in	1
this	1
new	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
visitors,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
visitors	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
future	1
you	1
are	1
never	1
to	1
dare	1
to	1
change	1
your	1
way	1
of	1
dress	1
without	1
my	1
consent."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
my	1
fault,	1
mon	1
pere,"	1
interceded	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
with	1
a	1
blush.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
bowing	1
to	1
his	1
daughter-in-law,	1
"but	1
she	1
need	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
herself,	1
she's	1
plain	1
enough	1
as	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
again,	1
paying	1
no	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
who	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
tears.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
that	1
coiffure	1
suits	1
the	1
princess	1
very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"Now	1
you,	1
young	1
prince,	1
what's	1
your	1
name?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anatole,	1
"come	1
here,	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
and	1
get	1
acquainted."	1
	1
"Now	1
the	1
fun	1
begins,"	1
thought	1
Anatole,	1
sitting	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
beside	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
I	1
hear	1
you've	1
been	1
educated	1
abroad,	1
not	1
taught	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
by	1
the	1
deacon,	1
like	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
me.	1
Now	1
tell	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
are	1
you	1
serving	1
in	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards?"	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
scrutinizing	1
Anatole	1
closely	1
and	1
intently.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
line,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
That's	1
a	1
good	1
thing.	1
So,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
country?	1
It	1
is	1
wartime.	1
Such	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
must	1
serve.	1
Well,	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
front?"	1
	1
"No,	1
Prince,	1
our	1
regiment	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
attached...	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
attached	1
to,	1
Papa?"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
with	1
a	1
laugh.	1
	1
"A	1
splendid	1
soldier,	1
splendid!	1
'What	1
am	1
I	1
attached	1
to!'	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
laughed	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
Anatole	1
laughed	1
still	1
louder.	1
Suddenly	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
frowned.	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
go,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Anatole.	1
	1
Anatole	1
returned	1
smiling	1
to	1
the	1
ladies.	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you've	1
had	1
him	1
educated	1
abroad,	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
haven't	1
you?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
done	1
my	1
best	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
the	1
education	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
ours."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
everything	1
is	1
different	1
nowadays,	1
everything	1
is	1
changed.	1
The	1
lad's	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow,	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow!	1
Well,	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
now."	1
He	1
took	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
arm	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
together,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
announced	1
his	1
hopes	1
and	1
wishes	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
"Well,	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
prevent	1
her,	1
that	1
I	1
can't	1
part	1
from	1
her?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
angrily.	1
"What	1
an	1
idea!	1
I'm	1
ready	1
for	1
it	1
tomorrow!	1
Only	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
son-in-law	1
better.	1
You	1
know	1
my	1
principles--everything	1
aboveboard?	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
her	1
tomorrow	1
in	1
your	1
presence;	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
willing,	1
then	1
he	1
can	1
stay	1
on.	1
He	1
can	1
stay	1
and	1
I'll	1
see."	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
snorted.	1
"Let	1
her	1
marry,	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me!"	1
he	1
screamed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
piercing	1
tone	1
as	1
when	1
parting	1
from	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
frankly,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
crafty	1
man	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
futility	1
of	1
being	1
cunning	1
with	1
so	1
keen-sighted	1
a	1
companion.	1
"You	1
know,	1
you	1
see	1
right	1
through	1
people.	1
Anatole	1
is	1
no	1
genius,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
honest,	1
goodhearted	1
lad;	1
an	1
excellent	1
son	1
or	1
kinsman."	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,	1
we'll	1
see!"	1
	1
As	1
always	1
happens	1
when	1
women	1
lead	1
lonely	1
lives	1
for	1
any	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
without	1
male	1
society,	1
on	1
Anatole's	1
appearance	1
all	1
the	1
three	1
women	1
of	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski's	1
household	1
felt	1
that	1
their	1
life	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
real	1
till	1
then.	1
Their	1
powers	1
of	1
reasoning,	1
feeling,	1
and	1
observing	1
immediately	1
increased	1
tenfold,	1
and	1
their	1
life,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
passed	1
in	1
darkness,	1
was	1
suddenly	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
brightness,	1
full	1
of	1
significance.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
grew	1
quite	1
unconscious	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
coiffure.	1
The	1
handsome	1
open	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
might	1
perhaps	1
be	1
her	1
husband	1
absorbed	1
all	1
her	1
attention.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
kind,	1
brave,	1
determined,	1
manly,	1
and	1
magnanimous.	1
She	1
felt	1
convinced	1
of	1
that.	1
Thousands	1
of	1
dreams	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
family	1
life	1
continually	1
rose	1
in	1
her	1
imagination.	1
She	1
drove	1
them	1
away	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
them.	1
	1
"But	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
too	1
cold	1
with	1
him?"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess.	1
"I	1
try	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
feel	1
too	1
near	1
to	1
him	1
already,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
may	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
him."	1
	1
And	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
tried,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
manage,	1
to	1
be	1
cordial	1
to	1
her	1
new	1
guest.	1
"Poor	1
girl,	1
she's	1
devilish	1
ugly!"	1
thought	1
Anatole.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
also	1
roused	1
to	1
great	1
excitement	1
by	1
Anatole's	1
arrival,	1
thought	1
in	1
another	1
way.	1
Of	1
course,	1
she,	1
a	1
handsome	1
young	1
woman	1
without	1
any	1
definite	1
position,	1
without	1
relations	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
country,	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
devote	1
her	1
life	1
to	1
serving	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
to	1
reading	1
aloud	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
being	1
friends	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
Russian	1
prince	1
who,	1
able	1
to	1
appreciate	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
her	1
superiority	1
to	1
the	1
plain,	1
badly	1
dressed,	1
ungainly	1
Russian	1
princesses,	1
would	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
carry	1
her	1
off;	1
and	1
here	1
at	1
last	1
was	1
a	1
Russian	1
prince.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
knew	1
a	1
story,	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
aunt	1
but	1
finished	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
way,	1
which	1
she	1
liked	1
to	1
repeat	1
to	1
herself.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
seduced,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
her	1
poor	1
mother	1
(sa	1
pauvre	1
mere)	1
appeared,	1
and	1
reproached	1
her	1
for	1
yielding	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
being	1
married.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
often	1
touched	1
to	1
tears	1
as	1
in	1
imagination	1
she	1
told	1
this	1
story	1
to	1
him,	1
her	1
seducer.	1
And	1
now	1
he,	1
a	1
real	1
Russian	1
prince,	1
had	1
appeared.	1
He	1
would	1
carry	1
her	1
away	1
and	1
then	1
sa	1
pauvre	1
mere	1
would	1
appear	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
marry	1
her.	1
So	1
her	1
future	1
shaped	1
itself	1
in	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
head	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Anatole	1
about	1
Paris.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
calculation	1
that	1
guided	1
her	1
(she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
consider	1
what	1
she	1
should	1
do),	1
but	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
familiar	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
Anatole	1
had	1
appeared	1
it	1
just	1
grouped	1
itself	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
wished	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess,	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
war	1
horse	1
that	1
hears	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
unconsciously	1
and	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
her	1
condition,	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
familiar	1
gallop	1
of	1
coquetry,	1
without	1
any	1
ulterior	1
motive	1
or	1
any	1
struggle,	1
but	1
with	1
naive	1
and	1
lighthearted	1
gaiety.	1
	1
Although	1
in	1
female	1
society	1
Anatole	1
usually	1
assumed	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
tired	1
of	1
being	1
run	1
after	1
by	1
women,	1
his	1
vanity	1
was	1
flattered	1
by	1
the	1
spectacle	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
over	1
these	1
three	1
women.	1
Besides	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
for	1
the	1
pretty	1
and	1
provocative	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
that	1
passionate	1
animal	1
feeling	1
which	1
was	1
apt	1
to	1
master	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
suddenness	1
and	1
prompt	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
coarsest	1
and	1
most	1
reckless	1
actions.	1
	1
After	1
tea,	1
the	1
company	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
Anatole,	1
laughing	1
and	1
in	1
high	1
spirits,	1
came	1
and	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
elbows,	1
facing	1
her	1
and	1
beside	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
felt	1
his	1
look	1
with	1
a	1
painfully	1
joyous	1
emotion.	1
Her	1
favorite	1
sonata	1
bore	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
most	1
intimately	1
poetic	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
look	1
she	1
felt	1
upon	1
her	1
made	1
that	1
world	1
still	1
more	1
poetic.	1
But	1
Anatole's	1
expression,	1
though	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her,	1
referred	1
not	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
little	1
foot,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
touching	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
under	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
also	1
looking	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
lovely	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
fearful	1
joy	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
was	1
also	1
new	1
to	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"How	1
she	1
loves	1
me!"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"How	1
happy	1
I	1
am	1
now,	1
and	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
husband!	1
Husband?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
possible?"	1
she	1
thought,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
face,	1
but	1
still	1
feeling	1
his	1
eyes	1
gazing	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
evening,	1
after	1
supper,	1
when	1
all	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
retire,	1
Anatole	1
kissed	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
hand.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
courage,	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
shortsighted	1
eyes.	1
Turning	1
from	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
kissed	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
hand.	1
(This	1
was	1
not	1
etiquette,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
did	1
everything	1
so	1
simply	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
assurance!)	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
flushed,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
princess	1
a	1
frightened	1
look.	1
	1
"What	1
delicacy!"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess.	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
Amelie"	1
(Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne)	1
"thinks	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
not	1
value	1
her	1
pure	1
affection	1
and	1
devotion	1
to	1
me?"	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
warmly.	1
Anatole	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
hand.	1
	1
"No!	1
No!	1
No!	1
When	1
your	1
father	1
writes	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
behaving	1
well	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss.	1
Not	1
till	1
then!"	1
she	1
said.	1
And	1
smilingly	1
raising	1
a	1
finger	1
at	1
him,	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
They	1
all	1
separated,	1
but,	1
except	1
Anatole	1
who	1
fell	1
asleep	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
bed,	1
all	1
kept	1
awake	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
really	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
husband,	1
this	1
stranger	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
kind--yes,	1
kind,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
thing,"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary;	1
and	1
fear,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
seldom	1
experienced,	1
came	1
upon	1
her.	1
She	1
feared	1
to	1
look	1
round,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
someone	1
was	1
there	1
standing	1
behind	1
the	1
screen	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
corner.	1
And	1
this	1
someone	1
was	1
he--the	1
devil--and	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
this	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
forehead,	1
black	1
eyebrows,	1
and	1
red	1
lips.	1
	1
She	1
rang	1
for	1
her	1
maid	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
her	1
room.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
conservatory	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
that	1
evening,	1
vainly	1
expecting	1
someone,	1
now	1
smiling	1
at	1
someone,	1
now	1
working	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
tears	1
with	1
the	1
imaginary	1
words	1
of	1
her	1
pauvre	1
mere	1
rebuking	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
fall.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
grumbled	1
to	1
her	1
maid	1
that	1
her	1
bed	1
was	1
badly	1
made.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
lie	1
either	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
or	1
on	1
her	1
side.	1
Every	1
position	1
was	1
awkward	1
and	1
uncomfortable,	1
and	1
her	1
burden	1
oppressed	1
her	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
because	1
Anatole's	1
presence	1
had	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
when	1
everything	1
was	1
light	1
and	1
gay.	1
She	1
sat	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
in	1
her	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
and	1
nightcap	1
and	1
Katie,	1
sleepy	1
and	1
disheveled,	1
beat	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
heavy	1
feather	1
bed	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
muttering	1
to	1
herself.	1
	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
lumps	1
and	1
holes!"	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
repeated.	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
enough	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
so	1
it's	1
not	1
my	1
fault!"	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
quivered	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
about	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
either.	1
Tikhon,	1
half	1
asleep,	1
heard	1
him	1
pacing	1
angrily	1
about	1
and	1
snorting.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
insulted	1
through	1
his	1
daughter.	1
The	1
insult	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
pointed	1
because	1
it	1
concerned	1
not	1
himself	1
but	1
another,	1
his	1
daughter,	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
more	1
than	1
himself.	1
He	1
kept	1
telling	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
consider	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
and	1
decide	1
what	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
should	1
act,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
excited	1
himself	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
"The	1
first	1
man	1
that	1
turns	1
up--she	1
forgets	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
everything	1
else,	1
runs	1
upstairs	1
and	1
does	1
up	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
wags	1
her	1
tail	1
and	1
is	1
unlike	1
herself!	1
Glad	1
to	1
throw	1
her	1
father	1
over!	1
And	1
she	1
knew	1
I	1
should	1
notice	1
it.	1
Fr...	1
fr...	1
fr!	1
And	1
don't	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
that	1
idiot	1
had	1
eyes	1
only	1
for	1
Bourienne--I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
her.	1
And	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
pride	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
it?	1
If	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
pride	1
for	1
herself	1
she	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
have	1
some	1
for	1
my	1
sake!	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
shown	1
that	1
the	1
blockhead	1
thinks	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
looks	1
only	1
at	1
Bourienne.	1
No,	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
pride...	1
but	1
I'll	1
let	1
her	1
see...."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
daughter	1
she	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
mistake	1
and	1
that	1
Anatole	1
meant	1
to	1
flirt	1
with	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
self-esteem	1
would	1
be	1
wounded	1
and	1
his	1
point	1
(not	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
her)	1
would	1
be	1
gained,	1
so	1
pacifying	1
himself	1
with	1
this	1
thought,	1
he	1
called	1
Tikhon	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
undress.	1
	1
"What	1
devil	1
brought	1
them	1
here?"	1
thought	1
he,	1
while	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
putting	1
the	1
nightshirt	1
over	1
his	1
dried-up	1
old	1
body	1
and	1
gray-haired	1
chest.	1
"I	1
never	1
invited	1
them.	1
They	1
came	1
to	1
disturb	1
my	1
life--and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
left."	1
	1
"Devil	1
take	1
'em!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
while	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
still	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
shirt.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
knew	1
his	1
master's	1
habit	1
of	1
sometimes	1
thinking	1
aloud,	1
and	1
therefore	1
met	1
with	1
unaltered	1
looks	1
the	1
angrily	1
inquisitive	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
that	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
shirt.	1
	1
"Gone	1
to	1
bed?"	1
asked	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
Tikhon,	1
like	1
all	1
good	1
valets,	1
instinctively	1
knew	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
master's	1
thoughts.	1
He	1
guessed	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
referred	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
their	1
lights,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"No	1
good...	1
no	1
good..."	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
rapidly,	1
and	1
thrusting	1
his	1
feet	1
into	1
his	1
slippers	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
into	1
the	1
sleeves	1
of	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
couch	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
slept.	1
	1
Though	1
no	1
words	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
they	1
quite	1
understood	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
romance,	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
pauvre	1
mere;	1
they	1
understood	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
private	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
seeking	1
an	1
opportunity	1
since	1
morning	1
to	1
meet	1
one	1
another	1
alone.	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
usual	1
hour,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
Anatole	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
conservatory.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
with	1
special	1
trepidation.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
everybody	1
know	1
that	1
her	1
fate	1
would	1
be	1
decided	1
that	1
day,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
thought	1
about	1
it.	1
She	1
read	1
this	1
in	1
Tikhon's	1
face	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
valet,	1
who	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
carrying	1
hot	1
water.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
very	1
affectionate	1
and	1
careful	1
in	1
his	1
treatment	1
of	1
his	1
daughter	1
that	1
morning.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
well	1
knew	1
this	1
painstaking	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
father's.	1
His	1
face	1
wore	1
that	1
expression	1
when	1
his	1
dry	1
hands	1
clenched	1
with	1
vexation	1
at	1
her	1
not	1
understanding	1
a	1
sum	1
in	1
arithmetic,	1
when	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
he	1
would	1
walk	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
repeating	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
several	1
times	1
over.	1
	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
once,	1
treating	1
her	1
ceremoniously.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
proposition	1
made	1
me	1
concerning	1
you,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
unnatural	1
smile.	1
"I	1
expect	1
you	1
have	1
guessed	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
has	1
not	1
come	1
and	1
brought	1
his	1
pupil	1
with	1
him"	1
(for	1
some	1
reason	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
referred	1
to	1
Anatole	1
as	1
a	1
"pupil")	1
"for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
my	1
beautiful	1
eyes.	1
Last	1
night	1
a	1
proposition	1
was	1
made	1
me	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
principles,	1
I	1
refer	1
it	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
understand	1
you,	1
mon	1
pere?"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
growing	1
pale	1
and	1
then	1
blushing.	1
	1
"How	1
understand	1
me!"	1
cried	1
her	1
father	1
angrily.	1
"Prince	1
Vasili	1
finds	1
you	1
to	1
his	1
taste	1
as	1
a	1
daughter-in-law	1
and	1
makes	1
a	1
proposal	1
to	1
you	1
on	1
his	1
pupil's	1
behalf.	1
That's	1
how	1
it's	1
to	1
be	1
understood!	1
'How	1
understand	1
it'!...	1
And	1
I	1
ask	1
you!"	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
think,	1
Father,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"I?	1
I?	1
What	1
of	1
me?	1
Leave	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
I'm	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
married.	1
What	1
about	1
you?	1
That's	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
regarded	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
disapproval,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
thought	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
fate	1
would	1
be	1
decided	1
now	1
or	1
never.	1
She	1
lowered	1
her	1
eyes	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
gaze	1
under	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think,	1
but	1
would	1
only	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
submit	1
from	1
habit,	1
and	1
she	1
said:	1
"I	1
wish	1
only	1
to	1
do	1
your	1
will,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
own	1
desire..."	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
finish.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
interrupted	1
her.	1
	1
"That's	1
admirable!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"He	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
with	1
your	1
dowry	1
and	1
take	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
She'll	1
be	1
the	1
wife,	1
while	1
you..."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
stopped.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
effect	1
these	1
words	1
had	1
produced	1
on	1
his	1
daughter.	1
She	1
lowered	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
now	1
then,	1
I'm	1
only	1
joking!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Remember	1
this,	1
Princess,	1
I	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
a	1
maiden	1
has	1
a	1
full	1
right	1
to	1
choose.	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
freedom.	1
Only	1
remember	1
that	1
your	1
life's	1
happiness	1
depends	1
on	1
your	1
decision.	1
Never	1
mind	1
me!"	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
Father!"	1
	1
"There's	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
talk!	1
He	1
receives	1
his	1
orders	1
and	1
will	1
marry	1
you	1
or	1
anybody;	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
free	1
to	1
choose....	1
Go	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
think	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
presence:	1
yes	1
or	1
no.	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
pray	1
over	1
it.	1
Well,	1
pray	1
if	1
you	1
like,	1
but	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
think	1
it	1
over.	1
Go!	1
Yes	1
or	1
no,	1
yes	1
or	1
no,	1
yes	1
or	1
no!"	1
he	1
still	1
shouted	1
when	1
the	1
princess,	1
as	1
if	1
lost	1
in	1
a	1
fog,	1
had	1
already	1
staggered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study.	1
	1
Her	1
fate	1
was	1
decided	1
and	1
happily	1
decided.	1
But	1
what	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
said	1
about	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
dreadful.	1
It	1
was	1
untrue	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
terrible,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
of	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
going	1
straight	1
on	1
through	1
the	1
conservatory,	1
neither	1
seeing	1
nor	1
hearing	1
anything,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
the	1
well-known	1
whispering	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
aroused	1
her.	1
She	1
raised	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
two	1
steps	1
away	1
saw	1
Anatole	1
embracing	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
and	1
whispering	1
something	1
to	1
her.	1
With	1
a	1
horrified	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
handsome	1
face,	1
Anatole	1
looked	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
take	1
his	1
arm	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
her.	1
	1
"Who's	1
that?	1
Why?	1
Wait	1
a	1
moment!"	1
Anatole's	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
in	1
silence.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
At	1
last	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
gave	1
a	1
scream	1
and	1
ran	1
away.	1
Anatole	1
bowed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
gay	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
inviting	1
her	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
a	1
laugh	1
at	1
this	1
strange	1
incident,	1
and	1
then	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
apartments.	1
	1
An	1
hour	1
later,	1
Tikhon	1
came	1
to	1
call	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince;	1
he	1
added	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
also	1
there.	1
When	1
Tikhon	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
holding	1
the	1
weeping	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
gently	1
stroking	1
her	1
hair.	1
The	1
princess'	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
former	1
calm	1
radiance	1
were	1
looking	1
with	1
tender	1
affection	1
and	1
pity	1
at	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
pretty	1
face.	1
	1
"No,	1
Princess,	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
your	1
affection	1
forever!"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
"Why?	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
ever,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
"and	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
for	1
your	1
happiness."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
despise	1
me.	1
You	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
pure	1
can	1
never	1
understand	1
being	1
so	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
passion.	1
Oh,	1
only	1
my	1
poor	1
mother..."	1
	1
"I	1
quite	1
understand,"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
smile.	1
"Calm	1
yourself,	1
my	1
dear.	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
father,"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
thrown	1
high	1
over	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
a	1
snuffbox	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
was	1
sitting	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
deep	1
emotion	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
as	1
if	1
stirred	1
to	1
his	1
heart's	1
core	1
and	1
himself	1
regretting	1
and	1
laughing	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
sensibility,	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entered.	1
He	1
hurriedly	1
took	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
snuff.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,	1
my	1
dear!"	1
he	1
began,	1
rising	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
by	1
both	1
hands.	1
Then,	1
sighing,	1
he	1
added:	1
"My	1
son's	1
fate	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
hands.	1
Decide,	1
my	1
dear,	1
good,	1
gentle	1
Marie,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
loved	1
as	1
a	1
daughter!"	1
	1
He	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
a	1
real	1
tear	1
appeared	1
in	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
"Fr...	1
fr..."	1
snorted	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski.	1
"The	1
prince	1
is	1
making	1
a	1
proposition	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
his	1
pupil's--I	1
mean,	1
his	1
son's--name.	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
Prince	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin's	1
wife?	1
Reply:	1
yes	1
or	1
no,"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
"and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
reserve	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
state	1
my	1
opinion	1
also.	1
Yes,	1
my	1
opinion,	1
and	1
only	1
my	1
opinion,"	1
added	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
answering	1
his	1
imploring	1
look.	1
"Yes,	1
or	1
no?"	1
	1
"My	1
desire	1
is	1
never	1
to	1
leave	1
you,	1
Father,	1
never	1
to	1
separate	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
yours.	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
marry,"	1
she	1
answered	1
positively,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Humbug!	1
Nonsense!	1
Humbug,	1
humbug,	1
humbug!"	1
cried	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
frowning	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
daughter's	1
hand;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
kiss	1
her,	1
but	1
only	1
bending	1
his	1
forehead	1
to	1
hers	1
just	1
touched	1
it,	1
and	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
winced	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
cry.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
rose.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
shall	1
never,	1
never	1
forget.	1
But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
little	1
hope	1
of	1
touching	1
this	1
heart,	1
so	1
kind	1
and	1
generous?	1
Say	1
'perhaps'...	1
The	1
future	1
is	1
so	1
long.	1
Say	1
'perhaps.'"	1
	1
"Prince,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
is	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
honor,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
your	1
son's	1
wife."	1
	1
"Well,	1
so	1
that's	1
finished,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
you.	1
Very	1
glad!	1
Go	1
back	1
to	1
your	1
rooms,	1
Princess.	1
Go!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
"Very,	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
you,"	1
repeated	1
he,	1
embracing	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"My	1
vocation	1
is	1
a	1
different	1
one,"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"My	1
vocation	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
with	1
another	1
kind	1
of	1
happiness,	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
self-sacrifice.	1
And	1
cost	1
what	1
it	1
may,	1
I	1
will	1
arrange	1
poor	1
Amelie's	1
happiness,	1
she	1
loves	1
him	1
so	1
passionately,	1
and	1
so	1
passionately	1
repents.	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
arrange	1
the	1
match	1
between	1
them.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
rich	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
means;	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
Andrew.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
so	1
happy	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
his	1
wife.	1
She	1
is	1
so	1
unfortunate,	1
a	1
stranger,	1
alone,	1
helpless!	1
And,	1
oh	1
God,	1
how	1
passionately	1
she	1
must	1
love	1
him	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
so	1
far	1
forget	1
herself!	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same!..."	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
had	1
news	1
of	1
Nicholas.	1
Not	1
till	1
midwinter	1
was	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
last	1
handed	1
a	1
letter	1
addressed	1
in	1
his	1
son's	1
handwriting.	1
On	1
receiving	1
it,	1
he	1
ran	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
in	1
alarm	1
and	1
haste,	1
trying	1
to	1
escape	1
notice,	1
closed	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
who	1
always	1
knew	1
everything	1
that	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
on	1
hearing	1
of	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
went	1
softly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
sobbing	1
and	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
though	1
her	1
circumstances	1
had	1
improved,	1
was	1
still	1
living	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
friend?"	1
said	1
she,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
pathetic	1
inquiry,	1
prepared	1
to	1
sympathize	1
in	1
any	1
way.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
sobbed	1
yet	1
more.	1
	1
"Nikolenka...	1
a	1
letter...	1
wa...	1
a...	1
s...	1
wounded...	1
my	1
darling	1
boy...	1
the	1
countess...	1
promoted	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
officer...	1
thank	1
God...	1
How	1
tell	1
the	1
little	1
countess!"	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him,	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
handkerchief	1
wiped	1
the	1
tears	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
letter,	1
then	1
having	1
dried	1
her	1
own	1
eyes	1
she	1
comforted	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
decided	1
that	1
at	1
dinner	1
and	1
till	1
teatime	1
she	1
would	1
prepare	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
after	1
tea,	1
with	1
God's	1
help,	1
would	1
inform	1
her.	1
	1
At	1
dinner	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
talked	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
news	1
and	1
about	1
Nikolenka,	1
twice	1
asked	1
when	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
from	1
him,	1
though	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
already,	1
and	1
remarked	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
very	1
likely	1
be	1
getting	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
day.	1
Each	1
time	1
that	1
these	1
hints	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
countess	1
anxious	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
uneasily	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
the	1
latter	1
very	1
adroitly	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
insignificant	1
matters.	1
Natasha,	1
who,	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
family,	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
gifted	1
with	1
a	1
capacity	1
to	1
feel	1
any	1
shades	1
of	1
intonation,	1
look,	1
and	1
expression,	1
pricked	1
up	1
her	1
ears	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
meal	1
and	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
secret	1
between	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
was	1
preparing	1
them	1
for	1
it.	1
Bold	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
knew	1
how	1
sensitive	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
to	1
anything	1
relating	1
to	1
Nikolenka,	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
ask	1
any	1
questions	1
at	1
dinner,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
excited	1
to	1
eat	1
anything	1
and	1
kept	1
wriggling	1
about	1
on	1
her	1
chair	1
regardless	1
of	1
her	1
governess'	1
remarks.	1
After	1
dinner,	1
she	1
rushed	1
head	1
long	1
after	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and,	1
dashing	1
at	1
her,	1
flung	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
overtook	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
"Auntie,	1
darling,	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
is!"	1
	1
"Nothing,	1
my	1
dear."	1
	1
"No,	1
dearest,	1
sweet	1
one,	1
honey,	1
I	1
won't	1
give	1
up--I	1
know	1
you	1
know	1
something."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
little	1
slyboots,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"A	1
letter	1
from	1
Nikolenka!	1
I'm	1
sure	1
of	1
it!"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha,	1
reading	1
confirmation	1
in	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
face.	1
	1
"But	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
be	1
careful,	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
may	1
affect	1
your	1
mamma."	1
	1
"I	1
will,	1
I	1
will,	1
only	1
tell	1
me!	1
You	1
won't?	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
at	1
once."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words,	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
one.	1
	1
"No,	1
on	1
my	1
true	1
word	1
of	1
honor,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
crossing	1
herself,	1
"I	1
won't	1
tell	1
anyone!"	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Nikolenka...	1
wounded...	1
a	1
letter,"	1
she	1
announced	1
in	1
gleeful	1
triumph.	1
	1
"Nicholas!"	1
was	1
all	1
Sonya	1
said,	1
instantly	1
turning	1
white.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
seeing	1
the	1
impression	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
wound	1
produced	1
on	1
Sonya,	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
sorrowful	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
news.	1
	1
She	1
rushed	1
to	1
Sonya,	1
hugged	1
her,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"A	1
little	1
wound,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
an	1
officer;	1
he	1
is	1
well	1
now,	1
he	1
wrote	1
himself,"	1
said	1
she	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
	1
"There	1
now!	1
It's	1
true	1
that	1
all	1
you	1
women	1
are	1
crybabies,"	1
remarked	1
Petya,	1
pacing	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
large,	1
resolute	1
strides.	1
"Now	1
I'm	1
very	1
glad,	1
very	1
glad	1
indeed,	1
that	1
my	1
brother	1
has	1
distinguished	1
himself	1
so.	1
You	1
are	1
all	1
blubberers	1
and	1
understand	1
nothing."	1
	1
Natasha	1
smiled	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
	1
"You	1
haven't	1
read	1
the	1
letter?"	1
asked	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
that	1
he's	1
now	1
an	1
officer."	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
crossing	1
herself.	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
she	1
deceived	1
you.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
Mamma."	1
	1
Petya	1
paced	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
"If	1
I'd	1
been	1
in	1
Nikolenka's	1
place	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
even	1
more	1
of	1
those	1
Frenchmen,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"What	1
nasty	1
brutes	1
they	1
are!	1
I'd	1
have	1
killed	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
there'd	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
"Hold	1
your	1
tongue,	1
Petya,	1
what	1
a	1
goose	1
you	1
are!"	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
a	1
goose,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
who	1
cry	1
about	1
trifles,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember	1
him?"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
asked,	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
silence.	1
	1
Sonya	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Do	1
I	1
remember	1
Nicholas?"	1
	1
"No,	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
remember	1
him	1
perfectly,	1
remember	1
everything?"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
an	1
expressive	1
gesture,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
words	1
a	1
very	1
definite	1
meaning.	1
"I	1
remember	1
Nikolenka	1
too,	1
I	1
remember	1
him	1
well,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
remember	1
Boris.	1
I	1
don't	1
remember	1
him	1
a	1
bit."	1
	1
"What!	1
You	1
don't	1
remember	1
Boris?"	1
asked	1
Sonya	1
in	1
surprise.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
remember--I	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
like,	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
remember	1
Nikolenka.	1
Him--I	1
just	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
remember,	1
but	1
Boris...	1
No!"	1
(She	1
shut	1
her	1
eyes.)	1
"No!	1
there's	1
nothing	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Natasha!"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
looking	1
ecstatically	1
and	1
earnestly	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
her	1
worthy	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
saying	1
it	1
to	1
someone	1
else,	1
with	1
whom	1
joking	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
"I	1
am	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
your	1
brother	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
and,	1
whatever	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
to	1
me,	1
shall	1
never	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live."	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
Sonya	1
with	1
wondering	1
and	1
inquisitive	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said	1
nothing.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
love	1
as	1
Sonya	1
was	1
speaking	1
of.	1
But	1
Natasha	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
felt	1
anything	1
like	1
it.	1
She	1
believed	1
it	1
could	1
be,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
	1
"Shall	1
you	1
write	1
to	1
him?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
Sonya	1
became	1
thoughtful.	1
The	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
whether	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
write,	1
tormented	1
her.	1
Now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
a	1
wounded	1
hero,	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
right	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
of	1
herself	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
seem,	1
of	1
the	1
obligations	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
on	1
himself?	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know.	1
I	1
think	1
if	1
he	1
writes,	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
too,"	1
she	1
said,	1
blushing.	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
won't	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
Sonya	1
smiled.	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
Boris.	1
I'm	1
not	1
going	1
to."	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
ashamed?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
It's	1
awkward	1
and	1
would	1
make	1
me	1
ashamed."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
know	1
why	1
she'd	1
be	1
ashamed,"	1
said	1
Petya,	1
offended	1
by	1
Natasha's	1
previous	1
remark.	1
"It's	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
fat	1
one	1
in	1
spectacles"	1
(that	1
was	1
how	1
Petya	1
described	1
his	1
namesake,	1
the	1
new	1
Count	1
Bezukhov)	1
"and	1
now	1
she's	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
singer"	1
(he	1
meant	1
Natasha's	1
Italian	1
singing	1
master),	1
"that's	1
why	1
she's	1
ashamed!"	1
	1
"Petya,	1
you're	1
a	1
stupid!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Not	1
more	1
stupid	1
than	1
you,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
the	1
nine-year-old	1
Petya,	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
brigadier.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
by	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
hints	1
at	1
dinner.	1
On	1
retiring	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
miniature	1
portrait	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
on	1
the	1
lid	1
of	1
a	1
snuffbox,	1
while	1
the	1
tears	1
kept	1
coming	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
the	1
letter,	1
came	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
countess'	1
door	1
and	1
paused.	1
	1
"Don't	1
come	1
in,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
who	1
was	1
following	1
her.	1
"Come	1
later."	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
in,	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
her.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
put	1
his	1
ear	1
to	1
the	1
keyhole	1
and	1
listened.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
indifferent	1
voices,	1
then	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
voice	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
speech,	1
then	1
a	1
cry,	1
then	1
silence,	1
then	1
both	1
voices	1
together	1
with	1
glad	1
intonations,	1
and	1
then	1
footsteps.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
opened	1
the	1
door.	1
Her	1
face	1
wore	1
the	1
proud	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
surgeon	1
who	1
has	1
just	1
performed	1
a	1
difficult	1
operation	1
and	1
admits	1
the	1
public	1
to	1
appreciate	1
his	1
skill.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
done!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
pointing	1
triumphantly	1
to	1
the	1
countess,	1
who	1
sat	1
holding	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
its	1
portrait	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
pressing	1
them	1
alternately	1
to	1
her	1
lips.	1
	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
count,	1
she	1
stretched	1
out	1
her	1
arms	1
to	1
him,	1
embraced	1
his	1
bald	1
head,	1
over	1
which	1
she	1
again	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
the	1
portrait,	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
press	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
her	1
lips,	1
she	1
slightly	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
bald	1
head.	1
Vera,	1
Natasha,	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
Petya	1
now	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
began.	1
After	1
a	1
brief	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
battles	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
part,	1
and	1
his	1
promotion,	1
Nicholas	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
kissed	1
his	1
father's	1
and	1
mother's	1
hands	1
asking	1
for	1
their	1
blessing,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
kissed	1
Vera,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
Petya.	1
Besides	1
that,	1
he	1
sent	1
greetings	1
to	1
Monsieur	1
Schelling,	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
and	1
his	1
old	1
nurse,	1
and	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
kiss	1
for	1
him	1
"dear	1
Sonya,	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
ever."	1
When	1
she	1
heard	1
this	1
Sonya	1
blushed	1
so	1
that	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
and,	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
looks	1
turned	1
upon	1
her,	1
ran	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
dancing	1
hall,	1
whirled	1
round	1
it	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
with	1
her	1
dress	1
puffed	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
balloon,	1
and,	1
flushed	1
and	1
smiling,	1
plumped	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
crying.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
crying,	1
Mamma?"	1
asked	1
Vera.	1
"From	1
all	1
he	1
says	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
not	1
cry."	1
	1
This	1
was	1
quite	1
true,	1
but	1
the	1
count,	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
reproachfully.	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
takes	1
after?"	1
thought	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Nicholas'	1
letter	1
was	1
read	1
over	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
considered	1
worthy	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
countess,	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hands.	1
The	1
tutors	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
nurses,	1
and	1
Dmitri,	1
and	1
several	1
acquaintances,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
reread	1
the	1
letter	1
each	1
time	1
with	1
fresh	1
pleasure	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
discovered	1
in	1
it	1
fresh	1
proofs	1
of	1
Nikolenka's	1
virtues.	1
How	1
strange,	1
how	1
extraordinary,	1
how	1
joyful	1
it	1
seemed,	1
that	1
her	1
son,	1
the	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
motion	1
of	1
whose	1
tiny	1
limbs	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
within	1
her,	1
that	1
son	1
about	1
whom	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
quarrels	1
with	1
the	1
too	1
indulgent	1
count,	1
that	1
son	1
who	1
had	1
first	1
learned	1
to	1
say	1
"pear"	1
and	1
then	1
"granny,"	1
that	1
this	1
son	1
should	1
now	1
be	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
foreign	1
land	1
amid	1
strange	1
surroundings,	1
a	1
manly	1
warrior	1
doing	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
man's	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
without	1
help	1
or	1
guidance.	1
The	1
universal	1
experience	1
of	1
ages,	1
showing	1
that	1
children	1
do	1
grow	1
imperceptibly	1
from	1
the	1
cradle	1
to	1
manhood,	1
did	1
not	1
exist	1
for	1
the	1
countess.	1
Her	1
son's	1
growth	1
toward	1
manhood,	1
at	1
each	1
of	1
its	1
stages,	1
had	1
seemed	1
as	1
extraordinary	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
never	1
existed	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
who	1
grew	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
As	1
twenty	1
years	1
before,	1
it	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
creature	1
who	1
lived	1
somewhere	1
under	1
her	1
heart	1
would	1
ever	1
cry,	1
suck	1
her	1
breast,	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
speak,	1
so	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
that	1
little	1
creature	1
could	1
be	1
this	1
strong,	1
brave	1
man,	1
this	1
model	1
son	1
and	1
officer	1
that,	1
judging	1
by	1
this	1
letter,	1
he	1
now	1
was.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
style!	1
How	1
charmingly	1
he	1
describes!"	1
said	1
she,	1
reading	1
the	1
descriptive	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
"And	1
what	1
a	1
soul!	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
himself....	1
Not	1
a	1
word!	1
About	1
some	1
Denisov	1
or	1
other,	1
though	1
he	1
himself,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
is	1
braver	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
He	1
says	1
nothing	1
about	1
his	1
sufferings.	1
What	1
a	1
heart!	1
How	1
like	1
him	1
it	1
is!	1
And	1
how	1
he	1
has	1
remembered	1
everybody!	1
Not	1
forgetting	1
anyone.	1
I	1
always	1
said	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
so	1
high--I	1
always	1
said...."	1
	1
For	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
week	1
preparations	1
were	1
being	1
made,	1
rough	1
drafts	1
of	1
letters	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
household	1
were	1
written	1
and	1
copied	1
out,	1
while	1
under	1
the	1
supervision	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
the	1
solicitude	1
of	1
the	1
count,	1
money	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
uniform	1
and	1
equipment	1
of	1
the	1
newly	1
commissioned	1
officer	1
were	1
collected.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
practical	1
woman	1
that	1
she	1
was,	1
had	1
even	1
managed	1
by	1
favor	1
with	1
army	1
authorities	1
to	1
secure	1
advantageous	1
means	1
of	1
communication	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
son.	1
She	1
had	1
opportunities	1
of	1
sending	1
her	1
letters	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
Constantine	1
Pavlovich,	1
who	1
commanded	1
the	1
Guards.	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
supposed	1
that	1
The	1
Russian	1
Guards,	1
Abroad,	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
definite	1
address,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
letter	1
reached	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
reach	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment,	1
which	1
was	1
presumably	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
neighborhood.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
send	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
money	1
by	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke's	1
courier	1
to	1
Boris	1
and	1
Boris	1
was	1
to	1
forward	1
them	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
The	1
letters	1
were	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
the	1
countess,	1
Petya,	1
Vera,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
finally	1
there	1
were	1
six	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
for	1
his	1
outfit	1
and	1
various	1
other	1
things	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
sent	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twelfth	1
of	1
November,	1
Kutuzov's	1
active	1
army,	1
in	1
camp	1
before	1
Olmutz,	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
be	1
reviewed	1
next	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
Emperors--the	1
Russian	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian.	1
The	1
Guards,	1
just	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia,	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
Olmutz	1
and	1
next	1
morning	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
review,	1
reaching	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
Olmutz	1
by	1
ten	1
o'clock.	1
	1
That	1
day	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Boris,	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
Ismaylov	1
regiment	1
was	1
quartered	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
Olmutz	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
money	1
for	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
particularly	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
money	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
troops,	1
after	1
their	1
active	1
service,	1
were	1
stationed	1
near	1
Olmutz	1
and	1
the	1
camp	1
swarmed	1
with	1
well-provisioned	1
sutlers	1
and	1
Austrian	1
Jews	1
offering	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
tempting	1
wares.	1
The	1
Pavlograds	1
held	1
feast	1
after	1
feast,	1
celebrating	1
awards	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
for	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
made	1
expeditions	1
to	1
Olmutz	1
to	1
visit	1
a	1
certain	1
Caroline	1
the	1
Hungarian,	1
who	1
had	1
recently	1
opened	1
a	1
restaurant	1
there	1
with	1
girls	1
as	1
waitresses.	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
celebrated	1
his	1
promotion	1
to	1
a	1
cornetcy	1
and	1
bought	1
Denisov's	1
horse,	1
Bedouin,	1
was	1
in	1
debt	1
all	1
round,	1
to	1
his	1
comrades	1
and	1
the	1
sutlers.	1
On	1
receiving	1
Boris'	1
letter	1
he	1
rode	1
with	1
a	1
fellow	1
officer	1
to	1
Olmutz,	1
dined	1
there,	1
drank	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
then	1
set	1
off	1
alone	1
to	1
the	1
Guards'	1
camp	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
old	1
playmate.	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
uniform.	1
He	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
shabby	1
cadet	1
jacket,	1
decorated	1
with	1
a	1
soldier's	1
cross,	1
equally	1
shabby	1
cadet's	1
riding	1
breeches	1
lined	1
with	1
worn	1
leather,	1
and	1
an	1
officer's	1
saber	1
with	1
a	1
sword	1
knot.	1
The	1
Don	1
horse	1
he	1
was	1
riding	1
was	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
from	1
a	1
Cossack	1
during	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
crumpled	1
hussar	1
cap	1
stuck	1
jauntily	1
back	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
As	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
he	1
thought	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
impress	1
Boris	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
by	1
his	1
appearance--that	1
of	1
a	1
fighting	1
hussar	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
under	1
fire.	1
	1
The	1
Guards	1
had	1
made	1
their	1
whole	1
march	1
as	1
if	1
on	1
a	1
pleasure	1
trip,	1
parading	1
their	1
cleanliness	1
and	1
discipline.	1
They	1
had	1
come	1
by	1
easy	1
stages,	1
their	1
knapsacks	1
conveyed	1
on	1
carts,	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
authorities	1
had	1
provided	1
excellent	1
dinners	1
for	1
the	1
officers	1
at	1
every	1
halting	1
place.	1
The	1
regiments	1
had	1
entered	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
town	1
with	1
their	1
bands	1
playing,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke's	1
orders	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
marched	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
step	1
(a	1
practice	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Guards	1
prided	1
themselves),	1
the	1
officers	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
at	1
their	1
proper	1
posts.	1
Boris	1
had	1
been	1
quartered,	1
and	1
had	1
marched	1
all	1
the	1
way,	1
with	1
Berg	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
company.	1
Berg,	1
who	1
had	1
obtained	1
his	1
captaincy	1
during	1
the	1
campaign,	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
his	1
superiors	1
by	1
his	1
promptitude	1
and	1
accuracy	1
and	1
had	1
arranged	1
his	1
money	1
matters	1
very	1
satisfactorily.	1
Boris,	1
during	1
the	1
campaign,	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
many	1
persons	1
who	1
might	1
prove	1
useful	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
recommendation	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
Pierre	1
had	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski,	1
through	1
whom	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
post	1
on	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
staff.	1
Berg	1
and	1
Boris,	1
having	1
rested	1
after	1
yesterday's	1
march,	1
were	1
sitting,	1
clean	1
and	1
neatly	1
dressed,	1
at	1
a	1
round	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
clean	1
quarters	1
allotted	1
to	1
them,	1
playing	1
chess.	1
Berg	1
held	1
a	1
smoking	1
pipe	1
between	1
his	1
knees.	1
Boris,	1
in	1
the	1
accurate	1
way	1
characteristic	1
of	1
him,	1
was	1
building	1
a	1
little	1
pyramid	1
of	1
chessmen	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
white	1
fingers	1
while	1
awaiting	1
Berg's	1
move,	1
and	1
watched	1
his	1
opponent's	1
face,	1
evidently	1
thinking	1
about	1
the	1
game	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
whatever	1
he	1
was	1
engaged	1
on.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
that?"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
	1
"We'll	1
try	1
to,"	1
replied	1
Berg,	1
touching	1
a	1
pawn	1
and	1
then	1
removing	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
opened.	1
	1
"Here	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
last!"	1
shouted	1
Rostov.	1
"And	1
Berg	1
too!	1
Oh,	1
you	1
petisenfans,	1
allay	1
cushay	1
dormir!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
imitating	1
his	1
Russian	1
nurse's	1
French,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
Boris	1
used	1
to	1
laugh	1
long	1
ago.	1
	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
how	1
you	1
have	1
changed!"	1
	1
Boris	1
rose	1
to	1
meet	1
Rostov,	1
but	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
omit	1
to	1
steady	1
and	1
replace	1
some	1
chessmen	1
that	1
were	1
falling.	1
He	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
embrace	1
his	1
friend,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
avoided	1
him.	1
With	1
that	1
peculiar	1
feeling	1
of	1
youth,	1
that	1
dread	1
of	1
beaten	1
tracks,	1
and	1
wish	1
to	1
express	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
its	1
elders	1
which	1
is	1
often	1
insincere,	1
Nicholas	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
special	1
on	1
meeting	1
his	1
friend.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
pinch	1
him,	1
push	1
him,	1
do	1
anything	1
but	1
kiss	1
him--a	1
thing	1
everybody	1
did.	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
this,	1
Boris	1
embraced	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
quiet,	1
friendly	1
way	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
three	1
times.	1
	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
met	1
for	1
nearly	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
and,	1
being	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
when	1
young	1
men	1
take	1
their	1
first	1
steps	1
on	1
life's	1
road,	1
each	1
saw	1
immense	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
reflection	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
those	1
first	1
steps.	1
Both	1
had	1
changed	1
greatly	1
since	1
they	1
last	1
met	1
and	1
both	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
changes	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
damned	1
dandies!	1
Clean	1
and	1
fresh	1
as	1
if	1
you'd	1
been	1
to	1
a	1
fete,	1
not	1
like	1
us	1
sinners	1
of	1
the	1
line,"	1
cried	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
martial	1
swagger	1
and	1
with	1
baritone	1
notes	1
in	1
his	1
voice,	1
new	1
to	1
Boris,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
mud-	1
bespattered	1
breeches.	1
The	1
German	1
landlady,	1
hearing	1
Rostov's	1
loud	1
voice,	1
popped	1
her	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
is	1
she	1
pretty?"	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
wink.	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
shout	1
so?	1
You'll	1
frighten	1
them!"	1
said	1
Boris.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
you	1
today,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"I	1
only	1
sent	1
you	1
the	1
note	1
yesterday	1
by	1
Bolkonski--an	1
adjutant	1
of	1
Kutuzov's,	1
who's	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
so	1
quickly....	1
Well,	1
how	1
are	1
you?	1
Been	1
under	1
fire	1
already?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
Without	1
answering,	1
Rostov	1
shook	1
the	1
soldier's	1
Cross	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
fastened	1
to	1
the	1
cording	1
of	1
his	1
uniform	1
and,	1
indicating	1
a	1
bandaged	1
arm,	1
glanced	1
at	1
Berg	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"As	1
you	1
see,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Indeed?	1
Yes,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
Boris,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"And	1
we	1
too	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
splendid	1
march.	1
You	1
know,	1
of	1
course,	1
that	1
His	1
Imperial	1
Highness	1
rode	1
with	1
our	1
regiment	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
every	1
comfort	1
and	1
every	1
advantage.	1
What	1
receptions	1
we	1
had	1
in	1
Poland!	1
What	1
dinners	1
and	1
balls!	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you.	1
And	1
the	1
Tsarevich	1
was	1
very	1
gracious	1
to	1
all	1
our	1
officers."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
friends	1
told	1
each	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
doings,	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
hussar	1
revels	1
and	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
fighting	1
line,	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
and	1
advantages	1
of	1
service	1
under	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
Guards!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"I	1
say,	1
send	1
for	1
some	1
wine."	1
	1
Boris	1
made	1
a	1
grimace.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
really	1
want	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
bed,	1
drew	1
a	1
purse	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
clean	1
pillow,	1
and	1
sent	1
for	1
wine.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
money	1
and	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
give	1
you,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
and,	1
throwing	1
the	1
money	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
put	1
both	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read.	1
After	1
reading	1
a	1
few	1
lines,	1
he	1
glanced	1
angrily	1
at	1
Berg,	1
then,	1
meeting	1
his	1
eyes,	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
behind	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
"Well,	1
they've	1
sent	1
you	1
a	1
tidy	1
sum,"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
eying	1
the	1
heavy	1
purse	1
that	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
sofa.	1
"As	1
for	1
us,	1
Count,	1
we	1
get	1
along	1
on	1
our	1
pay.	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
for	1
myself..."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Berg,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"when	1
you	1
get	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
meet	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
people	1
whom	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
everything	1
over	1
with,	1
and	1
I	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
there,	1
I'll	1
go	1
at	1
once,	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
way!	1
Do	1
go	1
somewhere,	1
anywhere...	1
to	1
the	1
devil!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
immediately	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
looking	1
amiably	1
into	1
his	1
face,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
rudeness	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
he	1
added,	1
"Don't	1
be	1
hurt,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
speak	1
from	1
my	1
heart	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
acquaintance."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
mention	1
it,	1
Count!	1
I	1
quite	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
muffled	1
and	1
guttural	1
voice.	1
	1
"Go	1
across	1
to	1
our	1
hosts:	1
they	1
invited	1
you,"	1
added	1
Boris.	1
	1
Berg	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
cleanest	1
of	1
coats,	1
without	1
a	1
spot	1
or	1
speck	1
of	1
dust,	1
stood	1
before	1
a	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
brushed	1
the	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
temples	1
upwards,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,	1
and,	1
having	1
assured	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
that	1
his	1
coat	1
had	1
been	1
noticed,	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile.	1
	1
"Oh	1
dear,	1
what	1
a	1
beast	1
I	1
am!"	1
muttered	1
Rostov,	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
"Why?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
pig	1
I	1
am,	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
written	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
such	1
a	1
fright!	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
pig	1
I	1
am!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
flushing	1
suddenly.	1
"Well,	1
have	1
you	1
sent	1
Gabriel	1
for	1
some	1
wine?	1
All	1
right	1
let's	1
have	1
some!"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
parents	1
was	1
enclosed	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
recommendation	1
to	1
Bagration	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
advice	1
had	1
obtained	1
through	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
her	1
son,	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
its	1
destination	1
and	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"What	1
nonsense!	1
Much	1
I	1
need	1
it!"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
throwing	1
the	1
letter	1
under	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"Why	1
have	1
you	1
thrown	1
that	1
away?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
some	1
letter	1
of	1
recommendation...	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
do	1
I	1
want	1
it	1
for!"	1
	1
"Why	1
'What	1
the	1
devil'?"	1
said	1
Boris,	1
picking	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
reading	1
the	1
address.	1
"This	1
letter	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
use	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
nothing,	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
anyone's	1
adjutant."	1
	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
inquired	1
Boris.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
lackey's	1
job!"	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
dreamer,	1
I	1
see,"	1
remarked	1
Boris,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"And	1
you're	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
diplomatist!	1
But	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
point...	1
Come,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Well,	1
as	1
you	1
see.	1
So	1
far	1
everything's	1
all	1
right,	1
but	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
should	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
adjutant	1
and	1
not	1
remain	1
at	1
the	1
front."	1
	1
"Why?"	1
	1
"Because	1
when	1
once	1
a	1
man	1
starts	1
on	1
military	1
service,	1
he	1
should	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
as	1
successful	1
a	1
career	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
possible."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that's	1
it!"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
evidently	1
thinking	1
of	1
something	1
else.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
intently	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
into	1
his	1
friend's	1
eyes,	1
evidently	1
trying	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
some	1
question.	1
	1
Old	1
Gabriel	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
wine.	1
	1
"Shouldn't	1
we	1
now	1
send	1
for	1
Berg?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
"He	1
would	1
drink	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
can't."	1
	1
"Well,	1
send	1
for	1
him...	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
that	1
German?"	1
asked	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
smile.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
very,	1
very	1
nice,	1
honest,	1
and	1
pleasant	1
fellow,"	1
answered	1
Boris.	1
	1
Again	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
intently	1
into	1
Boris'	1
eyes	1
and	1
sighed.	1
Berg	1
returned,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
conversation	1
between	1
the	1
three	1
officers	1
became	1
animated.	1
The	1
Guardsmen	1
told	1
Rostov	1
of	1
their	1
march	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
much	1
of	1
in	1
Russia,	1
Poland,	1
and	1
abroad.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
sayings	1
and	1
doings	1
of	1
their	1
commander,	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke,	1
and	1
told	1
stories	1
of	1
his	1
kindness	1
and	1
irascibility.	1
Berg,	1
as	1
usual,	1
kept	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
subject	1
did	1
not	1
relate	1
to	1
himself,	1
but	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
stories	1
of	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke's	1
quick	1
temper	1
he	1
related	1
with	1
gusto	1
how	1
in	1
Galicia	1
he	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
made	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
the	1
regiments	1
and	1
was	1
annoyed	1
at	1
the	1
irregularity	1
of	1
a	1
movement.	1
With	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
Berg	1
related	1
how	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
had	1
ridden	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
passion,	1
shouting:	1
"Arnauts!"	1
("Arnauts"	1
was	1
the	1
Tsarevich's	1
favorite	1
expression	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
rage)	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
company	1
commander.	1
	1
"Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
Count,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
alarmed,	1
because	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
was	1
right.	1
Without	1
boasting,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
Army	1
Orders	1
by	1
heart	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
Regulations	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
Lord's	1
Prayer.	1
So,	1
Count,	1
there	1
never	1
is	1
any	1
negligence	1
in	1
my	1
company,	1
and	1
so	1
my	1
conscience	1
was	1
at	1
ease.	1
I	1
came	1
forward...."	1
(Berg	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
showed	1
how	1
he	1
presented	1
himself,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
cap,	1
and	1
really	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
for	1
a	1
face	1
to	1
express	1
greater	1
respect	1
and	1
self-	1
complacency	1
than	1
his	1
did.)	1
"Well,	1
he	1
stormed	1
at	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
stormed	1
and	1
stormed	1
and	1
stormed!	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
rather	1
of	1
death,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is.	1
'Albanians!'	1
and	1
'devils!'	1
and	1
'To	1
Siberia!'"	1
said	1
Berg	1
with	1
a	1
sagacious	1
smile.	1
"I	1
knew	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
so	1
I	1
kept	1
silent;	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
best,	1
Count?...	1
'Hey,	1
are	1
you	1
dumb?'	1
he	1
shouted.	1
Still	1
I	1
remained	1
silent.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Count?	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
Orders	1
of	1
the	1
Day.	1
That's	1
what	1
keeping	1
one's	1
head	1
means.	1
That's	1
the	1
way,	1
Count,"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
lighting	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
emitting	1
rings	1
of	1
smoke.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
fine,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
smiling.	1
	1
But	1
Boris	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
Berg,	1
and	1
skillfully	1
changed	1
the	1
subject.	1
He	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
how	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
got	1
his	1
wound.	1
This	1
pleased	1
Rostov	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
talking	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
He	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
affair,	1
just	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
battle	1
generally	1
do	1
describe	1
it,	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
like	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
described	1
by	1
others,	1
and	1
as	1
sounds	1
well,	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
it	1
really	1
was.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
a	1
truthful	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
would	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
have	1
told	1
a	1
deliberate	1
lie.	1
He	1
began	1
his	1
story	1
meaning	1
to	1
tell	1
everything	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
happened,	1
but	1
imperceptibly,	1
involuntarily,	1
and	1
inevitably	1
he	1
lapsed	1
into	1
falsehood.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
his	1
hearers--who	1
like	1
himself	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
stories	1
of	1
attacks	1
and	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
definite	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
an	1
attack	1
was	1
and	1
were	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
story--they	1
would	1
either	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
him	1
or,	1
still	1
worse,	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
Rostov	1
was	1
himself	1
to	1
blame	1
since	1
what	1
generally	1
happens	1
to	1
the	1
narrators	1
of	1
cavalry	1
attacks	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
them	1
simply	1
that	1
everyone	1
went	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
off	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
sprained	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
from	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
into	1
the	1
wood.	1
Besides,	1
to	1
tell	1
everything	1
as	1
it	1
really	1
happened,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
of	1
will	1
to	1
tell	1
only	1
what	1
happened.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
rarely	1
capable	1
of	1
it.	1
His	1
hearers	1
expected	1
a	1
story	1
of	1
how	1
beside	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
aflame	1
with	1
excitement,	1
he	1
had	1
flown	1
like	1
a	1
storm	1
at	1
the	1
square,	1
cut	1
his	1
way	1
in,	1
slashed	1
right	1
and	1
left,	1
how	1
his	1
saber	1
had	1
tasted	1
flesh	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
all	1
that.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
story,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
saying:	1
"You	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
what	1
a	1
strange	1
frenzy	1
one	1
experiences	1
during	1
an	1
attack,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
whom	1
Boris	1
was	1
expecting,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
liked	1
to	1
help	1
young	1
men,	1
was	1
flattered	1
by	1
being	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
assistance	1
and	1
being	1
well	1
disposed	1
toward	1
Boris,	1
who	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
wanted.	1
Having	1
been	1
sent	1
with	1
papers	1
from	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
the	1
Tsarevich,	1
he	1
looked	1
in	1
on	1
Boris,	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
alone.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
saw	1
an	1
hussar	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
recounting	1
his	1
military	1
exploits	1
(Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
man),	1
he	1
gave	1
Boris	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
frowned	1
as	1
with	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
bowed	1
slightly	1
and	1
wearily,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
languidly	1
on	1
the	1
sofa:	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
have	1
dropped	1
in	1
on	1
bad	1
company.	1
Rostov	1
flushed	1
up	1
on	1
noticing	1
this,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care,	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
stranger.	1
Glancing,	1
however,	1
at	1
Boris,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
seemed	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
hussar	1
of	1
the	1
line.	1
	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
disagreeable,	1
ironical	1
tone,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
contempt	1
with	1
which	1
Rostov,	1
from	1
his	1
fighting	1
army	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
regarded	1
all	1
these	1
little	1
adjutants	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
newcomer	1
was	1
evidently	1
one,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
confused,	1
blushed,	1
and	1
became	1
silent.	1
Boris	1
inquired	1
what	1
news	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
and	1
what,	1
without	1
indiscretion,	1
one	1
might	1
ask	1
about	1
our	1
plans.	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
probably	1
advance,"	1
replied	1
Bolkonski,	1
evidently	1
reluctant	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
stranger.	1
	1
Berg	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
ask,	1
with	1
great	1
politeness,	1
whether,	1
as	1
was	1
rumored,	1
the	1
allowance	1
of	1
forage	1
money	1
to	1
captains	1
of	1
companies	1
would	1
be	1
doubled.	1
To	1
this	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
opinion	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
important	1
government	1
order,	1
and	1
Berg	1
laughed	1
gaily.	1
	1
"As	1
to	1
your	1
business,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued,	1
addressing	1
Boris,	1
"we	1
will	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
later"	1
(and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Rostov).	1
"Come	1
to	1
me	1
after	1
the	1
review	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
what	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
And,	1
having	1
glanced	1
round	1
the	1
room,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
whose	1
state	1
of	1
unconquerable	1
childish	1
embarrassment	1
now	1
changing	1
to	1
anger	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
condescend	1
to	1
notice,	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
affair?	1
Were	1
you	1
there?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
there,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
angrily,	1
as	1
if	1
intending	1
to	1
insult	1
the	1
aide-	1
de-camp.	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
noticed	1
the	1
hussar's	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
it	1
amused	1
him.	1
With	1
a	1
slightly	1
contemptuous	1
smile,	1
he	1
said:	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
stories	1
now	1
told	1
about	1
that	1
affair!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
stories!"	1
repeated	1
Rostov	1
loudly,	1
looking	1
with	1
eyes	1
suddenly	1
grown	1
furious,	1
now	1
at	1
Boris,	1
now	1
at	1
Bolkonski.	1
"Yes,	1
many	1
stories!	1
But	1
our	1
stories	1
are	1
the	1
stories	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fire!	1
Our	1
stories	1
have	1
some	1
weight,	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
stories	1
of	1
those	1
fellows	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
who	1
get	1
rewards	1
without	1
doing	1
anything!"	1
	1
"Of	1
whom	1
you	1
imagine	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
one?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
particularly	1
amiable	1
smile.	1
	1
A	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
exasperation	1
and	1
yet	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
this	1
man's	1
self-possession	1
mingled	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
soul.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
talking	1
about	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
you	1
and,	1
frankly,	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to.	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
in	1
general."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
this,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
interrupted	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
quiet	1
authority,	1
"you	1
wish	1
to	1
insult	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
haven't	1
sufficient	1
self-respect,	1
but	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
place	1
are	1
very	1
badly	1
chosen.	1
In	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
have	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
serious	1
duel,	1
and	1
besides,	1
Drubetskoy,	1
who	1
says	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
my	1
face	1
has	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
displease	1
you.	1
However,"	1
he	1
added	1
rising,	1
"you	1
know	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
where	1
to	1
find	1
me,	1
but	1
don't	1
forget	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
regard	1
either	1
myself	1
or	1
you	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
insulted,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
older	1
than	1
you,	1
my	1
advice	1
is	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
drop.	1
Well	1
then,	1
on	1
Friday	1
after	1
the	1
review	1
I	1
shall	1
expect	1
you,	1
Drubetskoy.	1
Au	1
revoir!"	1
exclaimed	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
them	1
both	1
he	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
gone	1
did	1
Rostov	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
angry	1
at	1
having	1
omitted	1
to	1
say	1
it.	1
He	1
ordered	1
his	1
horse	1
at	1
once	1
and,	1
coldly	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Boris,	1
rode	1
home.	1
Should	1
he	1
go	1
to	1
headquarters	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
challenge	1
that	1
affected	1
adjutant,	1
or	1
really	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
drop,	1
was	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
worried	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
way.	1
He	1
thought	1
angrily	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
at	1
seeing	1
the	1
fright	1
of	1
that	1
small	1
and	1
frail	1
but	1
proud	1
man	1
when	1
covered	1
by	1
his	1
pistol,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
felt	1
with	1
surprise	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
he	1
knew	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
he	1
would	1
so	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
as	1
that	1
very	1
adjutant	1
whom	1
he	1
so	1
hated.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
Rostov	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
Boris,	1
a	1
review	1
was	1
held	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
and	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
both	1
those	1
freshly	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
campaigning	1
under	1
Kutuzov.	1
The	1
two	1
Emperors,	1
the	1
Russian	1
with	1
his	1
heir	1
the	1
Tsarevich,	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
with	1
the	1
Archduke,	1
inspected	1
the	1
allied	1
army	1
of	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
From	1
early	1
morning	1
the	1
smart	1
clean	1
troops	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
move,	1
forming	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
before	1
the	1
fortress.	1
Now	1
thousands	1
of	1
feet	1
and	1
bayonets	1
moved	1
and	1
halted	1
at	1
the	1
officers'	1
command,	1
turned	1
with	1
banners	1
flying,	1
formed	1
up	1
at	1
intervals,	1
and	1
wheeled	1
round	1
other	1
similar	1
masses	1
of	1
infantry	1
in	1
different	1
uniforms;	1
now	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
rhythmic	1
beat	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
the	1
jingling	1
of	1
showy	1
cavalry	1
in	1
blue,	1
red,	1
and	1
green	1
braided	1
uniforms,	1
with	1
smartly	1
dressed	1
bandsmen	1
in	1
front	1
mounted	1
on	1
black,	1
roan,	1
or	1
gray	1
horses;	1
then	1
again,	1
spreading	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
brazen	1
clatter	1
of	1
the	1
polished	1
shining	1
cannon	1
that	1
quivered	1
on	1
the	1
gun	1
carriages	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
linstocks,	1
came	1
the	1
artillery	1
which	1
crawled	1
between	1
the	1
infantry	1
and	1
cavalry	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
its	1
appointed	1
position.	1
Not	1
only	1
the	1
generals	1
in	1
full	1
parade	1
uniforms,	1
with	1
their	1
thin	1
or	1
thick	1
waists	1
drawn	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
utmost,	1
their	1
red	1
necks	1
squeezed	1
into	1
their	1
stiff	1
collars,	1
and	1
wearing	1
scarves	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
decorations,	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
elegant,	1
pomaded	1
officers,	1
but	1
every	1
soldier	1
with	1
his	1
freshly	1
washed	1
and	1
shaven	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
weapons	1
clean	1
and	1
polished	1
to	1
the	1
utmost,	1
and	1
every	1
horse	1
groomed	1
till	1
its	1
coat	1
shone	1
like	1
satin	1
and	1
every	1
hair	1
of	1
its	1
wetted	1
mane	1
lay	1
smooth--felt	1
that	1
no	1
small	1
matter	1
was	1
happening,	1
but	1
an	1
important	1
and	1
solemn	1
affair.	1
Every	1
general	1
and	1
every	1
soldier	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
insignificance,	1
aware	1
of	1
being	1
but	1
a	1
drop	1
in	1
that	1
ocean	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
strength	1
as	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
enormous	1
whole.	1
	1
From	1
early	1
morning	1
strenuous	1
activities	1
and	1
efforts	1
had	1
begun	1
and	1
by	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
all	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
into	1
due	1
order.	1
The	1
ranks	1
were	1
drawn	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
vast	1
field.	1
The	1
whole	1
army	1
was	1
extended	1
in	1
three	1
lines:	1
the	1
cavalry	1
in	1
front,	1
behind	1
it	1
the	1
artillery,	1
and	1
behind	1
that	1
again	1
the	1
infantry.	1
	1
A	1
space	1
like	1
a	1
street	1
was	1
left	1
between	1
each	1
two	1
lines	1
of	1
troops.	1
The	1
three	1
parts	1
of	1
that	1
army	1
were	1
sharply	1
distinguished:	1
Kutuzov's	1
fighting	1
army	1
(with	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
front);	1
those	1
recently	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia,	1
both	1
Guards	1
and	1
regiments	1
of	1
the	1
line;	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
troops.	1
But	1
they	1
all	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
lines,	1
under	1
one	1
command,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
like	1
order.	1
	1
Like	1
wind	1
over	1
leaves	1
ran	1
an	1
excited	1
whisper:	1
"They're	1
coming!	1
They're	1
coming!"	1
Alarmed	1
voices	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
a	1
stir	1
of	1
final	1
preparation	1
swept	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
troops.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Olmutz	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
group	1
was	1
seen	1
approaching.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
though	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
still,	1
a	1
light	1
gust	1
of	1
wind	1
blowing	1
over	1
the	1
army	1
slightly	1
stirred	1
the	1
streamers	1
on	1
the	1
lances	1
and	1
the	1
unfolded	1
standards	1
fluttered	1
against	1
their	1
staffs.	1
It	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
that	1
slight	1
motion	1
the	1
army	1
itself	1
was	1
expressing	1
its	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
Emperors.	1
One	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
shouting:	1
"Eyes	1
front!"	1
Then,	1
like	1
the	1
crowing	1
of	1
cocks	1
at	1
sunrise,	1
this	1
was	1
repeated	1
by	1
others	1
from	1
various	1
sides	1
and	1
all	1
became	1
silent.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
deathlike	1
stillness	1
only	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses	1
was	1
heard.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
Emperors'	1
suites.	1
The	1
Emperors	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
flank,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpets	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
cavalry	1
regiment	1
played	1
the	1
general	1
march.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
not	1
the	1
trumpeters	1
were	1
playing,	1
but	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
army	1
itself,	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
the	1
Emperors'	1
approach,	1
had	1
naturally	1
burst	1
into	1
music.	1
Amid	1
these	1
sounds,	1
only	1
the	1
youthful	1
kindly	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
was	1
clearly	1
heard.	1
He	1
gave	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
greeting,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
regiment	1
roared	1
"Hurrah!"	1
so	1
deafeningly,	1
continuously,	1
and	1
joyfully	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
themselves	1
were	1
awed	1
by	1
their	1
multitude	1
and	1
the	1
immensity	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
they	1
constituted.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
lines	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
army	1
which	1
the	1
Tsar	1
approached	1
first,	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
as	1
every	1
other	1
man	1
in	1
that	1
army:	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
self-forgetfulness,	1
a	1
proud	1
consciousness	1
of	1
might,	1
and	1
a	1
passionate	1
attraction	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
triumph.	1
	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
at	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
from	1
that	1
man	1
all	1
this	1
vast	1
mass	1
(and	1
he	1
himself	1
an	1
insignificant	1
atom	1
in	1
it)	1
would	1
go	1
through	1
fire	1
and	1
water,	1
commit	1
crime,	1
die,	1
or	1
perform	1
deeds	1
of	1
highest	1
heroism,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
tremble	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
stand	1
still	1
at	1
the	1
imminence	1
of	1
that	1
word.	1
	1
"Hurrah!	1
Hurrah!	1
Hurrah!"	1
thundered	1
from	1
all	1
sides,	1
one	1
regiment	1
after	1
another	1
greeting	1
the	1
Tsar	1
with	1
the	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
march,	1
and	1
then	1
"Hurrah!"...	1
Then	1
the	1
general	1
march,	1
and	1
again	1
"Hurrah!	1
Hurrah!"	1
growing	1
ever	1
stronger	1
and	1
fuller	1
and	1
merging	1
into	1
a	1
deafening	1
roar.	1
	1
Till	1
the	1
Tsar	1
reached	1
it,	1
each	1
regiment	1
in	1
its	1
silence	1
and	1
immobility	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
lifeless	1
body,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
it	1
became	1
alive,	1
its	1
thunder	1
joining	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
line	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
passed.	1
Through	1
the	1
terrible	1
and	1
deafening	1
roar	1
of	1
those	1
voices,	1
amid	1
the	1
square	1
masses	1
of	1
troops	1
standing	1
motionless	1
as	1
if	1
turned	1
to	1
stone,	1
hundreds	1
of	1
riders	1
composing	1
the	1
suites	1
moved	1
carelessly	1
but	1
symmetrically	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
freely,	1
and	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
two	1
men--the	1
Emperors.	1
Upon	1
them	1
the	1
undivided,	1
tensely	1
passionate	1
attention	1
of	1
that	1
whole	1
mass	1
of	1
men	1
was	1
concentrated.	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
young	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
wearing	1
a	1
cocked	1
hat	1
with	1
its	1
peaks	1
front	1
and	1
back,	1
with	1
his	1
pleasant	1
face	1
and	1
resonant	1
though	1
not	1
loud	1
voice,	1
attracted	1
everyone's	1
attention.	1
	1
Rostov	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
trumpeters,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
keen	1
sight	1
had	1
recognized	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
watched	1
his	1
approach.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
within	1
twenty	1
paces,	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
could	1
clearly	1
distinguish	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
handsome,	1
happy	1
young	1
face,	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
tenderness	1
and	1
ecstasy	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
known.	1
Every	1
trait	1
and	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
enchanting.	1
	1
Stopping	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograds,	1
the	1
Tsar	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
French	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
Emperor	1
and	1
smiled.	1
	1
Seeing	1
that	1
smile,	1
Rostov	1
involuntarily	1
smiled	1
himself	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
still	1
stronger	1
flow	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
sovereign.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
love	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
impossible	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
cry.	1
The	1
Tsar	1
called	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh	1
God,	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
the	1
Emperor	1
spoke	1
to	1
me?"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
"I	1
should	1
die	1
of	1
happiness!"	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
addressed	1
the	1
officers	1
also:	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all,	1
gentlemen,	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart."	1
To	1
Rostov	1
every	1
word	1
sounded	1
like	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven.	1
How	1
gladly	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
died	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
his	1
Tsar!	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
earned	1
the	1
St.	1
George's	1
standards	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
to	1
die,	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
him,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
said	1
something	1
more	1
which	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
hear,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
straining	1
their	1
lungs,	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
too,	1
bending	1
over	1
his	1
saddle,	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
injure	1
himself	1
by	1
that	1
shout,	1
if	1
only	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
rapture	1
fully.	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
stopped	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
hussars	1
as	1
if	1
undecided.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
the	1
Emperor	1
be	1
undecided?"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
but	1
then	1
even	1
this	1
indecision	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
majestic	1
and	1
enchanting,	1
like	1
everything	1
else	1
the	1
Tsar	1
did.	1
	1
That	1
hesitation	1
lasted	1
only	1
an	1
instant.	1
The	1
Tsar's	1
foot,	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
pointed	1
boot	1
then	1
fashionable,	1
touched	1
the	1
groin	1
of	1
the	1
bobtailed	1
bay	1
mare	1
he	1
rode,	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
glove	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
reins,	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
off	1
accompanied	1
by	1
an	1
irregularly	1
swaying	1
sea	1
of	1
aides-de-camp.	1
Farther	1
and	1
farther	1
he	1
rode	1
away,	1
stopping	1
at	1
other	1
regiments,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
only	1
his	1
white	1
plumes	1
were	1
visible	1
to	1
Rostov	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
suites	1
that	1
surrounded	1
the	1
Emperors.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
Rostov	1
noticed	1
Bolkonski,	1
sitting	1
his	1
horse	1
indolently	1
and	1
carelessly.	1
Rostov	1
recalled	1
their	1
quarrel	1
of	1
yesterday	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
presented	1
itself	1
whether	1
he	1
ought	1
or	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
challenge	1
Bolkonski.	1
"Of	1
course	1
not!"	1
he	1
now	1
thought.	1
"Is	1
it	1
worth	1
thinking	1
or	1
speaking	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment?	1
At	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
such	1
love,	1
such	1
rapture,	1
and	1
such	1
self-sacrifice,	1
what	1
do	1
any	1
of	1
our	1
quarrels	1
and	1
affronts	1
matter?	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
forgive	1
everybody	1
now."	1
	1
When	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
passed	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
regiments,	1
the	1
troops	1
began	1
a	1
ceremonial	1
march	1
past	1
him,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
on	1
Bedouin,	1
recently	1
purchased	1
from	1
Denisov,	1
rode	1
past	1
too,	1
at	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
his	1
squadron--that	1
is,	1
alone	1
and	1
in	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
Before	1
he	1
reached	1
him,	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
splendid	1
horseman,	1
spurred	1
Bedouin	1
twice	1
and	1
successfully	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
showy	1
trot	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
animal	1
went	1
when	1
excited.	1
Bending	1
his	1
foaming	1
muzzle	1
to	1
his	1
chest,	1
his	1
tail	1
extended,	1
Bedouin,	1
as	1
if	1
also	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eye	1
upon	1
him,	1
passed	1
splendidly,	1
lifting	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
and	1
graceful	1
action,	1
as	1
if	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
without	1
touching	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
Rostov	1
himself,	1
his	1
legs	1
well	1
back	1
and	1
his	1
stomach	1
drawn	1
in	1
and	1
feeling	1
himself	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
horse,	1
rode	1
past	1
the	1
Emperor	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
but	1
blissful	1
face	1
"like	1
a	1
vewy	1
devil,"	1
as	1
Denisov	1
expressed	1
it.	1
	1
"Fine	1
fellows,	1
the	1
Pavlograds!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"My	1
God,	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
if	1
he	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
leap	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
this	1
instant!"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
review	1
was	1
over,	1
the	1
newly	1
arrived	1
officers,	1
and	1
also	1
Kutuzov's,	1
collected	1
in	1
groups	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
awards,	1
about	1
the	1
Austrians	1
and	1
their	1
uniforms,	1
about	1
their	1
lines,	1
about	1
Bonaparte,	1
and	1
how	1
badly	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
fare	1
now,	1
especially	1
if	1
the	1
Essen	1
corps	1
arrived	1
and	1
Prussia	1
took	1
our	1
side.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
talk	1
in	1
every	1
group	1
was	1
chiefly	1
about	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander.	1
His	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
movement	1
was	1
described	1
with	1
ecstasy.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
had	1
but	1
one	1
wish:	1
to	1
advance	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
under	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
command.	1
Commanded	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
vanquish	1
anyone,	1
be	1
it	1
whom	1
it	1
might:	1
so	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
after	1
the	1
review.	1
	1
All	1
were	1
then	1
more	1
confident	1
of	1
victory	1
than	1
the	1
winning	1
of	1
two	1
battles	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
them.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
review,	1
Boris,	1
in	1
his	1
best	1
uniform	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
comrade	1
Berg's	1
best	1
wishes	1
for	1
success,	1
rode	1
to	1
Olmutz	1
to	1
see	1
Bolkonski,	1
wishing	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
his	1
friendliness	1
and	1
obtain	1
for	1
himself	1
the	1
best	1
post	1
he	1
could--preferably	1
that	1
of	1
adjutant	1
to	1
some	1
important	1
personage,	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
most	1
attractive.	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
Rostov,	1
whose	1
father	1
sends	1
him	1
ten	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
cringe	1
to	1
anybody	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
anyone's	1
lackey,	1
but	1
I	1
who	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
my	1
brains	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
career	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
miss	1
opportunities,	1
but	1
must	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
them!"	1
he	1
reflected.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
Olmutz	1
that	1
day,	1
but	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
where	1
the	1
headquarters	1
and	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
corps	1
were	1
stationed	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
Emperors	1
were	1
living	1
with	1
their	1
suites,	1
households,	1
and	1
courts	1
only	1
strengthened	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
that	1
higher	1
world.	1
	1
He	1
knew	1
no	1
one,	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
smart	1
Guardsman's	1
uniform,	1
all	1
these	1
exalted	1
personages	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
their	1
elegant	1
carriages	1
with	1
their	1
plumes,	1
ribbons,	1
and	1
medals,	1
both	1
courtiers	1
and	1
military	1
men,	1
seemed	1
so	1
immeasurably	1
above	1
him,	1
an	1
insignificant	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
that	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to,	1
but	1
simply	1
could	1
not,	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
existence.	1
At	1
the	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
Kutuzov,	1
where	1
he	1
inquired	1
for	1
Bolkonski,	1
all	1
the	1
adjutants	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
orderlies	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
impress	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
officers	1
like	1
him	1
were	1
always	1
coming	1
there	1
and	1
that	1
everybody	1
was	1
heartily	1
sick	1
of	1
them.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
this,	1
or	1
rather	1
because	1
of	1
it,	1
next	1
day,	1
November	1
15,	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
again	1
went	1
to	1
Olmutz	1
and,	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
occupied	1
by	1
Kutuzov,	1
asked	1
for	1
Bolkonski.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
in	1
and	1
Boris	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
hall	1
probably	1
formerly	1
used	1
for	1
dancing,	1
but	1
in	1
which	1
five	1
beds	1
now	1
stood,	1
and	1
furniture	1
of	1
various	1
kinds:	1
a	1
table,	1
chairs,	1
and	1
a	1
clavichord.	1
One	1
adjutant,	1
nearest	1
the	1
door,	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
Persian	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
writing.	1
Another,	1
the	1
red,	1
stout	1
Nesvitski,	1
lay	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
under	1
his	1
head,	1
laughing	1
with	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
A	1
third	1
was	1
playing	1
a	1
Viennese	1
waltz	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
while	1
a	1
fourth,	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
sang	1
the	1
tune.	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
None	1
of	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
changed	1
his	1
position	1
on	1
seeing	1
Boris.	1
The	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
writing	1
and	1
whom	1
Boris	1
addressed	1
turned	1
round	1
crossly	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
on	1
duty	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
into	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Boris	1
thanked	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
reception	1
room,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
some	1
ten	1
officers	1
and	1
generals.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
entered,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
his	1
eyes	1
drooping	1
contemptuously	1
(with	1
that	1
peculiar	1
expression	1
of	1
polite	1
weariness	1
which	1
plainly	1
says,	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
duty	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
moment"),	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
Russian	1
general	1
with	1
decorations,	1
who	1
stood	1
very	1
erect,	1
almost	1
on	1
tiptoe,	1
with	1
a	1
soldier's	1
obsequious	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
purple	1
face,	1
reporting	1
something.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
then,	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
wait,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
the	1
general,	1
in	1
Russian,	1
speaking	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
intonation	1
he	1
affected	1
when	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
speak	1
contemptuously,	1
and	1
noticing	1
Boris,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
paying	1
no	1
more	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
ran	1
after	1
him	1
imploring	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
more,	1
nodded	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
smile.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Boris	1
clearly	1
realized	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
before	1
surmised,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
army,	1
besides	1
the	1
subordination	1
and	1
discipline	1
prescribed	1
in	1
the	1
military	1
code,	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
knew	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
there	1
was	1
another,	1
more	1
important,	1
subordination,	1
which	1
made	1
this	1
tight-laced,	1
purple-faced	1
general	1
wait	1
respectfully	1
while	1
Captain	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
pleasure,	1
chose	1
to	1
chat	1
with	1
Lieutenant	1
Drubetskoy.	1
More	1
than	1
ever	1
was	1
Boris	1
resolved	1
to	1
serve	1
in	1
future	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
written	1
code,	1
but	1
under	1
this	1
unwritten	1
law.	1
He	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
merely	1
by	1
having	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
risen	1
above	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
annihilate	1
him,	1
a	1
lieutenant	1
of	1
the	1
Guards.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
me	1
in	1
yesterday.	1
I	1
was	1
fussing	1
about	1
with	1
Germans	1
all	1
day.	1
We	1
went	1
with	1
Weyrother	1
to	1
survey	1
the	1
dispositions.	1
When	1
Germans	1
start	1
being	1
accurate,	1
there's	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
it!"	1
	1
Boris	1
smiled,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
alluding	1
to	1
as	1
something	1
generally	1
known.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
Weyrother's	1
name,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
term	1
"dispositions."	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
so	1
you	1
still	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
adjutant?	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
thinking"--for	1
some	1
reason	1
Boris	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
blushing--	1
"of	1
asking	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
He	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Kuragin	1
about	1
me.	1
I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
because	1
I	1
fear	1
the	1
Guards	1
won't	1
be	1
in	1
action,"	1
he	1
added	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
apology.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right.	1
We'll	1
talk	1
it	1
over,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Only	1
let	1
me	1
report	1
this	1
gentleman's	1
business,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
your	1
disposal."	1
	1
While	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
to	1
report	1
about	1
the	1
purple-faced	1
general,	1
that	1
gentleman--evidently	1
not	1
sharing	1
Boris'	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
unwritten	1
code	1
of	1
subordination--looked	1
so	1
fixedly	1
at	1
the	1
presumptuous	1
lieutenant	1
who	1
had	1
prevented	1
his	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
adjutant	1
that	1
Boris	1
felt	1
uncomfortable.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
waited	1
impatiently	1
for	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
commander-in-	1
chief's	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
large	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
clavichord	1
was.	1
"It's	1
no	1
use	1
your	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
He	1
would	1
say	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
pleasant	1
things,	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
dinner"	1
("That	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
bad	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
unwritten	1
code,"	1
thought	1
Boris),	1
"but	1
nothing	1
more	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it.	1
There	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
a	1
battalion	1
of	1
us	1
aides-de-camp	1
and	1
adjutants!	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
we'll	1
do:	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
friend,	1
an	1
adjutant	1
general	1
and	1
an	1
excellent	1
fellow,	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov;	1
and	1
though	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
know	1
it,	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
now	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
his	1
staff	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
count	1
for	1
nothing.	1
Everything	1
is	1
now	1
centered	1
round	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
So	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
Dolgorukov;	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
anyhow	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
you.	1
We	1
shall	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
cannot	1
attach	1
you	1
to	1
himself	1
or	1
find	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you	1
somewhere	1
nearer	1
the	1
sun."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
always	1
became	1
specially	1
keen	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
guide	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
worldly	1
success.	1
Under	1
cover	1
of	1
obtaining	1
help	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
for	1
another,	1
which	1
from	1
pride	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
accept	1
for	1
himself,	1
he	1
kept	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
circle	1
which	1
confers	1
success	1
and	1
which	1
attracted	1
him.	1
He	1
very	1
readily	1
took	1
up	1
Boris'	1
cause	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Dolgorukov.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
palace	1
at	1
Olmutz	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
Emperors	1
and	1
their	1
retinues.	1
	1
That	1
same	1
day	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
been	1
held	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
and	1
both	1
Emperors	1
took	1
part.	1
At	1
that	1
council,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
generals	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
Prince	1
Schwartzenberg,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
decided	1
to	1
advance	1
immediately	1
and	1
give	1
battle	1
to	1
Bonaparte.	1
The	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
was	1
just	1
over	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
accompanied	1
by	1
Boris	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
to	1
find	1
Dolgorukov.	1
Everyone	1
at	1
headquarters	1
was	1
still	1
under	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
day's	1
council,	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
party	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
had	1
triumphed.	1
The	1
voices	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
counseled	1
delay	1
and	1
advised	1
waiting	1
for	1
something	1
else	1
before	1
advancing	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
completely	1
silenced	1
and	1
their	1
arguments	1
confuted	1
by	1
such	1
conclusive	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
attacking	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
discussed	1
at	1
the	1
council--the	1
coming	1
battle	1
and	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
would	1
certainly	1
result	1
from	1
it--no	1
longer	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
past.	1
All	1
the	1
advantages	1
were	1
on	1
our	1
side.	1
Our	1
enormous	1
forces,	1
undoubtedly	1
superior	1
to	1
Napoleon's,	1
were	1
concentrated	1
in	1
one	1
place,	1
the	1
troops	1
inspired	1
by	1
the	1
Emperors'	1
presence	1
were	1
eager	1
for	1
action.	1
The	1
strategic	1
position	1
where	1
the	1
operations	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
was	1
familiar	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
details	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
General	1
Weyrother:	1
a	1
lucky	1
accident	1
had	1
ordained	1
that	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army	1
should	1
maneuver	1
the	1
previous	1
year	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
fields	1
where	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
fought;	1
the	1
adjacent	1
locality	1
was	1
known	1
and	1
shown	1
in	1
every	1
detail	1
on	1
the	1
maps,	1
and	1
Bonaparte,	1
evidently	1
weakened,	1
was	1
undertaking	1
nothing.	1
	1
Dolgorukov,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
warmest	1
advocates	1
of	1
an	1
attack,	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
council,	1
tired	1
and	1
exhausted	1
but	1
eager	1
and	1
proud	1
of	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
gained.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
introduced	1
his	1
protege,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
politely	1
and	1
firmly	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
Boris	1
and,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress	1
the	1
thoughts	1
which	1
were	1
uppermost	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
addressed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
what	1
a	1
battle	1
we	1
have	1
gained!	1
God	1
grant	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
result	1
from	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
victorious!	1
However,	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said	1
abruptly	1
and	1
eagerly,	1
"I	1
must	1
confess	1
to	1
having	1
been	1
unjust	1
to	1
the	1
Austrians	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
Weyrother.	1
What	1
exactitude,	1
what	1
minuteness,	1
what	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
locality,	1
what	1
foresight	1
for	1
every	1
eventuality,	1
every	1
possibility	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
smallest	1
detail!	1
No,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
no	1
conditions	1
better	1
than	1
our	1
present	1
ones	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
devised.	1
This	1
combination	1
of	1
Austrian	1
precision	1
with	1
Russian	1
valor--what	1
more	1
could	1
be	1
wished	1
for?"	1
	1
"So	1
the	1
attack	1
is	1
definitely	1
resolved	1
on?"	1
asked	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Bonaparte	1
has	1
decidedly	1
lost	1
bearings,	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
letter	1
was	1
received	1
from	1
him	1
today	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor."	1
Dolgorukov	1
smiled	1
significantly.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
so?	1
And	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
say?"	1
inquired	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
he	1
say?	1
Tra-di-ri-di-ra	1
and	1
so	1
on...	1
merely	1
to	1
gain	1
time.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
our	1
hands,	1
that's	1
certain!	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
most	1
amusing,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden,	1
good-natured	1
laugh,	1
"was	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
how	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
reply!	1
If	1
not	1
as	1
'Consul'	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
not	1
as	1
'Emperor,'	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
'General	1
Bonaparte.'"	1
	1
"But	1
between	1
not	1
recognizing	1
him	1
as	1
Emperor	1
and	1
calling	1
him	1
General	1
Bonaparte,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
difference,"	1
remarked	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"That's	1
just	1
it,"	1
interrupted	1
Dolgorukov	1
quickly,	1
laughing.	1
"You	1
know	1
Bilibin--he's	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
fellow.	1
He	1
suggested	1
addressing	1
him	1
as	1
'Usurper	1
and	1
Enemy	1
of	1
Mankind.'"	1
	1
Dolgorukov	1
laughed	1
merrily.	1
	1
"Only	1
that?"	1
said	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same,	1
it	1
was	1
Bilibin	1
who	1
found	1
a	1
suitable	1
form	1
for	1
the	1
address.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
clever	1
fellow."	1
	1
"What	1
was	1
it?"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
Head	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Government...	1
Au	1
chef	1
du	1
gouvernement	1
francais,"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov,	1
with	1
grave	1
satisfaction.	1
"Good,	1
wasn't	1
it?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
dislike	1
it	1
extremely,"	1
said	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
very	1
much!	1
My	1
brother	1
knows	1
him,	1
he's	1
dined	1
with	1
him--the	1
present	1
Emperor--more	1
than	1
once	1
in	1
Paris,	1
and	1
tells	1
me	1
he	1
never	1
met	1
a	1
more	1
cunning	1
or	1
subtle	1
diplomatist--you	1
know,	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
French	1
adroitness	1
and	1
Italian	1
play-acting!	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
tale	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
Count	1
Markov?	1
Count	1
Markov	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
handle	1
him.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
handkerchief?	1
It	1
is	1
delightful!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
talkative	1
Dolgorukov,	1
turning	1
now	1
to	1
Boris,	1
now	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
told	1
how	1
Bonaparte	1
wishing	1
to	1
test	1
Markov,	1
our	1
ambassador,	1
purposely	1
dropped	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
Markov,	1
probably	1
expecting	1
Markov	1
to	1
pick	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
Markov	1
immediately	1
dropped	1
his	1
own	1
beside	1
it	1
and	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
without	1
touching	1
Bonaparte's.	1
	1
"Delightful!"	1
said	1
Bolkonski.	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you,	1
Prince,	1
as	1
a	1
petitioner	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man.	1
You	1
see..."	1
but	1
before	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
finish,	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
summon	1
Dolgorukov	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
nuisance,"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov,	1
getting	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
pressing	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Boris.	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
both	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
dear	1
young	1
man."	1
Again	1
he	1
pressed	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
good-natured,	1
sincere,	1
and	1
animated	1
levity.	1
"But	1
you	1
see...	1
another	1
time!"	1
	1
Boris	1
was	1
excited	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
higher	1
powers	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
He	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
springs	1
that	1
set	1
in	1
motion	1
the	1
enormous	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
regiment	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
a	1
tiny,	1
obedient,	1
and	1
insignificant	1
atom.	1
They	1
followed	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
met--coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
room	1
by	1
which	1
Dolgorukov	1
had	1
entered--a	1
short	1
man	1
in	1
civilian	1
clothes	1
with	1
a	1
clever	1
face	1
and	1
sharply	1
projecting	1
jaw	1
which,	1
without	1
spoiling	1
his	1
face,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
peculiar	1
vivacity	1
and	1
shiftiness	1
of	1
expression.	1
This	1
short	1
man	1
nodded	1
to	1
Dolgorukov	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
friend	1
and	1
stared	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
cool	1
intensity,	1
walking	1
straight	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
evidently	1
expecting	1
him	1
to	1
bow	1
or	1
to	1
step	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
neither:	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
animosity	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
corridor.	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable,	1
but	1
to	1
me	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
of	1
men--the	1
Minister	1
of	1
Foreign	1
Affairs,	1
Prince	1
Adam	1
Czartoryski....	1
It	1
is	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
he	1
who	1
decide	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
nations,"	1
added	1
Bolkonski	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
suppress,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
palace.	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
the	1
army	1
began	1
its	1
campaign,	1
and	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
Boris	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
either	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
or	1
Dolgorukov	1
again	1
and	1
remained	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
Ismaylov	1
regiment.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
At	1
dawn	1
on	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
of	1
November,	1
Denisov's	1
squadron,	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
served	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Prince	1
Bagration's	1
detachment,	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
night,	1
advancing	1
into	1
action	1
as	1
arranged,	1
and	1
after	1
going	1
behind	1
other	1
columns	1
for	1
about	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
was	1
stopped	1
on	1
the	1
highroad.	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
squadrons	1
of	1
hussars	1
and	1
infantry	1
battalions	1
and	1
artillery	1
pass	1
by	1
and	1
go	1
forward	1
and	1
then	1
Generals	1
Bagration	1
and	1
Dolgorukov	1
ride	1
past	1
with	1
their	1
adjutants.	1
All	1
the	1
fear	1
before	1
action	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
as	1
previously,	1
all	1
the	1
inner	1
struggle	1
to	1
conquer	1
that	1
fear,	1
all	1
his	1
dreams	1
of	1
distinguishing	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
true	1
hussar	1
in	1
this	1
battle,	1
had	1
been	1
wasted.	1
Their	1
squadron	1
remained	1
in	1
reserve	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
spent	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
dull	1
and	1
wretched	1
mood.	1
At	1
nine	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
he	1
heard	1
firing	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
shouts	1
of	1
hurrah,	1
and	1
saw	1
wounded	1
being	1
brought	1
back	1
(there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
of	1
them),	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
a	1
whole	1
detachment	1
of	1
French	1
cavalry	1
was	1
brought	1
in,	1
convoyed	1
by	1
a	1
sotnya	1
of	1
Cossacks.	1
Evidently	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
over	1
and,	1
though	1
not	1
big,	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
successful	1
engagement.	1
The	1
men	1
and	1
officers	1
returning	1
spoke	1
of	1
a	1
brilliant	1
victory,	1
of	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Wischau	1
and	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
French	1
squadron.	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
sunny	1
after	1
a	1
sharp	1
night	1
frost,	1
and	1
the	1
cheerful	1
glitter	1
of	1
that	1
autumn	1
day	1
was	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
victory	1
which	1
was	1
conveyed,	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
tales	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
joyful	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
officers,	1
generals,	1
and	1
adjutants,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
Rostov	1
going	1
or	1
coming.	1
And	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
vainly	1
suffered	1
all	1
the	1
dread	1
that	1
precedes	1
a	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
that	1
happy	1
day	1
in	1
inactivity,	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
depressed.	1
	1
"Come	1
here,	1
Wostov.	1
Let's	1
dwink	1
to	1
dwown	1
our	1
gwief!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
roadside	1
with	1
a	1
flask	1
and	1
some	1
food.	1
	1
The	1
officers	1
gathered	1
round	1
Denisov's	1
canteen,	1
eating	1
and	1
talking.	1
	1
"There!	1
They	1
are	1
bringing	1
another!"	1
cried	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
indicating	1
a	1
captive	1
French	1
dragoon	1
who	1
was	1
being	1
brought	1
in	1
on	1
foot	1
by	1
two	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
leading	1
by	1
the	1
bridle	1
a	1
fine	1
large	1
French	1
horse	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
prisoner.	1
	1
"Sell	1
us	1
that	1
horse!"	1
Denisov	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
like,	1
your	1
honor!"	1
	1
The	1
officers	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
their	1
prisoner.	1
The	1
French	1
dragoon	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
Alsatian	1
who	1
spoke	1
French	1
with	1
a	1
German	1
accent.	1
He	1
was	1
breathless	1
with	1
agitation,	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
red,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
some	1
French	1
spoken	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
officers,	1
addressing	1
first	1
one,	1
then	1
another.	1
He	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
taken,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
fault	1
but	1
the	1
corporal's	1
who	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
seize	1
some	1
horsecloths,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
there.	1
And	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
added:	1
"But	1
don't	1
hurt	1
my	1
little	1
horse!"	1
and	1
stroked	1
the	1
animal.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
grasp	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
Now	1
he	1
excused	1
himself	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
and	1
now,	1
imagining	1
himself	1
before	1
his	1
own	1
officers,	1
insisted	1
on	1
his	1
soldierly	1
discipline	1
and	1
zeal	1
in	1
the	1
service.	1
He	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
our	1
rearguard	1
all	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
alien	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
sold	1
the	1
horse	1
for	1
two	1
gold	1
pieces,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
being	1
the	1
richest	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
money,	1
bought	1
it.	1
	1
"But	1
don't	1
hurt	1
my	1
little	1
horse!"	1
said	1
the	1
Alsatian	1
good-naturedly	1
to	1
Rostov	1
when	1
the	1
animal	1
was	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
hussar.	1
	1
Rostov	1
smilingly	1
reassured	1
the	1
dragoon	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
money.	1
	1
"Alley!	1
Alley!"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack,	1
touching	1
the	1
prisoner's	1
arm	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
go	1
on.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor!	1
The	1
Emperor!"	1
was	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
among	1
the	1
hussars.	1
	1
All	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
and	1
bustle,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
coming	1
up	1
the	1
road	1
behind	1
him	1
several	1
riders	1
with	1
white	1
plumes	1
in	1
their	1
hats.	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
everyone	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
waiting.	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
or	1
remember	1
how	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
mounted.	1
Instantly	1
his	1
regret	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
action	1
and	1
his	1
dejected	1
mood	1
amid	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
weary	1
had	1
gone,	1
instantly	1
every	1
thought	1
of	1
himself	1
had	1
vanished.	1
He	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
happiness	1
at	1
his	1
nearness	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
nearness	1
by	1
itself	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
lost.	1
He	1
was	1
happy	1
as	1
a	1
lover	1
when	1
the	1
longed-for	1
moment	1
of	1
meeting	1
arrives.	1
Not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
round,	1
he	1
was	1
ecstatically	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
approach.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
hoofs	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
cavalcade,	1
but	1
because	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
everything	1
grew	1
brighter,	1
more	1
joyful,	1
more	1
significant,	1
and	1
more	1
festive	1
around	1
him.	1
Nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
Rostov	1
came	1
that	1
sun	1
shedding	1
beams	1
of	1
mild	1
and	1
majestic	1
light	1
around,	1
and	1
already	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
enveloped	1
in	1
those	1
beams,	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
voice,	1
that	1
kindly,	1
calm,	1
and	1
majestic	1
voice	1
that	1
was	1
yet	1
so	1
simple!	1
And	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
Rostov's	1
feeling,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deathly	1
stillness	1
amid	1
which	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
voice.	1
	1
"The	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars?"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
	1
"The	1
reserves,	1
sire!"	1
replied	1
a	1
voice,	1
a	1
very	1
human	1
one	1
compared	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
said:	1
"The	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars?"	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
drew	1
level	1
with	1
Rostov	1
and	1
halted.	1
Alexander's	1
face	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
three	1
days	1
before	1
at	1
the	1
review.	1
It	1
shone	1
with	1
such	1
gaiety	1
and	1
youth,	1
such	1
innocent	1
youth,	1
that	1
it	1
suggested	1
the	1
liveliness	1
of	1
a	1
fourteen-year-old	1
boy,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
majestic	1
Emperor.	1
Casually,	1
while	1
surveying	1
the	1
squadron,	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes	1
met	1
Rostov's	1
and	1
rested	1
on	1
them	1
for	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
seconds.	1
Whether	1
or	1
no	1
the	1
Emperor	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
soul	1
(it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Rostov	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
everything),	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
his	1
light-blue	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
for	1
about	1
two	1
seconds	1
into	1
Rostov's	1
face.	1
A	1
gentle,	1
mild	1
light	1
poured	1
from	1
them.	1
Then	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
eyebrows,	1
abruptly	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
foot,	1
and	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
younger	1
Emperor	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
and,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
remonstrances	1
of	1
his	1
courtiers,	1
at	1
twelve	1
o'clock	1
left	1
the	1
third	1
column	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
galloped	1
toward	1
the	1
vanguard.	1
Before	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
hussars,	1
several	1
adjutants	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
successful	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
action.	1
	1
This	1
battle,	1
which	1
consisted	1
in	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
a	1
French	1
squadron,	1
was	1
represented	1
as	1
a	1
brilliant	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
especially	1
while	1
the	1
smoke	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
battlefield,	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
been	1
defeated	1
and	1
were	1
retreating	1
against	1
their	1
will.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
passed,	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
division	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
advance.	1
In	1
Wischau	1
itself,	1
a	1
petty	1
German	1
town,	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
Emperor	1
again.	1
In	1
the	1
market	1
place,	1
where	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
rather	1
heavy	1
firing	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival,	1
lay	1
several	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded	1
soldiers	1
whom	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
time	1
to	1
move.	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
his	1
suite	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
courtiers,	1
was	1
riding	1
a	1
bobtailed	1
chestnut	1
mare,	1
a	1
different	1
one	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
ridden	1
at	1
the	1
review,	1
and	1
bending	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
he	1
gracefully	1
held	1
a	1
gold	1
lorgnette	1
to	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
lay	1
prone,	1
with	1
blood	1
on	1
his	1
uncovered	1
head.	1
The	1
wounded	1
soldier	1
was	1
so	1
dirty,	1
coarse,	1
and	1
revolting	1
that	1
his	1
proximity	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
shocked	1
Rostov.	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
rather	1
round	1
shoulders	1
shuddered	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
cold	1
shiver	1
had	1
run	1
down	1
them,	1
how	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
began	1
convulsively	1
tapping	1
the	1
horse's	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
spur,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
well-trained	1
horse	1
looked	1
round	1
unconcerned	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
stir.	1
An	1
adjutant,	1
dismounting,	1
lifted	1
the	1
soldier	1
under	1
the	1
arms	1
to	1
place	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
stretcher	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brought.	1
The	1
soldier	1
groaned.	1
	1
"Gently,	1
gently!	1
Can't	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
more	1
gently?"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
apparently	1
suffering	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
dying	1
soldier,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
away.	1
	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
tears	1
filling	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes	1
and	1
heard	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
riding	1
away,	1
say	1
to	1
Czartoryski:	1
"What	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
war	1
is:	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing!	1
Quelle	1
terrible	1
chose	1
que	1
la	1
guerre!"	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
of	1
the	1
vanguard	1
were	1
stationed	1
before	1
Wischau,	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
lines,	1
which	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
had	1
yielded	1
ground	1
to	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
firing.	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
gratitude	1
was	1
announced	1
to	1
the	1
vanguard,	1
rewards	1
were	1
promised,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
received	1
a	1
double	1
ration	1
of	1
vodka.	1
The	1
campfires	1
crackled	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
songs	1
resounded	1
even	1
more	1
merrily	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
night.	1
Denisov	1
celebrated	1
his	1
promotion	1
to	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
major,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
drunk	1
enough,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
proposed	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
health.	1
"Not	1
'our	1
Sovereign,	1
the	1
Emperor,'	1
as	1
they	1
say	1
at	1
official	1
dinners,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
our	1
Sovereign,	1
that	1
good,	1
enchanting,	1
and	1
great	1
man!	1
Let	1
us	1
drink	1
to	1
his	1
health	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
certain	1
defeat	1
of	1
the	1
French!"	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
fought	1
before,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"not	1
letting	1
the	1
French	1
pass,	1
as	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
do	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
front?	1
We	1
will	1
all	1
die	1
for	1
him	1
gladly!	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
gentlemen?	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
saying	1
it	1
right,	1
I	1
have	1
drunk	1
a	1
good	1
deal--but	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
feel,	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
you	1
too!	1
To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Alexander	1
the	1
First!	1
Hurrah!"	1
	1
"Hurrah!"	1
rang	1
the	1
enthusiastic	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
cavalry	1
captain,	1
Kirsten,	1
shouted	1
enthusiastically	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
sincerely	1
than	1
the	1
twenty-year-old	1
Rostov.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
officers	1
had	1
emptied	1
and	1
smashed	1
their	1
glasses,	1
Kirsten	1
filled	1
others	1
and,	1
in	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
and	1
breeches,	1
went	1
glass	1
in	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
bonfires	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
gray	1
mustache,	1
his	1
white	1
chest	1
showing	1
under	1
his	1
open	1
shirt,	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
majestic	1
pose	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
campfire,	1
waving	1
his	1
uplifted	1
arm.	1
	1
"Lads!	1
here's	1
to	1
our	1
Sovereign,	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
victory	1
over	1
our	1
enemies!	1
Hurrah!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
his	1
dashing,	1
old,	1
hussar's	1
baritone.	1
	1
The	1
hussars	1
crowded	1
round	1
and	1
responded	1
heartily	1
with	1
loud	1
shouts.	1
	1
Late	1
that	1
night,	1
when	1
all	1
had	1
separated,	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
short	1
hand	1
patted	1
his	1
favorite,	1
Rostov,	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"As	1
there's	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
on	1
campaign,	1
he's	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
Tsar,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Denisov,	1
don't	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
it!"	1
cried	1
Rostov.	1
"It	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
lofty,	1
beautiful	1
feeling,	1
such	1
a..."	1
	1
"I	1
believe	1
it,	1
I	1
believe	1
it,	1
fwiend,	1
and	1
I	1
share	1
and	1
appwove..."	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
don't	1
understand!"	1
	1
And	1
Rostov	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
wandering	1
among	1
the	1
campfires,	1
dreaming	1
of	1
what	1
happiness	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
die--not	1
in	1
saving	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
life	1
(he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
dare	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
that),	1
but	1
simply	1
to	1
die	1
before	1
his	1
eyes.	1
He	1
really	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
arms	1
and	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
future	1
triumph.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
to	1
experience	1
that	1
feeling	1
during	1
those	1
memorable	1
days	1
preceding	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz:	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
were	1
then	1
in	1
love,	1
though	1
less	1
ecstatically,	1
with	1
their	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
arms.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
Emperor	1
stopped	1
at	1
Wischau,	1
and	1
Villier,	1
his	1
physician,	1
was	1
repeatedly	1
summoned	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
At	1
headquarters	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
troops	1
near	1
by	1
the	1
news	1
spread	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
unwell.	1
He	1
ate	1
nothing	1
and	1
had	1
slept	1
badly	1
that	1
night,	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
reported.	1
The	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
indisposition	1
was	1
the	1
strong	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
his	1
sensitive	1
mind	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded.	1
	1
At	1
daybreak	1
on	1
the	1
seventeenth,	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
a	1
flag	1
of	1
truce,	1
demanding	1
an	1
audience	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
Emperor,	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
Wischau	1
from	1
our	1
outposts.	1
This	1
officer	1
was	1
Savary.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
and	1
so	1
Savary	1
had	1
to	1
wait.	1
At	1
midday	1
he	1
was	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
he	1
rode	1
off	1
with	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
to	1
the	1
advanced	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
rumored	1
that	1
Savary	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
propose	1
to	1
Alexander	1
a	1
meeting	1
with	1
Napoleon.	1
To	1
the	1
joy	1
and	1
pride	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
a	1
personal	1
interview	1
was	1
refused,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
Sovereign,	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov,	1
the	1
victor	1
at	1
Wischau,	1
was	1
sent	1
with	1
Savary	1
to	1
negotiate	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
if,	1
contrary	1
to	1
expectations,	1
these	1
negotiations	1
were	1
actuated	1
by	1
a	1
real	1
desire	1
for	1
peace.	1
	1
Toward	1
evening	1
Dolgorukov	1
came	1
back,	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar,	1
and	1
remained	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
and	1
nineteenth	1
of	1
November,	1
the	1
army	1
advanced	1
two	1
days'	1
march	1
and	1
the	1
enemy's	1
outposts	1
after	1
a	1
brief	1
interchange	1
of	1
shots	1
retreated.	1
In	1
the	1
highest	1
army	1
circles	1
from	1
midday	1
on	1
the	1
nineteenth,	1
a	1
great,	1
excitedly	1
bustling	1
activity	1
began	1
which	1
lasted	1
till	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
twentieth,	1
when	1
the	1
memorable	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
was	1
fought.	1
	1
Till	1
midday	1
on	1
the	1
nineteenth,	1
the	1
activity--the	1
eager	1
talk,	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
dispatching	1
of	1
adjutants--was	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
afternoon	1
of	1
that	1
day,	1
this	1
activity	1
reached	1
Kutuzov's	1
headquarters	1
and	1
the	1
staffs	1
of	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
columns.	1
By	1
evening,	1
the	1
adjutants	1
had	1
spread	1
it	1
to	1
all	1
ends	1
and	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
from	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
to	1
the	1
twentieth,	1
the	1
whole	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
allied	1
troops	1
rose	1
from	1
their	1
bivouacs	1
to	1
the	1
hum	1
of	1
voices,	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
swayed	1
and	1
started	1
in	1
one	1
enormous	1
mass	1
six	1
miles	1
long.	1
	1
The	1
concentrated	1
activity	1
which	1
had	1
begun	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
had	1
started	1
the	1
whole	1
movement	1
that	1
followed	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
wheel	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
tower	1
clock.	1
One	1
wheel	1
slowly	1
moved,	1
another	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
motion,	1
and	1
a	1
third,	1
and	1
wheels	1
began	1
to	1
revolve	1
faster	1
and	1
faster,	1
levers	1
and	1
cogwheels	1
to	1
work,	1
chimes	1
to	1
play,	1
figures	1
to	1
pop	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
advance	1
with	1
regular	1
motion	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
activity.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
a	1
clock,	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
machine,	1
an	1
impulse	1
once	1
given	1
leads	1
to	1
the	1
final	1
result;	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
indifferently	1
quiescent	1
till	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
motion	1
is	1
transmitted	1
to	1
them	1
are	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
mechanism	1
which	1
the	1
impulse	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
reached.	1
Wheels	1
creak	1
on	1
their	1
axles	1
as	1
the	1
cogs	1
engage	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
revolving	1
pulleys	1
whirr	1
with	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
their	1
movement,	1
but	1
a	1
neighboring	1
wheel	1
is	1
as	1
quiet	1
and	1
motionless	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
prepared	1
to	1
remain	1
so	1
for	1
a	1
hundred	1
years;	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
comes	1
when	1
the	1
lever	1
catches	1
it	1
and	1
obeying	1
the	1
impulse	1
that	1
wheel	1
begins	1
to	1
creak	1
and	1
joins	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
motion	1
the	1
result	1
and	1
aim	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
beyond	1
its	1
ken.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
clock,	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
complicated	1
motion	1
of	1
innumerable	1
wheels	1
and	1
pulleys	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
slow	1
and	1
regular	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
which	1
show	1
the	1
time,	1
so	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
complicated	1
human	1
activities	1
of	1
160,000	1
Russians	1
and	1
French--all	1
their	1
passions,	1
desires,	1
remorse,	1
humiliations,	1
sufferings,	1
outbursts	1
of	1
pride,	1
fear,	1
and	1
enthusiasm--was	1
only	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
the	1
so-called	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
Emperors--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
slow	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
dial	1
of	1
human	1
history.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
on	1
duty	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
in	1
constant	1
attendance	1
on	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
At	1
six	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters	1
and	1
after	1
staying	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
Tsar	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
grand	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
court,	1
Count	1
Tolstoy.	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
action	1
from	1
Dolgorukov.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
upset	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
about	1
something	1
and	1
that	1
at	1
headquarters	1
they	1
were	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters	1
everyone	1
adopted	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
know	1
something	1
others	1
do	1
not	1
know:	1
he	1
therefore	1
wished	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Dolgorukov.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
d'you	1
do,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
tea	1
with	1
Bilibin.	1
"The	1
fete	1
is	1
for	1
tomorrow.	1
How	1
is	1
your	1
old	1
fellow?	1
Out	1
of	1
sorts?"	1
	1
"I	1
won't	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
sorts,	1
but	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
heard."	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
heard	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
will	1
hear	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
talks	1
sense,	1
but	1
to	1
temporize	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
something	1
now	1
when	1
Bonaparte	1
fears	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
battle	1
is	1
impossible."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
him?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
is	1
Bonaparte	1
like?	1
How	1
did	1
he	1
impress	1
you?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
fears	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
engagement,"	1
repeated	1
Dolgorukov,	1
evidently	1
prizing	1
this	1
general	1
conclusion	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
arrived	1
at	1
from	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Napoleon.	1
"If	1
he	1
weren't	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
ask	1
for	1
that	1
interview?	1
Why	1
negotiate,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
why	1
retreat,	1
when	1
to	1
retreat	1
is	1
so	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
method	1
of	1
conducting	1
war?	1
Believe	1
me,	1
he	1
is	1
afraid,	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
battle.	1
His	1
hour	1
has	1
come!	1
Mark	1
my	1
words!"	1
	1
"But	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
is	1
he	1
like,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
gray	1
overcoat,	1
very	1
anxious	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
call	1
him	1
'Your	1
Majesty,'	1
but	1
who,	1
to	1
his	1
chagrin,	1
got	1
no	1
title	1
from	1
me!	1
That's	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
nothing	1
more,"	1
replied	1
Dolgorukov,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
Bilibin	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Despite	1
my	1
great	1
respect	1
for	1
old	1
Kutuzov,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"we	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
nice	1
set	1
of	1
fellows	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
wait	1
about	1
and	1
so	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
escape,	1
or	1
to	1
trick	1
us,	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
certainly	1
have	1
him	1
in	1
our	1
hands!	1
No,	1
we	1
mustn't	1
forget	1
Suvorov	1
and	1
his	1
rule--not	1
to	1
put	1
yourself	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
be	1
attacked,	1
but	1
yourself	1
to	1
attack.	1
Believe	1
me	1
in	1
war	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
often	1
shows	1
the	1
way	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
old	1
Cunctators."	1
	1
"But	1
in	1
what	1
position	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
attack	1
him?	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
outposts	1
today	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
where	1
his	1
chief	1
forces	1
are	1
situated,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
Dolgorukov	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
formed.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
Dolgorukov	1
said	1
quickly,	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
spread	1
a	1
map	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"All	1
eventualities	1
have	1
been	1
foreseen.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
standing	1
before	1
Brunn..."	1
	1
And	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
rapidly	1
but	1
indistinctly	1
explained	1
Weyrother's	1
plan	1
of	1
a	1
flanking	1
movement.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
to	1
reply	1
and	1
to	1
state	1
his	1
own	1
plan,	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
Weyrother's,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
disadvantage	1
that	1
Weyrother's	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
approved.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
plan,	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
ceased	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
gazed	1
absent-mindedly	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
map,	1
but	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face.	1
	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
at	1
Kutuzov's	1
tonight,	1
though;	1
you	1
can	1
say	1
all	1
this	1
there,"	1
remarked	1
Dolgorukov.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
so,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
moving	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
map.	1
	1
"Whatever	1
are	1
you	1
bothering	1
about,	1
gentlemen?"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
who,	1
till	1
then,	1
had	1
listened	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
smile	1
to	1
their	1
conversation	1
and	1
now	1
was	1
evidently	1
ready	1
with	1
a	1
joke.	1
"Whether	1
tomorrow	1
brings	1
victory	1
or	1
defeat,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
Russian	1
arms	1
is	1
secure.	1
Except	1
your	1
Kutuzov,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
Russian	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
column!	1
The	1
commanders	1
are:	1
Herr	1
General	1
Wimpfen,	1
le	1
Comte	1
de	1
Langeron,	1
le	1
Prince	1
de	1
Lichtenstein,	1
le	1
Prince,	1
de	1
Hohenlohe,	1
and	1
finally	1
Prishprish,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
like	1
all	1
those	1
Polish	1
names."	1
	1
"Be	1
quiet,	1
backbiter!"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
true;	1
there	1
are	1
now	1
two	1
Russians,	1
Miloradovich,	1
and	1
Dokhturov,	1
and	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
third,	1
Count	1
Arakcheev,	1
if	1
his	1
nerves	1
were	1
not	1
too	1
weak."	1
	1
"However,	1
I	1
think	1
General	1
Kutuzov	1
has	1
come	1
out,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
good	1
luck	1
and	1
success,	1
gentlemen!"	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
after	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
Dolgorukov	1
and	1
Bilibin.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
home,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
asking	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
silently	1
beside	1
him,	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
tomorrow's	1
battle.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
his	1
adjutant	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
replied:	1
"I	1
think	1
the	1
battle	1
will	1
be	1
lost,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
told	1
Count	1
Tolstoy	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
replied?	1
'But,	1
my	1
dear	1
general,	1
I	1
am	1
engaged	1
with	1
rice	1
and	1
cutlets,	1
look	1
after	1
military	1
matters	1
yourself!'	1
Yes...	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
answer	1
I	1
got!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
Shortly	1
after	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
that	1
evening,	1
Weyrother	1
drove	1
with	1
his	1
plans	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
quarters	1
where	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
held.	1
All	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
columns	1
were	1
summoned	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
who	1
declined	1
to	1
come,	1
were	1
all	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time.	1
	1
Weyrother,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
battle,	1
by	1
his	1
eagerness	1
and	1
briskness	1
presented	1
a	1
marked	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
dissatisfied	1
and	1
drowsy	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
reluctantly	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
chairman	1
and	1
president	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war.	1
Weyrother	1
evidently	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
movement	1
that	1
had	1
already	1
become	1
unrestrainable.	1
He	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
horse	1
running	1
downhill	1
harnessed	1
to	1
a	1
heavy	1
cart.	1
Whether	1
he	1
was	1
pulling	1
it	1
or	1
being	1
pushed	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
rushed	1
along	1
at	1
headlong	1
speed	1
with	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
this	1
movement	1
might	1
lead	1
to.	1
Weyrother	1
had	1
been	1
twice	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
the	1
enemy's	1
picket	1
line	1
to	1
reconnoiter	1
personally,	1
and	1
twice	1
to	1
the	1
Emperors,	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian,	1
to	1
report	1
and	1
explain,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
headquarters	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
dictated	1
the	1
dispositions	1
in	1
German,	1
and	1
now,	1
much	1
exhausted,	1
he	1
arrived	1
at	1
Kutuzov's.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
so	1
busy	1
that	1
he	1
even	1
forgot	1
to	1
be	1
polite	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
He	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
talked	1
rapidly	1
and	1
indistinctly,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
addressing,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
to	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
bespattered	1
with	1
mud	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
pitiful,	1
weary,	1
and	1
distracted	1
air,	1
though	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
haughty	1
and	1
self-confident.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
occupying	1
a	1
nobleman's	1
castle	1
of	1
modest	1
dimensions	1
near	1
Ostralitz.	1
In	1
the	1
large	1
drawing	1
room	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief's	1
office	1
were	1
gathered	1
Kutuzov	1
himself,	1
Weyrother,	1
and	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war.	1
They	1
were	1
drinking	1
tea,	1
and	1
only	1
awaited	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
council.	1
At	1
last	1
Bagration's	1
orderly	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
could	1
not	1
attend.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
inform	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
of	1
this	1
and,	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
permission	1
previously	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
council,	1
he	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Since	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
is	1
not	1
coming,	1
we	1
may	1
begin,"	1
said	1
Weyrother,	1
hurriedly	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
an	1
enormous	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
Brunn	1
was	1
spread	1
out.	1
	1
Kutuzov,	1
with	1
his	1
uniform	1
unbuttoned	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
fat	1
neck	1
bulged	1
over	1
his	1
collar	1
as	1
if	1
escaping,	1
was	1
sitting	1
almost	1
asleep	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
podgy	1
old	1
hands	1
resting	1
symmetrically	1
on	1
its	1
arms.	1
At	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Weyrother's	1
voice,	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
one	1
eye	1
with	1
an	1
effort.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
if	1
you	1
please!	1
It	1
is	1
already	1
late,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
nodding	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
let	1
it	1
droop	1
and	1
again	1
closed	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
If	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
thought	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
pretending	1
to	1
sleep,	1
the	1
sounds	1
his	1
nose	1
emitted	1
during	1
the	1
reading	1
that	1
followed	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
was	1
absorbed	1
by	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
serious	1
matter	1
than	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
dispositions	1
or	1
anything	1
else--he	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
satisfying	1
the	1
irresistible	1
human	1
need	1
for	1
sleep.	1
He	1
really	1
was	1
asleep.	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
the	1
gesture	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
too	1
busy	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
moment,	1
glanced	1
at	1
Kutuzov	1
and,	1
having	1
convinced	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
paper	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
monotonous	1
voice	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
out	1
the	1
dispositions	1
for	1
the	1
impending	1
battle,	1
under	1
a	1
heading	1
which	1
he	1
also	1
read	1
out:	1
	1
"Dispositions	1
for	1
an	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
enemy	1
position	1
behind	1
Kobelnitz	1
and	1
Sokolnitz,	1
November	1
30,	1
1805."	1
	1
The	1
dispositions	1
were	1
very	1
complicated	1
and	1
difficult.	1
They	1
began	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
"As	1
the	1
enemy's	1
left	1
wing	1
rests	1
on	1
wooded	1
hills	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
extends	1
along	1
Kobelnitz	1
and	1
Sokolnitz	1
behind	1
the	1
ponds	1
that	1
are	1
there,	1
while	1
we,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
with	1
our	1
left	1
wing	1
by	1
far	1
outflank	1
his	1
right,	1
it	1
is	1
advantageous	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
enemy's	1
latter	1
wing	1
especially	1
if	1
we	1
occupy	1
the	1
villages	1
of	1
Sokolnitz	1
and	1
Kobelnitz,	1
whereby	1
we	1
can	1
both	1
fall	1
on	1
his	1
flank	1
and	1
pursue	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
plain	1
between	1
Schlappanitz	1
and	1
the	1
Thuerassa	1
forest,	1
avoiding	1
the	1
defiles	1
of	1
Schlappanitz	1
and	1
Bellowitz	1
which	1
cover	1
the	1
enemy's	1
front.	1
For	1
this	1
object	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that...	1
The	1
first	1
column	1
marches...	1
The	1
second	1
column	1
marches...	1
The	1
third	1
column	1
marches..."	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
read	1
Weyrother.	1
	1
The	1
generals	1
seemed	1
to	1
listen	1
reluctantly	1
to	1
the	1
difficult	1
dispositions.	1
The	1
tall,	1
fair-haired	1
General	1
Buxhowden	1
stood,	1
leaning	1
his	1
back	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
burning	1
candle,	1
and	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
listen	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
to	1
listen.	1
Exactly	1
opposite	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
his	1
glistening	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
mustache	1
twisted	1
upwards,	1
sat	1
the	1
ruddy	1
Miloradovich	1
in	1
a	1
military	1
pose,	1
his	1
elbows	1
turned	1
outwards,	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
his	1
shoulders	1
raised.	1
He	1
remained	1
stubbornly	1
silent,	1
gazing	1
at	1
Weyrother's	1
face,	1
and	1
only	1
turned	1
away	1
his	1
eyes	1
when	1
the	1
Austrian	1
chief	1
of	1
staff	1
finished	1
reading.	1
Then	1
Miloradovich	1
looked	1
round	1
significantly	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
generals.	1
But	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
from	1
that	1
significant	1
look	1
whether	1
he	1
agreed	1
or	1
disagreed	1
and	1
was	1
satisfied	1
or	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
arrangements.	1
Next	1
to	1
Weyrother	1
sat	1
Count	1
Langeron	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
that	1
never	1
left	1
his	1
typically	1
southern	1
French	1
face	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
reading,	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
delicate	1
fingers	1
which	1
rapidly	1
twirled	1
by	1
its	1
corners	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
portrait.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
longest	1
sentences,	1
he	1
stopped	1
the	1
rotary	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
snuffbox,	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
with	1
inimical	1
politeness	1
lurking	1
in	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
thin	1
lips	1
interrupted	1
Weyrother,	1
wishing	1
to	1
say	1
something.	1
But	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
continuing	1
to	1
read,	1
frowned	1
angrily	1
and	1
jerked	1
his	1
elbows,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say:	1
"You	1
can	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
views	1
later,	1
but	1
now	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
map	1
and	1
listen."	1
Langeron	1
lifted	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
perplexity,	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
Miloradovich	1
as	1
if	1
seeking	1
an	1
explanation,	1
but	1
meeting	1
the	1
latter's	1
impressive	1
but	1
meaningless	1
gaze	1
drooped	1
his	1
eyes	1
sadly	1
and	1
again	1
took	1
to	1
twirling	1
his	1
snuffbox.	1
	1
"A	1
geography	1
lesson!"	1
he	1
muttered	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
himself,	1
but	1
loud	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
Przebyszewski,	1
with	1
respectful	1
but	1
dignified	1
politeness,	1
held	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
ear	1
toward	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
absorbed	1
in	1
attention.	1
Dohkturov,	1
a	1
little	1
man,	1
sat	1
opposite	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
an	1
assiduous	1
and	1
modest	1
mien,	1
and	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
outspread	1
map	1
conscientiously	1
studied	1
the	1
dispositions	1
and	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
locality.	1
He	1
asked	1
Weyrother	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
repeat	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
clearly	1
heard	1
and	1
the	1
difficult	1
names	1
of	1
villages.	1
Weyrother	1
complied	1
and	1
Dohkturov	1
noted	1
them	1
down.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
reading	1
which	1
lasted	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
was	1
over,	1
Langeron	1
again	1
brought	1
his	1
snuffbox	1
to	1
rest	1
and,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Weyrother	1
or	1
at	1
anyone	1
in	1
particular,	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
difficult	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
such	1
a	1
plan	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
enemy's	1
position	1
was	1
assumed	1
to	1
be	1
known,	1
whereas	1
it	1
was	1
perhaps	1
not	1
known,	1
since	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
in	1
movement.	1
Langeron's	1
objections	1
were	1
valid	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
their	1
chief	1
aim	1
was	1
to	1
show	1
General	1
Weyrother--who	1
had	1
read	1
his	1
dispositions	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
self-confidence	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
addressing	1
school	1
children--that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do,	1
not	1
with	1
fools,	1
but	1
with	1
men	1
who	1
could	1
teach	1
him	1
something	1
in	1
military	1
matters.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
monotonous	1
sound	1
of	1
Weyrother's	1
voice	1
ceased,	1
Kutuzov	1
opened	1
his	1
eye	1
as	1
a	1
miller	1
wakes	1
up	1
when	1
the	1
soporific	1
drone	1
of	1
the	1
mill	1
wheel	1
is	1
interrupted.	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
Langeron	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
remarking,	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
at	1
that	1
silly	1
business!"	1
quickly	1
closed	1
his	1
eye	1
again,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
head	1
sink	1
still	1
lower.	1
	1
Langeron,	1
trying	1
as	1
virulently	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
sting	1
Weyrother's	1
vanity	1
as	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
plan,	1
argued	1
that	1
Bonaparte	1
might	1
easily	1
attack	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
attacked,	1
and	1
so	1
render	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
plan	1
perfectly	1
worthless.	1
Weyrother	1
met	1
all	1
objections	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
smile,	1
evidently	1
prepared	1
beforehand	1
to	1
meet	1
all	1
objections	1
be	1
they	1
what	1
they	1
might.	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
could	1
attack	1
us,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
today,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
powerless?"	1
said	1
Langeron.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
forty	1
thousand	1
men	1
at	1
most,"	1
replied	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
doctor	1
to	1
whom	1
an	1
old	1
wife	1
wishes	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
treatment	1
of	1
a	1
case.	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
he	1
is	1
inviting	1
his	1
doom	1
by	1
awaiting	1
our	1
attack,"	1
said	1
Langeron,	1
with	1
a	1
subtly	1
ironical	1
smile,	1
again	1
glancing	1
round	1
for	1
support	1
to	1
Miloradovich	1
who	1
was	1
near	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
Miloradovich	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
evidently	1
thinking	1
of	1
anything	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
generals	1
were	1
disputing	1
about.	1
	1
"Ma	1
foi!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"tomorrow	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield."	1
	1
Weyrother	1
again	1
gave	1
that	1
smile	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
and	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
meet	1
objections	1
from	1
Russian	1
generals	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
them	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
convinced	1
himself	1
of,	1
but	1
had	1
also	1
convinced	1
the	1
sovereign	1
Emperors	1
of.	1
	1
"The	1
enemy	1
has	1
quenched	1
his	1
fires	1
and	1
a	1
continual	1
noise	1
is	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
camp,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"What	1
does	1
that	1
mean?	1
Either	1
he	1
is	1
retreating,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
we	1
need	1
fear,	1
or	1
he	1
is	1
changing	1
his	1
position."	1
(He	1
smiled	1
ironically.)	1
"But	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
also	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
Thuerassa,	1
he	1
merely	1
saves	1
us	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
arrangements	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
detail	1
remain	1
the	1
same."	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
that?..."	1
began	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
for	1
long	1
been	1
waiting	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
doubts.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
here	1
woke	1
up,	1
coughed	1
heavily,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
generals.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
the	1
dispositions	1
for	1
tomorrow--or	1
rather	1
for	1
today,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
past	1
midnight--cannot	1
now	1
be	1
altered,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
have	1
heard	1
them,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
do	1
our	1
duty.	1
But	1
before	1
a	1
battle,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
important..."	1
he	1
paused,	1
"than	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
sleep."	1
	1
He	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
rise.	1
The	1
generals	1
bowed	1
and	1
retired.	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
midnight.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
The	1
council	1
of	1
war,	1
at	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
opinion	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
to,	1
left	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
vague	1
and	1
uneasy	1
impression.	1
Whether	1
Dolgorukov	1
and	1
Weyrother,	1
or	1
Kutuzov,	1
Langeron,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
attack,	1
were	1
right--he	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
"But	1
was	1
it	1
really	1
not	1
possible	1
for	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
state	1
his	1
views	1
plainly	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor?	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
court	1
and	1
personal	1
considerations	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
lives,	1
and	1
my	1
life,	1
my	1
life,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"must	1
be	1
risked?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
likely	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
killed	1
tomorrow,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
at	1
this	1
thought	1
of	1
death,	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
most	1
distant,	1
most	1
intimate,	1
memories	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
imagination:	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
last	1
parting	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
wife;	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
loved	1
her.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
pregnancy	1
and	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
nervously	1
emotional	1
and	1
softened	1
mood	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
billeted	1
with	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
foggy	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
fog	1
the	1
moonlight	1
gleamed	1
mysteriously.	1
"Yes,	1
tomorrow,	1
tomorrow!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Tomorrow	1
everything	1
may	1
be	1
over	1
for	1
me!	1
All	1
these	1
memories	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
more,	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
have	1
any	1
meaning	1
for	1
me.	1
Tomorrow	1
perhaps,	1
even	1
certainly,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
presentiment	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
show	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
do."	1
And	1
his	1
fancy	1
pictured	1
the	1
battle,	1
its	1
loss,	1
the	1
concentration	1
of	1
fighting	1
at	1
one	1
point,	1
and	1
the	1
hesitation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
commanders.	1
And	1
then	1
that	1
happy	1
moment,	1
that	1
Toulon	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
waited,	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
last.	1
He	1
firmly	1
and	1
clearly	1
expresses	1
his	1
opinion	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
to	1
Weyrother,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Emperors.	1
All	1
are	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
justness	1
of	1
his	1
views,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
undertakes	1
to	1
carry	1
them	1
out,	1
so	1
he	1
takes	1
a	1
regiment,	1
a	1
division-stipulates	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
his	1
arrangements--leads	1
his	1
division	1
to	1
the	1
decisive	1
point,	1
and	1
gains	1
the	1
victory	1
alone.	1
"But	1
death	1
and	1
suffering?"	1
suggested	1
another	1
voice.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
that	1
voice	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
dreaming	1
of	1
his	1
triumphs.	1
The	1
dispositions	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
battle	1
are	1
planned	1
by	1
him	1
alone.	1
Nominally	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
an	1
adjutant	1
on	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff,	1
but	1
he	1
does	1
everything	1
alone.	1
The	1
next	1
battle	1
is	1
won	1
by	1
him	1
alone.	1
Kutuzov	1
is	1
removed	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
appointed...	1
"Well	1
and	1
then?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other	1
voice.	1
"If	1
before	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
ten	1
times	1
wounded,	1
killed,	1
or	1
betrayed,	1
well...	1
what	1
then?..."	1
"Well	1
then,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
answered	1
himself,	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
and	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
can't,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
want	1
this--want	1
glory,	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
men,	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
by	1
them,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
it	1
and	1
want	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
and	1
live	1
only	1
for	1
that.	1
Yes,	1
for	1
that	1
alone!	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
tell	1
anyone,	1
but,	1
oh	1
God!	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
I	1
love	1
nothing	1
but	1
fame	1
and	1
men's	1
esteem?	1
Death,	1
wounds,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
family--I	1
fear	1
nothing.	1
And	1
precious	1
and	1
dear	1
as	1
many	1
persons	1
are	1
to	1
me--father,	1
sister,	1
wife--those	1
dearest	1
to	1
me--yet	1
dreadful	1
and	1
unnatural	1
as	1
it	1
seems,	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
glory,	1
of	1
triumph	1
over	1
men,	1
of	1
love	1
from	1
men	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
and	1
never	1
shall	1
know,	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
here,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
voices	1
in	1
Kutuzov's	1
courtyard.	1
The	1
voices	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
orderlies	1
who	1
were	1
packing	1
up;	1
one	1
voice,	1
probably	1
a	1
coachman's,	1
was	1
teasing	1
Kutuzov's	1
old	1
cook	1
whom	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Tit.	1
He	1
was	1
saying,	1
"Tit,	1
I	1
say,	1
Tit!"	1
	1
"Well?"	1
returned	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
	1
"Go,	1
Tit,	1
thresh	1
a	1
bit!"	1
said	1
the	1
wag.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
devil!"	1
called	1
out	1
a	1
voice,	1
drowned	1
by	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
orderlies	1
and	1
servants.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
value	1
nothing	1
but	1
triumph	1
over	1
them	1
all,	1
I	1
value	1
this	1
mystic	1
power	1
and	1
glory	1
that	1
is	1
floating	1
here	1
above	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
mist!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
That	1
same	1
night,	1
Rostov	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
platoon	1
on	1
skirmishing	1
duty	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Bagration's	1
detachment.	1
His	1
hussars	1
were	1
placed	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
in	1
couples	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
rode	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
trying	1
to	1
master	1
the	1
sleepiness	1
that	1
kept	1
coming	1
over	1
him.	1
An	1
enormous	1
space,	1
with	1
our	1
army's	1
campfires	1
dimly	1
glowing	1
in	1
the	1
fog,	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
behind	1
him;	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
misty	1
darkness.	1
Rostov	1
could	1
see	1
nothing,	1
peer	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
into	1
that	1
foggy	1
distance:	1
now	1
something	1
gleamed	1
gray,	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
black,	1
now	1
little	1
lights	1
seemed	1
to	1
glimmer	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
now	1
he	1
fancied	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
His	1
eyes	1
kept	1
closing,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
fancy	1
appeared--now	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
now	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
now	1
Moscow	1
memories--and	1
he	1
again	1
hurriedly	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
close	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
he	1
was	1
riding,	1
and	1
sometimes,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
within	1
six	1
paces	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
black	1
figures	1
of	1
hussars,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
misty	1
darkness.	1
"Why	1
not?...	1
It	1
might	1
easily	1
happen,"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
"that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
will	1
meet	1
me	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
an	1
order	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
officer;	1
he'll	1
say:	1
'Go	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
what's	1
there.'	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
stories	1
of	1
his	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
chance	1
way	1
and	1
attaching	1
him	1
to	1
himself!	1
What	1
if	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
place	1
near	1
him?	1
Oh,	1
how	1
I	1
would	1
guard	1
him,	1
how	1
I	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
the	1
truth,	1
how	1
I	1
would	1
unmask	1
his	1
deceivers!"	1
And	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
realize	1
vividly	1
his	1
love	1
devotion	1
to	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
Rostov	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
an	1
enemy	1
or	1
a	1
deceitful	1
German,	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
kill	1
with	1
pleasure	1
but	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
slap	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
distant	1
shout	1
aroused	1
him.	1
He	1
started	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Where	1
am	1
I?	1
Oh	1
yes,	1
in	1
the	1
skirmishing	1
line...	1
pass	1
and	1
watchword--	1
shaft,	1
Olmutz.	1
What	1
a	1
nuisance	1
that	1
our	1
squadron	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
reserve	1
tomorrow,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"I'll	1
ask	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
my	1
only	1
chance	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
It	1
won't	1
be	1
long	1
now	1
before	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
duty.	1
I'll	1
take	1
another	1
turn	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
get	1
back	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
ask	1
him."	1
He	1
readjusted	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
and	1
touched	1
up	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
ride	1
once	1
more	1
round	1
his	1
hussars.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
lighter.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
sloping	1
descent	1
lit	1
up,	1
and	1
facing	1
it	1
a	1
black	1
knoll	1
that	1
seemed	1
as	1
steep	1
as	1
a	1
wall.	1
On	1
this	1
knoll	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
patch	1
that	1
Rostov	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
make	1
out:	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
glade	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
moon,	1
or	1
some	1
unmelted	1
snow,	1
or	1
some	1
white	1
houses?	1
He	1
even	1
thought	1
something	1
moved	1
on	1
that	1
white	1
spot.	1
"I	1
expect	1
it's	1
snow...	1
that	1
spot...	1
a	1
spot--une	1
tache,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"There	1
now...	1
it's	1
not	1
a	1
tache...	1
Natasha...	1
sister,	1
black	1
eyes...	1
Na...	1
tasha...	1
(Won't	1
she	1
be	1
surprised	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
how	1
I've	1
seen	1
the	1
Emperor?)	1
Natasha...	1
take	1
my	1
sabretache..."--"Keep	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
your	1
honor,	1
there	1
are	1
bushes	1
here,"	1
came	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
an	1
hussar,	1
past	1
whom	1
Rostov	1
was	1
riding	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
falling	1
asleep.	1
Rostov	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
had	1
sunk	1
almost	1
to	1
his	1
horse's	1
mane	1
and	1
pulled	1
up	1
beside	1
the	1
hussar.	1
He	1
was	1
succumbing	1
to	1
irresistible,	1
youthful,	1
childish	1
drowsiness.	1
"But	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
thinking?	1
I	1
mustn't	1
forget.	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor?	1
No,	1
that's	1
not	1
it--that's	1
tomorrow.	1
Oh	1
yes!	1
Natasha...	1
sabretache...	1
saber	1
them...	1
Whom?	1
The	1
hussars...	1
Ah,	1
the	1
hussars	1
with	1
mustaches.	1
Along	1
the	1
Tverskaya	1
Street	1
rode	1
the	1
hussar	1
with	1
mustaches...	1
I	1
thought	1
about	1
him	1
too,	1
just	1
opposite	1
Guryev's	1
house...	1
Old	1
Guryev....	1
Oh,	1
but	1
Denisov's	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow.	1
But	1
that's	1
all	1
nonsense.	1
The	1
chief	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
is	1
here.	1
How	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
dared	1
not....	1
No,	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
who	1
dared	1
not.	1
But	1
that's	1
nonsense,	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
important	1
thing	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of.	1
Yes,	1
Na-tasha,	1
sabretache,	1
oh,	1
yes,	1
yes!	1
That's	1
right!"	1
And	1
his	1
head	1
once	1
more	1
sank	1
to	1
his	1
horse's	1
neck.	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
fired	1
at.	1
"What?	1
What?	1
What?...	1
Cut	1
them	1
down!	1
What?..."	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
waking	1
up.	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
heard	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
was,	1
the	1
long-drawn	1
shouts	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
voices.	1
His	1
horse	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
hussar	1
near	1
him	1
pricked	1
their	1
ears	1
at	1
these	1
shouts.	1
Over	1
there,	1
where	1
the	1
shouting	1
came	1
from,	1
a	1
fire	1
flared	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
again,	1
then	1
another,	1
and	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
French	1
line	1
on	1
the	1
hill	1
fires	1
flared	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
grew	1
louder	1
and	1
louder.	1
Rostov	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
French	1
words	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
them.	1
The	1
din	1
of	1
many	1
voices	1
was	1
too	1
great;	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
was:	1
"ahahah!"	1
and	1
"rrrr!"	1
	1
"What's	1
that?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
it?"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
beside	1
him.	1
"That	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
enemy's	1
camp!"	1
	1
The	1
hussar	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"Why,	1
don't	1
you	1
hear	1
it?"	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
again,	1
after	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply.	1
	1
"Who	1
can	1
tell,	1
your	1
honor?"	1
replied	1
the	1
hussar	1
reluctantly.	1
	1
"From	1
the	1
direction,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
enemy,"	1
repeated	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
he	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
nothing,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
hussar.	1
"It's	1
dark...	1
Steady!"	1
he	1
cried	1
to	1
his	1
fidgeting	1
horse.	1
	1
Rostov's	1
horse	1
was	1
also	1
getting	1
restive:	1
it	1
pawed	1
the	1
frozen	1
ground,	1
pricking	1
its	1
ears	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
lights.	1
The	1
shouting	1
grew	1
still	1
louder	1
and	1
merged	1
into	1
a	1
general	1
roar	1
that	1
only	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
several	1
thousand	1
men	1
could	1
produce.	1
The	1
lights	1
spread	1
farther	1
and	1
farther,	1
probably	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
camp.	1
Rostov	1
no	1
longer	1
wanted	1
to	1
sleep.	1
The	1
gay	1
triumphant	1
shouting	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
army	1
had	1
a	1
stimulating	1
effect	1
on	1
him.	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!	1
L'Empereur!"	1
he	1
now	1
heard	1
distinctly.	1
	1
"They	1
can't	1
be	1
far	1
off,	1
probably	1
just	1
beyond	1
the	1
stream,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
hussar	1
only	1
sighed	1
without	1
replying	1
and	1
coughed	1
angrily.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
horse's	1
hoofs	1
approaching	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
hussars	1
was	1
heard,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
foggy	1
darkness	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
sergeant	1
of	1
hussars	1
suddenly	1
appeared,	1
looming	1
huge	1
as	1
an	1
elephant.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
the	1
generals!"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant,	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
still	1
looking	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
fires	1
and	1
the	1
shouts,	1
rode	1
with	1
the	1
sergeant	1
to	1
meet	1
some	1
mounted	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
riding	1
along	1
the	1
line.	1
One	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
horse.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
and	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
with	1
their	1
adjutants	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
curious	1
phenomenon	1
of	1
the	1
lights	1
and	1
shouts	1
in	1
the	1
enemy's	1
camp.	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Bagration,	1
reported	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
joined	1
the	1
adjutants	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
generals	1
were	1
saying.	1
	1
"Believe	1
me,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov,	1
addressing	1
Bagration,	1
"it	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
trick!	1
He	1
has	1
retreated	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
rearguard	1
to	1
kindle	1
fires	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
to	1
deceive	1
us."	1
	1
"Hardly,"	1
said	1
Bagration.	1
"I	1
saw	1
them	1
this	1
evening	1
on	1
that	1
knoll;	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
retreated	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
that	1
too....	1
Officer!"	1
said	1
Bagration	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
"are	1
the	1
enemy's	1
skirmishers	1
still	1
there?"	1
	1
"They	1
were	1
there	1
this	1
evening,	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
hussars	1
to	1
see?"	1
replied	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Bagration	1
stopped	1
and,	1
before	1
replying,	1
tried	1
to	1
see	1
Rostov's	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
mist.	1
	1
"Well,	1
go	1
and	1
see,"	1
he	1
said,	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
Rostov	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse,	1
called	1
to	1
Sergeant	1
Fedchenko	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
hussars,	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
and	1
trotted	1
downhill	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
shouting	1
came.	1
He	1
felt	1
both	1
frightened	1
and	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
riding	1
alone	1
with	1
three	1
hussars	1
into	1
that	1
mysterious	1
and	1
dangerous	1
misty	1
distance	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
him.	1
Bagration	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
beyond	1
the	1
stream,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
but	1
rode	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
continually	1
mistaking	1
bushes	1
for	1
trees	1
and	1
gullies	1
for	1
men	1
and	1
continually	1
discovering	1
his	1
mistakes.	1
Having	1
descended	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
a	1
trot,	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
saw	1
either	1
our	1
own	1
or	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fires,	1
but	1
heard	1
the	1
shouting	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
more	1
loudly	1
and	1
distinctly.	1
In	1
the	1
valley	1
he	1
saw	1
before	1
him	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
river,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
it	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
road.	1
Having	1
come	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse,	1
hesitating	1
whether	1
to	1
ride	1
along	1
it	1
or	1
cross	1
it	1
and	1
ride	1
over	1
the	1
black	1
field	1
up	1
the	1
hillside.	1
To	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
which	1
gleamed	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
safer	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easier	1
to	1
see	1
people	1
coming	1
along	1
it.	1
"Follow	1
me!"	1
said	1
he,	1
crossed	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
began	1
riding	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
toward	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
French	1
pickets	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
that	1
evening.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
there	1
he	1
is!"	1
cried	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hussars	1
behind	1
him.	1
And	1
before	1
Rostov	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
black	1
thing	1
was	1
that	1
had	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
fog,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
flash,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
report,	1
and	1
a	1
bullet	1
whizzing	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
with	1
a	1
plaintive	1
sound	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
hearing.	1
Another	1
musket	1
missed	1
fire	1
but	1
flashed	1
in	1
the	1
pan.	1
Rostov	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
back.	1
Four	1
more	1
reports	1
followed	1
at	1
intervals,	1
and	1
the	1
bullets	1
passed	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
fog	1
singing	1
in	1
different	1
tones.	1
Rostov	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse,	1
whose	1
spirits	1
had	1
risen,	1
like	1
his	1
own,	1
at	1
the	1
firing,	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
at	1
a	1
footpace.	1
"Well,	1
some	1
more!	1
Some	1
more!"	1
a	1
merry	1
voice	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
But	1
no	1
more	1
shots	1
came.	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
approaching	1
Bagration	1
did	1
Rostov	1
let	1
his	1
horse	1
gallop	1
again,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
salute	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
general.	1
	1
Dolgorukov	1
was	1
still	1
insisting	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
retreated	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
lit	1
fires	1
to	1
deceive	1
us.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
that	1
prove?"	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
as	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
up.	1
"They	1
might	1
retreat	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
pickets."	1
	1
"It's	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
all	1
gone	1
yet,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Bagration.	1
"Wait	1
till	1
tomorrow	1
morning,	1
we'll	1
find	1
out	1
everything	1
tomorrow."	1
	1
"The	1
picket	1
is	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
hill,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
just	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
evening,"	1
reported	1
Rostov,	1
stooping	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
salute	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
repress	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
induced	1
by	1
his	1
ride	1
and	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
bullets.	1
	1
"Very	1
good,	1
very	1
good,"	1
said	1
Bagration.	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
officer."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"may	1
I	1
ask	1
a	1
favor?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Tomorrow	1
our	1
squadron	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
reserve.	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
to	1
be	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
squadron?"	1
	1
"What's	1
your	1
name?"	1
	1
"Count	1
Rostov."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
very	1
well,	1
you	1
may	1
stay	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
me."	1
	1
"Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov's	1
son?"	1
asked	1
Dolgorukov.	1
	1
But	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
may	1
reckon	1
on	1
it,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
order."	1
	1
"Tomorrow	1
very	1
likely	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
sent	1
with	1
some	1
message	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
	1
The	1
fires	1
and	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
enemy's	1
army	1
were	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
while	1
Napoleon's	1
proclamation	1
was	1
being	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
troops	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself	1
rode	1
round	1
his	1
bivouacs.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
on	1
seeing	1
him,	1
lit	1
wisps	1
of	1
straw	1
and	1
ran	1
after	1
him,	1
shouting,	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
Napoleon's	1
proclamation	1
was	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
Soldiers!	1
The	1
Russian	1
army	1
is	1
advancing	1
against	1
you	1
to	1
avenge	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army	1
of	1
Ulm.	1
They	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
battalions	1
you	1
broke	1
at	1
Hollabrunn	1
and	1
have	1
pursued	1
ever	1
since	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
The	1
position	1
we	1
occupy	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
one,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
marching	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
they	1
will	1
expose	1
a	1
flank	1
to	1
me.	1
Soldiers!	1
I	1
will	1
myself	1
direct	1
your	1
battalions.	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
fire	1
if	1
you	1
with	1
your	1
habitual	1
valor	1
carry	1
disorder	1
and	1
confusion	1
into	1
the	1
enemy's	1
ranks,	1
but	1
should	1
victory	1
be	1
in	1
doubt,	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
your	1
Emperor	1
exposing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
blows	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
for	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
victory,	1
especially	1
on	1
this	1
day	1
when	1
what	1
is	1
at	1
stake	1
is	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
infantry,	1
so	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
our	1
nation.	1
	1
Do	1
not	1
break	1
your	1
ranks	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
of	1
removing	1
the	1
wounded!	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
fully	1
imbued	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
defeat	1
these	1
hirelings	1
of	1
England,	1
inspired	1
by	1
such	1
hatred	1
of	1
our	1
nation!	1
This	1
victory	1
will	1
conclude	1
our	1
campaign	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
return	1
to	1
winter	1
quarters,	1
where	1
fresh	1
French	1
troops	1
who	1
are	1
being	1
raised	1
in	1
France	1
will	1
join	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
I	1
shall	1
conclude	1
will	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
of	1
myself.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
At	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
dark.	1
The	1
troops	1
of	1
the	1
center,	1
the	1
reserves,	1
and	1
Bagration's	1
right	1
flank	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
moved,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
the	1
columns	1
of	1
infantry,	1
cavalry,	1
and	1
artillery,	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
descend	1
the	1
heights	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
right	1
flank	1
and	1
drive	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
Bohemian	1
mountains	1
according	1
to	1
plan,	1
were	1
already	1
up	1
and	1
astir.	1
The	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
campfires,	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
throwing	1
everything	1
superfluous,	1
made	1
the	1
eyes	1
smart.	1
It	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
dark.	1
The	1
officers	1
were	1
hurriedly	1
drinking	1
tea	1
and	1
breakfasting,	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
munching	1
biscuit	1
and	1
beating	1
a	1
tattoo	1
with	1
their	1
feet	1
to	1
warm	1
themselves,	1
gathering	1
round	1
the	1
fires	1
throwing	1
into	1
the	1
flames	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
sheds,	1
chairs,	1
tables,	1
wheels,	1
tubs,	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
or	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
away	1
with	1
them.	1
Austrian	1
column	1
guides	1
were	1
moving	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
and	1
served	1
as	1
heralds	1
of	1
the	1
advance.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
an	1
Austrian	1
officer	1
showed	1
himself	1
near	1
a	1
commanding	1
officer's	1
quarters,	1
the	1
regiment	1
began	1
to	1
move:	1
the	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
fires,	1
thrust	1
their	1
pipes	1
into	1
their	1
boots,	1
their	1
bags	1
into	1
the	1
carts,	1
got	1
their	1
muskets	1
ready,	1
and	1
formed	1
rank.	1
The	1
officers	1
buttoned	1
up	1
their	1
coats,	1
buckled	1
on	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
pouches,	1
and	1
moved	1
along	1
the	1
ranks	1
shouting.	1
The	1
train	1
drivers	1
and	1
orderlies	1
harnessed	1
and	1
packed	1
the	1
wagons	1
and	1
tied	1
on	1
the	1
loads.	1
The	1
adjutants	1
and	1
battalion	1
and	1
regimental	1
commanders	1
mounted,	1
crossed	1
themselves,	1
gave	1
final	1
instructions,	1
orders,	1
and	1
commissions	1
to	1
the	1
baggage	1
men	1
who	1
remained	1
behind,	1
and	1
the	1
monotonous	1
tramp	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
feet	1
resounded.	1
The	1
column	1
moved	1
forward	1
without	1
knowing	1
where	1
and	1
unable,	1
from	1
the	1
masses	1
around	1
them,	1
the	1
smoke	1
and	1
the	1
increasing	1
fog,	1
to	1
see	1
either	1
the	1
place	1
they	1
were	1
leaving	1
or	1
that	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
going.	1
	1
A	1
soldier	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
is	1
hemmed	1
in	1
and	1
borne	1
along	1
by	1
his	1
regiment	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
sailor	1
is	1
by	1
his	1
ship.	1
However	1
far	1
he	1
has	1
walked,	1
whatever	1
strange,	1
unknown,	1
and	1
dangerous	1
places	1
he	1
reaches,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
sailor	1
is	1
always	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
decks,	1
masts,	1
and	1
rigging	1
of	1
his	1
ship,	1
so	1
the	1
soldier	1
always	1
has	1
around	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
comrades,	1
the	1
same	1
ranks,	1
the	1
same	1
sergeant	1
major	1
Ivan	1
Mitrich,	1
the	1
same	1
company	1
dog	1
Jack,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
commanders.	1
The	1
sailor	1
rarely	1
cares	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
latitude	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
ship	1
is	1
sailing,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle--heaven	1
knows	1
how	1
and	1
whence--a	1
stern	1
note	1
of	1
which	1
all	1
are	1
conscious	1
sounds	1
in	1
the	1
moral	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
an	1
army,	1
announcing	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
something	1
decisive	1
and	1
solemn,	1
and	1
awakening	1
in	1
the	1
men	1
an	1
unusual	1
curiosity.	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle	1
the	1
soldiers	1
excitedly	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
beyond	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
their	1
regiment,	1
they	1
listen	1
intently,	1
look	1
about,	1
and	1
eagerly	1
ask	1
concerning	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
fog	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
dense	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
growing	1
light	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
ten	1
paces	1
ahead.	1
Bushes	1
looked	1
like	1
gigantic	1
trees	1
and	1
level	1
ground	1
like	1
cliffs	1
and	1
slopes.	1
Anywhere,	1
on	1
any	1
side,	1
one	1
might	1
encounter	1
an	1
enemy	1
invisible	1
ten	1
paces	1
off.	1
But	1
the	1
columns	1
advanced	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
fog,	1
descending	1
and	1
ascending	1
hills,	1
avoiding	1
gardens	1
and	1
enclosures,	1
going	1
over	1
new	1
and	1
unknown	1
ground,	1
and	1
nowhere	1
encountering	1
the	1
enemy.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
in	1
front,	1
behind,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
other	1
Russian	1
columns	1
were	1
moving	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction.	1
Every	1
soldier	1
felt	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
unknown	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
our	1
men	1
were	1
going	1
too.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
the	1
Kurskies	1
have	1
also	1
gone	1
past,"	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
ranks.	1
	1
"It's	1
wonderful	1
what	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
have	1
gathered,	1
lads!	1
Last	1
night	1
I	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
campfires	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
them.	1
A	1
regular	1
Moscow!"	1
	1
Though	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
column	1
commanders	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
or	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
(the	1
commanders,	1
as	1
we	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war,	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
exert	1
themselves	1
to	1
cheer	1
the	1
men	1
but	1
merely	1
carried	1
out	1
the	1
orders),	1
yet	1
the	1
troops	1
marched	1
gaily,	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
do	1
when	1
going	1
into	1
action,	1
especially	1
to	1
an	1
attack.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
marched	1
for	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
the	1
dense	1
fog,	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
to	1
halt	1
and	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
consciousness	1
of	1
some	1
dislocation	1
and	1
blunder	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
ranks.	1
How	1
such	1
a	1
consciousness	1
is	1
communicated	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
define,	1
but	1
it	1
certainly	1
is	1
communicated	1
very	1
surely,	1
and	1
flows	1
rapidly,	1
imperceptibly,	1
and	1
irrepressibly,	1
as	1
water	1
does	1
in	1
a	1
creek.	1
Had	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
been	1
alone	1
without	1
any	1
allies,	1
it	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
this	1
consciousness	1
of	1
mismanagement	1
became	1
a	1
general	1
conviction,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
the	1
disorder	1
was	1
readily	1
and	1
naturally	1
attributed	1
to	1
the	1
stupid	1
Germans,	1
and	1
everyone	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
a	1
dangerous	1
muddle	1
had	1
been	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
sausage	1
eaters.	1
	1
"Why	1
have	1
we	1
stopped?	1
Is	1
the	1
way	1
blocked?	1
Or	1
have	1
we	1
already	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
French?"	1
	1
"No,	1
one	1
can't	1
hear	1
them.	1
They'd	1
be	1
firing	1
if	1
we	1
had."	1
	1
"They	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
enough	1
to	1
start	1
us,	1
and	1
now	1
here	1
we	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
field	1
without	1
rhyme	1
or	1
reason.	1
It's	1
all	1
those	1
damned	1
Germans'	1
muddling!	1
What	1
stupid	1
devils!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I'd	1
send	1
them	1
on	1
in	1
front,	1
but	1
no	1
fear,	1
they're	1
crowding	1
up	1
behind.	1
And	1
now	1
here	1
we	1
stand	1
hungry."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
shall	1
we	1
soon	1
be	1
clear?	1
They	1
say	1
the	1
cavalry	1
are	1
blocking	1
the	1
way,"	1
said	1
an	1
officer.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
those	1
damned	1
Germans!	1
They	1
don't	1
know	1
their	1
own	1
country!"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
"What	1
division	1
are	1
you?"	1
shouted	1
an	1
adjutant,	1
riding	1
up.	1
	1
"The	1
Eighteenth."	1
	1
"Then	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
here?	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
long	1
ago,	1
now	1
you	1
won't	1
get	1
there	1
till	1
evening."	1
	1
"What	1
stupid	1
orders!	1
They	1
don't	1
themselves	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
doing!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
rode	1
off.	1
	1
Then	1
a	1
general	1
rode	1
past	1
shouting	1
something	1
angrily,	1
not	1
in	1
Russian.	1
	1
"Tafa-lafa!	1
But	1
what	1
he's	1
jabbering	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
make	1
out,"	1
said	1
a	1
soldier,	1
mimicking	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
away.	1
"I'd	1
shoot	1
them,	1
the	1
scoundrels!"	1
	1
"We	1
were	1
ordered	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
before	1
nine,	1
but	1
we	1
haven't	1
got	1
halfway.	1
Fine	1
orders!"	1
was	1
being	1
repeated	1
on	1
different	1
sides.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
energy	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
had	1
started	1
began	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
vexation	1
and	1
anger	1
at	1
the	1
stupid	1
arrangements	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
Germans.	1
	1
The	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
confusion	1
was	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
Austrian	1
cavalry	1
was	1
moving	1
toward	1
our	1
left	1
flank,	1
the	1
higher	1
command	1
found	1
that	1
our	1
center	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
separated	1
from	1
our	1
right	1
flank	1
and	1
the	1
cavalry	1
were	1
all	1
ordered	1
to	1
turn	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
Several	1
thousand	1
cavalry	1
crossed	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
infantry,	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
wait.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
front	1
an	1
altercation	1
occurred	1
between	1
an	1
Austrian	1
guide	1
and	1
a	1
Russian	1
general.	1
The	1
general	1
shouted	1
a	1
demand	1
that	1
the	1
cavalry	1
should	1
be	1
halted,	1
the	1
Austrian	1
argued	1
that	1
not	1
he,	1
but	1
the	1
higher	1
command,	1
was	1
to	1
blame.	1
The	1
troops	1
meanwhile	1
stood	1
growing	1
listless	1
and	1
dispirited.	1
After	1
an	1
hour's	1
delay	1
they	1
at	1
last	1
moved	1
on,	1
descending	1
the	1
hill.	1
The	1
fog	1
that	1
was	1
dispersing	1
on	1
the	1
hill	1
lay	1
still	1
more	1
densely	1
below,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
descending.	1
In	1
front	1
in	1
the	1
fog	1
a	1
shot	1
was	1
heard	1
and	1
then	1
another,	1
at	1
first	1
irregularly	1
at	1
varying	1
intervals--trata...	1
tat--and	1
then	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
regularly	1
and	1
rapidly,	1
and	1
the	1
action	1
at	1
the	1
Goldbach	1
Stream	1
began.	1
	1
Not	1
expecting	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
enemy	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
stream,	1
and	1
having	1
stumbled	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fog,	1
hearing	1
no	1
encouraging	1
word	1
from	1
their	1
commanders,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
late	1
spreading	1
through	1
the	1
ranks,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
anything	1
in	1
front	1
or	1
around	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
fog,	1
the	1
Russians	1
exchanged	1
shots	1
with	1
the	1
enemy	1
lazily	1
and	1
advanced	1
and	1
again	1
halted,	1
receiving	1
no	1
timely	1
orders	1
from	1
the	1
officers	1
or	1
adjutants	1
who	1
wandered	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
fog	1
in	1
those	1
unknown	1
surroundings	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
their	1
own	1
regiments.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
action	1
began	1
for	1
the	1
first,	1
second,	1
and	1
third	1
columns,	1
which	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley.	1
The	1
fourth	1
column,	1
with	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
was,	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights.	1
	1
Below,	1
where	1
the	1
fight	1
was	1
beginning,	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
thick	1
fog;	1
on	1
the	1
higher	1
ground	1
it	1
was	1
clearing,	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
front.	1
Whether	1
all	1
the	1
enemy	1
forces	1
were,	1
as	1
we	1
supposed,	1
six	1
miles	1
away,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
near	1
by	1
in	1
that	1
sea	1
of	1
mist,	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
till	1
after	1
eight	1
o'clock.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
The	1
fog	1
lay	1
unbroken	1
like	1
a	1
sea	1
down	1
below,	1
but	1
higher	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Schlappanitz	1
where	1
Napoleon	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
marshals	1
around	1
him,	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
light.	1
Above	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
clear	1
blue	1
sky,	1
and	1
the	1
sun's	1
vast	1
orb	1
quivered	1
like	1
a	1
huge	1
hollow,	1
crimson	1
float	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
that	1
milky	1
sea	1
of	1
mist.	1
The	1
whole	1
French	1
army,	1
and	1
even	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
staff,	1
were	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
streams	1
and	1
hollows	1
of	1
Sokolnitz	1
and	1
Schlappanitz	1
beyond	1
which	1
we	1
intended	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
our	1
position	1
and	1
begin	1
the	1
action,	1
but	1
were	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
forces	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
eye	1
could	1
distinguish	1
a	1
mounted	1
man	1
from	1
one	1
on	1
foot.	1
Napoleon,	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
cloak	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
worn	1
on	1
his	1
Italian	1
campaign,	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
small	1
gray	1
Arab	1
horse	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
marshals.	1
He	1
gazed	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
hills	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
rise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
mist	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
were	1
moving	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
Not	1
a	1
single	1
muscle	1
of	1
his	1
face--which	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
was	1
still	1
thin--moved.	1
His	1
gleaming	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
intently	1
on	1
one	1
spot.	1
His	1
predictions	1
were	1
being	1
justified.	1
Part	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
force	1
had	1
already	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
toward	1
the	1
ponds	1
and	1
lakes	1
and	1
part	1
were	1
leaving	1
these	1
Pratzen	1
Heights	1
which	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
the	1
position.	1
He	1
saw	1
over	1
the	1
mist	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
between	1
two	1
hills	1
near	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Pratzen,	1
the	1
Russian	1
columns,	1
their	1
bayonets	1
glittering,	1
were	1
moving	1
continuously	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
toward	1
the	1
valley	1
and	1
disappearing	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
into	1
the	1
mist.	1
From	1
information	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
and	1
footsteps	1
heard	1
by	1
the	1
outposts	1
during	1
the	1
night,	1
by	1
the	1
disorderly	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
columns,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
indications,	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
the	1
allies	1
believed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
away	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
columns	1
moving	1
near	1
Pratzen	1
constituted	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
center	1
was	1
already	1
sufficiently	1
weakened	1
to	1
be	1
successfully	1
attacked.	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
the	1
engagement.	1
	1
Today	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
day	1
for	1
him--the	1
anniversary	1
of	1
his	1
coronation.	1
Before	1
dawn	1
he	1
had	1
slept	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours,	1
and	1
refreshed,	1
vigorous,	1
and	1
in	1
good	1
spirits,	1
he	1
mounted	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
in	1
that	1
happy	1
mood	1
in	1
which	1
everything	1
seems	1
possible	1
and	1
everything	1
succeeds.	1
He	1
sat	1
motionless,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
heights	1
visible	1
above	1
the	1
mist,	1
and	1
his	1
cold	1
face	1
wore	1
that	1
special	1
look	1
of	1
confident,	1
self-complacent	1
happiness	1
that	1
one	1
sees	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
happily	1
in	1
love.	1
The	1
marshals	1
stood	1
behind	1
him	1
not	1
venturing	1
to	1
distract	1
his	1
attention.	1
He	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights,	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
floating	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mist.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
entirely	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
fog,	1
and	1
fields	1
and	1
mist	1
were	1
aglow	1
with	1
dazzling	1
light--as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
awaited	1
this	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
action--he	1
drew	1
the	1
glove	1
from	1
his	1
shapely	1
white	1
hand,	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
marshals,	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
action	1
to	1
begin.	1
The	1
marshals,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
adjutants,	1
galloped	1
off	1
in	1
different	1
directions,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
chief	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
moved	1
rapidly	1
toward	1
those	1
Pratzen	1
Heights	1
which	1
were	1
being	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
denuded	1
by	1
Russian	1
troops	1
moving	1
down	1
the	1
valley	1
to	1
their	1
left.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
At	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
Kutuzov	1
rode	1
to	1
Pratzen	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
column,	1
Miloradovich's,	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Przebyszewski's	1
and	1
Langeron's	1
columns	1
which	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley.	1
He	1
greeted	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
regiment	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
march,	1
thereby	1
indicating	1
that	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
lead	1
that	1
column	1
himself.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Pratzen	1
he	1
halted.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
behind,	1
among	1
the	1
immense	1
number	1
forming	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
suite.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
suppressed	1
excitement	1
and	1
irritation,	1
though	1
controlledly	1
calm	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
a	1
long-awaited	1
moment.	1
He	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
Toulon,	1
or	1
his	1
bridge	1
of	1
Arcola.	1
How	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
about	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
sure	1
it	1
would	1
do	1
so.	1
The	1
locality	1
and	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
were	1
known	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
anyone	1
in	1
our	1
army.	1
His	1
own	1
strategic	1
plan,	1
which	1
obviously	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
carried	1
out,	1
was	1
forgotten.	1
Now,	1
entering	1
into	1
Weyrother's	1
plan,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
considered	1
possible	1
contingencies	1
and	1
formed	1
new	1
projects	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
call	1
for	1
his	1
rapidity	1
of	1
perception	1
and	1
decision.	1
	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
down	1
below	1
in	1
the	1
mist,	1
the	1
musketry	1
fire	1
of	1
unseen	1
forces	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
It	1
was	1
there	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
thought	1
the	1
fight	1
would	1
concentrate.	1
"There	1
we	1
shall	1
encounter	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
there,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
sent	1
with	1
a	1
brigade	1
or	1
division,	1
and	1
there,	1
standard	1
in	1
hand,	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
forward	1
and	1
break	1
whatever	1
is	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
calmly	1
at	1
the	1
standards	1
of	1
the	1
passing	1
battalions.	1
Seeing	1
them	1
he	1
kept	1
thinking,	1
"That	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
standard	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
lead	1
the	1
army."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
mist	1
on	1
the	1
heights	1
was	1
a	1
hoar	1
frost	1
now	1
turning	1
to	1
dew,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
valleys	1
it	1
still	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
milk-white	1
sea.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
into	1
which	1
our	1
troops	1
had	1
descended	1
and	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing.	1
Above	1
the	1
heights	1
was	1
the	1
dark	1
clear	1
sky,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
the	1
vast	1
orb	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
In	1
front,	1
far	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
farther	1
shore	1
of	1
that	1
sea	1
of	1
mist,	1
some	1
wooded	1
hills	1
were	1
discernible,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
enemy	1
probably	1
was,	1
for	1
something	1
could	1
be	1
descried.	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
the	1
Guards	1
were	1
entering	1
the	1
misty	1
region	1
with	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
wheels	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
bayonets;	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
beyond	1
the	1
village	1
similar	1
masses	1
of	1
cavalry	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
mist.	1
In	1
front	1
and	1
behind	1
moved	1
infantry.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
letting	1
the	1
troops	1
pass	1
by	1
him.	1
That	1
morning	1
Kutuzov	1
seemed	1
worn	1
and	1
irritable.	1
The	1
infantry	1
passing	1
before	1
him	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
without	1
any	1
command	1
being	1
given,	1
apparently	1
obstructed	1
by	1
something	1
in	1
front.	1
	1
"Do	1
order	1
them	1
to	1
form	1
into	1
battalion	1
columns	1
and	1
go	1
round	1
the	1
village!"	1
he	1
said	1
angrily	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
up.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
understand,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
defile	1
through	1
narrow	1
village	1
streets	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
marching	1
against	1
the	1
enemy?"	1
	1
"I	1
intended	1
to	1
re-form	1
them	1
beyond	1
the	1
village,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
answered	1
the	1
general.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
laughed	1
bitterly.	1
	1
"You'll	1
make	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
of	1
it,	1
deploying	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy!	1
Very	1
fine!"	1
	1
"The	1
enemy	1
is	1
still	1
far	1
away,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
dispositions..."	1
	1
"The	1
dispositions!"	1
exclaimed	1
Kutuzov	1
bitterly.	1
"Who	1
told	1
you	1
that?...	1
Kindly	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
ordered."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
Nesvitski	1
whispered	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"the	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
as	1
surly	1
as	1
a	1
dog."	1
	1
An	1
Austrian	1
officer	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform	1
with	1
green	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
asked	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
name	1
had	1
the	1
fourth	1
column	1
advanced	1
into	1
action.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
turned	1
round	1
without	1
answering	1
and	1
his	1
eye	1
happened	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
was	1
beside	1
him.	1
Seeing	1
him,	1
Kutuzov's	1
malevolent	1
and	1
caustic	1
expression	1
softened,	1
as	1
if	1
admitting	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
adjutant's	1
fault,	1
and	1
still	1
not	1
answering	1
the	1
Austrian	1
adjutant,	1
he	1
addressed	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Go,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
third	1
division	1
has	1
passed	1
the	1
village.	1
Tell	1
it	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
await	1
my	1
orders."	1
	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
started	1
than	1
he	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
ask	1
whether	1
sharpshooters	1
have	1
been	1
posted,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"What	1
are	1
they	1
doing?	1
What	1
are	1
they	1
doing?"	1
he	1
murmured	1
to	1
himself,	1
still	1
not	1
replying	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
galloped	1
off	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
order.	1
	1
Overtaking	1
the	1
battalions	1
that	1
continued	1
to	1
advance,	1
he	1
stopped	1
the	1
third	1
division	1
and	1
convinced	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
really	1
were	1
no	1
sharpshooters	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
our	1
columns.	1
The	1
colonel	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
much	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
order	1
to	1
throw	1
out	1
skirmishers.	1
He	1
had	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
sure	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
troops	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
six	1
miles	1
away.	1
There	1
was	1
really	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
front	1
except	1
a	1
barren	1
descent	1
hidden	1
by	1
dense	1
mist.	1
Having	1
given	1
orders	1
in	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
name	1
to	1
rectify	1
this	1
omission,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
galloped	1
back.	1
Kutuzov	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place,	1
his	1
stout	1
body	1
resting	1
heavily	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
with	1
the	1
lassitude	1
of	1
age,	1
sat	1
yawning	1
wearily	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes.	1
The	1
troops	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
moving,	1
but	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
butts	1
of	1
their	1
muskets	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
who,	1
watch	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
saying	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
they	1
started	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
left-flank	1
columns	1
had	1
already	1
descended.	1
	1
"Plenty	1
of	1
time,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
muttered	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
yawn.	1
"Plenty	1
of	1
time,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
behind	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
regiments	1
saluting,	1
and	1
this	1
sound	1
rapidly	1
came	1
nearer	1
along	1
the	1
whole	1
extended	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
advancing	1
Russian	1
columns.	1
Evidently	1
the	1
person	1
they	1
were	1
greeting	1
was	1
riding	1
quickly.	1
When	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
standing	1
began	1
to	1
shout,	1
he	1
rode	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
Along	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
Pratzen	1
galloped	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
squadron	1
of	1
horsemen	1
in	1
various	1
uniforms.	1
Two	1
of	1
them	1
rode	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
in	1
front,	1
at	1
full	1
gallop.	1
One	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
uniform	1
with	1
white	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
rode	1
a	1
bobtailed	1
chestnut	1
horse,	1
the	1
other	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform	1
rode	1
a	1
black	1
one.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
Emperors	1
followed	1
by	1
their	1
suites.	1
Kutuzov,	1
affecting	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
soldier	1
at	1
the	1
front,	1
gave	1
the	1
command	1
"Attention!"	1
and	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Emperors	1
with	1
a	1
salute.	1
His	1
whole	1
appearance	1
and	1
manner	1
were	1
suddenly	1
transformed.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
subordinate	1
who	1
obeys	1
without	1
reasoning.	1
With	1
an	1
affectation	1
of	1
respect	1
which	1
evidently	1
struck	1
Alexander	1
unpleasantly,	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
and	1
saluted.	1
	1
This	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
merely	1
flitted	1
over	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
happy	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
haze	1
across	1
a	1
clear	1
sky	1
and	1
vanished.	1
After	1
his	1
illness	1
he	1
looked	1
rather	1
thinner	1
that	1
day	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Olmutz	1
where	1
Bolkonski	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
abroad,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
bewitching	1
combination	1
of	1
majesty	1
and	1
mildness	1
in	1
his	1
fine	1
gray	1
eyes,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
delicate	1
lips	1
the	1
same	1
capacity	1
for	1
varying	1
expression	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
prevalent	1
appearance	1
of	1
goodhearted	1
innocent	1
youth.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
Olmutz	1
review	1
he	1
had	1
seemed	1
more	1
majestic;	1
here	1
he	1
seemed	1
brighter	1
and	1
more	1
energetic.	1
He	1
was	1
slightly	1
flushed	1
after	1
galloping	1
two	1
miles,	1
and	1
reining	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
sighed	1
restfully	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
his	1
suite,	1
young	1
and	1
animated	1
as	1
his	1
own.	1
Czartoryski,	1
Novosiltsev,	1
Prince	1
Volkonsky,	1
Strogonov,	1
and	1
the	1
others,	1
all	1
richly	1
dressed	1
gay	1
young	1
men	1
on	1
splendid,	1
well-groomed,	1
fresh,	1
only	1
slightly	1
heated	1
horses,	1
exchanging	1
remarks	1
and	1
smiling,	1
had	1
stopped	1
behind	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
Francis,	1
a	1
rosy,	1
long	1
faced	1
young	1
man,	1
sat	1
very	1
erect	1
on	1
his	1
handsome	1
black	1
horse,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
leisurely	1
and	1
preoccupied	1
manner.	1
He	1
beckoned	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
adjutants	1
and	1
asked	1
some	1
question--"Most	1
likely	1
he	1
is	1
asking	1
at	1
what	1
o'clock	1
they	1
started,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
watching	1
his	1
old	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
repress	1
as	1
he	1
recalled	1
his	1
reception	1
at	1
Brunn.	1
In	1
the	1
Emperors'	1
suite	1
were	1
the	1
picked	1
young	1
orderly	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Guard	1
and	1
line	1
regiments,	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian.	1
Among	1
them	1
were	1
grooms	1
leading	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
beautiful	1
relay	1
horses	1
covered	1
with	1
embroidered	1
cloths.	1
	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
window	1
is	1
opened	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
fresh	1
air	1
from	1
the	1
fields	1
enters	1
a	1
stuffy	1
room,	1
so	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
youthfulness,	1
energy,	1
and	1
confidence	1
of	1
success	1
reached	1
Kutuzov's	1
cheerless	1
staff	1
with	1
the	1
galloping	1
advent	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
brilliant	1
young	1
men.	1
	1
"Why	1
aren't	1
you	1
beginning,	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich?"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
glancing	1
courteously	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
waiting,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
answered	1
Kutuzov,	1
bending	1
forward	1
respectfully.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
frowning	1
slightly,	1
bent	1
his	1
ear	1
forward	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
quite	1
heard.	1
	1
"Waiting,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
repeated	1
Kutuzov.	1
(Prince	1
Andrew	1
noted	1
that	1
Kutuzov's	1
upper	1
lip	1
twitched	1
unnaturally	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
word	1
"waiting.")	1
"Not	1
all	1
the	1
columns	1
have	1
formed	1
up	1
yet,	1
Your	1
Majesty."	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
heard	1
but	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
reply;	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
rather	1
round	1
shoulders	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
Novosiltsev	1
who	1
was	1
near	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
complaining	1
of	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
Empress'	1
Field	1
where	1
a	1
parade	1
does	1
not	1
begin	1
till	1
all	1
the	1
troops	1
are	1
assembled,"	1
said	1
the	1
Tsar	1
with	1
another	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis,	1
as	1
if	1
inviting	1
him	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
But	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
listen.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
just	1
why	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
begin,	1
sire,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
a	1
resounding	1
voice,	1
apparently	1
to	1
preclude	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
not	1
being	1
heard,	1
and	1
again	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
twitched--"That	1
is	1
just	1
why	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
begin,	1
sire,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
on	1
parade	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
Empress'	1
Field,"	1
said	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
suite	1
all	1
exchanged	1
rapid	1
looks	1
that	1
expressed	1
dissatisfaction	1
and	1
reproach.	1
"Old	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
be,	1
he	1
should	1
not,	1
he	1
certainly	1
should	1
not,	1
speak	1
like	1
that,"	1
their	1
glances	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
looked	1
intently	1
and	1
observantly	1
into	1
Kutuzov's	1
eye	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
anything	1
more.	1
But	1
Kutuzov,	1
with	1
respectfully	1
bowed	1
head,	1
seemed	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
waiting.	1
The	1
silence	1
lasted	1
for	1
about	1
a	1
minute.	1
	1
"However,	1
if	1
you	1
command	1
it,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
again	1
assuming	1
his	1
former	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
dull,	1
unreasoning,	1
but	1
submissive	1
general.	1
	1
He	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
having	1
called	1
Miloradovich,	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
column,	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
advance.	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
move,	1
and	1
two	1
battalions	1
of	1
the	1
Novgorod	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Apsheron	1
regiment	1
went	1
forward	1
past	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
As	1
this	1
Apsheron	1
battalion	1
marched	1
by,	1
the	1
red-faced	1
Miloradovich,	1
without	1
his	1
greatcoat,	1
with	1
his	1
Orders	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
an	1
enormous	1
tuft	1
of	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
cocked	1
hat	1
worn	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
with	1
its	1
corners	1
front	1
and	1
back,	1
galloped	1
strenuously	1
forward,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
dashing	1
salute	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"God	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
general!"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Ma	1
foi,	1
sire,	1
nous	1
ferons	1
ce	1
qui	1
sera	1
dans	1
notre	1
possibilite,	1
sire,"	1
*	1
he	1
answered	1
gaily,	1
raising	1
nevertheless	1
ironic	1
smiles	1
among	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
suite	1
by	1
his	1
poor	1
French.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Indeed,	1
Sire,	1
we	1
shall	1
do	1
everything	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
do,	1
Sire."	1
	1
Miloradovich	1
wheeled	1
his	1
horse	1
sharply	1
and	1
stationed	1
himself	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
The	1
Apsheron	1
men,	1
excited	1
by	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
presence,	1
passed	1
in	1
step	1
before	1
the	1
Emperors	1
and	1
their	1
suites	1
at	1
a	1
bold,	1
brisk	1
pace.	1
	1
"Lads!"	1
shouted	1
Miloradovich	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
self-confident,	1
and	1
cheery	1
voice,	1
obviously	1
so	1
elated	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
firing,	1
by	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
battle,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
gallant	1
Apsherons,	1
his	1
comrades	1
in	1
Suvorov's	1
time,	1
now	1
passing	1
so	1
gallantly	1
before	1
the	1
Emperors,	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
the	1
sovereigns'	1
presence.	1
"Lads,	1
it's	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
you've	1
had	1
to	1
take,"	1
cried	1
he.	1
	1
"Glad	1
to	1
do	1
our	1
best!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
horse	1
started	1
at	1
the	1
sudden	1
cry.	1
This	1
horse	1
that	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
sovereign	1
at	1
reviews	1
in	1
Russia	1
bore	1
him	1
also	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
enduring	1
the	1
heedless	1
blows	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
and	1
pricking	1
its	1
ears	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
shots	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
on	1
the	1
Empress'	1
Field,	1
not	1
understanding	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
firing,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis'	1
black	1
cob,	1
nor	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
said,	1
thought,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
day	1
by	1
its	1
rider.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
turned	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
followers	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
remark	1
to	1
him,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
gallant	1
Apsherons.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
accompanied	1
by	1
his	1
adjutants	1
rode	1
at	1
a	1
walking	1
pace	1
behind	1
the	1
carabineers.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
column	1
he	1
stopped	1
at	1
a	1
solitary,	1
deserted	1
house	1
that	1
had	1
probably	1
once	1
been	1
an	1
inn,	1
where	1
two	1
roads	1
parted.	1
Both	1
of	1
them	1
led	1
downhill	1
and	1
troops	1
were	1
marching	1
along	1
both.	1
	1
The	1
fog	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
clear	1
and	1
enemy	1
troops	1
were	1
already	1
dimly	1
visible	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
heights.	1
Down	1
below,	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
the	1
firing	1
became	1
more	1
distinct.	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
stopped	1
and	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
an	1
Austrian	1
general.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
looking	1
at	1
them,	1
turned	1
to	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
field	1
glass.	1
	1
"Look,	1
look!"	1
said	1
this	1
adjutant,	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
troops	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
but	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
before	1
him.	1
"It's	1
the	1
French!"	1
	1
The	1
two	1
generals	1
and	1
the	1
adjutant	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
glass,	1
trying	1
to	1
snatch	1
it	1
from	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
expression	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
faces	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
horror.	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
away,	1
but	1
had	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
appeared	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
"It's	1
the	1
enemy?...	1
No!...	1
Yes,	1
see	1
it	1
is!...	1
for	1
certain....	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
that?"	1
said	1
different	1
voices.	1
	1
With	1
the	1
naked	1
eye	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
below	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
hundred	1
paces	1
from	1
where	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
standing,	1
a	1
dense	1
French	1
column	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Apsherons.	1
	1
"Here	1
it	1
is!	1
The	1
decisive	1
moment	1
has	1
arrived.	1
My	1
turn	1
has	1
come,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
striking	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"The	1
Apsherons	1
must	1
be	1
stopped,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
cried	1
he.	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
instant	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
spread	1
all	1
round,	1
firing	1
was	1
heard	1
quite	1
close	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
naive	1
terror	1
barely	1
two	1
steps	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shouted,	1
"Brothers!	1
All's	1
lost!"	1
And	1
at	1
this	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
a	1
command,	1
everyone	1
began	1
to	1
run.	1
	1
Confused	1
and	1
ever-increasing	1
crowds	1
were	1
running	1
back	1
to	1
where	1
five	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
troops	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
Emperors.	1
Not	1
only	1
would	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
to	1
stop	1
that	1
crowd,	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
back	1
with	1
it	1
oneself.	1
Bolkonski	1
only	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
touch	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
bewildered	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
grasp	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
Nesvitski	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
face,	1
red	1
and	1
unlike	1
himself,	1
was	1
shouting	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
ride	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
taken	1
prisoner.	1
Kutuzov	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
and	1
without	1
answering	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
handkerchief.	1
Blood	1
was	1
flowing	1
from	1
his	1
cheek.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
wounded?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
master	1
the	1
trembling	1
of	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw.	1
	1
"The	1
wound	1
is	1
not	1
here,	1
it	1
is	1
there!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
pressing	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
his	1
wounded	1
cheek	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
fleeing	1
soldiers.	1
"Stop	1
them!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment,	1
probably	1
realizing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
stop	1
them,	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
	1
A	1
fresh	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
mob	1
caught	1
him	1
and	1
bore	1
him	1
back	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
were	1
running	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
dense	1
mass	1
that	1
once	1
surrounded	1
by	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
again.	1
One	1
was	1
shouting,	1
"Get	1
on!	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
hindering	1
us?"	1
Another	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
fired	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
a	1
third	1
was	1
striking	1
the	1
horse	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
rode.	1
Having	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
got	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
that	1
flood	1
of	1
men,	1
Kutuzov,	1
with	1
his	1
suite	1
diminished	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
half,	1
rode	1
toward	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
artillery	1
fire	1
near	1
by.	1
Having	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
fugitives,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
trying	1
to	1
keep	1
near	1
Kutuzov,	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
a	1
Russian	1
battery	1
that	1
was	1
still	1
firing	1
and	1
Frenchmen	1
running	1
toward	1
it.	1
Higher	1
up	1
stood	1
some	1
Russian	1
infantry,	1
neither	1
moving	1
forward	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
battery	1
nor	1
backward	1
with	1
the	1
fleeing	1
crowd.	1
A	1
mounted	1
general	1
separated	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
infantry	1
and	1
approached	1
Kutuzov.	1
Of	1
Kutuzov's	1
suite	1
only	1
four	1
remained.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
pale	1
and	1
exchanged	1
looks	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"Stop	1
those	1
wretches!"	1
gasped	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
flying	1
soldiers;	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
those	1
words,	1
bullets	1
flew	1
hissing	1
across	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
across	1
Kutuzov's	1
suite	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
little	1
birds.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
battery	1
and,	1
seeing	1
Kutuzov,	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
him.	1
After	1
this	1
volley	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
leg;	1
several	1
soldiers	1
fell,	1
and	1
a	1
second	1
lieutenant	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
flag	1
let	1
it	1
fall	1
from	1
his	1
hands.	1
It	1
swayed	1
and	1
fell,	1
but	1
caught	1
on	1
the	1
muskets	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
soldiers.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
started	1
firing	1
without	1
orders.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
groaned	1
Kutuzov	1
despairingly	1
and	1
looked	1
around....	1
"Bolkonski!"	1
he	1
whispered,	1
his	1
voice	1
trembling	1
from	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
feebleness	1
of	1
age,	1
"Bolkonski!"	1
he	1
whispered,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
disordered	1
battalion	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
enemy,	1
"what's	1
that?"	1
	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
feeling	1
tears	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
anger	1
choking	1
him,	1
had	1
already	1
leapt	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
standard.	1
	1
"Forward,	1
lads!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
piercing	1
as	1
a	1
child's.	1
	1
"Here	1
it	1
is!"	1
thought	1
he,	1
seizing	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
standard	1
and	1
hearing	1
with	1
pleasure	1
the	1
whistle	1
of	1
bullets	1
evidently	1
aimed	1
at	1
him.	1
Several	1
soldiers	1
fell.	1
	1
"Hurrah!"	1
shouted	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and,	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
up	1
the	1
heavy	1
standard,	1
he	1
ran	1
forward	1
with	1
full	1
confidence	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
battalion	1
would	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
really	1
he	1
only	1
ran	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
alone.	1
One	1
soldier	1
moved	1
and	1
then	1
another	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
whole	1
battalion	1
ran	1
forward	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
and	1
overtook	1
him.	1
A	1
sergeant	1
of	1
the	1
battalion	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
flag	1
that	1
was	1
swaying	1
from	1
its	1
weight	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
hands,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
immediately	1
killed.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again	1
seized	1
the	1
standard	1
and,	1
dragging	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
staff,	1
ran	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
battalion.	1
In	1
front	1
he	1
saw	1
our	1
artillerymen,	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
fighting,	1
while	1
others,	1
having	1
abandoned	1
their	1
guns,	1
were	1
running	1
toward	1
him.	1
He	1
also	1
saw	1
French	1
infantry	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
seizing	1
the	1
artillery	1
horses	1
and	1
turning	1
the	1
guns	1
round.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
battalion	1
were	1
already	1
within	1
twenty	1
paces	1
of	1
the	1
cannon.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
whistle	1
of	1
bullets	1
above	1
him	1
unceasingly	1
and	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
of	1
him	1
soldiers	1
continually	1
groaned	1
and	1
dropped.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
them:	1
he	1
looked	1
only	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him--at	1
the	1
battery.	1
He	1
now	1
saw	1
clearly	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
red-haired	1
gunner	1
with	1
his	1
shako	1
knocked	1
awry,	1
pulling	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
mop	1
while	1
a	1
French	1
soldier	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
He	1
could	1
distinctly	1
see	1
the	1
distraught	1
yet	1
angry	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
men,	1
who	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
they	1
about?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
them.	1
"Why	1
doesn't	1
the	1
red-haired	1
gunner	1
run	1
away	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
unarmed?	1
Why	1
doesn't	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
stab	1
him?	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
get	1
away	1
before	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
remembers	1
his	1
bayonet	1
and	1
stabs	1
him...."	1
	1
And	1
really	1
another	1
French	1
soldier,	1
trailing	1
his	1
musket,	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
struggling	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
red-haired	1
gunner,	1
who	1
had	1
triumphantly	1
secured	1
the	1
mop	1
and	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
what	1
awaited	1
him,	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
decided.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
ended.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
near	1
him	1
hit	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
swing	1
of	1
a	1
bludgeon.	1
It	1
hurt	1
a	1
little,	1
but	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
pain	1
distracted	1
him	1
and	1
prevented	1
his	1
seeing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
at.	1
	1
"What's	1
this?	1
Am	1
I	1
falling?	1
My	1
legs	1
are	1
giving	1
way,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
back.	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
hoping	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
struggle	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
with	1
the	1
gunners	1
ended,	1
whether	1
the	1
red-haired	1
gunner	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
or	1
not	1
and	1
whether	1
the	1
cannon	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
or	1
saved.	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing.	1
Above	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
sky--the	1
lofty	1
sky,	1
not	1
clear	1
yet	1
still	1
immeasurably	1
lofty,	1
with	1
gray	1
clouds	1
gliding	1
slowly	1
across	1
it.	1
"How	1
quiet,	1
peaceful,	1
and	1
solemn;	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
I	1
ran,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew--"not	1
as	1
we	1
ran,	1
shouting	1
and	1
fighting,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
the	1
gunner	1
and	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
frightened	1
and	1
angry	1
faces	1
struggled	1
for	1
the	1
mop:	1
how	1
differently	1
do	1
those	1
clouds	1
glide	1
across	1
that	1
lofty	1
infinite	1
sky!	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
lofty	1
sky	1
before?	1
And	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
at	1
last!	1
Yes!	1
All	1
is	1
vanity,	1
all	1
falsehood,	1
except	1
that	1
infinite	1
sky.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing,	1
nothing,	1
but	1
that.	1
But	1
even	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
exist,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
quiet	1
and	1
peace.	1
Thank	1
God!..."	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
On	1
our	1
right	1
flank	1
commanded	1
by	1
Bagration,	1
at	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
begun.	1
Not	1
wishing	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
Dolgorukov's	1
demand	1
to	1
commence	1
the	1
action,	1
and	1
wishing	1
to	1
avert	1
responsibility	1
from	1
himself,	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
proposed	1
to	1
Dolgorukov	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
Bagration	1
knew	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
distance	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
flanks	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
six	1
miles,	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
messenger	1
were	1
not	1
killed	1
(which	1
he	1
very	1
likely	1
would	1
be),	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
(which	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
difficult),	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
before	1
evening.	1
	1
Bagration	1
cast	1
his	1
large,	1
expressionless,	1
sleepy	1
eyes	1
round	1
his	1
suite,	1
and	1
the	1
boyish	1
face	1
Rostov,	1
breathless	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
hope,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
catch	1
his	1
eye.	1
He	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
meet	1
His	1
Majesty	1
before	1
I	1
meet	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
give	1
the	1
message	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov,	1
hurriedly	1
interrupting	1
Bagration.	1
	1
On	1
being	1
relieved	1
from	1
picket	1
duty	1
Rostov	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
few	1
hours'	1
sleep	1
before	1
morning	1
and	1
felt	1
cheerful,	1
bold,	1
and	1
resolute,	1
with	1
elasticity	1
of	1
movement,	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
good	1
fortune,	1
and	1
generally	1
in	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
makes	1
everything	1
seem	1
possible,	1
pleasant,	1
and	1
easy.	1
	1
All	1
his	1
wishes	1
were	1
being	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
morning:	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
general	1
engagement	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
part,	1
more	1
than	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
orderly	1
to	1
the	1
bravest	1
general,	1
and	1
still	1
more,	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
perhaps	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
sovereign	1
himself.	1
The	1
morning	1
was	1
bright,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
horse	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
happiness.	1
On	1
receiving	1
the	1
order	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
horse	1
the	1
rein	1
and	1
galloped	1
along	1
the	1
line.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
rode	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
Bagration's	1
troops,	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
advanced	1
into	1
action	1
but	1
were	1
standing	1
motionless;	1
then	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
region	1
occupied	1
by	1
Uvarov's	1
cavalry	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
stir	1
and	1
signs	1
of	1
preparation	1
for	1
battle;	1
having	1
passed	1
Uvarov's	1
cavalry	1
he	1
clearly	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
cannon	1
and	1
musketry	1
ahead	1
of	1
him.	1
The	1
firing	1
grew	1
louder	1
and	1
louder.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
fresh	1
morning	1
air	1
were	1
now	1
heard,	1
not	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
musket	1
shots	1
at	1
irregular	1
intervals	1
as	1
before,	1
followed	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
cannon	1
shots,	1
but	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
volleys	1
of	1
musketry	1
from	1
the	1
slopes	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
before	1
Pratzen,	1
interrupted	1
by	1
such	1
frequent	1
reports	1
of	1
cannon	1
that	1
sometimes	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
not	1
separated	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
but	1
merged	1
into	1
a	1
general	1
roar.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
puffs	1
of	1
musketry	1
smoke	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
chase	1
one	1
another	1
down	1
the	1
hillsides,	1
and	1
clouds	1
of	1
cannon	1
smoke	1
rolling,	1
spreading,	1
and	1
mingling	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
He	1
could	1
also,	1
by	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
bayonets	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
smoke,	1
make	1
out	1
moving	1
masses	1
of	1
infantry	1
and	1
narrow	1
lines	1
of	1
artillery	1
with	1
green	1
caissons.	1
	1
Rostov	1
stopped	1
his	1
horse	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
a	1
hillock	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
but	1
strain	1
his	1
attention	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
or	1
make	1
out	1
anything	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening:	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
smoke	1
men	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
were	1
moving	1
about,	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
behind	1
moved	1
lines	1
of	1
troops;	1
but	1
why,	1
whither,	1
and	1
who	1
they	1
were,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
out.	1
These	1
sights	1
and	1
sounds	1
had	1
no	1
depressing	1
or	1
intimidating	1
effect	1
on	1
him;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
they	1
stimulated	1
his	1
energy	1
and	1
determination.	1
	1
"Go	1
on!	1
Go	1
on!	1
Give	1
it	1
them!"	1
he	1
mentally	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
these	1
sounds,	1
and	1
again	1
proceeded	1
to	1
gallop	1
along	1
the	1
line,	1
penetrating	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
into	1
the	1
region	1
where	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
action.	1
	1
"How	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
there	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
but	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
well!"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
After	1
passing	1
some	1
Austrian	1
troops	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
(the	1
Guards)	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
action.	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
the	1
better!	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
it	1
close,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
riding	1
almost	1
along	1
the	1
front	1
line.	1
A	1
handful	1
of	1
men	1
came	1
galloping	1
toward	1
him.	1
They	1
were	1
our	1
uhlans	1
who	1
with	1
disordered	1
ranks	1
were	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
attack.	1
Rostov	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
way,	1
involuntarily	1
noticed	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
bleeding,	1
and	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
no	1
business	1
of	1
mine,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
ridden	1
many	1
hundred	1
yards	1
after	1
that	1
before	1
he	1
saw	1
to	1
his	1
left,	1
across	1
the	1
whole	1
width	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
an	1
enormous	1
mass	1
of	1
cavalry	1
in	1
brilliant	1
white	1
uniforms,	1
mounted	1
on	1
black	1
horses,	1
trotting	1
straight	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
across	1
his	1
path.	1
Rostov	1
put	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
full	1
gallop	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
these	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
clear	1
had	1
they	1
continued	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
speed,	1
but	1
they	1
kept	1
increasing	1
their	1
pace,	1
so	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
already	1
galloping.	1
Rostov	1
heard	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
their	1
hoofs	1
and	1
the	1
jingle	1
of	1
their	1
weapons	1
and	1
saw	1
their	1
horses,	1
their	1
figures,	1
and	1
even	1
their	1
faces,	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
distinctly.	1
They	1
were	1
our	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
advancing	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
cavalry	1
that	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
were	1
galloping,	1
but	1
still	1
holding	1
in	1
their	1
horses.	1
Rostov	1
could	1
already	1
see	1
their	1
faces	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
command:	1
"Charge!"	1
shouted	1
by	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
was	1
urging	1
his	1
thoroughbred	1
to	1
full	1
speed.	1
Rostov,	1
fearing	1
to	1
be	1
crushed	1
or	1
swept	1
into	1
the	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
French,	1
galloped	1
along	1
the	1
front	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
his	1
horse	1
could	1
go,	1
but	1
still	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
avoid	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
a	1
huge	1
pockmarked	1
fellow,	1
frowned	1
angrily	1
on	1
seeing	1
Rostov	1
before	1
him,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
inevitably	1
collide.	1
This	1
Guardsman	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
bowled	1
Rostov	1
and	1
his	1
Bedouin	1
over	1
(Rostov	1
felt	1
himself	1
quite	1
tiny	1
and	1
weak	1
compared	1
to	1
these	1
gigantic	1
men	1
and	1
horses)	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
occurred	1
to	1
Rostov	1
to	1
flourish	1
his	1
whip	1
before	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Guardsman's	1
horse.	1
The	1
heavy	1
black	1
horse,	1
sixteen	1
hands	1
high,	1
shied,	1
throwing	1
back	1
its	1
ears;	1
but	1
the	1
pockmarked	1
Guardsman	1
drove	1
his	1
huge	1
spurs	1
in	1
violently,	1
and	1
the	1
horse,	1
flourishing	1
its	1
tail	1
and	1
extending	1
its	1
neck,	1
galloped	1
on	1
yet	1
faster.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
passed	1
Rostov	1
before	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
shout,	1
"Hurrah!"	1
and	1
looking	1
back	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
foremost	1
ranks	1
were	1
mixed	1
up	1
with	1
some	1
foreign	1
cavalry	1
with	1
red	1
epaulets,	1
probably	1
French.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
more,	1
for	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
cannon	1
began	1
firing	1
from	1
somewhere	1
and	1
smoke	1
enveloped	1
everything.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
as	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
having	1
passed	1
him,	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
smoke,	1
Rostov	1
hesitated	1
whether	1
to	1
gallop	1
after	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
go	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
sent.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
brilliant	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
that	1
amazed	1
the	1
French	1
themselves.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
horrified	1
to	1
hear	1
later	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
mass	1
of	1
huge	1
and	1
handsome	1
men,	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
brilliant,	1
rich	1
youths,	1
officers	1
and	1
cadets,	1
who	1
had	1
galloped	1
past	1
him	1
on	1
their	1
thousand-ruble	1
horses,	1
only	1
eighteen	1
were	1
left	1
after	1
the	1
charge.	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
I	1
envy	1
them?	1
My	1
chance	1
is	1
not	1
lost,	1
and	1
maybe	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Emperor	1
immediately!"	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
and	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
Foot	1
Guards	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
about	1
them	1
and	1
around	1
them	1
cannon	1
balls	1
were	1
flying,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
because	1
he	1
heard	1
their	1
sound	1
as	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
uneasiness	1
on	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
faces	1
and	1
unnatural	1
warlike	1
solemnity	1
on	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
Passing	1
behind	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
a	1
regiment	1
of	1
Foot	1
Guards	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
calling	1
him	1
by	1
name.	1
	1
"Rostov!"	1
	1
"What?"	1
he	1
answered,	1
not	1
recognizing	1
Boris.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
we've	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line!	1
Our	1
regiment	1
attacked!"	1
said	1
Boris	1
with	1
the	1
happy	1
smile	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
fire	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
	1
Rostov	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Have	1
you?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Well,	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
go?"	1
	1
"We	1
drove	1
them	1
back!"	1
said	1
Boris	1
with	1
animation,	1
growing	1
talkative.	1
"Can	1
you	1
imagine	1
it?"	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
describing	1
how	1
the	1
Guards,	1
having	1
taken	1
up	1
their	1
position	1
and	1
seeing	1
troops	1
before	1
them,	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
Austrians,	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
discovered	1
from	1
the	1
cannon	1
balls	1
discharged	1
by	1
those	1
troops	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
and	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
action.	1
Rostov	1
without	1
hearing	1
Boris	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
"With	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty."	1
	1
"There	1
he	1
is!"	1
said	1
Boris,	1
thinking	1
Rostov	1
had	1
said	1
"His	1
Highness,"	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
high	1
shoulders	1
and	1
frowning	1
brows	1
stood	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
helmet	1
and	1
Horse	1
Guards'	1
jacket,	1
shouting	1
something	1
to	1
a	1
pale,	1
white	1
uniformed	1
Austrian	1
officer.	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
or	1
the	1
Emperor,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
spur	1
his	1
horse.	1
	1
"Count!	1
Count!"	1
shouted	1
Berg	1
who	1
ran	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
as	1
eager	1
as	1
Boris.	1
"Count!	1
I	1
am	1
wounded	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand"	1
(and	1
he	1
showed	1
his	1
bleeding	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
tied	1
round	1
it)	1
"and	1
I	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
front.	1
I	1
held	1
my	1
sword	1
in	1
my	1
left	1
hand,	1
Count.	1
All	1
our	1
family--the	1
von	1
Bergs--have	1
been	1
knights!"	1
	1
He	1
said	1
something	1
more,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
and	1
rode	1
away.	1
	1
Having	1
passed	1
the	1
Guards	1
and	1
traversed	1
an	1
empty	1
space,	1
Rostov,	1
to	1
avoid	1
again	1
getting	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
line	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
charged,	1
followed	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
reserves,	1
going	1
far	1
round	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
hottest	1
musket	1
fire	1
and	1
cannonade	1
were	1
heard.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
musket	1
fire	1
quite	1
close	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
behind	1
our	1
troops,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
expected	1
the	1
enemy	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
be?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"The	1
enemy	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
our	1
army?	1
Impossible!"	1
And	1
suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
panic	1
of	1
fear	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
battle.	1
"But	1
be	1
that	1
what	1
it	1
may,"	1
he	1
reflected,	1
"there	1
is	1
no	1
riding	1
round	1
it	1
now.	1
I	1
must	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
here,	1
and	1
if	1
all	1
is	1
lost	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
rest."	1
	1
The	1
foreboding	1
of	1
evil	1
that	1
had	1
suddenly	1
come	1
over	1
Rostov	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
confirmed	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
rode	1
into	1
the	1
region	1
behind	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Pratzen,	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
troops	1
of	1
all	1
kinds.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
it	1
mean?	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
Whom	1
are	1
they	1
firing	1
at?	1
Who	1
is	1
firing?"	1
Rostov	1
kept	1
asking	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian	1
soldiers	1
running	1
in	1
confused	1
crowds	1
across	1
his	1
path.	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
knows!	1
They've	1
killed	1
everybody!	1
It's	1
all	1
up	1
now!"	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
in	1
Russian,	1
German,	1
and	1
Czech	1
by	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
fugitives	1
who	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
"Kill	1
the	1
Germans!"	1
shouted	1
one.	1
	1
"May	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
them--the	1
traitors!"	1
	1
"Zum	1
Henker	1
diese	1
Russen!"	1
*	1
muttered	1
a	1
German.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Hang	1
these	1
Russians!"	1
	1
Several	1
wounded	1
men	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
words	1
of	1
abuse,	1
screams,	1
and	1
groans	1
mingled	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
hubbub,	1
then	1
the	1
firing	1
died	1
down.	1
Rostov	1
learned	1
later	1
that	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian	1
soldiers	1
had	1
been	1
firing	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
"My	1
God!	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
all	1
mean?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"And	1
here,	1
where	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
the	1
Emperor	1
may	1
see	1
them....	1
But	1
no,	1
these	1
must	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
scoundrels.	1
It	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
over,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
that,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!	1
Only	1
to	1
get	1
past	1
them	1
quicker,	1
quicker!"	1
	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
defeat	1
and	1
flight	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
Rostov's	1
head.	1
Though	1
he	1
saw	1
French	1
cannon	1
and	1
French	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights	1
just	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
he	1
could	1
not,	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to,	1
believe	1
that.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Rostov	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
near	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Pratzen.	1
But	1
neither	1
they	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
commanding	1
officer	1
were	1
there,	1
only	1
disorganized	1
crowds	1
of	1
troops	1
of	1
various	1
kinds.	1
He	1
urged	1
on	1
his	1
already	1
weary	1
horse	1
to	1
get	1
quickly	1
past	1
these	1
crowds,	1
but	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
went	1
the	1
more	1
disorganized	1
they	1
were.	1
The	1
highroad	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
was	1
thronged	1
with	1
caleches,	1
carriages	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
and	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian	1
soldiers	1
of	1
all	1
arms,	1
some	1
wounded	1
and	1
some	1
not.	1
This	1
whole	1
mass	1
droned	1
and	1
jostled	1
in	1
confusion	1
under	1
the	1
dismal	1
influence	1
of	1
cannon	1
balls	1
flying	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
batteries	1
stationed	1
on	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
Emperor?	1
Where	1
is	1
Kutuzov?"	1
Rostov	1
kept	1
asking	1
everyone	1
he	1
could	1
stop,	1
but	1
got	1
no	1
answer	1
from	1
anyone.	1
	1
At	1
last	1
seizing	1
a	1
soldier	1
by	1
his	1
collar	1
he	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
answer.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
brother!	1
They've	1
all	1
bolted	1
long	1
ago!"	1
said	1
the	1
soldier,	1
laughing	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
and	1
shaking	1
himself	1
free.	1
	1
Having	1
left	1
that	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
drunk,	1
Rostov	1
stopped	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
a	1
batman	1
or	1
groom	1
of	1
some	1
important	1
personage	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
him.	1
The	1
man	1
announced	1
that	1
the	1
Tsar	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
along	1
that	1
very	1
road	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dangerously	1
wounded.	1
	1
"It	1
can't	1
be!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
someone	1
else."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
him	1
myself,"	1
replied	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
self-confident	1
smile	1
of	1
derision.	1
"I	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
Emperor	1
by	1
now,	1
after	1
the	1
times	1
I've	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
you....	1
There	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
anything.	1
How	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
four	1
black	1
horses	1
fly!	1
Gracious	1
me,	1
they	1
did	1
rattle	1
past!	1
It's	1
time	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
Imperial	1
horses	1
and	1
Ilya	1
Ivanych.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
Ilya	1
drives	1
anyone	1
except	1
the	1
Tsar!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ride	1
on,	1
when	1
a	1
wounded	1
officer	1
passing	1
by	1
addressed	1
him:	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"The	1
commander-in-chief?	1
He	1
was	1
killed	1
by	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball--struck	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
before	1
our	1
regiment."	1
	1
"Not	1
killed--wounded!"	1
another	1
officer	1
corrected	1
him.	1
	1
"Who?	1
Kutuzov?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Not	1
Kutuzov,	1
but	1
what's	1
his	1
name--well,	1
never	1
mind...	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
left	1
alive.	1
Go	1
that	1
way,	1
to	1
that	1
village,	1
all	1
the	1
commanders	1
are	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Hosjeradek,	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
on.	1
	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
footpace	1
not	1
knowing	1
why	1
or	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
going.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
wounded,	1
the	1
battle	1
lost.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
doubt	1
it	1
now.	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
turrets	1
and	1
a	1
church.	1
What	1
need	1
to	1
hurry?	1
What	1
was	1
he	1
now	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar	1
or	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
alive	1
and	1
unwounded?	1
	1
"Take	1
this	1
road,	1
your	1
honor,	1
that	1
way	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
killed	1
at	1
once!"	1
a	1
soldier	1
shouted	1
to	1
him.	1
"They'd	1
kill	1
you	1
there!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?"	1
said	1
another.	1
"Where	1
is	1
he	1
to	1
go?	1
That	1
way	1
is	1
nearer."	1
	1
Rostov	1
considered,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
where	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
now.	1
If	1
the	1
Emperor	1
is	1
wounded,	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
save	1
myself?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
He	1
rode	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
region	1
where	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
had	1
perished	1
in	1
fleeing	1
from	1
Pratzen.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
occupied	1
that	1
region,	1
and	1
the	1
Russians--the	1
uninjured	1
and	1
slightly	1
wounded--had	1
left	1
it	1
long	1
ago.	1
All	1
about	1
the	1
field,	1
like	1
heaps	1
of	1
manure	1
on	1
well-kept	1
plowland,	1
lay	1
from	1
ten	1
to	1
fifteen	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded	1
to	1
each	1
couple	1
of	1
acres.	1
The	1
wounded	1
crept	1
together	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes	1
and	1
one	1
could	1
hear	1
their	1
distressing	1
screams	1
and	1
groans,	1
sometimes	1
feigned--or	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
a	1
trot	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
all	1
these	1
suffering	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
afraid--afraid	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
life,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
courage	1
he	1
needed	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
would	1
not	1
stand	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
unfortunates.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
who	1
had	1
ceased	1
firing	1
at	1
this	1
field	1
strewn	1
with	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
left	1
to	1
fire	1
at,	1
on	1
seeing	1
an	1
adjutant	1
riding	1
over	1
it	1
trained	1
a	1
gun	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
fired	1
several	1
shots.	1
The	1
sensation	1
of	1
those	1
terrible	1
whistling	1
sounds	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
corpses	1
around	1
him	1
merged	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
mind	1
into	1
a	1
single	1
feeling	1
of	1
terror	1
and	1
pity	1
for	1
himself.	1
He	1
remembered	1
his	1
mother's	1
last	1
letter.	1
"What	1
would	1
she	1
feel,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"if	1
she	1
saw	1
me	1
here	1
now	1
on	1
this	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
cannon	1
aimed	1
at	1
me?"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Hosjeradek	1
there	1
were	1
Russian	1
troops	1
retiring	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
who	1
though	1
still	1
in	1
some	1
confusion	1
were	1
less	1
disordered.	1
The	1
French	1
cannon	1
did	1
not	1
reach	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
musketry	1
fire	1
sounded	1
far	1
away.	1
Here	1
everyone	1
clearly	1
saw	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
lost.	1
No	1
one	1
whom	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
could	1
tell	1
him	1
where	1
the	1
Emperor	1
or	1
Kutuzov	1
was.	1
Some	1
said	1
the	1
report	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
wounded	1
was	1
correct,	1
others	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not,	1
and	1
explained	1
the	1
false	1
rumor	1
that	1
had	1
spread	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
carriage	1
had	1
really	1
galloped	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
pale	1
and	1
terrified	1
Ober-Hofmarschal	1
Count	1
Tolstoy,	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
battlefield	1
with	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
suite.	1
One	1
officer	1
told	1
Rostov	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
someone	1
from	1
headquarters	1
behind	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
thither	1
Rostov	1
rode,	1
not	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
anyone	1
but	1
merely	1
to	1
ease	1
his	1
conscience.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
ridden	1
about	1
two	1
miles	1
and	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
he	1
saw,	1
near	1
a	1
kitchen	1
garden	1
with	1
a	1
ditch	1
round	1
it,	1
two	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
facing	1
the	1
ditch.	1
One	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
plume	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Rostov;	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
a	1
beautiful	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
(which	1
Rostov	1
fancied	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
before)	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ditch,	1
struck	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
spurs,	1
and	1
giving	1
it	1
the	1
rein	1
leaped	1
lightly	1
over.	1
Only	1
a	1
little	1
earth	1
crumbled	1
from	1
the	1
bank	1
under	1
the	1
horse's	1
hind	1
hoofs.	1
Turning	1
the	1
horse	1
sharply,	1
he	1
again	1
jumped	1
the	1
ditch,	1
and	1
deferentially	1
addressed	1
the	1
horseman	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
plumes,	1
evidently	1
suggesting	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
the	1
same.	1
The	1
rider,	1
whose	1
figure	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Rostov	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
riveted	1
his	1
attention,	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
refusal	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
hand	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
gesture	1
Rostov	1
instantly	1
recognized	1
his	1
lamented	1
and	1
adored	1
monarch.	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
he,	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
empty	1
field!"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Alexander	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
beloved	1
features	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
deeply	1
engraved	1
on	1
his	1
memory.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
pale,	1
his	1
cheeks	1
sunken	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
hollow,	1
but	1
the	1
charm,	1
the	1
mildness	1
of	1
his	1
features,	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
greater.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
assurance	1
that	1
the	1
rumors	1
about	1
the	1
Emperor	1
being	1
wounded	1
were	1
false.	1
He	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
seeing	1
him.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
and	1
even	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
give	1
the	1
message	1
Dolgorukov	1
had	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
deliver.	1
	1
But	1
as	1
a	1
youth	1
in	1
love	1
trembles,	1
is	1
unnerved,	1
and	1
dares	1
not	1
utter	1
the	1
thoughts	1
he	1
has	1
dreamed	1
of	1
for	1
nights,	1
but	1
looks	1
around	1
for	1
help	1
or	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
delay	1
and	1
flight	1
when	1
the	1
longed-for	1
moment	1
comes	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
alone	1
with	1
her,	1
so	1
Rostov,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
attained	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
longed	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
reasons	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
why	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
inconvenient,	1
unseemly,	1
and	1
impossible	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
"What!	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
alone	1
and	1
despondent!	1
A	1
strange	1
face	1
may	1
seem	1
unpleasant	1
or	1
painful	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
of	1
sorrow;	1
besides,	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
now,	1
when	1
my	1
heart	1
fails	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
mouth	1
feels	1
dry	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
him?"	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
speeches	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
composed	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
could	1
he	1
now	1
recall.	1
Those	1
speeches	1
were	1
intended	1
for	1
quite	1
other	1
conditions,	1
they	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
victory	1
and	1
triumph,	1
generally	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
dying	1
of	1
wounds	1
and	1
the	1
sovereign	1
had	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
heroic	1
deeds,	1
and	1
while	1
dying	1
he	1
expressed	1
the	1
love	1
his	1
actions	1
had	1
proved.	1
	1
"Besides	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
ask	1
the	1
Emperor	1
for	1
his	1
instructions	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
nearly	1
four	1
o'clock	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
is	1
lost?	1
No,	1
certainly	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
approach	1
him,	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
intrude	1
on	1
his	1
reflections.	1
Better	1
die	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
than	1
risk	1
receiving	1
an	1
unkind	1
look	1
or	1
bad	1
opinion	1
from	1
him,"	1
Rostov	1
decided;	1
and	1
sorrowfully	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
full	1
despair	1
he	1
rode	1
away,	1
continually	1
looking	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
Tsar,	1
who	1
still	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
attitude	1
of	1
indecision.	1
	1
While	1
Rostov	1
was	1
thus	1
arguing	1
with	1
himself	1
and	1
riding	1
sadly	1
away,	1
Captain	1
von	1
Toll	1
chanced	1
to	1
ride	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
spot,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
Emperor	1
at	1
once	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
offered	1
his	1
services,	1
and	1
assisted	1
him	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
ditch	1
on	1
foot.	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
wishing	1
to	1
rest	1
and	1
feeling	1
unwell,	1
sat	1
down	1
under	1
an	1
apple	1
tree	1
and	1
von	1
Toll	1
remained	1
beside	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
saw	1
with	1
envy	1
and	1
remorse	1
how	1
von	1
Toll	1
spoke	1
long	1
and	1
warmly	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
evidently	1
weeping,	1
covered	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
von	1
Toll's	1
hand.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
place!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
hardly	1
restraining	1
his	1
tears	1
of	1
pity	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
he	1
rode	1
on	1
in	1
utter	1
despair,	1
not	1
knowing	1
where	1
to	1
or	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
riding.	1
	1
His	1
despair	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
greater	1
from	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
own	1
weakness	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
grief.	1
	1
He	1
might...	1
not	1
only	1
might	1
but	1
should,	1
have	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sovereign.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
unique	1
chance	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
devotion	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
it....	1
"What	1
have	1
I	1
done?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
galloped	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
beyond	1
the	1
ditch	1
now.	1
Only	1
some	1
carts	1
and	1
carriages	1
were	1
passing	1
by.	1
From	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
drivers	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff	1
were	1
not	1
far	1
off,	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
the	1
vehicles	1
were	1
going	1
to.	1
Rostov	1
followed	1
them.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
walked	1
Kutuzov's	1
groom	1
leading	1
horses	1
in	1
horsecloths.	1
Then	1
came	1
a	1
cart,	1
and	1
behind	1
that	1
walked	1
an	1
old,	1
bandy-	1
legged	1
domestic	1
serf	1
in	1
a	1
peaked	1
cap	1
and	1
sheepskin	1
coat.	1
	1
"Tit!	1
I	1
say,	1
Tit!"	1
said	1
the	1
groom.	1
	1
"What?"	1
answered	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
absent-mindedly.	1
	1
"Go,	1
Tit!	1
Thresh	1
a	1
bit!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
fool!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
spitting	1
angrily.	1
Some	1
time	1
passed	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
same	1
joke	1
was	1
repeated.	1
	1
Before	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
been	1
lost	1
at	1
all	1
points.	1
More	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
cannon	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
Przebyszewski	1
and	1
his	1
corps	1
had	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
arms.	1
Other	1
columns	1
after	1
losing	1
half	1
their	1
men	1
were	1
retreating	1
in	1
disorderly	1
confused	1
masses.	1
	1
The	1
remains	1
of	1
Langeron's	1
and	1
Dokhturov's	1
mingled	1
forces	1
were	1
crowding	1
around	1
the	1
dams	1
and	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
ponds	1
near	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Augesd.	1
	1
After	1
five	1
o'clock	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
Augesd	1
Dam	1
that	1
a	1
hot	1
cannonade	1
(delivered	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
alone)	1
was	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
numerous	1
batteries	1
ranged	1
on	1
the	1
slopes	1
of	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights,	1
directed	1
at	1
our	1
retreating	1
forces.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
rearguard,	1
Dokhturov	1
and	1
others	1
rallying	1
some	1
battalions	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
musketry	1
fire	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
cavalry	1
that	1
was	1
pursuing	1
our	1
troops.	1
It	1
was	1
growing	1
dusk.	1
On	1
the	1
narrow	1
Augesd	1
Dam	1
where	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
the	1
old	1
miller	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
his	1
tasseled	1
cap	1
peacefully	1
angling,	1
while	1
his	1
grandson,	1
with	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
rolled	1
up,	1
handled	1
the	1
floundering	1
silvery	1
fish	1
in	1
the	1
watering	1
can,	1
on	1
that	1
dam	1
over	1
which	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
Moravians	1
in	1
shaggy	1
caps	1
and	1
blue	1
jackets	1
had	1
peacefully	1
driven	1
their	1
two-horse	1
carts	1
loaded	1
with	1
wheat	1
and	1
had	1
returned	1
dusty	1
with	1
flour	1
whitening	1
their	1
carts--on	1
that	1
narrow	1
dam	1
amid	1
the	1
wagons	1
and	1
the	1
cannon,	1
under	1
the	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
wagon	1
wheels,	1
men	1
disfigured	1
by	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
now	1
crowded	1
together,	1
crushing	1
one	1
another,	1
dying,	1
stepping	1
over	1
the	1
dying	1
and	1
killing	1
one	1
another,	1
only	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
and	1
be	1
killed	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
	1
Every	1
ten	1
seconds	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
flew	1
compressing	1
the	1
air	1
around,	1
or	1
a	1
shell	1
burst	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
that	1
dense	1
throng,	1
killing	1
some	1
and	1
splashing	1
with	1
blood	1
those	1
near	1
them.	1
	1
Dolokhov--now	1
an	1
officer--wounded	1
in	1
the	1
arm,	1
and	1
on	1
foot,	1
with	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
some	1
ten	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
company,	1
represented	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
that	1
whole	1
regiment.	1
Impelled	1
by	1
the	1
crowd,	1
they	1
had	1
got	1
wedged	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
to	1
the	1
dam	1
and,	1
jammed	1
in	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
had	1
stopped	1
because	1
a	1
horse	1
in	1
front	1
had	1
fallen	1
under	1
a	1
cannon	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
dragging	1
it	1
out.	1
A	1
cannon	1
ball	1
killed	1
someone	1
behind	1
them,	1
another	1
fell	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
splashed	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
blood.	1
The	1
crowd,	1
pushing	1
forward	1
desperately,	1
squeezed	1
together,	1
moved	1
a	1
few	1
steps,	1
and	1
again	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Move	1
on	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
certainly	1
saved,	1
remain	1
here	1
another	1
two	1
minutes	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
death,"	1
thought	1
each	1
one.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
dam,	1
throwing	1
two	1
soldiers	1
off	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
ran	1
onto	1
the	1
slippery	1
ice	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
millpool.	1
	1
"Turn	1
this	1
way!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
jumping	1
over	1
the	1
ice	1
which	1
creaked	1
under	1
him;	1
"turn	1
this	1
way!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
those	1
with	1
the	1
gun.	1
"It	1
bears!..."	1
	1
The	1
ice	1
bore	1
him	1
but	1
it	1
swayed	1
and	1
creaked,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
way	1
not	1
only	1
under	1
a	1
cannon	1
or	1
a	1
crowd,	1
but	1
very	1
soon	1
even	1
under	1
his	1
weight	1
alone.	1
The	1
men	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
pressed	1
to	1
the	1
bank,	1
hesitating	1
to	1
step	1
onto	1
the	1
ice.	1
The	1
general	1
on	1
horseback	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
dam	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
address	1
Dolokhov.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
hissed	1
so	1
low	1
above	1
the	1
crowd	1
that	1
everyone	1
ducked.	1
It	1
flopped	1
into	1
something	1
moist,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
in	1
a	1
pool	1
of	1
blood.	1
Nobody	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
look	1
or	1
thought	1
of	1
raising	1
him.	1
	1
"Get	1
onto	1
the	1
ice,	1
over	1
the	1
ice!	1
Go	1
on!	1
Turn!	1
Don't	1
you	1
hear?	1
Go	1
on!"	1
innumerable	1
voices	1
suddenly	1
shouted	1
after	1
the	1
ball	1
had	1
struck	1
the	1
general,	1
the	1
men	1
themselves	1
not	1
knowing	1
what,	1
or	1
why,	1
they	1
were	1
shouting.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
hindmost	1
guns	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
onto	1
the	1
dam	1
turned	1
off	1
onto	1
the	1
ice.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
soldiers	1
from	1
the	1
dam	1
began	1
running	1
onto	1
the	1
frozen	1
pond.	1
The	1
ice	1
gave	1
way	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
one	1
leg	1
slipped	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
right	1
himself	1
but	1
fell	1
in	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
waist.	1
The	1
nearest	1
soldiers	1
shrank	1
back,	1
the	1
gun	1
driver	1
stopped	1
his	1
horse,	1
but	1
from	1
behind	1
still	1
came	1
the	1
shouts:	1
"Onto	1
the	1
ice,	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
stop?	1
Go	1
on!	1
Go	1
on!"	1
And	1
cries	1
of	1
horror	1
were	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
near	1
the	1
gun	1
waved	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
beat	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
turn	1
and	1
move	1
on.	1
The	1
horses	1
moved	1
off	1
the	1
bank.	1
The	1
ice,	1
that	1
had	1
held	1
under	1
those	1
on	1
foot,	1
collapsed	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
mass,	1
and	1
some	1
forty	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
it	1
dashed,	1
some	1
forward	1
and	1
some	1
back,	1
drowning	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Still	1
the	1
cannon	1
balls	1
continued	1
regularly	1
to	1
whistle	1
and	1
flop	1
onto	1
the	1
ice	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
oftenest	1
of	1
all	1
among	1
the	1
crowd	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
dam,	1
the	1
pond,	1
and	1
the	1
bank.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
On	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
the	1
flagstaff	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
lay	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski	1
bleeding	1
profusely	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
uttering	1
a	1
gentle,	1
piteous,	1
and	1
childlike	1
moan.	1
	1
Toward	1
evening	1
he	1
ceased	1
moaning	1
and	1
became	1
quite	1
still.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
his	1
unconsciousness	1
lasted.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
again	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
alive	1
and	1
suffering	1
from	1
a	1
burning,	1
lacerating	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
it,	1
that	1
lofty	1
sky	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
till	1
now,	1
but	1
saw	1
today?"	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
thought.	1
"And	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
this	1
suffering	1
either,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
anything,	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
till	1
now.	1
But	1
where	1
am	1
I?"	1
	1
He	1
listened	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
approaching	1
horses,	1
and	1
voices	1
speaking	1
French.	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Above	1
him	1
again	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
lofty	1
sky	1
with	1
clouds	1
that	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
were	1
floating	1
still	1
higher,	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
gleamed	1
blue	1
infinity.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
those	1
who,	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
voices,	1
had	1
ridden	1
up	1
and	1
stopped	1
near	1
him.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
accompanied	1
by	1
two	1
aides-de-camp.	1
Bonaparte	1
riding	1
over	1
the	1
battlefield	1
had	1
given	1
final	1
orders	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
batteries	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
Augesd	1
Dam	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
"Fine	1
men!"	1
remarked	1
Napoleon,	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
dead	1
Russian	1
grenadier,	1
who,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
a	1
blackened	1
nape,	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
stomach	1
with	1
an	1
already	1
stiffened	1
arm	1
flung	1
wide.	1
	1
"The	1
ammunition	1
for	1
the	1
guns	1
in	1
position	1
is	1
exhausted,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
an	1
adjutant	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
batteries	1
that	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
Augesd.	1
	1
"Have	1
some	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
reserve,"	1
said	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
having	1
gone	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
he	1
stopped	1
before	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
with	1
the	1
flagstaff	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
dropped	1
beside	1
him.	1
(The	1
flag	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
as	1
a	1
trophy.)	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
fine	1
death!"	1
said	1
Napoleon	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
who	1
said	1
it.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
speaker	1
addressed	1
as	1
Sire.	1
But	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
buzzing	1
of	1
a	1
fly.	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
interest	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
forgot	1
them.	1
His	1
head	1
was	1
burning,	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
bleeding	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
above	1
him	1
the	1
remote,	1
lofty,	1
and	1
everlasting	1
sky.	1
He	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
Napoleon--his	1
hero--but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Napoleon	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
small,	1
insignificant	1
creature	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
now	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
that	1
lofty	1
infinite	1
sky	1
with	1
the	1
clouds	1
flying	1
over	1
it.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
meant	1
nothing	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
standing	1
over	1
him,	1
or	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
him;	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
glad	1
that	1
people	1
were	1
standing	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
only	1
wished	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
help	1
him	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
life,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
beautiful	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
today	1
learned	1
to	1
understand	1
it	1
so	1
differently.	1
He	1
collected	1
all	1
his	1
strength,	1
to	1
stir	1
and	1
utter	1
a	1
sound.	1
He	1
feebly	1
moved	1
his	1
leg	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
weak,	1
sickly	1
groan	1
which	1
aroused	1
his	1
own	1
pity.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
He	1
is	1
alive,"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"Lift	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
up	1
and	1
carry	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
station."	1
	1
Having	1
said	1
this,	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
on	1
to	1
meet	1
Marshal	1
Lannes,	1
who,	1
hat	1
in	1
hand,	1
rode	1
up	1
smiling	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
congratulate	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
victory.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remembered	1
nothing	1
more:	1
he	1
lost	1
consciousness	1
from	1
the	1
terrible	1
pain	1
of	1
being	1
lifted	1
onto	1
the	1
stretcher,	1
the	1
jolting	1
while	1
being	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
probing	1
of	1
his	1
wound	1
at	1
the	1
dressing	1
station.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
regain	1
consciousness	1
till	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
when	1
with	1
other	1
wounded	1
and	1
captured	1
Russian	1
officers	1
he	1
was	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
hospital.	1
During	1
this	1
transfer	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
stronger	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
speak.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
words	1
he	1
heard	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
French	1
convoy	1
officer,	1
who	1
said	1
rapidly:	1
"We	1
must	1
halt	1
here:	1
the	1
Emperor	1
will	1
pass	1
here	1
immediately;	1
it	1
will	1
please	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
prisoners."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
prisoners	1
today,	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
army,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
probably	1
tired	1
of	1
them,"	1
said	1
another	1
officer.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same!	1
They	1
say	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
Guards,"	1
said	1
the	1
first	1
one,	1
indicating	1
a	1
Russian	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards.	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
recognized	1
Prince	1
Repnin	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society.	1
Beside	1
him	1
stood	1
a	1
lad	1
of	1
nineteen,	1
also	1
a	1
wounded	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards.	1
	1
Bonaparte,	1
having	1
come	1
up	1
at	1
a	1
gallop,	1
stopped	1
his	1
horse.	1
	1
"Which	1
is	1
the	1
senior?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
prisoners.	1
	1
They	1
named	1
the	1
colonel,	1
Prince	1
Repnin.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
regiment	1
of	1
Horse	1
Guards?"	1
asked	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
"I	1
commanded	1
a	1
squadron,"	1
replied	1
Repnin.	1
	1
"Your	1
regiment	1
fulfilled	1
its	1
duty	1
honorably,"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
"The	1
praise	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
commander	1
is	1
a	1
soldier's	1
highest	1
reward,"	1
said	1
Repnin.	1
	1
"I	1
bestow	1
it	1
with	1
pleasure,"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
young	1
man	1
beside	1
you?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Repnin	1
named	1
Lieutenant	1
Sukhtelen.	1
	1
After	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
Napoleon	1
smiled.	1
	1
"He's	1
very	1
young	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
"Youth	1
is	1
no	1
hindrance	1
to	1
courage,"	1
muttered	1
Sukhtelen	1
in	1
a	1
failing	1
voice.	1
	1
"A	1
splendid	1
reply!"	1
said	1
Napoleon.	1
"Young	1
man,	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
far!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
been	1
brought	1
forward	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
show	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
attract	1
his	1
attention.	1
Napoleon	1
apparently	1
remembered	1
seeing	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield	1
and,	1
addressing	1
him,	1
again	1
used	1
the	1
epithet	1
"young	1
man"	1
that	1
was	1
connected	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
you,	1
young	1
man,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
feel,	1
mon	1
brave?"	1
	1
Though	1
five	1
minutes	1
before,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
carrying	1
him,	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
straight	1
on	1
Napoleon,	1
he	1
was	1
silent....	1
So	1
insignificant	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
interests	1
that	1
engrossed	1
Napoleon,	1
so	1
mean	1
did	1
his	1
hero	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
paltry	1
vanity	1
and	1
joy	1
in	1
victory	1
appear,	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
lofty,	1
equitable,	1
and	1
kindly	1
sky	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
understood,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
him.	1
	1
Everything	1
seemed	1
so	1
futile	1
and	1
insignificant	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
stern	1
and	1
solemn	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
that	1
weakness	1
from	1
loss	1
of	1
blood,	1
suffering,	1
and	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
death	1
aroused	1
in	1
him.	1
Looking	1
into	1
Napoleon's	1
eyes	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
insignificance	1
of	1
greatness,	1
the	1
unimportance	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
understand,	1
and	1
the	1
still	1
greater	1
unimportance	1
of	1
death,	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
alive	1
could	1
understand	1
or	1
explain.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
as	1
he	1
went:	1
"Have	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
attended	1
to	1
and	1
taken	1
to	1
my	1
bivouac;	1
let	1
my	1
doctor,	1
Larrey,	1
examine	1
their	1
wounds.	1
Au	1
revoir,	1
Prince	1
Repnin!"	1
and	1
he	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
away.	1
	1
His	1
face	1
shone	1
with	1
self-satisfaction	1
and	1
pleasure.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
noticed	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
little	1
gold	1
icon	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
hung	1
round	1
her	1
brother's	1
neck,	1
but	1
seeing	1
the	1
favor	1
the	1
Emperor	1
showed	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
they	1
now	1
hastened	1
to	1
return	1
the	1
holy	1
image.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
replaced,	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
icon	1
with	1
its	1
thin	1
gold	1
chain	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
upon	1
his	1
chest	1
outside	1
his	1
uniform.	1
	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
good,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
icon	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
hung	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
with	1
such	1
emotion	1
and	1
reverence,	1
"it	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
if	1
everything	1
were	1
as	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
Mary.	1
How	1
good	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
help	1
in	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
what	1
to	1
expect	1
after	1
it	1
beyond	1
the	1
grave!	1
How	1
happy	1
and	1
calm	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
now	1
say:	1
'Lord,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me!'...	1
But	1
to	1
whom	1
should	1
I	1
say	1
that?	1
Either	1
to	1
a	1
Power	1
indefinable,	1
incomprehensible,	1
which	1
I	1
not	1
only	1
cannot	1
address	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
even	1
express	1
in	1
words--the	1
Great	1
All	1
or	1
Nothing-"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"or	1
to	1
that	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
sewn	1
into	1
this	1
amulet	1
by	1
Mary!	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
certain,	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
except	1
the	1
unimportance	1
of	1
everything	1
I	1
understand,	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
something	1
incomprehensible	1
but	1
all-important."	1
	1
The	1
stretchers	1
moved	1
on.	1
At	1
every	1
jolt	1
he	1
again	1
felt	1
unendurable	1
pain;	1
his	1
feverishness	1
increased	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
delirious.	1
Visions	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
wife,	1
sister,	1
and	1
future	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
tenderness	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
the	1
battle,	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
insignificant	1
little	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
lofty	1
sky,	1
formed	1
the	1
chief	1
subjects	1
of	1
his	1
delirious	1
fancies.	1
	1
The	1
quiet	1
home	1
life	1
and	1
peaceful	1
happiness	1
of	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
already	1
enjoying	1
that	1
happiness	1
when	1
that	1
little	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
with	1
his	1
unsympathizing	1
look	1
of	1
shortsighted	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
doubts	1
and	1
torments	1
had	1
followed,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
heavens	1
promised	1
peace.	1
Toward	1
morning	1
all	1
these	1
dreams	1
melted	1
and	1
merged	1
into	1
the	1
chaos	1
and	1
darkness	1
of	1
unconciousness	1
and	1
oblivion	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
doctor,	1
Larrey,	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
end	1
in	1
death	1
than	1
in	1
convalescence.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
nervous,	1
bilious	1
subject,"	1
said	1
Larrey,	1
"and	1
will	1
not	1
recover."	1
	1
And	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
others	1
fatally	1
wounded,	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
district.	1

1806	1

	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1806	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
returned	1
home	1
on	1
leave.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
going	1
home	1
to	1
Voronezh	1
and	1
Rostov	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
travel	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Moscow	1
and	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
him	1
there.	1
Meeting	1
a	1
comrade	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
post	1
station	1
but	1
one	1
before	1
Moscow,	1
Denisov	1
had	1
drunk	1
three	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine	1
with	1
him	1
and,	1
despite	1
the	1
jolting	1
ruts	1
across	1
the	1
snow-covered	1
road,	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
wake	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sleigh	1
beside	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
impatient	1
the	1
nearer	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"How	1
much	1
longer?	1
How	1
much	1
longer?	1
Oh,	1
these	1
insufferable	1
streets,	1
shops,	1
bakers'	1
signboards,	1
street	1
lamps,	1
and	1
sleighs!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
when	1
their	1
leave	1
permits	1
had	1
been	1
passed	1
at	1
the	1
town	1
gate	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"Denisov!	1
We're	1
here!	1
He's	1
asleep,"	1
he	1
added,	1
leaning	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
hasten	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
sleigh.	1
	1
Denisov	1
gave	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
"There's	1
the	1
corner	1
at	1
the	1
crossroads,	1
where	1
the	1
cabman,	1
Zakhar,	1
has	1
his	1
stand,	1
and	1
there's	1
Zakhar	1
himself	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
horse!	1
And	1
here's	1
the	1
little	1
shop	1
where	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
buy	1
gingerbread!	1
Can't	1
you	1
hurry	1
up?	1
Now	1
then!"	1
	1
"Which	1
house	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
the	1
driver.	1
	1
"Why,	1
that	1
one,	1
right	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
big	1
one.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see?	1
That's	1
our	1
house,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"Of	1
course,	1
it's	1
our	1
house!	1
Denisov,	1
Denisov!	1
We're	1
almost	1
there!"	1
	1
Denisov	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
coughed,	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
"Dmitri,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
to	1
his	1
valet	1
on	1
the	1
box,	1
"those	1
lights	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
house,	1
aren't	1
they?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
and	1
there's	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
your	1
father's	1
study."	1
	1
"Then	1
they've	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
yet?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
Mind	1
now,	1
don't	1
forget	1
to	1
put	1
out	1
my	1
new	1
coat,"	1
added	1
Rostov,	1
fingering	1
his	1
new	1
mustache.	1
"Now	1
then,	1
get	1
on,"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
driver.	1
"Do	1
wake	1
up,	1
Vaska!"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Denisov,	1
whose	1
head	1
was	1
again	1
nodding.	1
"Come,	1
get	1
on!	1
You	1
shall	1
have	1
three	1
rubles	1
for	1
vodka--get	1
on!"	1
Rostov	1
shouted,	1
when	1
the	1
sleigh	1
was	1
only	1
three	1
houses	1
from	1
his	1
door.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
not	1
moving	1
at	1
all.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
sleigh	1
bore	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
an	1
entrance,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
overhead	1
the	1
old	1
familiar	1
cornice	1
with	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
plaster	1
broken	1
off,	1
the	1
porch,	1
and	1
the	1
post	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pavement.	1
He	1
sprang	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
sleigh	1
stopped,	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
The	1
house	1
stood	1
cold	1
and	1
silent,	1
as	1
if	1
quite	1
regardless	1
of	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
"Oh	1
God!	1
Is	1
everyone	1
all	1
right?"	1
he	1
thought,	1
stopping	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart,	1
and	1
then	1
immediately	1
starting	1
to	1
run	1
along	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
up	1
the	1
warped	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
familiar	1
staircase.	1
The	1
well-known	1
old	1
door	1
handle,	1
which	1
always	1
angered	1
the	1
countess	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
properly	1
cleaned,	1
turned	1
as	1
loosely	1
as	1
ever.	1
A	1
solitary	1
tallow	1
candle	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
	1
Old	1
Michael	1
was	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
chest.	1
Prokofy,	1
the	1
footman,	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
lift	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
from	1
behind,	1
sat	1
plaiting	1
slippers	1
out	1
of	1
cloth	1
selvedges.	1
He	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
opening	1
door	1
and	1
his	1
expression	1
of	1
sleepy	1
indifference	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
delighted	1
amazement.	1
	1
"Gracious	1
heavens!	1
The	1
young	1
count!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
recognizing	1
his	1
young	1
master.	1
"Can	1
it	1
be?	1
My	1
treasure!"	1
and	1
Prokofy,	1
trembling	1
with	1
excitement,	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door,	1
probably	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
announce	1
him,	1
but,	1
changing	1
his	1
mind,	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
stooped	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"All	1
well?"	1
asked	1
Rostov,	1
drawing	1
away	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
God	1
be	1
thanked!	1
Yes!	1
They've	1
just	1
finished	1
supper.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
you,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"Is	1
everything	1
quite	1
all	1
right?"	1
	1
"The	1
Lord	1
be	1
thanked,	1
yes!"	1
	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
Denisov,	1
not	1
wishing	1
anyone	1
to	1
forestall	1
him,	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
and	1
ran	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
through	1
the	1
large	1
dark	1
ballroom.	1
All	1
was	1
the	1
same:	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
card	1
tables	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
chandelier	1
with	1
a	1
cover	1
over	1
it;	1
but	1
someone	1
had	1
already	1
seen	1
the	1
young	1
master,	1
and,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
something	1
flew	1
out	1
from	1
a	1
side	1
door	1
like	1
a	1
tornado	1
and	1
began	1
hugging	1
and	1
kissing	1
him.	1
Another	1
and	1
yet	1
another	1
creature	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
sprang	1
from	1
a	1
second	1
door	1
and	1
a	1
third;	1
more	1
hugging,	1
more	1
kissing,	1
more	1
outcries,	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
joy.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
which	1
was	1
Papa,	1
which	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
which	1
Petya.	1
Everyone	1
shouted,	1
talked,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
Only	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
he	1
noticed	1
that.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know...	1
Nicholas...	1
My	1
darling!..."	1
	1
"Here	1
he	1
is...	1
our	1
own...	1
Kolya,	1
*	1
dear	1
fellow...	1
How	1
he	1
has	1
changed!...	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
candles?...	1
Tea!..."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"And	1
me,	1
kiss	1
me!"	1
	1
"Dearest...	1
and	1
me!"	1
	1
Sonya,	1
Natasha,	1
Petya,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
Vera,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
were	1
all	1
hugging	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
serfs,	1
men	1
and	1
maids,	1
flocked	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
exclaiming	1
and	1
oh-ing	1
and	1
ah-ing.	1
	1
Petya,	1
clinging	1
to	1
his	1
legs,	1
kept	1
shouting,	1
"And	1
me	1
too!"	1
	1
Natasha,	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
pulled	1
him	1
down	1
toward	1
her	1
and	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
kisses,	1
holding	1
him	1
tight	1
by	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
coat,	1
sprang	1
away	1
and	1
pranced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
like	1
a	1
goat	1
and	1
shrieked	1
piercingly.	1
	1
All	1
around	1
were	1
loving	1
eyes	1
glistening	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
joy,	1
and	1
all	1
around	1
were	1
lips	1
seeking	1
a	1
kiss.	1
	1
Sonya	1
too,	1
all	1
rosy	1
red,	1
clung	1
to	1
his	1
arm	1
and,	1
radiant	1
with	1
bliss,	1
looked	1
eagerly	1
toward	1
his	1
eyes,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
look	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
longed.	1
Sonya	1
now	1
was	1
sixteen	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
pretty,	1
especially	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
of	1
happy,	1
rapturous	1
excitement.	1
She	1
gazed	1
at	1
him,	1
not	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
him,	1
and	1
smiling	1
and	1
holding	1
her	1
breath.	1
He	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
grateful	1
look,	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
expectant	1
and	1
looking	1
for	1
someone.	1
The	1
old	1
countess	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
But	1
now	1
steps	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
steps	1
so	1
rapid	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
his	1
mother's.	1
	1
Yet	1
it	1
was	1
she,	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
gown	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
made	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
left.	1
All	1
the	1
others	1
let	1
him	1
go,	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
her.	1
When	1
they	1
met,	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
sobbing.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
lift	1
her	1
face,	1
but	1
only	1
pressed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
cold	1
braiding	1
of	1
his	1
hussar's	1
jacket.	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
unnoticed	1
by	1
anyone,	1
stood	1
there	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
sight.	1
	1
"Vasili	1
Denisov,	1
your	1
son's	1
friend,"	1
he	1
said,	1
introducing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
most	1
welcome!	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
kissing	1
and	1
embracing	1
Denisov.	1
"Nicholas	1
wrote	1
us...	1
Natasha,	1
Vera,	1
look!	1
Here	1
is	1
Denisov!"	1
	1
The	1
same	1
happy,	1
rapturous	1
faces	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
shaggy	1
figure	1
of	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Darling	1
Denisov!"	1
screamed	1
Natasha,	1
beside	1
herself	1
with	1
rapture,	1
springing	1
to	1
him,	1
putting	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
kissing	1
him.	1
This	1
escapade	1
made	1
everybody	1
feel	1
confused.	1
Denisov	1
blushed	1
too,	1
but	1
smiled	1
and,	1
taking	1
Natasha's	1
hand,	1
kissed	1
it.	1
	1
Denisov	1
was	1
shown	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
prepared	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
all	1
gathered	1
round	1
Nicholas	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
countess,	1
not	1
letting	1
go	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
kissing	1
it	1
every	1
moment,	1
sat	1
beside	1
him:	1
the	1
rest,	1
crowding	1
round	1
him,	1
watched	1
every	1
movement,	1
word,	1
or	1
look	1
of	1
his,	1
never	1
taking	1
their	1
blissfully	1
adoring	1
eyes	1
off	1
him.	1
His	1
brother	1
and	1
sisters	1
struggled	1
for	1
the	1
places	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
disputed	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
who	1
should	1
bring	1
him	1
his	1
tea,	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
pipe.	1
	1
Rostov	1
was	1
very	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
they	1
showed	1
him;	1
but	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
meeting	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
beatific	1
that	1
his	1
present	1
joy	1
seemed	1
insufficient,	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
expecting	1
something	1
more,	1
more	1
and	1
yet	1
more.	1
	1
Next	1
morning,	1
after	1
the	1
fatigues	1
of	1
their	1
journey,	1
the	1
travelers	1
slept	1
till	1
ten	1
o'clock.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
room	1
next	1
their	1
bedroom	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
confusion	1
of	1
sabers,	1
satchels,	1
sabretaches,	1
open	1
portmanteaus,	1
and	1
dirty	1
boots.	1
Two	1
freshly	1
cleaned	1
pairs	1
with	1
spurs	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
placed	1
by	1
the	1
wall.	1
The	1
servants	1
were	1
bringing	1
in	1
jugs	1
and	1
basins,	1
hot	1
water	1
for	1
shaving,	1
and	1
their	1
well-	1
brushed	1
clothes.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
masculine	1
odor	1
and	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
tobacco.	1
	1
"Hallo,	1
Gwiska--my	1
pipe!"	1
came	1
Vasili	1
Denisov's	1
husky	1
voice.	1
"Wostov,	1
get	1
up!"	1
	1
Rostov,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
glued	1
together,	1
raised	1
his	1
disheveled	1
head	1
from	1
the	1
hot	1
pillow.	1
	1
"Why,	1
is	1
it	1
late?"	1
	1
"Late!	1
It's	1
nearly	1
ten	1
o'clock,"	1
answered	1
Natasha's	1
voice.	1
A	1
rustle	1
of	1
starched	1
petticoats	1
and	1
the	1
whispering	1
and	1
laughter	1
of	1
girls'	1
voices	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
adjoining	1
room.	1
The	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
a	1
crack	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
something	1
blue,	1
of	1
ribbons,	1
black	1
hair,	1
and	1
merry	1
faces.	1
It	1
was	1
Natasha,	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
Petya,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
up.	1
	1
"Nicholas!	1
Get	1
up!"	1
Natasha's	1
voice	1
was	1
again	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Directly!"	1
	1
Meanwhile,	1
Petya,	1
having	1
found	1
and	1
seized	1
the	1
sabers	1
in	1
the	1
outer	1
room,	1
with	1
the	1
delight	1
boys	1
feel	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
military	1
elder	1
brother,	1
and	1
forgetting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
unbecoming	1
for	1
the	1
girls	1
to	1
see	1
men	1
undressed,	1
opened	1
the	1
bedroom	1
door.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
your	1
saber?"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
The	1
girls	1
sprang	1
aside.	1
Denisov	1
hid	1
his	1
hairy	1
legs	1
under	1
the	1
blanket,	1
looking	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
face	1
at	1
his	1
comrade	1
for	1
help.	1
The	1
door,	1
having	1
let	1
Petya	1
in,	1
closed	1
again.	1
A	1
sound	1
of	1
laughter	1
came	1
from	1
behind	1
it.	1
	1
"Nicholas!	1
Come	1
out	1
in	1
your	1
dressing	1
gown!"	1
said	1
Natasha's	1
voice.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
your	1
saber?"	1
asked	1
Petya.	1
"Or	1
is	1
it	1
yours?"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
the	1
black-mustached	1
Denisov	1
with	1
servile	1
deference.	1
	1
Rostov	1
hurriedly	1
put	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
feet,	1
drew	1
on	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
one	1
spurred	1
boot	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
getting	1
her	1
foot	1
into	1
the	1
other.	1
Sonya,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in,	1
was	1
twirling	1
round	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
expand	1
her	1
dresses	1
into	1
a	1
balloon	1
and	1
sit	1
down.	1
They	1
were	1
dressed	1
alike,	1
in	1
new	1
pale-blue	1
frocks,	1
and	1
were	1
both	1
fresh,	1
rosy,	1
and	1
bright.	1
Sonya	1
ran	1
away,	1
but	1
Natasha,	1
taking	1
her	1
brother's	1
arm,	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
where	1
they	1
began	1
talking.	1
They	1
hardly	1
gave	1
one	1
another	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
questions	1
and	1
give	1
replies	1
concerning	1
a	1
thousand	1
little	1
matters	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
interest	1
anyone	1
but	1
themselves.	1
Natasha	1
laughed	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
said	1
or	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
herself,	1
not	1
because	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
was	1
amusing,	1
but	1
because	1
she	1
felt	1
happy	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
control	1
her	1
joy	1
which	1
expressed	1
itself	1
by	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
nice,	1
how	1
splendid!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
everything.	1
	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
that,	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
warm	1
rays	1
of	1
love,	1
that	1
childlike	1
smile	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
since	1
he	1
left	1
home	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
after	1
eighteen	1
months	1
again	1
brightened	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
listen,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"now	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
a	1
man,	1
aren't	1
you?	1
I'm	1
awfully	1
glad	1
you're	1
my	1
brother."	1
She	1
touched	1
his	1
mustache.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
men	1
are	1
like.	1
Are	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
we?	1
No?"	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
Sonya	1
run	1
away?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes!	1
That's	1
a	1
whole	1
long	1
story!	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her--	1
thou	1
or	1
you?"	1
	1
"As	1
may	1
happen,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"No,	1
call	1
her	1
you,	1
please!	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
some	1
other	1
time.	1
No,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
now.	1
You	1
know	1
Sonya's	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend.	1
Such	1
a	1
friend	1
that	1
I	1
burned	1
my	1
arm	1
for	1
her	1
sake.	1
Look	1
here!"	1
	1
She	1
pulled	1
up	1
her	1
muslin	1
sleeve	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
a	1
red	1
scar	1
on	1
her	1
long,	1
slender,	1
delicate	1
arm,	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
elbow	1
on	1
that	1
part	1
that	1
is	1
covered	1
even	1
by	1
a	1
ball	1
dress.	1
	1
"I	1
burned	1
this	1
to	1
prove	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
her.	1
I	1
just	1
heated	1
a	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
there!"	1
	1
Sitting	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
cushions	1
on	1
its	1
arms,	1
in	1
what	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
old	1
schoolroom,	1
and	1
looking	1
into	1
Natasha's	1
wildly	1
bright	1
eyes,	1
Rostov	1
re-entered	1
that	1
world	1
of	1
home	1
and	1
childhood	1
which	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
for	1
anyone	1
else,	1
but	1
gave	1
him	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
joys	1
of	1
his	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
an	1
arm	1
with	1
a	1
ruler	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
love	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
senseless,	1
he	1
understood	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
is	1
that	1
all?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
such	1
friends,	1
such	1
friends!	1
All	1
that	1
ruler	1
business	1
was	1
just	1
nonsense,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
friends	1
forever.	1
She,	1
if	1
she	1
loves	1
anyone,	1
does	1
it	1
for	1
life,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
that,	1
I	1
forget	1
quickly."	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
she	1
loves	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
flushed.	1
	1
"Why,	1
you	1
remember	1
before	1
you	1
went	1
away?...	1
Well,	1
she	1
says	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
forget	1
all	1
that....	1
She	1
says:	1
'I	1
shall	1
love	1
him	1
always,	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
free.'	1
Isn't	1
that	1
lovely	1
and	1
noble!	1
Yes,	1
very	1
noble?	1
Isn't	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
so	1
seriously	1
and	1
excitedly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
saying	1
she	1
had	1
talked	1
of	1
before,	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
Rostov	1
became	1
thoughtful.	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
go	1
back	1
on	1
my	1
word,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Besides,	1
Sonya	1
is	1
so	1
charming	1
that	1
only	1
a	1
fool	1
would	1
renounce	1
such	1
happiness."	1
	1
"No,	1
no!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
"she	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
talked	1
it	1
over.	1
We	1
knew	1
you'd	1
say	1
so.	1
But	1
it	1
won't	1
do,	1
because	1
you	1
see,	1
if	1
you	1
say	1
that--if	1
you	1
consider	1
yourself	1
bound	1
by	1
your	1
promise--it	1
will	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
meant	1
it	1
seriously.	1
It	1
makes	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
marrying	1
her	1
because	1
you	1
must,	1
and	1
that	1
wouldn't	1
do	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
well	1
considered	1
by	1
them.	1
Sonya	1
had	1
already	1
struck	1
him	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
on	1
the	1
preceding	1
day.	1
Today,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her,	1
she	1
seemed	1
still	1
more	1
lovely.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
charming	1
girl	1
of	1
sixteen,	1
evidently	1
passionately	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
(he	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
instant).	1
Why	1
should	1
he	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
now,	1
and	1
even	1
marry	1
her,	1
Rostov	1
thought,	1
but	1
just	1
now	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
pleasures	1
and	1
interests	1
before	1
him!	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
a	1
wise	1
decision,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"I	1
must	1
remain	1
free."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
that's	1
excellent,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"We'll	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
later	1
on.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
have	1
you!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
are	1
you	1
still	1
true	1
to	1
Boris?"	1
he	1
continued.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
nonsense!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
laughing.	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
about	1
him	1
or	1
anyone	1
else,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind."	1
	1
"Dear	1
me!	1
Then	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
now?"	1
	1
"Now?"	1
repeated	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
a	1
happy	1
smile	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
face.	1
"Have	1
you	1
seen	1
Duport?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"Not	1
seen	1
Duport--the	1
famous	1
dancer?	1
Well	1
then,	1
you	1
won't	1
understand.	1
That's	1
what	1
I'm	1
up	1
to."	1
	1
Curving	1
her	1
arms,	1
Natasha	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
skirts	1
as	1
dancers	1
do,	1
ran	1
back	1
a	1
few	1
steps,	1
turned,	1
cut	1
a	1
caper,	1
brought	1
her	1
little	1
feet	1
sharply	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
some	1
steps	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
tips	1
of	1
her	1
toes.	1
	1
"See,	1
I'm	1
standing!	1
See!"	1
she	1
said,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
maintain	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
toes	1
any	1
longer.	1
"So	1
that's	1
what	1
I'm	1
up	1
to!	1
I'll	1
never	1
marry	1
anyone,	1
but	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
dancer.	1
Only	1
don't	1
tell	1
anyone."	1
	1
Rostov	1
laughed	1
so	1
loud	1
and	1
merrily	1
that	1
Denisov,	1
in	1
his	1
bedroom,	1
felt	1
envious	1
and	1
Natasha	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
joining	1
in.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
don't	1
you	1
think	1
it's	1
nice?"	1
she	1
kept	1
repeating.	1
	1
"Nice!	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
no	1
longer	1
wish	1
to	1
marry	1
Boris?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
flared	1
up.	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
marry	1
anyone.	1
And	1
I'll	1
tell	1
him	1
so	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
him!"	1
	1
"Dear	1
me!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
all	1
rubbish,"	1
Natasha	1
chattered	1
on.	1
"And	1
is	1
Denisov	1
nice?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
indeed!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well	1
then,	1
good-by:	1
go	1
and	1
dress.	1
Is	1
he	1
very	1
terrible,	1
Denisov?"	1
	1
"Why	1
terrible?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
"No,	1
Vaska	1
is	1
a	1
splendid	1
fellow."	1
	1
"You	1
call	1
him	1
Vaska?	1
That's	1
funny!	1
And	1
is	1
he	1
very	1
nice?"	1
	1
"Very."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
be	1
quick.	1
We'll	1
all	1
have	1
breakfast	1
together."	1
	1
And	1
Natasha	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
on	1
tiptoe,	1
like	1
a	1
ballet	1
dancer,	1
but	1
smiling	1
as	1
only	1
happy	1
girls	1
of	1
fifteen	1
can	1
smile.	1
When	1
Rostov	1
met	1
Sonya	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
he	1
reddened.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
with	1
her.	1
The	1
evening	1
before,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
happy	1
moment	1
of	1
meeting,	1
they	1
had	1
kissed	1
each	1
other,	1
but	1
today	1
they	1
felt	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done;	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
everybody,	1
including	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters,	1
was	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
watching	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
behave	1
with	1
her.	1
He	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
not	1
as	1
thou	1
but	1
as	1
you--Sonya.	1
But	1
their	1
eyes	1
met	1
and	1
said	1
thou,	1
and	1
exchanged	1
tender	1
kisses.	1
Her	1
looks	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
for	1
having	1
dared,	1
by	1
Natasha's	1
intermediacy,	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
promise,	1
and	1
then	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
love.	1
His	1
looks	1
thanked	1
her	1
for	1
offering	1
him	1
his	1
freedom	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
for	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
impossible.	1
	1
"How	1
strange	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
Vera,	1
selecting	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
all	1
were	1
silent,	1
"that	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
now	1
say	1
you	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
meet	1
like	1
strangers."	1
	1
Vera's	1
remark	1
was	1
correct,	1
as	1
her	1
remarks	1
always	1
were,	1
but,	1
like	1
most	1
of	1
her	1
observations,	1
it	1
made	1
everyone	1
feel	1
uncomfortable,	1
not	1
only	1
Sonya,	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
who--dreading	1
this	1
love	1
affair	1
which	1
might	1
hinder	1
Nicholas	1
from	1
making	1
a	1
brilliant	1
match--	1
blushed	1
like	1
a	1
girl.	1
	1
Denisov,	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
surprise,	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
pomaded	1
hair,	1
perfumed,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
uniform,	1
looking	1
just	1
as	1
smart	1
as	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
when	1
going	1
into	1
battle,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
amiable	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
than	1
Rostov	1
had	1
ever	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
On	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
the	1
army,	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
was	1
welcomed	1
by	1
his	1
home	1
circle	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
sons,	1
a	1
hero,	1
and	1
their	1
darling	1
Nikolenka;	1
by	1
his	1
relations	1
as	1
a	1
charming,	1
attractive,	1
and	1
polite	1
young	1
man;	1
by	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
as	1
a	1
handsome	1
lieutenant	1
of	1
hussars,	1
a	1
good	1
dancer,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
matches	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
knew	1
everybody	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
had	1
money	1
enough	1
that	1
year,	1
as	1
all	1
his	1
estates	1
had	1
been	1
remortgaged,	1
and	1
so	1
Nicholas,	1
acquiring	1
a	1
trotter	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
very	1
stylish	1
riding	1
breeches	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
cut,	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
yet	1
had	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
boots	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion,	1
with	1
extremely	1
pointed	1
toes	1
and	1
small	1
silver	1
spurs,	1
passed	1
his	1
time	1
very	1
gaily.	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
period	1
of	1
adapting	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
conditions	1
of	1
life,	1
Nicholas	1
found	1
it	1
very	1
pleasant	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
again.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
and	1
matured	1
very	1
much.	1
His	1
despair	1
at	1
failing	1
in	1
a	1
Scripture	1
examination,	1
his	1
borrowing	1
money	1
from	1
Gavril	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
sleigh	1
driver,	1
his	1
kissing	1
Sonya	1
on	1
the	1
sly--he	1
now	1
recalled	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
childishness	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
immeasurably	1
behind.	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
lieutenant	1
of	1
hussars,	1
in	1
a	1
jacket	1
laced	1
with	1
silver,	1
and	1
wearing	1
the	1
Cross	1
of	1
St.	1
George,	1
awarded	1
to	1
soldiers	1
for	1
bravery	1
in	1
action,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
well-known,	1
elderly,	1
and	1
respected	1
racing	1
men	1
was	1
training	1
a	1
trotter	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
for	1
a	1
race.	1
He	1
knew	1
a	1
lady	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
boulevards	1
whom	1
he	1
visited	1
of	1
an	1
evening.	1
He	1
led	1
the	1
mazurka	1
at	1
the	1
Arkharovs'	1
ball,	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Field	1
Marshal	1
Kamenski,	1
visited	1
the	1
English	1
Club,	1
and	1
was	1
on	1
intimate	1
terms	1
with	1
a	1
colonel	1
of	1
forty	1
to	1
whom	1
Denisov	1
had	1
introduced	1
him.	1
	1
His	1
passion	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
cooled	1
somewhat	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
still,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
seeing	1
him,	1
he	1
often	1
spoke	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
about	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
letting	1
it	1
be	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
all	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
feelings	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
not	1
everyone	1
could	1
understand,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
he	1
shared	1
the	1
adoration	1
then	1
common	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
who	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
the	1
"angel	1
incarnate."	1
	1
During	1
Rostov's	1
short	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
before	1
rejoining	1
the	1
army,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
draw	1
closer	1
to	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
rather	1
drifted	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
sweet,	1
and	1
evidently	1
deeply	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
youth	1
when	1
there	1
seems	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
fears	1
to	1
bind	1
himself	1
and	1
prizes	1
his	1
freedom	1
which	1
he	1
needs	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
things.	1
When	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
during	1
this	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"Ah,	1
there	1
will	1
be,	1
and	1
there	1
are,	1
many	1
more	1
such	1
girls	1
somewhere	1
whom	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
yet	1
know.	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
love	1
when	1
I	1
want	1
to,	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
time."	1
Besides,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
women	1
was	1
rather	1
derogatory	1
to	1
his	1
manhood.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
balls	1
and	1
into	1
ladies'	1
society	1
with	1
an	1
affectation	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
against	1
his	1
will.	1
The	1
races,	1
the	1
English	1
Club,	1
sprees	1
with	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
visits	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
house--that	1
was	1
another	1
matter	1
and	1
quite	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
dashing	1
young	1
hussar!	1
	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
March,	1
old	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
was	1
very	1
busy	1
arranging	1
a	1
dinner	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
Club.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
hall	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
giving	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
steward	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
famous	1
Feoktist,	1
the	1
club's	1
head	1
cook,	1
about	1
asparagus,	1
fresh	1
cucumbers,	1
strawberries,	1
veal,	1
and	1
fish	1
for	1
this	1
dinner.	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
member	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
committee	1
of	1
the	1
club	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
founded.	1
To	1
him	1
the	1
club	1
entrusted	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
festival	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
Bagration,	1
for	1
few	1
men	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
feast	1
on	1
an	1
open-handed,	1
hospitable	1
scale,	1
and	1
still	1
fewer	1
men	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
well	1
able	1
and	1
willing	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
resources	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
fete.	1
The	1
club	1
cook	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
orders	1
with	1
pleased	1
faces,	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
under	1
no	1
other	1
management	1
could	1
they	1
so	1
easily	1
extract	1
a	1
good	1
profit	1
for	1
themselves	1
from	1
a	1
dinner	1
costing	1
several	1
thousand	1
rubles.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
mind	1
and	1
have	1
cocks'	1
comb	1
in	1
the	1
turtle	1
soup,	1
you	1
know!"	1
	1
"Shall	1
we	1
have	1
three	1
cold	1
dishes	1
then?"	1
asked	1
the	1
cook.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
considered.	1
	1
"We	1
can't	1
have	1
less--yes,	1
three...	1
the	1
mayonnaise,	1
that's	1
one,"	1
said	1
he,	1
bending	1
down	1
a	1
finger.	1
	1
"Then	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
order	1
those	1
large	1
sterlets?"	1
asked	1
the	1
steward.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped	1
if	1
they	1
won't	1
take	1
less.	1
Ah,	1
dear	1
me!	1
I	1
was	1
forgetting.	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
another	1
entree.	1
Ah,	1
goodness	1
gracious!"	1
he	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
head.	1
"Who	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
me	1
the	1
flowers?	1
Dmitri!	1
Eh,	1
Dmitri!	1
Gallop	1
off	1
to	1
our	1
Moscow	1
estate,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
factotum	1
who	1
appeared	1
at	1
his	1
call.	1
"Hurry	1
off	1
and	1
tell	1
Maksim,	1
the	1
gardener,	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
serfs	1
to	1
work.	1
Say	1
that	1
everything	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hothouses	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
here	1
well	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
felt.	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
two	1
hundred	1
pots	1
here	1
on	1
Friday."	1
	1
Having	1
given	1
several	1
more	1
orders,	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
"little	1
countess"	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
rest,	1
but	1
remembering	1
something	1
else	1
of	1
importance,	1
he	1
returned	1
again,	1
called	1
back	1
the	1
cook	1
and	1
the	1
club	1
steward,	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
giving	1
orders.	1
A	1
light	1
footstep	1
and	1
the	1
clinking	1
of	1
spurs	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
count,	1
handsome,	1
rosy,	1
with	1
a	1
dark	1
little	1
mustache,	1
evidently	1
rested	1
and	1
made	1
sleeker	1
by	1
his	1
easy	1
life	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
boy,	1
my	1
head's	1
in	1
a	1
whirl!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
confused	1
before	1
his	1
son.	1
"Now,	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
only	1
help	1
a	1
bit!	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
singers	1
too.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
my	1
own	1
orchestra,	1
but	1
shouldn't	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
gypsy	1
singers	1
as	1
well?	1
You	1
military	1
men	1
like	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing."	1
	1
"Really,	1
Papa,	1
I	1
believe	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
worried	1
himself	1
less	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
than	1
you	1
do	1
now,"	1
said	1
his	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
angry.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
talk,	1
but	1
try	1
it	1
yourself!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
count	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
cook,	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
shrewd	1
and	1
respectful	1
expression,	1
looked	1
observantly	1
and	1
sympathetically	1
at	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
come	1
to	1
nowadays,	1
eh,	1
Feoktist?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Laughing	1
at	1
us	1
old	1
fellows!"	1
	1
"That's	1
so,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
all	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
eat	1
a	1
good	1
dinner,	1
but	1
providing	1
it	1
and	1
serving	1
it	1
all	1
up,	1
that's	1
not	1
their	1
business!"	1
	1
"That's	1
it,	1
that's	1
it!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
gaily	1
seizing	1
his	1
son	1
by	1
both	1
hands,	1
he	1
cried,	1
"Now	1
I've	1
got	1
you,	1
so	1
take	1
the	1
sleigh	1
and	1
pair	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Bezukhov's,	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
'Count	1
Ilya	1
has	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
strawberries	1
and	1
fresh	1
pineapples.'	1
We	1
can't	1
get	1
them	1
from	1
anyone	1
else.	1
He's	1
not	1
there	1
himself,	1
so	1
you'll	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
ask	1
the	1
princesses;	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
Rasgulyay--the	1
coachman	1
Ipatka	1
knows--and	1
look	1
up	1
the	1
gypsy	1
Ilyushka,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
danced	1
at	1
Count	1
Orlov's,	1
you	1
remember,	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
Cossack	1
coat,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
along	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"And	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
gypsy	1
girls	1
along	1
with	1
him?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas,	1
laughing.	1
"Dear,	1
dear!..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
with	1
noiseless	1
footsteps	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
businesslike,	1
preoccupied,	1
yet	1
meekly	1
Christian	1
look	1
which	1
never	1
left	1
her	1
face,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
entered	1
the	1
hall.	1
Though	1
she	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
every	1
day,	1
he	1
invariably	1
became	1
confused	1
and	1
begged	1
her	1
to	1
excuse	1
his	1
costume.	1
	1
"No	1
matter	1
at	1
all,	1
my	1
dear	1
count,"	1
she	1
said,	1
meekly	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"But	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
Bezukhov's	1
myself.	1
Pierre	1
has	1
arrived,	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
shall	1
get	1
anything	1
we	1
want	1
from	1
his	1
hothouses.	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
any	1
case.	1
He	1
has	1
forwarded	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Boris.	1
Thank	1
God,	1
Boris	1
is	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
staff."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
delighted	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
taking	1
upon	1
herself	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
commissions	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
small	1
closed	1
carriage	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"Tell	1
Bezukhov	1
to	1
come.	1
I'll	1
put	1
his	1
name	1
down.	1
Is	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
him?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
turned	1
up	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
profound	1
sadness	1
was	1
depicted	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
unfortunate,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"If	1
what	1
we	1
hear	1
is	1
true,	1
it	1
is	1
dreadful.	1
How	1
little	1
we	1
dreamed	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
his	1
happiness!	1
And	1
such	1
a	1
lofty	1
angelic	1
soul	1
as	1
young	1
Bezukhov!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
pity	1
him	1
from	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
what	1
consolation	1
I	1
can."	1
	1
"Wh-what	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
asked	1
both	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
sighed	1
deeply.	1
	1
"Dolokhov,	1
Mary	1
Ivanovna's	1
son,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
mysterious	1
whisper,	1
"has	1
compromised	1
her	1
completely,	1
they	1
say.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
now...	1
she	1
has	1
come	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
daredevil	1
after	1
her!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
sympathy	1
for	1
Pierre,	1
but	1
by	1
involuntary	1
intonations	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
smile	1
betraying	1
her	1
sympathy	1
for	1
the	1
"daredevil,"	1
as	1
she	1
called	1
Dolokhov.	1
"They	1
say	1
Pierre	1
is	1
quite	1
broken	1
by	1
his	1
misfortune."	1
	1
"Dear,	1
dear!	1
But	1
still	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
club--it	1
will	1
all	1
blow	1
over.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
tremendous	1
banquet."	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
the	1
third	1
of	1
March,	1
soon	1
after	1
one	1
o'clock,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
and	1
fifty	1
guests	1
were	1
awaiting	1
the	1
guest	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
campaign,	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
first	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
bewildered.	1
At	1
that	1
time,	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
victories	1
that	1
on	1
receiving	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
defeat	1
some	1
would	1
simply	1
not	1
believe	1
it,	1
while	1
others	1
sought	1
some	1
extraordinary	1
explanation	1
of	1
so	1
strange	1
an	1
event.	1
In	1
the	1
English	1
Club,	1
where	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
distinguished,	1
important,	1
and	1
well	1
informed	1
foregathered	1
when	1
the	1
news	1
began	1
to	1
arrive	1
in	1
December,	1
nothing	1
was	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
battle,	1
as	1
though	1
all	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
of	1
silence.	1
The	1
men	1
who	1
set	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
conversation--Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
Prince	1
Yuri	1
Dolgorukov,	1
Valuev,	1
Count	1
Markov,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vyazemski--did	1
not	1
show	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
club,	1
but	1
met	1
in	1
private	1
houses	1
in	1
intimate	1
circles,	1
and	1
the	1
Moscovites	1
who	1
took	1
their	1
opinions	1
from	1
others--Ilya	1
Rostov	1
among	1
them--remained	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
without	1
any	1
definite	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
without	1
leaders.	1
The	1
Moscovites	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
bad	1
news	1
was	1
difficult,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
best	1
to	1
be	1
silent.	1
But	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
jury	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
room,	1
the	1
bigwigs	1
who	1
guided	1
the	1
club's	1
opinion	1
reappeared,	1
and	1
everybody	1
began	1
speaking	1
clearly	1
and	1
definitely.	1
Reasons	1
were	1
found	1
for	1
the	1
incredible,	1
unheard-	1
of,	1
and	1
impossible	1
event	1
of	1
a	1
Russian	1
defeat,	1
everything	1
became	1
clear,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
corners	1
of	1
Moscow	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
said.	1
These	1
reasons	1
were	1
the	1
treachery	1
of	1
the	1
Austrians,	1
a	1
defective	1
commissariat,	1
the	1
treachery	1
of	1
the	1
Pole	1
Przebyszewski	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
Langeron,	1
Kutuzov's	1
incapacity,	1
and	1
(it	1
was	1
whispered)	1
the	1
youth	1
and	1
inexperience	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
who	1
had	1
trusted	1
worthless	1
and	1
insignificant	1
people.	1
But	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
everyone	1
declared,	1
was	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
had	1
achieved	1
miracles	1
of	1
valor.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
officers,	1
and	1
generals	1
were	1
heroes.	1
But	1
the	1
hero	1
of	1
heroes	1
was	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
affair	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
retreat	1
from	1
Austerlitz,	1
where	1
he	1
alone	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
his	1
column	1
unbroken	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
day	1
beaten	1
back	1
an	1
enemy	1
force	1
twice	1
as	1
numerous	1
as	1
his	1
own.	1
What	1
also	1
conduced	1
to	1
Bagration's	1
being	1
selected	1
as	1
Moscow's	1
hero	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
connections	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
stranger	1
there.	1
In	1
his	1
person,	1
honor	1
was	1
shown	1
to	1
a	1
simple	1
fighting	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
without	1
connections	1
and	1
intrigues,	1
and	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
associated	1
by	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
Italian	1
campaign	1
with	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Suvorov.	1
Moreover,	1
paying	1
such	1
honor	1
to	1
Bagration	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
of	1
expressing	1
disapproval	1
and	1
dislike	1
of	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"Had	1
there	1
been	1
no	1
Bagration,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
necessary	1
to	1
invent	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
wit	1
Shinshin,	1
parodying	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Voltaire.	1
Kutuzov	1
no	1
one	1
spoke	1
of,	1
except	1
some	1
who	1
abused	1
him	1
in	1
whispers,	1
calling	1
him	1
a	1
court	1
weathercock	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
satyr.	1
	1
All	1
Moscow	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov's	1
saying:	1
"If	1
you	1
go	1
on	1
modeling	1
and	1
modeling	1
you	1
must	1
get	1
smeared	1
with	1
clay,"	1
suggesting	1
consolation	1
for	1
our	1
defeat	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
former	1
victories;	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rostopchin,	1
that	1
French	1
soldiers	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
incited	1
to	1
battle	1
by	1
highfalutin	1
words,	1
and	1
Germans	1
by	1
logical	1
arguments	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
dangerous	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
than	1
to	1
advance,	1
but	1
that	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
only	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
restrained	1
and	1
held	1
back!	1
On	1
all	1
sides,	1
new	1
and	1
fresh	1
anecdotes	1
were	1
heard	1
of	1
individual	1
examples	1
of	1
heroism	1
shown	1
by	1
our	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
at	1
Austerlitz.	1
One	1
had	1
saved	1
a	1
standard,	1
another	1
had	1
killed	1
five	1
Frenchmen,	1
a	1
third	1
had	1
loaded	1
five	1
cannon	1
singlehanded.	1
Berg	1
was	1
mentioned,	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him,	1
as	1
having,	1
when	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
taken	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
gone	1
forward.	1
Of	1
Bolkonski,	1
nothing	1
was	1
said,	1
and	1
only	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
intimately	1
regretted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
died	1
so	1
young,	1
leaving	1
a	1
pregnant	1
wife	1
with	1
his	1
eccentric	1
father.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
On	1
that	1
third	1
of	1
March,	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
a	1
hum	1
of	1
conversation,	1
like	1
the	1
hum	1
of	1
bees	1
swarming	1
in	1
springtime.	1
The	1
members	1
and	1
guests	1
of	1
the	1
club	1
wandered	1
hither	1
and	1
thither,	1
sat,	1
stood,	1
met,	1
and	1
separated,	1
some	1
in	1
uniform	1
and	1
some	1
in	1
evening	1
dress,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
with	1
powdered	1
hair	1
and	1
in	1
Russian	1
kaftans.	1
Powdered	1
footmen,	1
in	1
livery	1
with	1
buckled	1
shoes	1
and	1
smart	1
stockings,	1
stood	1
at	1
every	1
door	1
anxiously	1
noting	1
visitors'	1
every	1
movement	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
offer	1
their	1
services.	1
Most	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
were	1
elderly,	1
respected	1
men	1
with	1
broad,	1
self-confident	1
faces,	1
fat	1
fingers,	1
and	1
resolute	1
gestures	1
and	1
voices.	1
This	1
class	1
of	1
guests	1
and	1
members	1
sat	1
in	1
certain	1
habitual	1
places	1
and	1
met	1
in	1
certain	1
habitual	1
groups.	1
A	1
minority	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
were	1
casual	1
guests--chiefly	1
young	1
men,	1
among	1
whom	1
were	1
Denisov,	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
Dolokhov--who	1
was	1
now	1
again	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment.	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
these	1
young	1
people,	1
especially	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
military	1
men,	1
bore	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
condescending	1
respect	1
for	1
their	1
elders	1
which	1
seems	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
older	1
generation,	1
"We	1
are	1
prepared	1
to	1
respect	1
and	1
honor	1
you,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
future	1
belongs	1
to	1
us."	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
was	1
there	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
club.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
at	1
his	1
wife's	1
command	1
had	1
let	1
his	1
hair	1
grow	1
and	1
abandoned	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
went	1
about	1
the	1
rooms	1
fashionably	1
dressed	1
but	1
looking	1
sad	1
and	1
dull.	1
Here,	1
as	1
elsewhere,	1
he	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
subservience	1
to	1
his	1
wealth,	1
and	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
lording	1
it	1
over	1
these	1
people,	1
he	1
treated	1
them	1
with	1
absent-minded	1
contempt.	1
	1
By	1
his	1
age	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
younger	1
men,	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
connections	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
groups	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
honored	1
guests,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
from	1
one	1
group	1
to	1
another.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
old	1
men	1
were	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
groups	1
which	1
even	1
strangers	1
approached	1
respectfully	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
well-known	1
men.	1
The	1
largest	1
circles	1
formed	1
round	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
Valuev,	1
and	1
Naryshkin.	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
describing	1
how	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
been	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
flying	1
Austrians	1
and	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
force	1
their	1
way	1
through	1
them	1
with	1
bayonets.	1
	1
Valuev	1
was	1
confidentially	1
telling	1
that	1
Uvarov	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
ascertain	1
what	1
Moscow	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
Austerlitz.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
circle,	1
Naryshkin	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
Council	1
of	1
War	1
at	1
which	1
Suvorov	1
crowed	1
like	1
a	1
cock	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
nonsense	1
talked	1
by	1
the	1
Austrian	1
generals.	1
Shinshin,	1
standing	1
close	1
by,	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
joke,	1
saying	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
evidently	1
failed	1
to	1
learn	1
from	1
Suvorov	1
even	1
so	1
simple	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
crowing	1
like	1
a	1
cock,	1
but	1
the	1
elder	1
members	1
glanced	1
severely	1
at	1
the	1
wit,	1
making	1
him	1
feel	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
it	1
was	1
improper	1
to	1
speak	1
so	1
of	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
hurried	1
and	1
preoccupied,	1
went	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
soft	1
boots	1
between	1
the	1
dining	1
and	1
drawing	1
rooms,	1
hastily	1
greeting	1
the	1
important	1
and	1
unimportant,	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
knew,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
equals,	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
occasionally	1
sought	1
out	1
his	1
fine	1
well-set-up	1
young	1
son,	1
resting	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
winking	1
joyfully	1
at	1
him.	1
Young	1
Rostov	1
stood	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
with	1
Dolokhov,	1
whose	1
acquaintance	1
he	1
had	1
lately	1
made	1
and	1
highly	1
valued.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
pressed	1
Dolokhov's	1
hand.	1
	1
"Please	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
us...	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
brave	1
boy...	1
been	1
together	1
out	1
there...	1
both	1
playing	1
the	1
hero...	1
Ah,	1
Vasili	1
Ignatovich...	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do,	1
old	1
fellow?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
passing,	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
greeting	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
stir,	1
and	1
a	1
footman	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
in	1
announced,	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
face:	1
"He's	1
arrived!"	1
	1
Bells	1
rang,	1
the	1
stewards	1
rushed	1
forward,	1
and--like	1
rye	1
shaken	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
shovel--the	1
guests	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
scattered	1
about	1
in	1
different	1
rooms	1
came	1
together	1
and	1
crowded	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
drawing	1
room	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
	1
Bagration	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
of	1
the	1
anteroom	1
without	1
hat	1
or	1
sword,	1
which,	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
club	1
custom,	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
porter.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
lambskin	1
cap	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
nor	1
had	1
he	1
a	1
loaded	1
whip	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
as	1
when	1
Rostov	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
but	1
wore	1
a	1
tight	1
new	1
uniform	1
with	1
Russian	1
and	1
foreign	1
Orders,	1
and	1
the	1
Star	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
breast.	1
Evidently	1
just	1
before	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
dinner	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
whiskers	1
trimmed,	1
which	1
changed	1
his	1
appearance	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
naively	1
festive	1
in	1
his	1
air,	1
which,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
his	1
firm	1
and	1
virile	1
features,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
rather	1
comical	1
expression.	1
Bekleshev	1
and	1
Theodore	1
Uvarov,	1
who	1
had	1
arrived	1
with	1
him,	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
doorway	1
to	1
allow	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
guest	1
of	1
honor,	1
to	1
enter	1
first.	1
Bagration	1
was	1
embarrassed,	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
avail	1
himself	1
of	1
their	1
courtesy,	1
and	1
this	1
caused	1
some	1
delay	1
at	1
the	1
doors,	1
but	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
enter	1
first.	1
He	1
walked	1
shyly	1
and	1
awkwardly	1
over	1
the	1
parquet	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
reception	1
room,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
hands;	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
accustomed	1
to	1
walk	1
over	1
a	1
plowed	1
field	1
under	1
fire,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Kursk	1
regiment	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern--and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
easier.	1
The	1
committeemen	1
met	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
door	1
and,	1
expressing	1
their	1
delight	1
at	1
seeing	1
such	1
a	1
highly	1
honored	1
guest,	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
reply,	1
surrounded	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
impossible	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door	1
for	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
members	1
and	1
guests	1
jostling	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
Bagration	1
over	1
each	1
other's	1
shoulders,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
some	1
rare	1
animal.	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
laughing	1
and	1
repeating	1
the	1
words,	1
"Make	1
way,	1
dear	1
boy!	1
Make	1
way,	1
make	1
way!"	1
pushed	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
more	1
energetically	1
than	1
anyone,	1
led	1
the	1
guests	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
and	1
seated	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
center	1
sofa.	1
The	1
bigwigs,	1
the	1
most	1
respected	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
club,	1
beset	1
the	1
new	1
arrivals.	1
Count	1
Ilya,	1
again	1
thrusting	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
crowd,	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
reappeared	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
with	1
another	1
committeeman,	1
carrying	1
a	1
large	1
silver	1
salver	1
which	1
he	1
presented	1
to	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
On	1
the	1
salver	1
lay	1
some	1
verses	1
composed	1
and	1
printed	1
in	1
the	1
hero's	1
honor.	1
Bagration,	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
salver,	1
glanced	1
around	1
in	1
dismay,	1
as	1
though	1
seeking	1
help.	1
But	1
all	1
eyes	1
demanded	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
submit.	1
Feeling	1
himself	1
in	1
their	1
power,	1
he	1
resolutely	1
took	1
the	1
salver	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
reproachfully	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
who	1
had	1
presented	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
Someone	1
obligingly	1
took	1
the	1
dish	1
from	1
Bagration	1
(or	1
he	1
would,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
have	1
held	1
it	1
till	1
evening	1
and	1
have	1
gone	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
it)	1
and	1
drew	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
verses.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
them,	1
then!"	1
Bagration	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
and,	1
fixing	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
paper,	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
fixed	1
and	1
serious	1
expression.	1
But	1
the	1
author	1
himself	1
took	1
the	1
verses	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
them	1
aloud.	1
Bagration	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
listened:	1
	1
	1
Bring	1
glory	1
then	1
to	1
Alexander's	1
reign	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
our	1
Titus	1
shield.	1
A	1
dreaded	1
foe	1
be	1
thou,	1
kindhearted	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
A	1
Rhipheus	1
at	1
home,	1
a	1
Caesar	1
in	1
the	1
field!	1
E'en	1
fortunate	1
Napoleon	1
Knows	1
by	1
experience,	1
now,	1
Bagration,	1
And	1
dare	1
not	1
Herculean	1
Russians	1
trouble...	1
	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
reading,	1
a	1
stentorian	1
major-domo	1
announced	1
that	1
dinner	1
was	1
ready!	1
The	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
came	1
the	1
resounding	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
polonaise:	1
	1
	1
Conquest's	1
joyful	1
thunder	1
waken,	1
Triumph,	1
valiant	1
Russians,	1
now!...	1
	1
and	1
Count	1
Rostov,	1
glancing	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
author	1
who	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
his	1
verses,	1
bowed	1
to	1
Bagration.	1
Everyone	1
rose,	1
feeling	1
that	1
dinner	1
was	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
verses,	1
and	1
Bagration,	1
again	1
preceding	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
dinner.	1
He	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
honor	1
between	1
two	1
Alexanders--Bekleshev	1
and	1
Naryshkin--which	1
was	1
a	1
significant	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign.	1
Three	1
hundred	1
persons	1
took	1
their	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
rank	1
and	1
importance:	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
honored	1
guest,	1
as	1
naturally	1
as	1
water	1
flows	1
deepest	1
where	1
the	1
land	1
lies	1
lowest.	1
	1
Just	1
before	1
dinner,	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
presented	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
Bagration,	1
who	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him,	1
disjointed	1
and	1
awkward,	1
as	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
spoke	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
looked	1
joyfully	1
and	1
proudly	1
around	1
while	1
Bagration	1
spoke	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
Denisov	1
and	1
his	1
new	1
acquaintance,	1
Dolokhov,	1
sat	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
Facing	1
them	1
sat	1
Pierre,	1
beside	1
Prince	1
Nesvitski.	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
sat	1
facing	1
Bagration	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
very	1
personification	1
of	1
Moscow	1
hospitality,	1
did	1
the	1
honors	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
His	1
efforts	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
vain.	1
The	1
dinner,	1
both	1
the	1
Lenten	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
fare,	1
was	1
splendid,	1
yet	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
meal.	1
He	1
winked	1
at	1
the	1
butler,	1
whispered	1
directions	1
to	1
the	1
footmen,	1
and	1
awaited	1
each	1
expected	1
dish	1
with	1
some	1
anxiety.	1
Everything	1
was	1
excellent.	1
With	1
the	1
second	1
course,	1
a	1
gigantic	1
sterlet	1
(at	1
sight	1
of	1
which	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
blushed	1
with	1
self-conscious	1
pleasure),	1
the	1
footmen	1
began	1
popping	1
corks	1
and	1
filling	1
the	1
champagne	1
glasses.	1
After	1
the	1
fish,	1
which	1
made	1
a	1
certain	1
sensation,	1
the	1
count	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
committeemen.	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
many	1
toasts,	1
it's	1
time	1
to	1
begin,"	1
he	1
whispered,	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
glass,	1
he	1
rose.	1
All	1
were	1
silent,	1
waiting	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
our	1
Sovereign,	1
the	1
Emperor!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
his	1
kindly	1
eyes	1
grew	1
moist	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
enthusiasm.	1
The	1
band	1
immediately	1
struck	1
up	1
"Conquest's	1
joyful	1
thunder	1
waken..."	1
All	1
rose	1
and	1
cried	1
"Hurrah!"	1
Bagration	1
also	1
rose	1
and	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
in	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
shouted	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern.	1
Young	1
Rostov's	1
ecstatic	1
voice	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
above	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
others.	1
He	1
nearly	1
wept.	1
"To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
our	1
Sovereign,	1
the	1
Emperor!"	1
he	1
roared,	1
"Hurrah!"	1
and	1
emptying	1
his	1
glass	1
at	1
one	1
gulp	1
he	1
dashed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
floor.	1
Many	1
followed	1
his	1
example,	1
and	1
the	1
loud	1
shouting	1
continued	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
When	1
the	1
voices	1
subsided,	1
the	1
footmen	1
cleared	1
away	1
the	1
broken	1
glass	1
and	1
everybody	1
sat	1
down	1
again,	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
and	1
exchanging	1
remarks.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
rose	1
once	1
more,	1
glanced	1
at	1
a	1
note	1
lying	1
beside	1
his	1
plate,	1
and	1
proposed	1
a	1
toast,	1
"To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
hero	1
of	1
our	1
last	1
campaign,	1
Prince	1
Peter	1
Ivanovich	1
Bagration!"	1
and	1
again	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
grew	1
moist.	1
"Hurrah!"	1
cried	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
voices	1
again,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
a	1
choir	1
began	1
singing	1
a	1
cantata	1
composed	1
by	1
Paul	1
Ivanovich	1
Kutuzov:	1
	1
	1
Russians!	1
O'er	1
all	1
barriers	1
on!	1
Courage	1
conquest	1
guarantees;	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
Bagration?	1
He	1
brings	1
foe	1
men	1
to	1
their	1
knees,...	1
etc.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
singing	1
was	1
over,	1
another	1
and	1
another	1
toast	1
was	1
proposed	1
and	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
moved,	1
more	1
glass	1
was	1
smashed,	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
grew	1
louder.	1
They	1
drank	1
to	1
Bekleshev,	1
Naryshkin,	1
Uvarov,	1
Dolgorukov,	1
Apraksin,	1
Valuev,	1
to	1
the	1
committee,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
club	1
members	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
club	1
guests,	1
and	1
finally	1
to	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
separately,	1
as	1
the	1
organizer	1
of	1
the	1
banquet.	1
At	1
that	1
toast,	1
the	1
count	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
and,	1
covering	1
his	1
face,	1
wept	1
outright.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
opposite	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov.	1
As	1
usual,	1
he	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
much,	1
and	1
eagerly.	1
But	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
intimately	1
noticed	1
that	1
some	1
great	1
change	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
him	1
that	1
day.	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
all	1
through	1
dinner	1
and	1
looked	1
about,	1
blinking	1
and	1
scowling,	1
or,	1
with	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
complete	1
absent-mindedness,	1
kept	1
rubbing	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
his	1
nose.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
depressed	1
and	1
gloomy.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
absorbed	1
by	1
some	1
depressing	1
and	1
unsolved	1
problem.	1
	1
The	1
unsolved	1
problem	1
that	1
tormented	1
him	1
was	1
caused	1
by	1
hints	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
princess,	1
his	1
cousin,	1
at	1
Moscow,	1
concerning	1
Dolokhov's	1
intimacy	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
by	1
an	1
anonymous	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
that	1
morning,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
jocular	1
way	1
common	1
to	1
anonymous	1
letters	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
badly	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
wife's	1
connection	1
with	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
secret	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
himself.	1
Pierre	1
absolutely	1
disbelieved	1
both	1
the	1
princess'	1
hints	1
and	1
the	1
letter,	1
but	1
he	1
feared	1
now	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him.	1
Every	1
time	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
meet	1
Dolokhov's	1
handsome	1
insolent	1
eyes,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
monstrous	1
rising	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
turned	1
quickly	1
away.	1
Involuntarily	1
recalling	1
his	1
wife's	1
past	1
and	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
Dolokhov,	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
letter	1
might	1
be	1
true,	1
or	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
referred	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
He	1
involuntarily	1
remembered	1
how	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
had	1
fully	1
recovered	1
his	1
former	1
position	1
after	1
the	1
campaign,	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
him.	1
Availing	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
friendly	1
relations	1
with	1
Pierre	1
as	1
a	1
boon	1
companion,	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
had	1
put	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
lent	1
him	1
money.	1
Pierre	1
recalled	1
how	1
Helene	1
had	1
smilingly	1
expressed	1
disapproval	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
living	1
at	1
their	1
house,	1
and	1
how	1
cynically	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
praised	1
his	1
wife's	1
beauty	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
till	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
day.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
handsome,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"and	1
I	1
know	1
him.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
dishonor	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
ridicule	1
me,	1
just	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
exerted	1
myself	1
on	1
his	1
behalf,	1
befriended	1
him,	1
and	1
helped	1
him.	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
understand	1
what	1
a	1
spice	1
that	1
would	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
deceiving	1
me,	1
if	1
it	1
really	1
were	1
true.	1
Yes,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
true,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to,	1
and	1
can't,	1
believe	1
it."	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
expression	1
Dolokhov's	1
face	1
assumed	1
in	1
his	1
moments	1
of	1
cruelty,	1
as	1
when	1
tying	1
the	1
policeman	1
to	1
the	1
bear	1
and	1
dropping	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
challenged	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
a	1
duel	1
without	1
any	1
reason,	1
or	1
shot	1
a	1
post-boy's	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
pistol.	1
That	1
expression	1
was	1
often	1
on	1
Dolokhov's	1
face	1
when	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
bully,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"to	1
kill	1
a	1
man	1
means	1
nothing	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
everyone	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
must	1
please	1
him.	1
He	1
must	1
think	1
that	1
I,	1
too,	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him--and	1
in	1
fact	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
felt	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
monstrous	1
rising	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
Dolokhov,	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
were	1
now	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
Pierre	1
and	1
seemed	1
very	1
gay.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
talking	1
merrily	1
to	1
his	1
two	1
friends,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
a	1
dashing	1
hussar	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
notorious	1
duelist	1
and	1
rake,	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
glanced	1
ironically	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
whose	1
preoccupied,	1
absent-minded,	1
and	1
massive	1
figure	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
noticeable	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
dinner.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
inimically	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
first	1
because	1
Pierre	1
appeared	1
to	1
his	1
hussar	1
eyes	1
as	1
a	1
rich	1
civilian,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
a	1
beauty,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
word--an	1
old	1
woman;	1
and	1
secondly	1
because	1
Pierre	1
in	1
his	1
preoccupation	1
and	1
absent-mindedness	1
had	1
not	1
recognized	1
Rostov	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
responded	1
to	1
his	1
greeting.	1
When	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
health	1
was	1
drunk,	1
Pierre,	1
lost	1
in	1
thought,	1
did	1
not	1
rise	1
or	1
lift	1
his	1
glass.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
about?"	1
shouted	1
Rostov,	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
exasperation.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
hear	1
it's	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
health?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
sighed,	1
rose	1
submissively,	1
emptied	1
his	1
glass,	1
and,	1
waiting	1
till	1
all	1
were	1
seated	1
again,	1
turned	1
with	1
his	1
kindly	1
smile	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Why,	1
I	1
didn't	1
recognize	1
you!"	1
he	1
said.	1
But	1
Rostov	1
was	1
otherwise	1
engaged;	1
he	1
was	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
renew	1
the	1
acquaintance?"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Confound	1
him,	1
he's	1
a	1
fool!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"One	1
should	1
make	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
husbands	1
of	1
pretty	1
women,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
catch	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying,	1
but	1
knew	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
him.	1
He	1
reddened	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
handsome	1
women!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
expression,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
lurking	1
at	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
he	1
turned	1
with	1
his	1
glass	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Here's	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
lovely	1
women,	1
Peterkin--and	1
their	1
lovers!"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes,	1
drank	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
glass	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Dolokhov	1
or	1
answering	1
him.	1
The	1
footman,	1
who	1
was	1
distributing	1
leaflets	1
with	1
Kutuzov's	1
cantata,	1
laid	1
one	1
before	1
Pierre	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
guests.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
when	1
Dolokhov,	1
leaning	1
across,	1
snatched	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
dropped,	1
the	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
monstrous	1
that	1
had	1
tormented	1
him	1
all	1
dinnertime	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
leaned	1
his	1
whole	1
massive	1
body	1
across	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"How	1
dare	1
you	1
take	1
it?"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
Hearing	1
that	1
cry	1
and	1
seeing	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
addressed,	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
the	1
neighbor	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
quickly	1
turned	1
in	1
alarm	1
to	1
Bezukhov.	1
	1
"Don't!	1
Don't!	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
about?"	1
whispered	1
their	1
frightened	1
voices.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
clear,	1
mirthful,	1
cruel	1
eyes,	1
and	1
that	1
smile	1
of	1
his	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"Ah!	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
like!"	1
	1
"You	1
shan't	1
have	1
it!"	1
he	1
said	1
distinctly.	1
	1
Pale,	1
with	1
quivering	1
lips,	1
Pierre	1
snatched	1
the	1
copy.	1
	1
"You...!	1
you...	1
scoundrel!	1
I	1
challenge	1
you!"	1
he	1
ejaculated,	1
and,	1
pushing	1
back	1
his	1
chair,	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
and	1
uttered	1
those	1
words,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
wife's	1
guilt	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
tormenting	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
was	1
finally	1
and	1
indubitably	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
He	1
hated	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
forever	1
sundered	1
from	1
her.	1
Despite	1
Denisov's	1
request	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
Rostov	1
agreed	1
to	1
be	1
Dolokhov's	1
second,	1
and	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
discussed	1
the	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
duel	1
with	1
Nesvitski,	1
Bezukhov's	1
second.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
home,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
with	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
Denisov	1
stayed	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
till	1
late,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
gypsies	1
and	1
other	1
singers.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
till	1
tomorrow	1
at	1
Sokolniki,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
Rostov	1
in	1
the	1
club	1
porch.	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
quite	1
calm?"	1
Rostov	1
asked.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
paused.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
secret	1
of	1
dueling	1
in	1
two	1
words.	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel,	1
and	1
you	1
make	1
a	1
will	1
and	1
write	1
affectionate	1
letters	1
to	1
your	1
parents,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
killed,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
fool	1
and	1
are	1
lost	1
for	1
certain.	1
But	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
firm	1
intention	1
of	1
killing	1
your	1
man	1
as	1
quickly	1
and	1
surely	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
right,	1
as	1
our	1
bear	1
huntsman	1
at	1
Kostroma	1
used	1
to	1
tell	1
me.	1
'Everyone	1
fears	1
a	1
bear,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'but	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
one	1
your	1
fear's	1
all	1
gone,	1
and	1
your	1
only	1
thought	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
get	1
away!'	1
And	1
that's	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
A	1
demain,	1
mon	1
cher."	1

Till	1
tomorrow,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
at	1
eight	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Nesvitski	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
Sokolniki	1
forest	1
and	1
found	1
Dolokhov,	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
already	1
there.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
considerations	1
which	1
had	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
hand.	1
His	1
haggard	1
face	1
was	1
yellow.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
not	1
slept	1
that	1
night.	1
He	1
looked	1
about	1
distractedly	1
and	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
dazzled	1
by	1
the	1
sun.	1
He	1
was	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
by	1
two	1
considerations:	1
his	1
wife's	1
guilt,	1
of	1
which	1
after	1
his	1
sleepless	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
doubt,	1
and	1
the	1
guiltlessness	1
of	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
him....	1
"I	1
should	1
perhaps	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
place,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"It's	1
even	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same,	1
then	1
why	1
this	1
duel,	1
this	1
murder?	1
Either	1
I	1
shall	1
kill	1
him,	1
or	1
he	1
will	1
hit	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
or	1
elbow,	1
or	1
knee.	1
Can't	1
I	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
here,	1
run	1
away,	1
bury	1
myself	1
somewhere?"	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
mind.	1
But	1
just	1
at	1
moments	1
when	1
such	1
thoughts	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
in	1
a	1
particularly	1
calm	1
and	1
absent-minded	1
way,	1
which	1
inspired	1
the	1
respect	1
of	1
the	1
onlookers,	1
"Will	1
it	1
be	1
long?	1
Are	1
things	1
ready?"	1
	1
When	1
all	1
was	1
ready,	1
the	1
sabers	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
barriers,	1
and	1
the	1
pistols	1
loaded,	1
Nesvitski	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
doing	1
my	1
duty,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
timid	1
tones,	1
"and	1
should	1
not	1
justify	1
your	1
confidence	1
and	1
the	1
honor	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
in	1
choosing	1
me	1
for	1
your	1
second,	1
if	1
at	1
this	1
grave,	1
this	1
very	1
grave,	1
moment	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sufficient	1
ground	1
for	1
this	1
affair,	1
or	1
for	1
blood	1
to	1
be	1
shed	1
over	1
it....	1
You	1
were	1
not	1
right,	1
not	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
right,	1
you	1
were	1
impetuous..."	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
it	1
is	1
horribly	1
stupid,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Then	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
express	1
your	1
regrets,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
opponent	1
will	1
accept	1
them,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
(who	1
like	1
the	1
others	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
like	1
everyone	1
in	1
similar	1
cases,	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
actual	1
duel).	1
"You	1
know,	1
Count,	1
it	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
honorable	1
to	1
admit	1
one's	1
mistake	1
than	1
to	1
let	1
matters	1
become	1
irreparable.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
insult	1
on	1
either	1
side.	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
convey...."	1
	1
"No!	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
talk	1
about?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
same....	1
Is	1
everything	1
ready?"	1
he	1
added.	1
"Only	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
where	1
to	1
shoot,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
unnaturally	1
gentle	1
smile.	1
	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
pistol	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
began	1
asking	1
about	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
the	1
trigger,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
before	1
held	1
a	1
pistol	1
in	1
his	1
hand--a	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
confess.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
like	1
that,	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
only	1
forgot,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"No	1
apologies,	1
none	1
whatever,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
to	1
Denisov	1
(who	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
had	1
been	1
attempting	1
a	1
reconciliation),	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
appointed	1
place.	1
	1
The	1
spot	1
chosen	1
for	1
the	1
duel	1
was	1
some	1
eighty	1
paces	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
where	1
the	1
sleighs	1
had	1
been	1
left,	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
clearing	1
in	1
the	1
pine	1
forest	1
covered	1
with	1
melting	1
snow,	1
the	1
frost	1
having	1
begun	1
to	1
break	1
up	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days.	1
The	1
antagonists	1
stood	1
forty	1
paces	1
apart	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
clearing.	1
The	1
seconds,	1
measuring	1
the	1
paces,	1
left	1
tracks	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
wet	1
snow	1
between	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
and	1
Nesvitski's	1
and	1
Dolokhov's	1
sabers,	1
which	1
were	1
stuck	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
ten	1
paces	1
apart	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
barrier.	1
It	1
was	1
thawing	1
and	1
misty;	1
at	1
forty	1
paces'	1
distance	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
For	1
three	1
minutes	1
all	1
had	1
been	1
ready,	1
but	1
they	1
still	1
delayed	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
"Well	1
begin!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"All	1
right,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
still	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
A	1
feeling	1
of	1
dread	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
so	1
lightly	1
begun	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
averted	1
but	1
was	1
taking	1
its	1
course	1
independently	1
of	1
men's	1
will.	1
	1
Denisov	1
first	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
barrier	1
and	1
announced:	1
"As	1
the	1
adve'sawies	1
have	1
wefused	1
a	1
weconciliation,	1
please	1
pwoceed.	1
Take	1
your	1
pistols,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
thwee	1
begin	1
to	1
advance.	1
	1
"O-ne!	1
T-wo!	1
Thwee!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
angrily	1
and	1
stepped	1
aside.	1
	1
The	1
combatants	1
advanced	1
along	1
the	1
trodden	1
tracks,	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
beginning	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
another	1
through	1
the	1
mist.	1
They	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
fire	1
when	1
they	1
liked	1
as	1
they	1
approached	1
the	1
barrier.	1
Dolokhov	1
walked	1
slowly	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
pistol,	1
looking	1
intently	1
with	1
his	1
bright,	1
sparkling	1
blue	1
eyes	1
into	1
his	1
antagonist's	1
face.	1
His	1
mouth	1
wore	1
its	1
usual	1
semblance	1
of	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
can	1
fire	1
when	1
I	1
like!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
"three,"	1
he	1
went	1
quickly	1
forward,	1
missing	1
the	1
trodden	1
path	1
and	1
stepping	1
into	1
the	1
deep	1
snow.	1
He	1
held	1
the	1
pistol	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
at	1
arm's	1
length,	1
apparently	1
afraid	1
of	1
shooting	1
himself	1
with	1
it.	1
His	1
left	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
carefully	1
back,	1
because	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
support	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
knew	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
Having	1
advanced	1
six	1
paces	1
and	1
strayed	1
off	1
the	1
track	1
into	1
the	1
snow,	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
then	1
quickly	1
glanced	1
at	1
Dolokhov	1
and,	1
bending	1
his	1
finger	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
shown,	1
fired.	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
expecting	1
so	1
loud	1
a	1
report,	1
Pierre	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
and	1
then,	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
sensations,	1
stood	1
still.	1
The	1
smoke,	1
rendered	1
denser	1
by	1
the	1
mist,	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
seeing	1
anything	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
second	1
report	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
expected.	1
He	1
only	1
heard	1
Dolokhov's	1
hurried	1
steps,	1
and	1
his	1
figure	1
came	1
in	1
view	1
through	1
the	1
smoke.	1
He	1
was	1
pressing	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
left	1
side,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
clutched	1
his	1
drooping	1
pistol.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
pale.	1
Rostov	1
ran	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
something.	1
	1
"No-o-o!"	1
muttered	1
Dolokhov	1
through	1
his	1
teeth,	1
"no,	1
it's	1
not	1
over."	1
And	1
after	1
stumbling	1
a	1
few	1
staggering	1
steps	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
saber,	1
he	1
sank	1
on	1
the	1
snow	1
beside	1
it.	1
His	1
left	1
hand	1
was	1
bloody;	1
he	1
wiped	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
supported	1
himself	1
with	1
it.	1
His	1
frowning	1
face	1
was	1
pallid	1
and	1
quivered.	1
	1
"Plea..."	1
began	1
Dolokhov,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
pronounce	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
"Please,"	1
he	1
uttered	1
with	1
an	1
effort.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
hardly	1
restraining	1
his	1
sobs,	1
began	1
running	1
toward	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
barriers,	1
when	1
Dolokhov	1
cried:	1
	1
"To	1
your	1
barrier!"	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
grasping	1
what	1
was	1
meant,	1
stopped	1
by	1
his	1
saber.	1
Only	1
ten	1
paces	1
divided	1
them.	1
Dolokhov	1
lowered	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
snow,	1
greedily	1
bit	1
at	1
it,	1
again	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
adjusted	1
himself,	1
drew	1
in	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
sat	1
up,	1
seeking	1
a	1
firm	1
center	1
of	1
gravity.	1
He	1
sucked	1
and	1
swallowed	1
the	1
cold	1
snow,	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
but	1
his	1
eyes,	1
still	1
smiling,	1
glittered	1
with	1
effort	1
and	1
exasperation	1
as	1
he	1
mustered	1
his	1
remaining	1
strength.	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
pistol	1
and	1
aimed.	1
	1
"Sideways!	1
Cover	1
yourself	1
with	1
your	1
pistol!"	1
ejaculated	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"Cover	1
yourself!"	1
even	1
Denisov	1
cried	1
to	1
his	1
adversary.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile	1
of	1
pity	1
and	1
remorse,	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
helplessly	1
spread	1
out,	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
broad	1
chest	1
directly	1
facing	1
Dolokhov	1
looked	1
sorrowfully	1
at	1
him.	1
Denisov,	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
Nesvitski	1
closed	1
their	1
eyes.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
report	1
and	1
Dolokhov's	1
angry	1
cry.	1
	1
"Missed!"	1
shouted	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
helplessly,	1
face	1
downwards	1
on	1
the	1
snow.	1
	1
Pierre	1
clutched	1
his	1
temples,	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
forest,	1
trampling	1
through	1
the	1
deep	1
snow,	1
and	1
muttering	1
incoherent	1
words:	1
	1
"Folly...	1
folly!	1
Death...	1
lies..."	1
he	1
repeated,	1
puckering	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
stopped	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
home.	1
	1
Rostov	1
and	1
Denisov	1
drove	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
wounded	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
The	1
latter	1
lay	1
silent	1
in	1
the	1
sleigh	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
questions	1
addressed	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
on	1
entering	1
Moscow	1
he	1
suddenly	1
came	1
to	1
and,	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
an	1
effort,	1
took	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him,	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
totally	1
altered	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
rapturous	1
and	1
tender	1
expression	1
on	1
Dolokhov's	1
face.	1
	1
"Well?	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
feel?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Bad!	1
But	1
it's	1
not	1
that,	1
my	1
friend-"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
a	1
gasping	1
voice.	1
"Where	1
are	1
we?	1
In	1
Moscow,	1
I	1
know.	1
I	1
don't	1
matter,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
killed	1
her,	1
killed...	1
She	1
won't	1
get	1
over	1
it!	1
She	1
won't	1
survive...."	1
	1
"Who?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"My	1
mother!	1
My	1
mother,	1
my	1
angel,	1
my	1
adored	1
angel	1
mother,"	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
pressed	1
Rostov's	1
hand	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
little	1
quieter,	1
he	1
explained	1
to	1
Rostov	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
with	1
his	1
mother,	1
who,	1
if	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
dying,	1
would	1
not	1
survive	1
it.	1
He	1
implored	1
Rostov	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
prepare	1
her.	1
	1
Rostov	1
went	1
on	1
ahead	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
asked,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
surprise	1
learned	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
the	1
brawler,	1
Dolokhov	1
the	1
bully,	1
lived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
mother	1
and	1
a	1
hunchback	1
sister,	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
affectionate	1
of	1
sons	1
and	1
brothers.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
rarely	1
seen	1
his	1
wife	1
alone.	1
Both	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
in	1
Moscow	1
their	1
house	1
was	1
always	1
full	1
of	1
visitors.	1
The	1
night	1
after	1
the	1
duel	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
bedroom	1
but,	1
as	1
he	1
often	1
did,	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
room,	1
that	1
huge	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
died.	1
	1
He	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
meaning	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep	1
and	1
forget	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
Such	1
a	1
storm	1
of	1
feelings,	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
memories	1
suddenly	1
arose	1
within	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
nor	1
even	1
remain	1
in	1
one	1
place,	1
but	1
had	1
to	1
jump	1
up	1
and	1
pace	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps.	1
Now	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
marriage,	1
with	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
and	1
a	1
languid,	1
passionate	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
then	1
immediately	1
he	1
saw	1
beside	1
her	1
Dolokhov's	1
handsome,	1
insolent,	1
hard,	1
and	1
mocking	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
banquet,	1
and	1
then	1
that	1
same	1
face	1
pale,	1
quivering,	1
and	1
suffering,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
he	1
reeled	1
and	1
sank	1
on	1
the	1
snow.	1
	1
"What	1
has	1
happened?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"I	1
have	1
killed	1
her	1
lover,	1
yes,	1
killed	1
my	1
wife's	1
lover.	1
Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
it!	1
And	1
why?	1
How	1
did	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
it?"--"Because	1
you	1
married	1
her,"	1
answered	1
an	1
inner	1
voice.	1
	1
"But	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
to	1
blame?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"In	1
marrying	1
her	1
without	1
loving	1
her;	1
in	1
deceiving	1
yourself	1
and	1
her."	1
And	1
he	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
that	1
moment	1
after	1
supper	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili's,	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
those	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
so	1
difficult	1
to	1
utter:	1
"I	1
love	1
you."	1
"It	1
all	1
comes	1
from	1
that!	1
Even	1
then	1
I	1
felt	1
it,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"I	1
felt	1
then	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
turns	1
out."	1
	1
He	1
remembered	1
his	1
honeymoon	1
and	1
blushed	1
at	1
the	1
recollection.	1
Particularly	1
vivid,	1
humiliating,	1
and	1
shameful	1
was	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
how	1
one	1
day	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
marriage	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bedroom	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
noon	1
in	1
his	1
silk	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
found	1
his	1
head	1
steward	1
there,	1
who,	1
bowing	1
respectfully,	1
looked	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
smiled	1
slightly,	1
as	1
if	1
expressing	1
respectful	1
understanding	1
of	1
his	1
employer's	1
happiness.	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
often	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
proud	1
of	1
her,	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
majestic	1
beauty	1
and	1
social	1
tact,"	1
thought	1
he;	1
"been	1
proud	1
of	1
my	1
house,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
received	1
all	1
Petersburg,	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
unapproachability	1
and	1
beauty.	1
So	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
proud	1
of!	1
I	1
then	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
her.	1
How	1
often	1
when	1
considering	1
her	1
character	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
not	1
understanding	1
her,	1
for	1
not	1
understanding	1
that	1
constant	1
composure	1
and	1
complacency	1
and	1
lack	1
of	1
all	1
interests	1
or	1
desires,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
secret	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
terrible	1
truth	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
depraved	1
woman.	1
Now	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
that	1
terrible	1
word	1
to	1
myself	1
all	1
has	1
become	1
clear.	1
	1
"Anatole	1
used	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
borrow	1
money	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
naked	1
shoulders.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
money,	1
but	1
let	1
herself	1
be	1
kissed.	1
Her	1
father	1
in	1
jest	1
tried	1
to	1
rouse	1
her	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
a	1
calm	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
stupid	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
jealous:	1
'Let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
pleases,'	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
me.	1
One	1
day	1
I	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
any	1
symptoms	1
of	1
pregnancy.	1
She	1
laughed	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
fool	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
children,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
children	1
by	1
me."	1
	1
Then	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
coarseness	1
and	1
bluntness	1
of	1
her	1
thoughts	1
and	1
the	1
vulgarity	1
of	1
the	1
expressions	1
that	1
were	1
natural	1
to	1
her,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
aristocratic	1
circles.	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
fool....	1
Just	1
you	1
try	1
it	1
on....	1
Allez-vous	1
promener,"	1
*	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
say.	1
Often	1
seeing	1
the	1
success	1
she	1
had	1
with	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"You	1
clear	1
out	1
of	1
this."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
never	1
loved	1
her,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself;	1
"I	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
depraved	1
woman,"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
"but	1
dared	1
not	1
admit	1
it	1
to	1
myself.	1
And	1
now	1
there's	1
Dolokhov	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile	1
and	1
perhaps	1
dying,	1
while	1
meeting	1
my	1
remorse	1
with	1
some	1
forced	1
bravado!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
who,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
weak	1
character,	1
do	1
not	1
seek	1
a	1
confidant	1
in	1
their	1
troubles.	1
He	1
digested	1
his	1
sufferings	1
alone.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
all,	1
all	1
her	1
fault,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself;	1
"but	1
what	1
of	1
that?	1
Why	1
did	1
I	1
bind	1
myself	1
to	1
her?	1
Why	1
did	1
I	1
say	1
'Je	1
vous	1
aime'	1
*	1
to	1
her,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
lie?	1
I	1
am	1
guilty	1
and	1
must	1
endure...	1
what?	1
A	1
slur	1
on	1
my	1
name?	1
A	1
misfortune	1
for	1
life?	1
Oh,	1
that's	1
nonsense,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"The	1
slur	1
on	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
honor--that's	1
all	1
apart	1
from	1
myself."	1
	1
	1
*	1
I	1
love	1
you.	1
	1
"Louis	1
XVI	1
was	1
executed	1
because	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
dishonorable	1
and	1
a	1
criminal,"	1
came	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
head,	1
"and	1
from	1
their	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
they	1
were	1
right,	1
as	1
were	1
those	1
too	1
who	1
canonized	1
him	1
and	1
died	1
a	1
martyr's	1
death	1
for	1
his	1
sake.	1
Then	1
Robespierre	1
was	1
beheaded	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
despot.	1
Who	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
wrong?	1
No	1
one!	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
alive--live:	1
tomorrow	1
you'll	1
die	1
as	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
died	1
an	1
hour	1
ago.	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
worth	1
tormenting	1
oneself,	1
when	1
one	1
has	1
only	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
eternity?"	1
	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
imagined	1
himself	1
calmed	1
by	1
such	1
reflections,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
moments	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
most	1
strongly	1
expressed	1
his	1
insincere	1
love	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
had	1
again	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
move	1
about	1
and	1
break	1
and	1
tear	1
whatever	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Why	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
'Je	1
vous	1
aime'?"	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
tenth	1
time,	1
Moliere's	1
words:	1
"Mais	1
que	1
diable	1
allait-il	1
faire	1
dans	1
cette	1
galere?"*	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
himself.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"But	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
he	1
doing	1
in	1
that	1
galley?"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
valet	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
pack	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
now.	1
He	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
leave	1
a	1
letter	1
informing	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
her	1
forever.	1
	1
Next	1
morning	1
when	1
the	1
valet	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
coffee,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
lying	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
ottoman	1
with	1
an	1
open	1
book	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
He	1
woke	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
a	1
startled	1
expression,	1
unable	1
to	1
realize	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
"The	1
countess	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
your	1
excellency	1
was	1
at	1
home,"	1
said	1
the	1
valet.	1
	1
But	1
before	1
Pierre	1
could	1
decide	1
what	1
answer	1
he	1
would	1
send,	1
the	1
countess	1
herself	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
satin	1
dressing	1
gown	1
embroidered	1
with	1
silver	1
and	1
with	1
simply	1
dressed	1
hair	1
(two	1
immense	1
plaits	1
twice	1
round	1
her	1
lovely	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
coronet)	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
calm	1
and	1
majestic,	1
except	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wrathful	1
wrinkle	1
on	1
her	1
rather	1
prominent	1
marble	1
brow.	1
With	1
her	1
imperturbable	1
calm	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
valet.	1
She	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
duel	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
it.	1
She	1
waited	1
till	1
the	1
valet	1
had	1
set	1
down	1
the	1
coffee	1
things	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
timidly	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
hare	1
surrounded	1
by	1
hounds	1
who	1
lays	1
back	1
her	1
ears	1
and	1
continues	1
to	1
crouch	1
motionless	1
before	1
her	1
enemies,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
continue	1
reading.	1
But	1
feeling	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
senseless	1
and	1
impossible,	1
he	1
again	1
glanced	1
timidly	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
smile,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
valet	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what's	1
this	1
now?	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
now,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know?"	1
she	1
asked	1
sternly.	1
	1
"I?	1
What	1
have	1
I...?"	1
stammered	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
seems	1
you're	1
a	1
hero,	1
eh?	1
Come	1
now,	1
what	1
was	1
this	1
duel	1
about?	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
meant	1
to	1
prove?	1
What?	1
I	1
ask	1
you."	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
over	1
heavily	1
on	1
the	1
ottoman	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
won't	1
answer,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you..."	1
Helene	1
went	1
on.	1
"You	1
believe	1
everything	1
you're	1
told.	1
You	1
were	1
told..."	1
Helene	1
laughed,	1
"that	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
my	1
lover,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
with	1
her	1
coarse	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech,	1
uttering	1
the	1
word	1
amant	1
as	1
casually	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
word,	1
"and	1
you	1
believed	1
it!	1
Well,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
proved?	1
What	1
does	1
this	1
duel	1
prove?	1
That	1
you're	1
a	1
fool,	1
que	1
vous	1
etes	1
un	1
sot,	1
but	1
everybody	1
knew	1
that.	1
What	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
result?	1
That	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
laughingstock	1
of	1
all	1
Moscow,	1
that	1
everyone	1
will	1
say	1
that	1
you,	1
drunk	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
about,	1
challenged	1
a	1
man	1
you	1
are	1
jealous	1
of	1
without	1
cause."	1
Helene	1
raised	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited,	1
"A	1
man	1
who's	1
a	1
better	1
man	1
than	1
you	1
in	1
every	1
way..."	1
	1
"Hm...	1
Hm...!"	1
growled	1
Pierre,	1
frowning	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
not	1
moving	1
a	1
muscle.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
believe	1
he	1
was	1
my	1
lover?	1
Why?	1
Because	1
I	1
like	1
his	1
company?	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
cleverer	1
and	1
more	1
agreeable,	1
I	1
should	1
prefer	1
yours."	1
	1
"Don't	1
speak	1
to	1
me...	1
I	1
beg	1
you,"	1
muttered	1
Pierre	1
hoarsely.	1
	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
I	1
speak?	1
I	1
can	1
speak	1
as	1
I	1
like,	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
plainly	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
wives	1
with	1
husbands	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
taken	1
lovers	1
(des	1
amants),	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
so,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
eyes	1
whose	1
strange	1
expression	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
again.	1
He	1
was	1
suffering	1
physically	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
weight	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
breathe.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
something	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
this	1
suffering,	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
too	1
terrible.	1
	1
"We	1
had	1
better	1
separate,"	1
he	1
muttered	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
voice.	1
	1
"Separate?	1
Very	1
well,	1
but	1
only	1
if	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
fortune,"	1
said	1
Helene.	1
"Separate!	1
That's	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
frighten	1
me	1
with!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
leaped	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
rushed	1
staggering	1
toward	1
her.	1
	1
"I'll	1
kill	1
you!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
marble	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
strength	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
felt,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
step	1
toward	1
her	1
brandishing	1
the	1
slab.	1
	1
Helene's	1
face	1
became	1
terrible,	1
she	1
shrieked	1
and	1
sprang	1
aside.	1
His	1
father's	1
nature	1
showed	1
itself	1
in	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
felt	1
the	1
fascination	1
and	1
delight	1
of	1
frenzy.	1
He	1
flung	1
down	1
the	1
slab,	1
broke	1
it,	1
and	1
swooping	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
with	1
outstretched	1
hands	1
shouted,	1
"Get	1
out!"	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
terrible	1
voice	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
heard	1
it	1
with	1
horror.	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
had	1
Helene	1
not	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
A	1
week	1
later	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
his	1
wife	1
full	1
power	1
to	1
control	1
all	1
his	1
estates	1
in	1
Great	1
Russia,	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
larger	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
property,	1
and	1
left	1
for	1
Petersburg	1
alone.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Two	1
months	1
had	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
reached	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
letters	1
sent	1
through	1
the	1
embassy	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
searches	1
made,	1
his	1
body	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
found	1
nor	1
was	1
he	1
on	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
prisoners.	1
What	1
was	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
his	1
relations	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
been	1
picked	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
now	1
be	1
lying,	1
recovering	1
or	1
dying,	1
alone	1
among	1
strangers	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
send	1
news	1
of	1
himself.	1
The	1
gazettes	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
first	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
defeat	1
at	1
Austerlitz	1
stated,	1
as	1
usual	1
very	1
briefly	1
and	1
vaguely,	1
that	1
after	1
brilliant	1
engagements	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
retreat	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
their	1
withdrawal	1
in	1
perfect	1
order.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
understood	1
from	1
this	1
official	1
report	1
that	1
our	1
army	1
had	1
been	1
defeated.	1
A	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
gazette	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
came	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Kutuzov	1
informing	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
fate	1
that	1
had	1
befallen	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"Your	1
son,"	1
wrote	1
Kutuzov,	1
"fell	1
before	1
my	1
eyes,	1
a	1
standard	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
regiment--he	1
fell	1
as	1
a	1
hero,	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
fatherland.	1
To	1
the	1
great	1
regret	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
alive	1
or	1
not.	1
I	1
comfort	1
myself	1
and	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
your	1
son	1
is	1
alive,	1
for	1
otherwise	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
mentioned	1
among	1
the	1
officers	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
whom	1
has	1
been	1
sent	1
me	1
under	1
flag	1
of	1
truce."	1
	1
After	1
receiving	1
this	1
news	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
study,	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
went	1
for	1
his	1
walk	1
as	1
usual	1
next	1
morning,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
with	1
his	1
steward,	1
the	1
gardener,	1
and	1
the	1
architect,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
grim	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
anyone.	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
usual	1
hour	1
he	1
was	1
working	1
at	1
his	1
lathe	1
and,	1
as	1
usual,	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Princess	1
Mary!"	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
voice,	1
throwing	1
down	1
his	1
chisel.	1
(The	1
wheel	1
continued	1
to	1
revolve	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
impetus,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
long	1
remembered	1
the	1
dying	1
creak	1
of	1
that	1
wheel,	1
which	1
merged	1
in	1
her	1
memory	1
with	1
what	1
followed.)	1
	1
She	1
approached	1
him,	1
saw	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
something	1
gave	1
way	1
within	1
her.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim.	1
By	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
face,	1
not	1
sad,	1
not	1
crushed,	1
but	1
angry	1
and	1
working	1
unnaturally,	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
hanging	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
about	1
to	1
crush	1
her	1
was	1
some	1
terrible	1
misfortune,	1
the	1
worst	1
in	1
life,	1
one	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
experienced,	1
irreparable	1
and	1
incomprehensible-	1
-the	1
death	1
of	1
one	1
she	1
loved.	1
	1
"Father!	1
Andrew!"--said	1
the	1
ungraceful,	1
awkward	1
princess	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
indescribable	1
charm	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
self-forgetfulness	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
her	1
look	1
but	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
sob.	1
	1
"Bad	1
news!	1
He's	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
prisoners	1
nor	1
among	1
the	1
killed!	1
Kutuzov	1
writes..."	1
and	1
he	1
screamed	1
as	1
piercingly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
drive	1
the	1
princess	1
away	1
by	1
that	1
scream...	1
"Killed!"	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
down	1
or	1
faint.	1
She	1
was	1
already	1
pale,	1
but	1
on	1
hearing	1
these	1
words	1
her	1
face	1
changed	1
and	1
something	1
brightened	1
in	1
her	1
beautiful,	1
radiant	1
eyes.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
joy--a	1
supreme	1
joy	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
joys	1
and	1
sorrows	1
of	1
this	1
world--overflowed	1
the	1
great	1
grief	1
within	1
her.	1
She	1
forgot	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
took	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
drawing	1
him	1
down	1
put	1
her	1
arm	1
round	1
his	1
thin,	1
scraggy	1
neck.	1
	1
"Father,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"do	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
me,	1
let	1
us	1
weep	1
together."	1
	1
"Scoundrels!	1
Blackguards!"	1
shrieked	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
turning	1
his	1
face	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
"Destroying	1
the	1
army,	1
destroying	1
the	1
men!	1
And	1
why?	1
Go,	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
Lise."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
sank	1
helplessly	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
beside	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
wept.	1
She	1
saw	1
her	1
brother	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
of	1
Lise,	1
his	1
look	1
tender	1
yet	1
proud.	1
She	1
saw	1
him	1
tender	1
and	1
amused	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
icon.	1
"Did	1
he	1
believe?	1
Had	1
he	1
repented	1
of	1
his	1
unbelief?	1
Was	1
he	1
now	1
there?	1
There	1
in	1
the	1
realms	1
of	1
eternal	1
peace	1
and	1
blessedness?"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
"Father,	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
it	1
happened,"	1
she	1
asked	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
	1
"Go!	1
Go!	1
Killed	1
in	1
battle,	1
where	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
Russian	1
men	1
and	1
Russia's	1
glory	1
were	1
led	1
to	1
destruction.	1
Go,	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
Lise.	1
I	1
will	1
follow."	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
returned	1
from	1
her	1
father,	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
sat	1
working	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
with	1
that	1
curious	1
expression	1
of	1
inner,	1
happy	1
calm	1
peculiar	1
to	1
pregnant	1
women.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
her	1
eyes	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
but	1
were	1
looking	1
within...	1
into	1
herself...	1
at	1
something	1
joyful	1
and	1
mysterious	1
taking	1
place	1
within	1
her.	1
	1
"Mary,"	1
she	1
said,	1
moving	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
embroidery	1
frame	1
and	1
lying	1
back,	1
"give	1
me	1
your	1
hand."	1
She	1
took	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
hand	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
below	1
her	1
waist.	1
	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
smiling	1
expectantly,	1
her	1
downy	1
lip	1
rose	1
and	1
remained	1
lifted	1
in	1
childlike	1
happiness.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
knelt	1
down	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
dress.	1
	1
"There,	1
there!	1
Do	1
you	1
feel	1
it?	1
I	1
feel	1
so	1
strange.	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
Mary,	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
very	1
much,"	1
said	1
Lise,	1
looking	1
with	1
bright	1
and	1
happy	1
eyes	1
at	1
her	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
lift	1
her	1
head,	1
she	1
was	1
weeping.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
Mary?"	1
	1
"Nothing...	1
only	1
I	1
feel	1
sad...	1
sad	1
about	1
Andrew,"	1
she	1
said,	1
wiping	1
away	1
her	1
tears	1
on	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
knee.	1
	1
Several	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
began	1
trying	1
to	1
prepare	1
her	1
sister-in-law,	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
Unobservant	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
these	1
tears,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand,	1
agitated	1
her.	1
She	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
looked	1
about	1
uneasily	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
something.	1
Before	1
dinner	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
of	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
afraid,	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
restless	1
and	1
malign	1
expression	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
then	1
sat	1
thinking	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
attention	1
to	1
something	1
within	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
seen	1
in	1
pregnant	1
women,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Has	1
anything	1
come	1
from	1
Andrew?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
know	1
it's	1
too	1
soon	1
for	1
news.	1
But	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
anxious	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
afraid."	1
	1
"So	1
there's	1
nothing?"	1
	1
"Nothing,"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
looking	1
firmly	1
with	1
her	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
at	1
her	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
She	1
had	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
and	1
persuaded	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
terrible	1
news	1
from	1
her	1
till	1
after	1
her	1
confinement,	1
which	1
was	1
expected	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
each	1
bore	1
and	1
hid	1
their	1
grief	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
way.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
would	1
not	1
cherish	1
any	1
hope:	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
sent	1
an	1
official	1
to	1
Austria	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
traces	1
of	1
his	1
son,	1
he	1
ordered	1
a	1
monument	1
from	1
Moscow	1
which	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
erect	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
garden	1
to	1
his	1
memory,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
everybody	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
been	1
killed.	1
He	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
former	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
but	1
his	1
strength	1
failed	1
him.	1
He	1
walked	1
less,	1
ate	1
less,	1
slept	1
less,	1
and	1
became	1

Princess	1
Mary	1
hoped.	1
She	1
prayed	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
as	1
living	1

awaiting	1

of	1
his	1
return.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
"Dearest,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
after	1
breakfast	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
March,	1
and	1
her	1
downy	1
little	1
lip	1
rose	1
from	1
old	1
habit,	1
but	1
as	1
sorrow	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
every	1
smile,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
every	1
word,	1
and	1
even	1
every	1
footstep	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
since	1
the	1
terrible	1
news	1
had	1
come,	1
so	1
now	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess--influenced	1
by	1
the	1
general	1
mood	1
though	1
without	1
knowing	1
its	1
cause--was	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
remind	1
one	1
still	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
sorrow.	1
	1
"Dearest,	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
this	1
morning's	1
fruschtique	1
*--as	1
Foka	1
the	1
cook	1
calls	1
it--has	1
disagreed	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Fruhstuck:	1
breakfast.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
darling?	1
You	1
look	1
pale.	1
Oh,	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
pale!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
alarm,	1
running	1
with	1
her	1
soft,	1
ponderous	1
steps	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
should	1
not	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna	1
be	1
sent	1
for?"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
who	1
was	1
present.	1
(Mary	1
Bogdanovna	1
was	1
a	1
midwife	1
from	1
the	1
neighboring	1
town,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
fortnight.)	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,"	1
assented	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
"perhaps	1
that's	1
it.	1
I'll	1
go.	1
Courage,	1
my	1
angel."	1
She	1
kissed	1
Lise	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
no!"	1
And	1
besides	1
the	1
pallor	1
and	1
the	1
physical	1
suffering	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
face,	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
childish	1
fear	1
of	1
inevitable	1
pain	1
showed	1
itself.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
only	1
indigestion?...	1
Say	1
it's	1
only	1
indigestion,	1
say	1
so,	1
Mary!	1
Say..."	1
And	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
capriciously	1
like	1
a	1
suffering	1
child	1
and	1
to	1
wring	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
even	1
with	1
some	1
affectation.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
fetch	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna.	1
	1
"Mon	1
Dieu!	1
Mon	1
Dieu!	1
Oh!"	1
she	1
heard	1
as	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
midwife	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
rubbing	1
her	1
small,	1
plump	1
white	1
hands	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
calm	1
importance.	1
	1
"Mary	1
Bogdanovna,	1
I	1
think	1
it's	1
beginning!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
midwife	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
of	1
alarm.	1
	1
"Well,	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
thanked,	1
Princess,"	1
said	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna,	1
not	1
hastening	1
her	1
steps.	1
"You	1
young	1
ladies	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
the	1
doctor	1
from	1
Moscow	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
yet?"	1
said	1
the	1
princess.	1
(In	1
accordance	1
with	1
Lise's	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
wishes	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
a	1
doctor	1
and	1
were	1
expecting	1
him	1
at	1
any	1
moment.)	1
	1
"No	1
matter,	1
Princess,	1
don't	1
be	1
alarmed,"	1
said	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna.	1
"We'll	1
manage	1
very	1
well	1
without	1
a	1
doctor."	1
	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
from	1
her	1
room	1
heard	1
something	1
heavy	1
being	1
carried	1
by.	1
She	1
looked	1
out.	1
The	1
men	1
servants	1
were	1
carrying	1
the	1
large	1
leather	1
sofa	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
study	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
On	1
their	1
faces	1
was	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
solemn	1
look.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sat	1
alone	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
opening	1
her	1
door	1
when	1
someone	1
passed	1
and	1
watching	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
Some	1
women	1
passing	1
with	1
quiet	1
steps	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bedroom	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
ask	1
any	1
questions,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
again,	1
now	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
easy	1
chair,	1
now	1
taking	1
her	1
prayer	1
book,	1
now	1
kneeling	1
before	1
the	1
icon	1
stand.	1
To	1
her	1
surprise	1
and	1
distress	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
her	1
prayers	1
did	1
not	1
calm	1
her	1
excitement.	1
Suddenly	1
her	1
door	1
opened	1
softly	1
and	1
her	1
old	1
nurse,	1
Praskovya	1
Savishna,	1
who	1
hardly	1
ever	1
came	1
to	1
that	1
room	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
forbidden	1
it,	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
with	1
a	1
shawl	1
round	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"I've	1
come	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
you	1
a	1
bit,	1
Masha,"	1
said	1
the	1
nurse,	1
"and	1
here	1
I've	1
brought	1
the	1
prince's	1
wedding	1
candles	1
to	1
light	1
before	1
his	1
saint,	1
my	1
angel,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
nurse,	1
I'm	1
so	1
glad!"	1
	1
"God	1
is	1
merciful,	1
birdie."	1
	1
The	1
nurse	1
lit	1
the	1
gilt	1
candles	1
before	1
the	1
icons	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
her	1
knitting.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
took	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
began	1
reading.	1
Only	1
when	1
footsteps	1
or	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
did	1
they	1
look	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
the	1
princess	1
anxious	1
and	1
inquiring,	1
the	1
nurse	1
encouraging.	1
Everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
dominated	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
experienced	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
her	1
room.	1
But	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
superstition	1
that	1
the	1
fewer	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
know	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
less	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail	1
suffers,	1
everyone	1
tried	1
to	1
pretend	1
not	1
to	1
know;	1
no	1
one	1
spoke	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
ordinary	1
staid	1
and	1
respectful	1
good	1
manners	1
habitual	1
in	1
the	1
prince's	1
household,	1
a	1
common	1
anxiety,	1
a	1
softening	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
something	1
great	1
and	1
mysterious	1
was	1
being	1
accomplished	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
made	1
itself	1
felt.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
laughter	1
in	1
the	1
maids'	1
large	1
hall.	1
In	1
the	1
men	1
servants'	1
hall	1
all	1
sat	1
waiting,	1
silently	1
and	1
alert.	1
In	1
the	1
outlying	1
serfs'	1
quarters	1
torches	1
and	1
candles	1
were	1
burning	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
slept.	1
The	1
old	1
prince,	1
stepping	1
on	1
his	1
heels,	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
sent	1
Tikhon	1
to	1
ask	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna	1
what	1
news.--"Say	1
only	1
that	1
'the	1
prince	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
ask,'	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
her	1
answer."	1
	1
"Inform	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
labor	1
has	1
begun,"	1
said	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna,	1
giving	1
the	1
messenger	1
a	1
significant	1
look.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"Very	1
good!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
Tikhon	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
slightest	1
sound	1
from	1
the	1
study	1
after	1
that.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
re-entered	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
snuff	1
the	1
candles,	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
noticed	1
his	1
perturbed	1
face,	1
shook	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
silently	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
snuffing	1
the	1
candles	1
or	1
saying	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
entered.	1
The	1
most	1
solemn	1
mystery	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
continued	1
its	1
course.	1
Evening	1
passed,	1
night	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
suspense	1
and	1
softening	1
of	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
unfathomable	1
did	1
not	1
lessen	1
but	1
increased.	1
No	1
one	1
slept.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
March	1
nights	1
when	1
winter	1
seems	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
resume	1
its	1
sway	1
and	1
scatters	1
its	1
last	1
snows	1
and	1
storms	1
with	1
desperate	1
fury.	1
A	1
relay	1
of	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
up	1
the	1
highroad	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
German	1
doctor	1
from	1
Moscow	1
who	1
was	1
expected	1
every	1
moment,	1
and	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
with	1
lanterns	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
crossroads	1
to	1
guide	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
country	1
road	1
with	1
its	1
hollows	1
and	1
snow-covered	1
pools	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
put	1
aside	1
her	1
book:	1
she	1
sat	1
silent,	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
nurse's	1
wrinkled	1
face	1
(every	1
line	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well),	1
on	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
gray	1
hair	1
that	1
escaped	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
kerchief,	1
and	1
the	1
loose	1
skin	1
that	1
hung	1
under	1
her	1
chin.	1
	1
Nurse	1
Savishna,	1
knitting	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
telling	1
in	1
low	1
tones,	1
scarcely	1
hearing	1
or	1
understanding	1
her	1
own	1
words,	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times	1
before:	1
how	1
the	1
late	1
princess	1
had	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
Kishenev	1
with	1
only	1
a	1
Moldavian	1
peasant	1
woman	1
to	1
help	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
midwife.	1
	1
"God	1
is	1
merciful,	1
doctors	1
are	1
never	1
needed,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
gust	1
of	1
wind	1
beat	1
violently	1
against	1
the	1
casement	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
double	1
frame	1
had	1
been	1
removed	1
(by	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
prince,	1
one	1
window	1
frame	1
was	1
removed	1
in	1
each	1
room	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
larks	1
returned),	1
and,	1
forcing	1
open	1
a	1
loosely	1
closed	1
latch,	1
set	1
the	1
damask	1
curtain	1
flapping	1
and	1
blew	1
out	1
the	1
candle	1
with	1
its	1
chill,	1
snowy	1
draft.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
shuddered;	1
her	1
nurse,	1
putting	1
down	1
the	1
stocking	1
she	1
was	1
knitting,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
leaning	1
out	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
open	1
casement.	1
The	1
cold	1
wind	1
flapped	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
her	1
kerchief	1
and	1
her	1
loose	1
locks	1
of	1
gray	1
hair.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
my	1
dear,	1
there's	1
someone	1
driving	1
up	1
the	1
avenue!"	1
she	1
said,	1
holding	1
the	1
casement	1
and	1
not	1
closing	1
it.	1
"With	1
lanterns.	1
Most	1
likely	1
the	1
doctor."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
thank	1
God!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
meet	1
him,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
Russian."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
threw	1
a	1
shawl	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
newcomer.	1
As	1
she	1
was	1
crossing	1
the	1
anteroom	1
she	1
saw	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
a	1
carriage	1
with	1
lanterns,	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance.	1
She	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
stairs.	1
On	1
a	1
banister	1
post	1
stood	1
a	1
tallow	1
candle	1
which	1
guttered	1
in	1
the	1
draft.	1
On	1
the	1
landing	1
below,	1
Philip,	1
the	1
footman,	1
stood	1
looking	1
scared	1
and	1
holding	1
another	1
candle.	1
Still	1
lower,	1
beyond	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
staircase,	1
one	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
footstep	1
of	1
someone	1
in	1
thick	1
felt	1
boots,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
saying	1
something.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
said	1
the	1
voice.	1
"And	1
Father?"	1
	1
"Gone	1
to	1
bed,"	1
replied	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Demyan	1
the	1
house	1
steward,	1
who	1
was	1
downstairs.	1
	1
Then	1
the	1
voice	1
said	1
something	1
more,	1
Demyan	1
replied,	1
and	1
the	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
felt	1
boots	1
approached	1
the	1
unseen	1
bend	1
of	1
the	1
staircase	1
more	1
rapidly.	1
	1
"It's	1
Andrew!"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"No	1
it	1
can't	1
be,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
extraordinary,"	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
she	1
thought	1
this,	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
in	1
a	1
fur	1
cloak	1
the	1
deep	1
collar	1
of	1
which	1
covered	1
with	1
snow,	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
landing	1
where	1
the	1
footman	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
candle.	1
Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
he,	1
pale,	1
thin,	1
with	1
a	1
changed	1
and	1
strangely	1
softened	1
but	1
agitated	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
embraced	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"You	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
my	1
letter?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
and	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply--	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
received,	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
speak--	1
he	1
turned	1
back,	1
rapidly	1
mounted	1
the	1
stairs	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
hall	1
after	1
him	1
(they	1
had	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
post	1
station),	1
and	1
again	1
embraced	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
strange	1
fate,	1
Masha	1
darling!"	1
And	1
having	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
felt	1
boots,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
apartment.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
lay	1
supported	1
by	1
pillows,	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
cap	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
(the	1
pains	1
had	1
just	1
left	1
her).	1
Strands	1
of	1
her	1
black	1
hair	1
lay	1
round	1
her	1
inflamed	1
and	1
perspiring	1
cheeks,	1
her	1
charming	1
rosy	1
mouth	1
with	1
its	1
downy	1
lip	1
was	1
open	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
smiling	1
joyfully.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
and	1
paused	1
facing	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
lying.	1
Her	1
glittering	1
eyes,	1
filled	1
with	1
childlike	1
fear	1
and	1
excitement,	1
rested	1
on	1
him	1
without	1
changing	1
their	1
expression.	1
"I	1
love	1
you	1
all	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone;	1
why	1
must	1
I	1
suffer	1
so?	1
Help	1
me!"	1
her	1
look	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
She	1
saw	1
her	1
husband,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
appearance	1
before	1
her	1
now.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
forehead.	1
	1
"My	1
darling!"	1
he	1
said--a	1
word	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
her	1
before.	1
"God	1
is	1
merciful...."	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
inquiringly	1
and	1
with	1
childlike	1
reproach.	1
	1
"I	1
expected	1
help	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
get	1
none,	1
none	1
from	1
you	1
either!"	1
said	1
her	1
eyes.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
having	1
come;	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come.	1
His	1
coming	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
sufferings	1
or	1
with	1
their	1
relief.	1
The	1
pangs	1
began	1
again	1
and	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna	1
advised	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
entered.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out	1
and,	1
meeting	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
again	1
joined	1
her.	1
They	1
began	1
talking	1
in	1
whispers,	1
but	1
their	1
talk	1
broke	1
off	1
at	1
every	1
moment.	1
They	1
waited	1
and	1
listened.	1
	1
"Go,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
sat	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
next	1
to	1
hers.	1
A	1
woman	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
became	1
confused	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
He	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
remained	1
so	1
for	1
some	1
minutes.	1
Piteous,	1
helpless,	1
animal	1
moans	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
got	1
up,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
Someone	1
was	1
holding	1
it	1
shut.	1
	1
"You	1
can't	1
come	1
in!	1
You	1
can't!"	1
said	1
a	1
terrified	1
voice	1
from	1
within.	1
	1
He	1
began	1
pacing	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
screaming	1
ceased,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
seconds	1
went	1
by.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
a	1
terrible	1
shriek--it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
hers,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
scream	1
like	1
that--came	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
door;	1
the	1
scream	1
ceased	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
wail	1
of	1
an	1
infant.	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
they	1
taken	1
a	1
baby	1
in	1
there	1
for?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
second.	1
"A	1
baby?	1
What	1
baby...?	1
Why	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
baby	1
there?	1
Or	1
is	1
the	1
baby	1
born?"	1
	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
he	1
realized	1
the	1
joyful	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
wail;	1
tears	1
choked	1
him,	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
be	1
began	1
to	1
cry,	1
sobbing	1
like	1
a	1
child.	1
The	1
door	1
opened.	1
The	1
doctor	1
with	1
his	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
tucked	1
up,	1
without	1
a	1
coat,	1
pale	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
trembling	1
jaw,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
doctor	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
bewildered	1
look	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
A	1
woman	1
rushed	1
out	1
and	1
seeing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped,	1
hesitating	1
on	1
the	1
threshold.	1
He	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
wife's	1
room.	1
She	1
was	1
lying	1
dead,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
before	1
and,	1
despite	1
the	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
pallor	1
of	1
the	1
cheeks,	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
was	1
on	1
her	1
charming	1
childlike	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
upper	1
lip	1
covered	1
with	1
tiny	1
black	1
hair.	1
	1
"I	1
love	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone;	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
me?"--said	1
her	1
charming,	1
pathetic,	1
dead	1
face.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
something	1
red	1
and	1
tiny	1
gave	1
a	1
grunt	1
and	1
squealed	1
in	1
Mary	1
Bogdanovna's	1
trembling	1
white	1
hands.	1
	1
Two	1
hours	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
stepping	1
softly,	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
father's	1
room.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
already	1
knew	1
everything.	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
opened	1
his	1
rough	1
old	1
arms	1
closed	1
like	1
a	1
vise	1
round	1
his	1
son's	1
neck,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
like	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
Three	1
days	1
later	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
buried,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
coffin	1
stood,	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
farewell	1
kiss.	1
And	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
face,	1
though	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes.	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
me?"	1
it	1
still	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
gave	1
way	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
guilty	1
of	1
a	1
sin	1
he	1
could	1
neither	1
remedy	1
nor	1
forget.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
weep.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
too	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
waxen	1
little	1
hands	1
that	1
lay	1
quietly	1
crossed	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
her	1
breast,	1
and	1
to	1
him,	1
too,	1
her	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
why?"	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
turned	1
angrily	1
away.	1
	1
Another	1
five	1
days	1
passed,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
young	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Andreevich	1
was	1
baptized.	1
The	1
wet	1
nurse	1
supported	1
the	1
coverlet	1
with	1
her	1
chin,	1
while	1
the	1
priest	1
with	1
a	1
goose	1
feather	1
anointed	1
the	1
boy's	1
little	1
red	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
soles	1
and	1
palms.	1
	1
His	1
grandfather,	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
godfather,	1
trembling	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
dropping	1
him,	1
carried	1
the	1
infant	1
round	1
the	1
battered	1
tin	1
font	1
and	1
handed	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
godmother,	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sat	1
in	1
another	1
room,	1
faint	1
with	1
fear	1
lest	1
the	1
baby	1
should	1
be	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
font,	1
and	1
awaited	1
the	1
termination	1
of	1
the	1
ceremony.	1
He	1
looked	1
up	1
joyfully	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
when	1
the	1
nurse	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
nodded	1
approval	1
when	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
wax	1
with	1
the	1
baby's	1
hair	1
had	1
not	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
font	1
but	1
had	1
floated.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Rostov's	1
share	1
in	1
Dolokhov's	1
duel	1
with	1
Bezukhov	1
was	1
hushed	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
degraded	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
as	1
he	1
expected	1
he	1
was	1
appointed	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
general	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
As	1
a	1
result	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
but	1
was	1
kept	1
all	1
summer	1
in	1
Moscow	1
by	1
his	1
new	1
duties.	1
Dolokhov	1
recovered,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
became	1
very	1
friendly	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
his	1
convalescence.	1
Dolokhov	1
lay	1
ill	1
at	1
his	1
mother's	1
who	1
loved	1
him	1
passionately	1
and	1
tenderly,	1
and	1
old	1
Mary	1
Ivanovna,	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
fond	1
of	1
Rostov	1
for	1
his	1
friendship	1
to	1
her	1
Fedya,	1
often	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
her	1
son.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Count,"	1
she	1
would	1
say,	1
"he	1
is	1
too	1
noble	1
and	1
pure-souled	1
for	1
our	1
present,	1
depraved	1
world.	1
No	1
one	1
now	1
loves	1
virtue;	1
it	1
seems	1
like	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
everyone.	1
Now	1
tell	1
me,	1
Count,	1
was	1
it	1
right,	1
was	1
it	1
honorable,	1
of	1
Bezukhov?	1
And	1
Fedya,	1
with	1
his	1
noble	1
spirit,	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
never	1
says	1
a	1
word	1
against	1
him.	1
Those	1
pranks	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
when	1
they	1
played	1
some	1
tricks	1
on	1
a	1
policeman,	1
didn't	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
together?	1
And	1
there!	1
Bezukhov	1
got	1
off	1
scotfree,	1
while	1
Fedya	1
had	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
whole	1
burden	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Fancy	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
through!	1
It's	1
true	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
reinstated,	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
they	1
fail	1
to	1
do	1
that?	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
such	1
gallant	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
fatherland	1
out	1
there	1
as	1
he.	1
And	1
now--this	1
duel!	1
Have	1
these	1
people	1
no	1
feeling,	1
or	1
honor?	1
Knowing	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
to	1
challenge	1
him	1
and	1
shoot	1
so	1
straight!	1
It's	1
well	1
God	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
us.	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
for?	1
Who	1
doesn't	1
have	1
intrigues	1
nowadays?	1
Why,	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
jealous,	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
things	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
shown	1
it	1
sooner,	1
but	1
he	1
lets	1
it	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
months.	1
And	1
then	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
out,	1
reckoning	1
on	1
Fedya	1
not	1
fighting	1
because	1
he	1
owed	1
him	1
money!	1
What	1
baseness!	1
What	1
meanness!	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
understand	1
Fedya,	1
my	1
dear	1
count;	1
that,	1
believe	1
me,	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
you.	1
Few	1
people	1
do	1
understand	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
lofty,	1
heavenly	1
soul!"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
himself	1
during	1
his	1
convalescence	1
spoke	1
to	1
Rostov	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
expected	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
people	1
consider	1
me	1
a	1
bad	1
man!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Let	1
them!	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
a	1
straw	1
about	1
anyone	1
but	1
those	1
I	1
love;	1
but	1
those	1
I	1
love,	1
I	1
love	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
I'd	1
throttle	1
if	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
my	1
way.	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
adored,	1
a	1
priceless	1
mother,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
friends--you	1
among	1
them--and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
I	1
only	1
care	1
about	1
them	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
harmful	1
or	1
useful.	1
And	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
harmful,	1
especially	1
the	1
women.	1
Yes,	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"I	1
have	1
met	1
loving,	1
noble,	1
high-minded	1
men,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
met	1
any	1
women--countesses	1
or	1
cooks--who	1
were	1
not	1
venal.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
met	1
that	1
divine	1
purity	1
and	1
devotion	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
in	1
women.	1
If	1
I	1
found	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
I'd	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
her!	1
But	1
those!..."	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
contempt.	1
"And	1
believe	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
still	1
value	1
my	1
life	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
still	1
hope	1
to	1
meet	1
such	1
a	1
divine	1
creature,	1
who	1
will	1
regenerate,	1
purify,	1
and	1
elevate	1
me.	1
But	1
you	1
don't	1
understand	1
it."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
quite	1
understand,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
new	1
friend's	1
influence.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
autumn	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
Denisov	1
also	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
stayed	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
first	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
1806,	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
spent	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
happiest,	1
merriest	1
times	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
family.	1
Nicholas	1
brought	1
many	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
his	1
parents'	1
house.	1
Vera	1
was	1
a	1
handsome	1
girl	1
of	1
twenty;	1
Sonya	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
sixteen	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
an	1
opening	1
flower;	1
Natasha,	1
half	1
grown	1
up	1
and	1
half	1
child,	1
was	1
now	1
childishly	1
amusing,	1
now	1
girlishly	1
enchanting.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
there	1
prevailed	1
an	1
amorous	1
atmosphere	1
characteristic	1
of	1
homes	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
young	1
and	1
very	1
charming	1
girls.	1
Every	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house--seeing	1
those	1
impressionable,	1
smiling	1
young	1
faces	1
(smiling	1
probably	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
happiness),	1
feeling	1
the	1
eager	1
bustle	1
around	1
him,	1
and	1
hearing	1
the	1
fitful	1
bursts	1
of	1
song	1
and	1
music	1
and	1
the	1
inconsequent	1
but	1
friendly	1
prattle	1
of	1
young	1
girls	1
ready	1
for	1
anything	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
hope--experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling;	1
sharing	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
folk	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
household	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
an	1
expectation	1
of	1
happiness.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
introduced	1
by	1
Rostov	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
was	1
Dolokhov,	1
whom	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
liked	1
except	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
almost	1
quarreled	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
about	1
him.	1
She	1
insisted	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
duel	1
with	1
Bezukhov,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
wrong,	1
and	1
further	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
and	1
unnatural.	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
understand,"	1
she	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
resolute	1
self-will,	1
"he	1
is	1
wicked	1
and	1
heartless.	1
There	1
now,	1
I	1
like	1
your	1
Denisov	1
though	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
rake	1
and	1
all	1
that,	1
still	1
I	1
like	1
him;	1
so	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
do	1
understand.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
put	1
it...	1
with	1
this	1
one	1
everything	1
is	1
calculated,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
that.	1
But	1
Denisov..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Denisov	1
is	1
quite	1
different,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
implying	1
that	1
even	1
Denisov	1
was	1
nothing	1
compared	1
to	1
Dolokhov--"you	1
must	1
understand	1
what	1
a	1
soul	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
Dolokhov,	1
you	1
should	1
see	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
mother.	1
What	1
a	1
heart!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
about	1
that,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
uncomfortable	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Sonya?"	1
	1
"What	1
nonsense..."	1
	1
"I'm	1
certain	1
of	1
it;	1
you'll	1
see."	1
	1
Natasha's	1
prediction	1
proved	1
true.	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
usually	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
ladies,	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
often	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
he	1
came	1
(though	1
no	1
one	1
spoke	1
of	1
it)	1
was	1
soon	1
settled.	1
He	1
came	1
because	1
of	1
Sonya.	1
And	1
Sonya,	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
say	1
so,	1
knew	1
it	1
and	1
blushed	1
scarlet	1
every	1
time	1
Dolokhov	1
appeared.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
often	1
dined	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs',	1
never	1
missed	1
a	1
performance	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
present,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Iogel's	1
balls	1
for	1
young	1
people	1
which	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
always	1
attended.	1
He	1
was	1
pointedly	1
attentive	1
to	1
Sonya	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
could	1
she	1
not	1
bear	1
his	1
glances	1
without	1
coloring,	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
and	1
Natasha	1
blushed	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
his	1
looks.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
this	1
strange,	1
strong	1
man	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
irresistible	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
dark,	1
graceful	1
girl	1
who	1
loved	1
another.	1
	1
Rostov	1
noticed	1
something	1
new	1
in	1
Dolokhov's	1
relations	1
with	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
explain	1
to	1
himself	1
what	1
these	1
new	1
relations	1
were.	1
"They're	1
always	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
someone,"	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
was	1
less	1
frequently	1
at	1
home.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
autumn	1
of	1
1806	1
everybody	1
had	1
again	1
begun	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
warmth	1
than	1
the	1
year	1
before.	1
Orders	1
were	1
given	1
to	1
raise	1
recruits,	1
ten	1
men	1
in	1
every	1
thousand	1
for	1
the	1
regular	1
army,	1
and	1
besides	1
this,	1
nine	1
men	1
in	1
every	1
thousand	1
for	1
the	1
militia.	1
Everywhere	1
Bonaparte	1
was	1
anathematized	1
and	1
in	1
Moscow	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
coming	1
war	1
was	1
talked	1
of.	1
For	1
the	1
Rostov	1
family	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
these	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
remaining	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
only	1
awaited	1
the	1
termination	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
furlough	1
after	1
Christmas	1
to	1
return	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
their	1
regiment.	1
His	1
approaching	1
departure	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
amusing	1
himself,	1
but	1
rather	1
gave	1
zest	1
to	1
his	1
pleasures.	1
He	1
spent	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
away	1
from	1
home,	1
at	1
dinners,	1
parties,	1
and	1
balls.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
Christmas	1
Nicholas	1
dined	1
at	1
home,	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
had	1
rarely	1
done	1
of	1
late.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
grand	1
farewell	1
dinner,	1
as	1
he	1
and	1
Denisov	1
were	1
leaving	1
to	1
join	1
their	1
regiment	1
after	1
Epiphany.	1
About	1
twenty	1
people	1
were	1
present,	1
including	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Never	1
had	1
love	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
amorous	1
atmosphere	1
made	1
itself	1
so	1
strongly	1
felt	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
holiday	1
time.	1
"Seize	1
the	1
moments	1
of	1
happiness,	1
love	1
and	1
be	1
loved!	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
reality	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
all	1
else	1
is	1
folly.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
we	1
are	1
interested	1
in	1
here,"	1
said	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
place.	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
having	1
as	1
usual	1
exhausted	1
two	1
pairs	1
of	1
horses,	1
without	1
visiting	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
invited,	1
returned	1
home	1
just	1
before	1
dinner.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
he	1
noticed	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
tension	1
of	1
the	1
amorous	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
also	1
noticed	1
a	1
curious	1
embarrassment	1
among	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
present.	1
Sonya,	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
were	1
especially	1
disturbed,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
lesser	1
degree	1
Natasha.	1
Nicholas	1
understood	1
that	1
something	1
must	1
have	1
happened	1
between	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
before	1
dinner,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
kindly	1
sensitiveness	1
natural	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
very	1
gentle	1
and	1
wary	1
with	1
them	1
both	1
at	1
dinner.	1
On	1
that	1
same	1
evening	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
balls	1
that	1
Iogel	1
(the	1
dancing	1
master)	1
gave	1
for	1
his	1
pupils	1
during	1
the	1
holidays.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
will	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
Iogel's?	1
Please	1
do!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"He	1
asked	1
you,	1
and	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
*	1
is	1
also	1
going."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Where	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
go	1
at	1
the	1
countess'	1
command!"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
had	1
jocularly	1
assumed	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
knight.	1
"I'm	1
even	1
weady	1
to	1
dance	1
the	1
pas	1
de	1
chale."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
have	1
time,"	1
answered	1
Nicholas.	1
"But	1
I	1
promised	1
the	1
Arkharovs;	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
party."	1
	1
"And	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Dolokhov,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
put.	1
	1
"Perhaps,"	1
coldly	1
and	1
angrily	1
replied	1
Dolokhov,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Sonya,	1
and,	1
scowling,	1
he	1
gave	1
Nicholas	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
look	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
dinner.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
something	1
up,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
further	1
confirmed	1
in	1
this	1
conclusion	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
left	1
immediately	1
after	1
dinner.	1
He	1
called	1
Natasha	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
running	1
out	1
to	1
him.	1
"I	1
told	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
it,"	1
she	1
said	1
triumphantly.	1
"He	1
has	1
proposed	1
to	1
Sonya!"	1
	1
Little	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
occupied	1
himself	1
with	1
Sonya	1
of	1
late,	1
something	1
seemed	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
within	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
news.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
suitable	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
respects	1
a	1
brilliant	1
match	1
for	1
the	1
dowerless,	1
orphan	1
girl.	1
From	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
and	1
of	1
society	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
refuse	1
him.	1
And	1
therefore	1
Nicholas'	1
first	1
feeling	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
news	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
anger	1
with	1
Sonya....	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say,	1
"That's	1
capital;	1
of	1
course	1
she'll	1
forget	1
her	1
childish	1
promises	1
and	1
accept	1
the	1
offer,"	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
Natasha	1
began	1
again.	1
	1
"And	1
fancy!	1
she	1
refused	1
him	1
quite	1
definitely!"	1
adding,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
loved	1
another."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
Sonya	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
otherwise!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Much	1
as	1
Mamma	1
pressed	1
her,	1
she	1
refused,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
she	1
won't	1
change	1
once	1
she	1
has	1
said..."	1
	1
"And	1
Mamma	1
pressed	1
her!"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Nicholas--don't	1
be	1
angry--but	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
marry	1
her.	1
I	1
know,	1
heaven	1
knows	1
how,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
you	1
won't	1
marry	1
her."	1
	1
"Now	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
at	1
all!"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"But	1
I	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
her.	1
What	1
a	1
darling	1
Sonya	1
is!"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
she	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
darling!	1
I'll	1
send	1
her	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
And	1
Natasha	1
kissed	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
ran	1
away.	1
	1
A	1
minute	1
later	1
Sonya	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
frightened,	1
guilty,	1
and	1
scared	1
look.	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
his	1
return	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
talked	1
alone	1
and	1
about	1
their	1
love.	1
	1
"Sophie,"	1
he	1
began,	1
timidly	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
boldly,	1
"if	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
refuse	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
brilliant	1
and	1
advantageous	1
match	1
but	1
a	1
splendid,	1
noble	1
fellow...	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
friend..."	1
	1
Sonya	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
refused,"	1
she	1
said	1
hurriedly.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
are	1
refusing	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
I..."	1
	1
Sonya	1
again	1
interrupted.	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
imploring,	1
frightened	1
look.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
don't	1
tell	1
me	1
that!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
must.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
arrogant	1
of	1
me,	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
is	1
best	1
to	1
say	1
it.	1
If	1
you	1
refuse	1
him	1
on	1
my	1
account,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
anyone	1
else...."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
blushing.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
and	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
again,	1
though	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
have	1
I	1
such	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
friendship,	1
confidence,	1
and	1
love	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
you.	1
Then	1
I	1
am	1
young.	1
Mamma	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
it.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
promise.	1
And	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
consider	1
Dolokhov's	1
offer,"	1
he	1
said,	1
articulating	1
his	1
friend's	1
name	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"Don't	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
me!	1
I	1
want	1
nothing.	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
brother	1
and	1
always	1
shall,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
nothing	1
more."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
an	1
angel:	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
misleading	1
you."	1
	1
And	1
Nicholas	1
again	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
Iogel's	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
enjoyable	1
balls	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
So	1
said	1
the	1
mothers	1
as	1
they	1
watched	1
their	1
young	1
people	1
executing	1
their	1
newly	1
learned	1
steps,	1
and	1
so	1
said	1
the	1
youths	1
and	1
maidens	1
themselves	1
as	1
they	1
danced	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
drop,	1
and	1
so	1
said	1
the	1
grown-up	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
these	1
balls	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
condescension	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
most	1
enjoyable.	1
That	1
year	1
two	1
marriages	1
had	1
come	1
of	1
these	1
balls.	1
The	1
two	1
pretty	1
young	1
Princesses	1
Gorchakov	1
met	1
suitors	1
there	1
and	1
were	1
married	1
and	1
so	1
further	1
increased	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
these	1
dances.	1
What	1
distinguished	1
them	1
from	1
others	1
was	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
host	1
or	1
hostess	1
and	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
good-natured	1
Iogel,	1
flying	1
about	1
like	1
a	1
feather	1
and	1
bowing	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
his	1
art,	1
as	1
he	1
collected	1
the	1
tickets	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
visitors.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
only	1
those	1
came	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
dance	1
and	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
as	1
girls	1
of	1
thirteen	1
and	1
fourteen	1
do	1
who	1
are	1
wearing	1
long	1
dresses	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
With	1
scarcely	1
any	1
exceptions	1
they	1
all	1
were,	1
or	1
seemed	1
to	1
be,	1
pretty--so	1
rapturous	1
were	1
their	1
smiles	1
and	1
so	1
sparkling	1
their	1
eyes.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
pupils,	1
of	1
whom	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
graceful,	1
was	1
first,	1
even	1
danced	1
the	1
pas	1
de	1
chale,	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
last	1
ball	1
only	1
the	1
ecossaise,	1
the	1
anglaise,	1
and	1
the	1
mazurka,	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
coming	1
into	1
fashion,	1
were	1
danced.	1
Iogel	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
ballroom	1
in	1
Bezukhov's	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
ball,	1
as	1
everyone	1
said,	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
success.	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
pretty	1
girls	1
and	1
the	1
Rostov	1
girls	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
prettiest.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
particularly	1
happy	1
and	1
gay.	1
That	1
evening,	1
proud	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
proposal,	1
her	1
refusal,	1
and	1
her	1
explanation	1
with	1
Nicholas,	1
Sonya	1
twirled	1
about	1
before	1
she	1
left	1
home	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
maid	1
could	1
hardly	1
get	1
her	1
hair	1
plaited,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
transparently	1
radiant	1
with	1
impulsive	1
joy.	1
	1
Natasha	1
no	1
less	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
first	1
long	1
dress	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
at	1
a	1
real	1
ball	1
was	1
even	1
happier.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
dressed	1
in	1
white	1
muslin	1
with	1
pink	1
ribbons.	1
	1
Natasha	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
anyone	1
in	1
particular,	1
but	1
with	1
everyone.	1
Whatever	1
person	1
she	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
for	1
that	1
moment.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
delightful	1
it	1
is!"	1
she	1
kept	1
saying,	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
Sonya.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Denisov	1
were	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
looking	1
with	1
kindly	1
patronage	1
at	1
the	1
dancers.	1
	1
"How	1
sweet	1
she	1
is--she	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
weal	1
beauty!"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Who?"	1
	1
"Countess	1
Natasha,"	1
answered	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
she	1
dances!	1
What	1
gwace!"	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?"	1
	1
"About	1
your	1
sister,"	1
ejaculated	1
Denisov	1
testily.	1
	1
Rostov	1
smiled.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
count,	1
you	1
were	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
best	1
pupils--you	1
must	1
dance,"	1
said	1
little	1
Iogel	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
"Look	1
how	1
many	1
charming	1
young	1
ladies-"	1
He	1
turned	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
request	1
to	1
Denisov	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
former	1
pupil	1
of	1
his.	1
	1
"No,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I'll	1
be	1
a	1
wallflower,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
wecollect	1
what	1
bad	1
use	1
I	1
made	1
of	1
your	1
lessons?"	1
	1
	1
"Oh	1
no!"	1
said	1
Iogel,	1
hastening	1
to	1
reassure	1
him.	1
"You	1
were	1
only	1
inattentive,	1
but	1
you	1
had	1
talent--oh	1
yes,	1
you	1
had	1
talent!"	1
	1
The	1
band	1
struck	1
up	1
the	1
newly	1
introduced	1
mazurka.	1
Nicholas	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
Iogel	1
and	1
asked	1
Sonya	1
to	1
dance.	1
Denisov	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
old	1
ladies	1
and,	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
saber	1
and	1
beating	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
foot,	1
told	1
them	1
something	1
funny	1
and	1
kept	1
them	1
amused,	1
while	1
he	1
watched	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
dancing,	1
Iogel	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
his	1
pride	1
and	1
his	1
best	1
pupil,	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
couple.	1
Noiselessly,	1
skillfully	1
stepping	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
feet	1
in	1
low	1
shoes,	1
Iogel	1
flew	1
first	1
across	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
who,	1
though	1
shy,	1
went	1
on	1
carefully	1
executing	1
her	1
steps.	1
Denisov	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
and	1
beat	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
saber	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
clearly	1
indicated	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
dancing	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
and	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
figure	1
he	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Rostov	1
who	1
was	1
passing:	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
thing,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"What	1
sort	1
of	1
Polish	1
mazuwka	1
is	1
this?	1
But	1
she	1
does	1
dance	1
splendidly."	1
	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Denisov	1
had	1
a	1
reputation	1
even	1
in	1
Poland	1
for	1
the	1
masterly	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
danced	1
the	1
mazurka,	1
Nicholas	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
Natasha:	1
	1
"Go	1
and	1
choose	1
Denisov.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
dancer,	1
a	1
wonder!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
When	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
turn	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
partner,	1
she	1
rose	1
and,	1
tripping	1
rapidly	1
across	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
shoes	1
trimmed	1
with	1
bows,	1
ran	1
timidly	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
where	1
Denisov	1
sat.	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
everybody	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
waiting.	1
Nicholas	1
saw	1
that	1
Denisov	1
was	1
refusing	1
though	1
he	1
smiled	1
delightedly.	1
He	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
"Please,	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich,"	1
Natasha	1
was	1
saying,	1
"do	1
come!"	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
let	1
me	1
off,	1
Countess,"	1
Denisov	1
replied.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
Vaska,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"They	1
coax	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
Vaska	1
the	1
cat!"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
jokingly.	1
	1
"I'll	1
sing	1
for	1
you	1
a	1
whole	1
evening,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
faiwy!	1
She	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
me!"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
he	1
unhooked	1
his	1
saber.	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
chairs,	1
clasped	1
his	1
partner's	1
hand	1
firmly,	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
advanced	1
his	1
foot,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
beat.	1
Only	1
on	1
horse	1
back	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mazurka	1
was	1
Denisov's	1
short	1
stature	1
not	1
noticeable	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
the	1
fine	1
fellow	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be.	1
At	1
the	1
right	1
beat	1
of	1
the	1
music	1
he	1
looked	1
sideways	1
at	1
his	1
partner	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
and	1
triumphant	1
air,	1
suddenly	1
stamped	1
with	1
one	1
foot,	1
bounded	1
from	1
the	1
floor	1
like	1
a	1
ball,	1
and	1
flew	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
taking	1
his	1
partner	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
glided	1
silently	1
on	1
one	1
foot	1
half	1
across	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
seeming	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
chairs	1
was	1
dashing	1
straight	1
at	1
them,	1
when	1
suddenly,	1
clinking	1
his	1
spurs	1
and	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
legs,	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
on	1
his	1
heels,	1
stood	1
so	1
a	1
second,	1
stamped	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
clanking	1
his	1
spurs,	1
whirled	1
rapidly	1
round,	1
and,	1
striking	1
his	1
left	1
heel	1
against	1
his	1
right,	1
flew	1
round	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
circle.	1
Natasha	1
guessed	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
abandoning	1
herself	1
to	1
him	1
followed	1
his	1
lead	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
how.	1
First	1
he	1
spun	1
her	1
round,	1
holding	1
her	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
left,	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
then	1
falling	1
on	1
one	1
knee	1
he	1
twirled	1
her	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
again	1
jumping	1
up,	1
dashed	1
so	1
impetuously	1
forward	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
rush	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
suite	1
of	1
rooms	1
without	1
drawing	1
breath,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
and	1
performed	1
some	1
new	1
and	1
unexpected	1
steps.	1
When	1
at	1
last,	1
smartly	1
whirling	1
his	1
partner	1
round	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
chair,	1
he	1
drew	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
click	1
of	1
his	1
spurs	1
and	1
bowed	1
to	1
her,	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
curtsy.	1
She	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
amazement,	1
smiling	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
this	1
mean?"	1
she	1
brought	1
out.	1
	1
Although	1
Iogel	1
did	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
real	1
mazurka,	1
everyone	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
Denisov's	1
skill,	1
he	1
was	1
asked	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
as	1
a	1
partner,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
began	1
smilingly	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
Poland	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
days.	1
Denisov,	1
flushed	1
after	1
the	1
mazurka	1
and	1
mopping	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
handkerchief,	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
Natasha	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
For	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
that	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
Dolokhov	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
or	1
at	1
Dolokhov's	1
home:	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
received	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
him:	1
	1
As	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
your	1
house	1
again	1
for	1
reasons	1
you	1
know	1
of,	1
and	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
rejoin	1
my	1
regiment,	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
a	1
farewell	1
supper	1
tonight	1
to	1
my	1
friends--come	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
Hotel.	1
	1
About	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
Hotel	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
theater,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
Denisov.	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
shown	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
room,	1
which	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
taken	1
for	1
that	1
evening.	1
Some	1
twenty	1
men	1
were	1
gathered	1
round	1
a	1
table	1
at	1
which	1
Dolokhov	1
sat	1
between	1
two	1
candles.	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
paper	1
money,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
keeping	1
the	1
bank.	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
his	1
proposal	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
refusal	1
and	1
felt	1
uncomfortable	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
meet.	1
	1
Dolokhov's	1
clear,	1
cold	1
glance	1
met	1
Rostov	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
door,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
expected	1
him.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
since	1
we	1
met,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Thanks	1
for	1
coming.	1
I'll	1
just	1
finish	1
dealing,	1
and	1
then	1
Ilyushka	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
his	1
chorus."	1
	1
"I	1
called	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
at	1
your	1
house,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
reddening.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
punt,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Rostov	1
recalled	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
strange	1
conversation	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
had	1
with	1
Dolokhov.	1
"None	1
but	1
fools	1
trust	1
to	1
luck	1
in	1
play,"	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
then	1
said.	1
	1
"Or	1
are	1
you	1
afraid	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
me?"	1
Dolokhov	1
now	1
asked	1
as	1
if	1
guessing	1
Rostov's	1
thought.	1
	1
Beneath	1
his	1
smile	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
mood	1
he	1
had	1
shown	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
dinner	1
and	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
when	1
as	1
if	1
tired	1
of	1
everyday	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
it	1
by	1
some	1
strange,	1
and	1
usually	1
cruel,	1
action.	1
	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease.	1
He	1
tried,	1
but	1
failed,	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
joke	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
Dolokhov's	1
words.	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
anything,	1
Dolokhov,	1
looking	1
straight	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
said	1
slowly	1
and	1
deliberately	1
so	1
that	1
everyone	1
could	1
hear:	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
about	1
cards...	1
'He's	1
a	1
fool	1
who	1
trusts	1
to	1
luck,	1
one	1
should	1
make	1
certain,'	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
try."	1
	1
"To	1
try	1
his	1
luck	1
or	1
the	1
certainty?"	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
himself.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you'd	1
better	1
not	1
play,"	1
Dolokhov	1
added,	1
and	1
springing	1
a	1
new	1
pack	1
of	1
cards	1
said:	1
"Bank,	1
gentlemen!"	1
	1
Moving	1
the	1
money	1
forward	1
he	1
prepared	1
to	1
deal.	1
Rostov	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
did	1
not	1
play.	1
Dolokhov	1
kept	1
glancing	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
play?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
And	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
card,	1
putting	1
a	1
small	1
stake	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
play.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
money	1
with	1
me,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"I'll	1
trust	1
you."	1
	1
Rostov	1
staked	1
five	1
rubles	1
on	1
a	1
card	1
and	1
lost,	1
staked	1
again,	1
and	1
again	1
lost.	1
Dolokhov	1
"killed,"	1
that	1
is,	1
beat,	1
ten	1
cards	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
running.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
dealt	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
"Please	1
place	1
your	1
money	1
on	1
the	1
cards	1
or	1
I	1
may	1
get	1
muddled	1
in	1
the	1
reckoning."	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
players	1
said	1
he	1
hoped	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
trusted.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
might,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
the	1
accounts	1
mixed.	1
So	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
money	1
on	1
your	1
cards,"	1
replied	1
Dolokhov.	1
"Don't	1
stint	1
yourself,	1
we'll	1
settle	1
afterwards,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
The	1
game	1
continued;	1
a	1
waiter	1
kept	1
handing	1
round	1
champagne.	1
	1
All	1
Rostov's	1
cards	1
were	1
beaten	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
eight	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
scored	1
up	1
against	1
him.	1
He	1
wrote	1
"800	1
rubles"	1
on	1
a	1
card,	1
but	1
while	1
the	1
waiter	1
filled	1
his	1
glass	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
altered	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
stake	1
of	1
twenty	1
rubles.	1
	1
"Leave	1
it,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
even	1
looking	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
"you'll	1
win	1
it	1
back	1
all	1
the	1
sooner.	1
I	1
lose	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
but	1
win	1
from	1
you.	1
Or	1
are	1
you	1
afraid	1
of	1
me?"	1
he	1
asked	1
again.	1
	1
Rostov	1
submitted.	1
He	1
let	1
the	1
eight	1
hundred	1
remain	1
and	1
laid	1
down	1
a	1
seven	1
of	1
hearts	1
with	1
a	1
torn	1
corner,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
floor.	1
He	1
well	1
remembered	1
that	1
seven	1
afterwards.	1
He	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
seven	1
of	1
hearts,	1
on	1
which	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
bit	1
of	1
chalk	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
"800	1
rubles"	1
in	1
clear	1
upright	1
figures;	1
he	1
emptied	1
the	1
glass	1
of	1
warm	1
champagne	1
that	1
was	1
handed	1
him,	1
smiled	1
at	1
Dolokhov's	1
words,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart,	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
seven	1
to	1
turn	1
up,	1
gazed	1
at	1
Dolokhov's	1
hands	1
which	1
held	1
the	1
pack.	1
Much	1
depended	1
on	1
Rostov's	1
winning	1
or	1
losing	1
on	1
that	1
seven	1
of	1
hearts.	1
On	1
the	1
previous	1
Sunday	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
son	1
two	1
thousand	1
rubles,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
always	1
disliked	1
speaking	1
of	1
money	1
difficulties	1
had	1
told	1
Nicholas	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
till	1
May,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
economical	1
this	1
time.	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
anything	1
more	1
till	1
the	1
spring.	1
Now	1
only	1
twelve	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
that	1
money,	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
seven	1
of	1
hearts	1
meant	1
for	1
him	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
sixteen	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
but	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
going	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
word.	1
With	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart	1
he	1
watched	1
Dolokhov's	1
hands	1
and	1
thought,	1
"Now	1
then,	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
this	1
card	1
and	1
I'll	1
take	1
my	1
cap	1
and	1
drive	1
home	1
to	1
supper	1
with	1
Denisov,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
will	1
certainly	1
never	1
touch	1
a	1
card	1
again."	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
his	1
home	1
life,	1
jokes	1
with	1
Petya,	1
talks	1
with	1
Sonya,	1
duets	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
piquet	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
even	1
his	1
comfortable	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Povarskaya	1
rose	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
vividness,	1
clearness,	1
and	1
charm	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
a	1
lost	1
and	1
unappreciated	1
bliss,	1
long	1
past.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
that	1
a	1
stupid	1
chance,	1
letting	1
the	1
seven	1
be	1
dealt	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
might	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
happiness,	1
newly	1
appreciated	1
and	1
newly	1
illumined,	1
and	1
plunge	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
unknown	1
and	1
undefined	1
misery.	1
That	1
could	1
not	1
be,	1
yet	1
he	1
awaited	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
hands.	1
Those	1
broad,	1
reddish	1
hands,	1
with	1
hairy	1
wrists	1
visible	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
shirt	1
cuffs,	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
pack	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
glass	1
and	1
a	1
pipe	1
that	1
were	1
handed	1
him.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
me?"	1
repeated	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
good	1
story	1
he	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
cards,	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
began	1
deliberately	1
with	1
a	1
smile:	1
	1
"Yes,	1
gentlemen,	1
I've	1
been	1
told	1
there's	1
a	1
rumor	1
going	1
about	1
Moscow	1
that	1
I'm	1
a	1
sharper,	1
so	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
careful."	1
	1
"Come	1
now,	1
deal!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
those	1
Moscow	1
gossips!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
cards	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Aah!"	1
Rostov	1
almost	1
screamed	1
lifting	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
his	1
head.	1
The	1
seven	1
he	1
needed	1
was	1
lying	1
uppermost,	1
the	1
first	1
card	1
in	1
the	1
pack.	1
He	1
had	1
lost	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
pay.	1
	1
"Still,	1
don't	1
ruin	1
yourself!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
a	1
side	1
glance	1
at	1
Rostov	1
as	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
deal.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
An	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
later	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
players	1
were	1
but	1
little	1
interested	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
play.	1
	1
The	1
whole	1
interest	1
was	1
concentrated	1
on	1
Rostov.	1
Instead	1
of	1
sixteen	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
column	1
of	1
figures	1
scored	1
against	1
him,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
reckoned	1
up	1
to	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
but	1
that	1
now,	1
as	1
he	1
vaguely	1
supposed,	1
must	1
have	1
risen	1
to	1
fifteen	1
thousand.	1
In	1
reality	1
it	1
already	1
exceeded	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
rubles.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
listening	1
to	1
stories	1
or	1
telling	1
them,	1
but	1
followed	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
hands	1
and	1
occasionally	1
ran	1
his	1
eyes	1
over	1
the	1
score	1
against	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
play	1
until	1
that	1
score	1
reached	1
forty-three	1
thousand.	1
He	1
had	1
fixed	1
on	1
that	1
number	1
because	1
forty-three	1
was	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
joint	1
ages.	1
Rostov,	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
both	1
hands,	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
which	1
was	1
scrawled	1
over	1
with	1
figures,	1
wet	1
with	1
spilled	1
wine,	1
and	1
littered	1
with	1
cards.	1
One	1
tormenting	1
impression	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
him:	1
that	1
those	1
broad-	1
boned	1
reddish	1
hands	1
with	1
hairy	1
wrists	1
visible	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
shirt	1
sleeves,	1
those	1
hands	1
which	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
hated,	1
held	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
power.	1
	1
"Six	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
ace,	1
a	1
corner,	1
a	1
nine...	1
winning	1
it	1
back's	1
impossible...	1
Oh,	1
how	1
pleasant	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
home!...	1
The	1
knave,	1
double	1
or	1
quits...	1
it	1
can't	1
be!...	1
And	1
why	1
is	1
he	1
doing	1
this	1
to	1
me?"	1
Rostov	1
pondered.	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
staked	1
a	1
large	1
sum,	1
but	1
Dolokhov	1
refused	1
to	1
accept	1
it	1
and	1
fixed	1
the	1
stake	1
himself.	1
Nicholas	1
submitted	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield	1
at	1
the	1
bridge	1
over	1
the	1
Enns,	1
and	1
then	1
guessed	1
that	1
the	1
card	1
that	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
crumpled	1
heap	1
under	1
the	1
table	1
would	1
save	1
him,	1
now	1
counted	1
the	1
cords	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
card	1
with	1
that	1
number	1
and	1
tried	1
staking	1
the	1
total	1
of	1
his	1
losses	1
on	1
it,	1
then	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
aid	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
players,	1
or	1
peered	1
at	1
the	1
now	1
cold	1
face	1
of	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
read	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"He	1
knows	1
of	1
course	1
what	1
this	1
loss	1
means	1
to	1
me.	1
He	1
can't	1
want	1
my	1
ruin.	1
Wasn't	1
he	1
my	1
friend?	1
Wasn't	1
I	1
fond	1
of	1
him?	1
But	1
it's	1
not	1
his	1
fault.	1
What's	1
he	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
such	1
luck?...	1
And	1
it's	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
either,"	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
himself,	1
"I	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
wrong.	1
Have	1
I	1
killed	1
anyone,	1
or	1
insulted	1
or	1
wished	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone?	1
Why	1
such	1
a	1
terrible	1
misfortune?	1
And	1
when	1
did	1
it	1
begin?	1
Such	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
ago	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
this	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
winning	1
a	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
to	1
buy	1
that	1
casket	1
for	1
Mamma's	1
name	1
day	1
and	1
then	1
going	1
home.	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
happy,	1
so	1
free,	1
so	1
lighthearted!	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
was!	1
When	1
did	1
that	1
end	1
and	1
when	1
did	1
this	1
new,	1
terrible	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
begin?	1
What	1
marked	1
the	1
change?	1
I	1
sat	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
place	1
at	1
this	1
table,	1
chose	1
and	1
placed	1
cards,	1
and	1
watched	1
those	1
broad-boned	1
agile	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
When	1
did	1
it	1
happen	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
happened?	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
and	1
strong	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!	1
Surely	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
end	1
in	1
nothing!"	1
	1
He	1
was	1
flushed	1
and	1
bathed	1
in	1
perspiration,	1
though	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
not	1
hot.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
terrible	1
and	1
piteous	1
to	1
see,	1
especially	1
from	1
its	1
helpless	1
efforts	1
to	1
seem	1
calm.	1
	1
The	1
score	1
against	1
him	1
reached	1
the	1
fateful	1
sum	1
of	1
forty-three	1
thousand.	1
Rostov	1
had	1
just	1
prepared	1
a	1
card,	1
by	1
bending	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
double	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
just	1
put	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
score,	1
when	1
Dolokhov,	1
slamming	1
down	1
the	1
pack	1
of	1
cards,	1
put	1
it	1
aside	1
and	1
began	1
rapidly	1
adding	1
up	1
the	1
total	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
debt,	1
breaking	1
the	1
chalk	1
as	1
he	1
marked	1
the	1
figures	1
in	1
his	1
clear,	1
bold	1
hand.	1
	1
"Supper,	1
it's	1
time	1
for	1
supper!	1
And	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
gypsies!"	1
	1
Some	1
swarthy	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
were	1
really	1
entering	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
outside	1
and	1
saying	1
something	1
in	1
their	1
gypsy	1
accents.	1
Nicholas	1
understood	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over;	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
indifferent	1
tone:	1
	1
"Well,	1
won't	1
you	1
go	1
on?	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
splendid	1
card	1
all	1
ready,"	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
fun	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
which	1
interested	1
him	1
most.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
up!	1
I'm	1
lost!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"Now	1
a	1
bullet	1
through	1
my	1
brain--	1
that's	1
all	1
that's	1
left	1
me!"	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
voice:	1
	1
"Come	1
now,	1
just	1
this	1
one	1
more	1
little	1
card!"	1
	1
"All	1
right!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
having	1
finished	1
the	1
addition.	1
"All	1
right!	1
Twenty-one	1
rubles,"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
figure	1
twenty-one	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
total	1
exceeded	1
the	1
round	1
sum	1
of	1
forty-three	1
thousand;	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
pack	1
he	1
prepared	1
to	1
deal.	1
Rostov	1
submissively	1
unbent	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
card	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
six	1
thousand	1
he	1
had	1
intended,	1
carefully	1
wrote	1
twenty-one.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
win	1
this	1
ten,	1
or	1
beat	1
it."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
began	1
to	1
deal	1
seriously.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
Rostov	1
detested	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
those	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
short	1
reddish	1
fingers	1
and	1
hairy	1
wrists,	1
which	1
held	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
power....	1
The	1
ten	1
fell	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
owe	1
forty-three	1
thousand,	1
Count,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
stretching	1
himself	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table.	1
"One	1
does	1
get	1
tired	1
sitting	1
so	1
long,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I'm	1
tired	1
too,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
cut	1
him	1
short,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
jest.	1
	1
"When	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
money,	1
Count?"	1
	1
Rostov,	1
flushing,	1
drew	1
Dolokhov	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
pay	1
it	1
all	1
immediately.	1
Will	1
you	1
take	1
an	1
I.O.U.?"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Rostov,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
clearly,	1
smiling	1
and	1
looking	1
Nicholas	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
eyes,	1
"you	1
know	1
the	1
saying,	1
'Lucky	1
in	1
love,	1
unlucky	1
at	1
cards.'	1
Your	1
cousin	1
is	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
know."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
terrible	1
to	1
feel	1
oneself	1
so	1
in	1
this	1
man's	1
power,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
He	1
knew	1
what	1
a	1
shock	1
he	1
would	1
inflict	1
on	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
by	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
this	1
loss,	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
a	1
relief	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
escape	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
this	1
shame	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
but	1
wanted	1
now	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
cat	1
does	1
with	1
a	1
mouse.	1
	1
"Your	1
cousin..."	1
Dolokhov	1
started	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"My	1
cousin	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
and	1
it's	1
not	1
necessary	1
to	1
mention	1
her!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
fiercely.	1
	1
"Then	1
when	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
have	1
it?"	1
	1
"Tomorrow,"	1
replied	1
Rostov	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
To	1
say	1
"tomorrow"	1
and	1
keep	1
up	1
a	1
dignified	1
tone	1
was	1
not	1
difficult,	1
but	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
alone,	1
see	1
his	1
sisters,	1
brother,	1
mother,	1
and	1
father,	1
confess	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
after	1
giving	1
his	1
word	1
of	1
honor,	1
was	1
terrible.	1
	1
At	1
home,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
gone	1
to	1
bed.	1
The	1
young	1
people,	1
after	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
theater,	1
had	1
had	1
supper	1
and	1
were	1
grouped	1
round	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
entered,	1
he	1
was	1
enfolded	1
in	1
that	1
poetic	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
pervaded	1
the	1
Rostov	1
household	1
that	1
winter	1
and,	1
now	1
after	1
Dolokhov's	1
proposal	1
and	1
Iogel's	1
ball,	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
thicker	1
round	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
as	1
the	1
air	1
does	1
before	1
a	1
thunderstorm.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
in	1
the	1
light-blue	1
dresses	1
they	1
had	1
worn	1
at	1
the	1
theater,	1
looking	1
pretty	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
it,	1
were	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
happy	1
and	1
smiling.	1
Vera	1
was	1
playing	1
chess	1
with	1
Shinshin	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
old	1
countess,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
son,	1
sat	1
playing	1
patience	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
gentlewoman	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
Denisov,	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
and	1
ruffled	1
hair,	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
clavichord	1
striking	1
chords	1
with	1
his	1
short	1
fingers,	1
his	1
legs	1
thrown	1
back	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
rolling	1
as	1
he	1
sang,	1
with	1
his	1
small,	1
husky,	1
but	1
true	1
voice,	1
some	1
verses	1
called	1
"Enchantress,"	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
composed,	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
fit	1
music:	1
	1
	1
Enchantress,	1
say,	1
to	1
my	1
forsaken	1
lyre	1
What	1
magic	1
power	1
is	1
this	1
recalls	1
me	1
still?	1
What	1
spark	1
has	1
set	1
my	1
inmost	1
soul	1
on	1
fire,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
bliss	1
that	1
makes	1
my	1
fingers	1
thrill?	1
	1
He	1
was	1
singing	1
in	1
passionate	1
tones,	1
gazing	1
with	1
his	1
sparkling	1
black-	1
agate	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
frightened	1
and	1
happy	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Splendid!	1
Excellent!"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha.	1
"Another	1
verse,"	1
she	1
said,	1
without	1
noticing	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Everything's	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
them,"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
glancing	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
he	1
saw	1
Vera	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
lady.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
and	1
here's	1
Nicholas!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Is	1
Papa	1
at	1
home?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
you've	1
come!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
without	1
answering	1
him.	1
"We	1
are	1
enjoying	1
ourselves!	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
is	1
staying	1
a	1
day	1
longer	1
for	1
my	1
sake!	1
Did	1
you	1
know?"	1
	1
"No,	1
Papa	1
is	1
not	1
back	1
yet,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
have	1
you	1
come?	1
Come	1
here,	1
dear!"	1
called	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
to	1
her,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
silently	1
at	1
her	1
table	1
began	1
to	1
watch	1
her	1
hands	1
arranging	1
the	1
cards.	1
From	1
the	1
dancing	1
room,	1
they	1
still	1
heard	1
the	1
laughter	1
and	1
merry	1
voices	1
trying	1
to	1
persuade	1
Natasha	1
to	1
sing.	1
	1
"All	1
wight!	1
All	1
wight!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov.	1
"It's	1
no	1
good	1
making	1
excuses	1
now!	1
It's	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
sing	1
the	1
ba'cawolla--I	1
entweat	1
you!"	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
silent	1
son.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
nothing,"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
if	1
weary	1
of	1
being	1
continually	1
asked	1
the	1
same	1
question.	1
"Will	1
Papa	1
be	1
back	1
soon?"	1
	1
"I	1
expect	1
so."	1
	1
"Everything's	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
them.	1
They	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it!	1
Where	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
go?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
went	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
dancing	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
clavichord	1
stood.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
playing	1
the	1
prelude	1
to	1
Denisov's	1
favorite	1
barcarolle.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
sing.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
enraptured	1
eyes.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
began	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
sing?	1
How	1
can	1
she	1
sing?	1
There's	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
about!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
Sonya	1
struck	1
the	1
first	1
chord	1
of	1
the	1
prelude.	1
	1
"My	1
God,	1
I'm	1
a	1
ruined	1
and	1
dishonored	1
man!	1
A	1
bullet	1
through	1
my	1
brain	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
left	1
me--not	1
singing!"	1
his	1
thoughts	1
ran	1
on.	1
"Go	1
away?	1
But	1
where	1
to?	1
It's	1
one--let	1
them	1
sing!"	1
	1
He	1
continued	1
to	1
pace	1
the	1
room,	1
looking	1
gloomily	1
at	1
Denisov	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
and	1
avoiding	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Nikolenka,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
Sonya's	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
seemed	1
to	1
ask.	1
She	1
noticed	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
too,	1
with	1
her	1
quick	1
instinct,	1
had	1
instantly	1
noticed	1
her	1
brother's	1
condition.	1
But,	1
though	1
she	1
noticed	1
it,	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
in	1
such	1
high	1
spirits	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
sorrow,	1
sadness,	1
or	1
self-reproach,	1
that	1
she	1
purposely	1
deceived	1
herself	1
as	1
young	1
people	1
often	1
do.	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
happy	1
now	1
to	1
spoil	1
my	1
enjoyment	1
by	1
sympathy	1
with	1
anyone's	1
sorrow,"	1
she	1
felt,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself:	1
"No,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
mistaken,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
feeling	1
happy,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
am."	1
	1
"Now,	1
Sonya!"	1
she	1
said,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
where	1
she	1
considered	1
the	1
resonance	1
was	1
best.	1
	1
Having	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
arms	1
droop	1
lifelessly,	1
as	1
ballet	1
dancers	1
do,	1
Natasha,	1
rising	1
energetically	1
from	1
her	1
heels	1
to	1
her	1
toes,	1
stepped	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
me!"	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
answering	1
the	1
rapt	1
gaze	1
with	1
which	1
Denisov	1
followed	1
her.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
so	1
pleased	1
about?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
sister.	1
"Why	1
isn't	1
she	1
dull	1
and	1
ashamed?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
took	1
the	1
first	1
note,	1
her	1
throat	1
swelled,	1
her	1
chest	1
rose,	1
her	1
eyes	1
became	1
serious.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
oblivious	1
of	1
her	1
surroundings,	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
smiling	1
lips	1
flowed	1
sounds	1
which	1
anyone	1
may	1
produce	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
intervals	1
and	1
hold	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
but	1
which	1
leave	1
you	1
cold	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
thousand	1
and	1
first	1
time	1
thrill	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
weep.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
that	1
winter,	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
begun	1
to	1
sing	1
seriously,	1
mainly	1
because	1
Denisov	1
so	1
delighted	1
in	1
her	1
singing.	1
She	1
no	1
longer	1
sang	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
her	1
singing	1
that	1
comical,	1
childish,	1
painstaking	1
effect	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
it	1
before;	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
sing	1
well,	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
connoisseurs	1
who	1
heard	1
her	1
said:	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
trained,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
beautiful	1
voice	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
trained."	1
Only	1
they	1
generally	1
said	1
this	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
singing.	1
While	1
that	1
untrained	1
voice,	1
with	1
its	1
incorrect	1
breathing	1
and	1
labored	1
transitions,	1
was	1
sounding,	1
even	1
the	1
connoisseurs	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
only	1
delighted	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
again.	1
In	1
her	1
voice	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
virginal	1
freshness,	1
an	1
unconsciousness	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
powers,	1
and	1
an	1
as	1
yet	1
untrained	1
velvety	1
softness,	1
which	1
so	1
mingled	1
with	1
her	1
lack	1
of	1
art	1
in	1
singing	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
in	1
that	1
voice	1
could	1
be	1
altered	1
without	1
spoiling	1
it.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
this?"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
widely	1
opened	1
eyes.	1
"What	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
her?	1
How	1
she	1
is	1
singing	1
today!"	1
And	1
suddenly	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
centered	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
note,	1
the	1
next	1
phrase,	1
and	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
three	1
beats:	1
"Oh	1
mio	1
crudele	1
affetto."...	1
One,	1
two,	1
three...	1
one,	1
two,	1
three...	1
One...	1
"Oh	1
mio	1
crudele	1
affetto."...	1
One,	1
two,	1
three...	1
One.	1
"Oh,	1
this	1
senseless	1
life	1
of	1
ours!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas.	1
"All	1
this	1
misery,	1
and	1
money,	1
and	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
anger,	1
and	1
honor--it's	1
all	1
nonsense...	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
real....	1
Now	1
then,	1
Natasha,	1
now	1
then,	1
dearest!	1
Now	1
then,	1
darling!	1
How	1
will	1
she	1
take	1
that	1
si?	1
She's	1
taken	1
it!	1
Thank	1
God!"	1
And	1
without	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
singing,	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
si	1
he	1
sung	1
a	1
second,	1
a	1
third	1
below	1
the	1
high	1
note.	1
"Ah,	1
God!	1
How	1
fine!	1
Did	1
I	1
really	1
take	1
it?	1
How	1
fortunate!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
Oh,	1
how	1
that	1
chord	1
vibrated,	1
and	1
how	1
moved	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
finest	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
soul!	1
And	1
this	1
something	1
was	1
apart	1
from	1
everything	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
above	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
"What	1
were	1
losses,	1
and	1
Dolokhov,	1
and	1
words	1
of	1
honor?...	1
All	1
nonsense!	1
One	1
might	1
kill	1
and	1
rob	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
happy..."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
Rostov	1
had	1
felt	1
such	1
enjoyment	1
from	1
music	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
day.	1
But	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
Natasha	1
finished	1
her	1
barcarolle	1
than	1
reality	1
again	1
presented	1
itself.	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
went	1
downstairs	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room.	1
A	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
his	1
club,	1
cheerful	1
and	1
contented.	1
Nicholas,	1
hearing	1
him	1
drive	1
up,	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
	1
"Well--had	1
a	1
good	1
time?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
smiling	1
gaily	1
and	1
proudly	1
at	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
"Yes,"	1
but	1
could	1
not:	1
and	1
he	1
nearly	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
lighting	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
his	1
son's	1
condition.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
avoided!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
last	1
time.	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
casual	1
tone,	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
of	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
merely	1
asking	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
town:	1
	1
"Papa,	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
business.	1
I	1
was	1
nearly	1
forgetting.	1
I	1
need	1
some	1
money."	1
	1
"Dear	1
me!"	1
said	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
good	1
humor.	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
enough.	1
How	1
much?"	1
	1
"Very	1
much,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
flushing,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stupid	1
careless	1
smile,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
long	1
unable	1
to	1
forgive	1
himself,	1
"I	1
have	1
lost	1
a	1
little,	1
I	1
mean	1
a	1
good	1
deal,	1
a	1
great	1
deal--forty	1
three	1
thousand."	1
	1
"What!	1
To	1
whom?...	1
Nonsense!"	1
cried	1
the	1
count,	1
suddenly	1
reddening	1
with	1
an	1
apoplectic	1
flush	1
over	1
neck	1
and	1
nape	1
as	1
old	1
people	1
do.	1
	1
"I	1
promised	1
to	1
pay	1
tomorrow,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Well!..."	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
sinking	1
helplessly	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped	1
It	1
happens	1
to	1
everyone!"	1
said	1
the	1
son,	1
with	1
a	1
bold,	1
free,	1
and	1
easy	1
tone,	1
while	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
regarded	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
worthless	1
scoundrel	1
whose	1
whole	1
life	1
could	1
not	1
atone	1
for	1
his	1
crime.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
kiss	1
his	1
father's	1
hands	1
and	1
kneel	1
to	1
beg	1
his	1
forgiveness,	1
but	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
careless	1
and	1
even	1
rude	1
voice,	1
that	1
it	1
happens	1
to	1
everyone!	1
	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
cast	1
down	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
hearing	1
his	1
son's	1
words	1
and	1
began	1
bustlingly	1
searching	1
for	1
something.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
"it	1
will	1
be	1
difficult,	1
I	1
fear,	1
difficult	1
to	1
raise...	1
happens	1
to	1
everybody!	1
Yes,	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
done	1
it?"	1
	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
furtive	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
son's	1
face,	1
the	1
count	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room....	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
resistance,	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
expected	1
this.	1
	1
"Papa!	1
Pa-pa!"	1
he	1
called	1
after	1
him,	1
sobbing,	1
"forgive	1
me!"	1
And	1
seizing	1
his	1
father's	1
hand,	1
he	1
pressed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
While	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
were	1
having	1
their	1
explanation,	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter	1
were	1
having	1
one	1
not	1
less	1
important.	1
Natasha	1
came	1
running	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
quite	1
excited.	1
	1
"Mamma!...	1
Mamma!...	1
He	1
has	1
made	1
me..."	1
	1
"Made	1
what?"	1
	1
"Made,	1
made	1
me	1
an	1
offer,	1
Mamma!	1
Mamma!"	1
she	1
exclaimed.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
her	1
ears.	1
Denisov	1
had	1
proposed.	1
To	1
whom?	1
To	1
this	1
chit	1
of	1
a	1
girl,	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
not	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
was	1
playing	1
with	1
dolls	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
having	1
lessons.	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Natasha!	1
What	1
nonsense!"	1
she	1
said,	1
hoping	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
joke.	1
	1
"Nonsense,	1
indeed!	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
you	1
the	1
fact,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
indignantly.	1
"I	1
come	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
you	1
call	1
it	1
'nonsense!'"	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
shrugged	1
her	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
Monsieur	1
Denisov	1
has	1
made	1
you	1
a	1
proposal,	1
tell	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
fool,	1
that's	1
all!"	1
	1
"No,	1
he's	1
not	1
a	1
fool!"	1
replied	1
Natasha	1
indignantly	1
and	1
seriously.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want?	1
You're	1
all	1
in	1
love	1
nowadays.	1
Well,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
love,	1
marry	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
of	1
annoyance.	1
"Good	1
luck	1
to	1
you!"	1
	1
"No,	1
Mamma,	1
I'm	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him,	1
I	1
suppose	1
I'm	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
tell	1
him	1
so."	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
are	1
you	1
cross?	1
Don't	1
be	1
cross,	1
dear!	1
Is	1
it	1
my	1
fault?"	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
it,	1
my	1
dear?	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
him?"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
smiling.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
myself,	1
only	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
It's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
a	1
responsive	1
smile.	1
"You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
he	1
said	1
it!	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
came	1
out	1
accidently."	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
you	1
must	1
refuse	1
him."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
mustn't.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
him!	1
He's	1
so	1
nice."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
accept	1
his	1
offer.	1
It's	1
high	1
time	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
married,"	1
answered	1
the	1
countess	1
sharply	1
and	1
sarcastically.	1
	1
"No,	1
Mamma,	1
but	1
I'm	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
him.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
I'm	1
to	1
say	1
it."	1
	1
"And	1
there's	1
nothing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
say.	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
myself,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
indignant	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
treat	1
this	1
little	1
Natasha	1
as	1
grown	1
up.	1
	1
"No,	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account!	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
him	1
myself,	1
and	1
you'll	1
listen	1
at	1
the	1
door,"	1
and	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
the	1
dancing	1
hall,	1
where	1
Denisov	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
chair	1
by	1
the	1
clavichord	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
He	1
jumped	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
light	1
step.	1
	1
"Nataly,"	1
he	1
said,	1
moving	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
toward	1
her,	1
"decide	1
my	1
fate.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
hands."	1
	1
"Vasili	1
Dmitrich,	1
I'm	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
you!...	1
No,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
nice...	1
but	1
it	1
won't	1
do...not	1
that...	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
friend,	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
love	1
you."	1
	1
Denisov	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
she	1
heard	1
strange	1
sounds	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
She	1
kissed	1
his	1
rough	1
curly	1
black	1
head.	1
At	1
this	1
instant,	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
quick	1
rustle	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
dress.	1
She	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
"Vasili	1
Dmitrich,	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
honor,"	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
an	1
embarrassed	1
voice,	1
though	1
it	1
sounded	1
severe	1
to	1
Denisov--"but	1
my	1
daughter	1
is	1
so	1
young,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
that,	1
as	1
my	1
son's	1
friend,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
addressed	1
yourself	1
first	1
to	1
me.	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
obliged	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
this	1
refusal."	1
	1
"Countess..."	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
guilty	1
face.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
more,	1
but	1
faltered.	1
	1
Natasha	1
could	1
not	1
remain	1
calm,	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
plight.	1
She	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
aloud.	1
	1
"Countess,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
w'ong,"	1
Denisov	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
an	1
unsteady	1
voice,	1
"but	1
believe	1
me,	1
I	1
so	1
adore	1
your	1
daughter	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
family	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
twice	1
over..."	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
seeing	1
her	1
severe	1
face	1
said:	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
Countess,"	1
and	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
quick	1
resolute	1
strides,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
Denisov	1
off.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
stay	1
another	1
day	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
All	1
Denisov's	1
Moscow	1
friends	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
farewell	1
entertainment	1
at	1
the	1
gypsies',	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
recollection	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
sleigh	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
three	1
stages	1
of	1
his	1
journey.	1
	1
After	1
Denisov's	1
departure,	1
Rostov	1
spent	1
another	1
fortnight	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
without	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
money	1
his	1
father	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
raise,	1
and	1
he	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
girls'	1
room.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
more	1
tender	1
and	1
devoted	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
ever.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
losses	1
were	1
an	1
achievement	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
love	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
now	1
considered	1
himself	1
unworthy	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
He	1
filled	1
the	1
girls'	1
albums	1
with	1
verses	1
and	1
music,	1
and	1
having	1
at	1
last	1
sent	1
Dolokhov	1
the	1
whole	1
forty-three	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
and	1
received	1
his	1
receipt,	1
he	1
left	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
November,	1
without	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintances,	1
to	1
overtake	1
his	1
regiment	1
which	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
Poland.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
After	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Pierre	1
left	1
for	1
Petersburg.	1
At	1
the	1
Torzhok	1
post	1
station,	1
either	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
horses	1
or	1
the	1
postmaster	1
would	1
not	1
supply	1
them.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
wait.	1
Without	1
undressing,	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
leather	1
sofa	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
round	1
table,	1
put	1
his	1
big	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
overboots	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
reflect.	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
portmanteaus	1
brought	1
in?	1
And	1
a	1
bed	1
got	1
ready,	1
and	1
tea?"	1
asked	1
his	1
valet.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
no	1
answer,	1
for	1
he	1
neither	1
heard	1
nor	1
saw	1
anything.	1
He	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
station	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
pondering	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
question--one	1
so	1
important	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
around	1
him.	1
Not	1
only	1
was	1
he	1
indifferent	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
earlier	1
or	1
later,	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
secured	1
accommodation	1
at	1
this	1
station,	1
but	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
now	1
occupied	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference	1
whether	1
he	1
remained	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
The	1
postmaster,	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
valet,	1
and	1
a	1
peasant	1
woman	1
selling	1
Torzhok	1
embroidery	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
offering	1
their	1
services.	1
Without	1
changing	1
his	1
careless	1
attitude,	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
or	1
how	1
they	1
could	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
without	1
having	1
solved	1
the	1
problems	1
that	1
so	1
absorbed	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
engrossed	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
thoughts	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
Sokolniki	1
after	1
the	1
duel	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
that	1
first	1
agonizing,	1
sleepless	1
night.	1
But	1
now,	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
journey,	1
they	1
seized	1
him	1
with	1
special	1
force.	1
No	1
matter	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
about,	1
he	1
always	1
returned	1
to	1
these	1
same	1
questions	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
solve	1
and	1
yet	1
could	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
ask	1
himself.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
screw	1
which	1
held	1
his	1
life	1
together	1
were	1
stripped,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
screw	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
in	1
or	1
out,	1
but	1
went	1
on	1
turning	1
uselessly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
	1
The	1
postmaster	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
began	1
obsequiously	1
to	1
beg	1
his	1
excellency	1
to	1
wait	1
only	1
two	1
hours,	1
when,	1
come	1
what	1
might,	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
his	1
excellency	1
have	1
the	1
courier	1
horses.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
and	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
more	1
money	1
from	1
the	1
traveler.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
good	1
or	1
bad?"	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
me,	1
bad	1
for	1
another	1
traveler,	1
and	1
for	1
himself	1
it's	1
unavoidable,	1
because	1
he	1
needs	1
money	1
for	1
food;	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
an	1
officer	1
had	1
once	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
thrashing	1
for	1
letting	1
a	1
private	1
traveler	1
have	1
the	1
courier	1
horses.	1
But	1
the	1
officer	1
thrashed	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
And	1
I,"	1
continued	1
Pierre,	1
"shot	1
Dolokhov	1
because	1
I	1
considered	1
myself	1
injured,	1
and	1
Louis	1
XVI	1
was	1
executed	1
because	1
they	1
considered	1
him	1
a	1
criminal,	1
and	1
a	1
year	1
later	1
they	1
executed	1
those	1
who	1
executed	1
him--also	1
for	1
some	1
reason.	1
What	1
is	1
bad?	1
What	1
is	1
good?	1
What	1
should	1
one	1
love	1
and	1
what	1
hate?	1
What	1
does	1
one	1
live	1
for?	1
And	1
what	1
am	1
I?	1
What	1
is	1
life,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
death?	1
What	1
power	1
governs	1
all?"	1
	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
answer	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
questions,	1
except	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
logical	1
answer	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
them.	1
The	1
answer	1
was:	1
"You'll	1
die	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
end.	1
You'll	1
die	1
and	1
know	1
all,	1
or	1
cease	1
asking."	1
But	1
dying	1
was	1
also	1
dreadful.	1
	1
The	1
Torzhok	1
peddler	1
woman,	1
in	1
a	1
whining	1
voice,	1
went	1
on	1
offering	1
her	1
wares,	1
especially	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
goatskin	1
slippers.	1
"I	1
have	1
hundreds	1
of	1
rubles	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with,	1
and	1
she	1
stands	1
in	1
her	1
tattered	1
cloak	1
looking	1
timidly	1
at	1
me,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"And	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
want	1
the	1
money	1
for?	1
As	1
if	1
that	1
money	1
could	1
add	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth	1
to	1
happiness	1
or	1
peace	1
of	1
mind.	1
Can	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
make	1
her	1
or	1
me	1
less	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
evil	1
and	1
death?--death	1
which	1
ends	1
all	1
and	1
must	1
come	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow--	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
compared	1
with	1
eternity."	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
twisted	1
the	1
screw	1
with	1
the	1
stripped	1
thread,	1
and	1
again	1
it	1
turned	1
uselessly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
	1
His	1
servant	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
half-cut	1
novel,	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
letters,	1
by	1
Madame	1
de	1
Souza.	1
He	1
began	1
reading	1
about	1
the	1
sufferings	1
and	1
virtuous	1
struggles	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
Emilie	1
de	1
Mansfeld.	1
"And	1
why	1
did	1
she	1
resist	1
her	1
seducer	1
when	1
she	1
loved	1
him?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"God	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
put	1
into	1
her	1
heart	1
an	1
impulse	1
that	1
was	1
against	1
His	1
will.	1
My	1
wife--as	1
she	1
once	1
was--did	1
not	1
struggle,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
she	1
was	1
right.	1
Nothing	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
out,	1
nothing	1
discovered,"	1
Pierre	1
again	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"All	1
we	1
can	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
nothing.	1
And	1
that's	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
human	1
wisdom."	1
	1
Everything	1
within	1
and	1
around	1
him	1
seemed	1
confused,	1
senseless,	1
and	1
repellent.	1
Yet	1
in	1
this	1
very	1
repugnance	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
circumstances	1
Pierre	1
found	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
tantalizing	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
"I	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
ask	1
your	1
excellency	1
to	1
move	1
a	1
little	1
for	1
this	1
gentleman,"	1
said	1
the	1
postmaster,	1
entering	1
the	1
room	1
followed	1
by	1
another	1
traveler,	1
also	1
detained	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
horses.	1
	1
The	1
newcomer	1
was	1
a	1
short,	1
large-boned,	1
yellow-faced,	1
wrinkled	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
gray	1
bushy	1
eyebrows	1
overhanging	1
bright	1
eyes	1
of	1
an	1
indefinite	1
grayish	1
color.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
his	1
feet	1
off	1
the	1
table,	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
got	1
ready	1
for	1
him,	1
glancing	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
newcomer,	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
and	1
tired	1
face,	1
was	1
wearily	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
wraps	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
With	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
felt	1
boots	1
on	1
his	1
thin	1
bony	1
legs,	1
and	1
keeping	1
on	1
a	1
worn,	1
nankeen-covered,	1
sheepskin	1
coat,	1
the	1
traveler	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
leaned	1
back	1
his	1
big	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
broad	1
temples	1
and	1
close-cropped	1
hair,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Bezukhov.	1
The	1
stern,	1
shrewd,	1
and	1
penetrating	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
look	1
struck	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
stranger,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
a	1
question	1
about	1
the	1
roads,	1
the	1
traveler	1
had	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
His	1
shriveled	1
old	1
hands	1
were	1
folded	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
a	1
large	1
cast	1
iron	1
ring	1
with	1
a	1
seal	1
representing	1
a	1
death's	1
head.	1
The	1
stranger	1
sat	1
without	1
stirring,	1
either	1
resting	1
or,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
sunk	1
in	1
profound	1
and	1
calm	1
meditation.	1
His	1
servant	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
yellow,	1
wrinkled	1
old	1
man,	1
without	1
beard	1
or	1
mustache,	1
evidently	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
shaven	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
grown.	1
This	1
active	1
old	1
servant	1
was	1
unpacking	1
the	1
traveler's	1
canteen	1
and	1
preparing	1
tea.	1
He	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
boiling	1
samovar.	1
When	1
everything	1
was	1
ready,	1
the	1
stranger	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
filled	1
a	1
tumbler	1
with	1
tea	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
beardless	1
old	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
passed	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
uneasiness,	1
and	1
the	1
need,	1
even	1
the	1
inevitability,	1
of	1
entering	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
this	1
stranger.	1
	1
The	1
servant	1
brought	1
back	1
his	1
tumbler	1
turned	1
upside	1
down,	1
*	1
with	1
an	1
unfinished	1
bit	1
of	1
nibbled	1
sugar,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
anything	1
more	1
would	1
be	1
wanted.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
indicate	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
more	1
tea.	1
	1
"No.	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
book,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger.	1
	1
The	1
servant	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
book	1
which	1
Pierre	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
devotional	1
work,	1
and	1
the	1
traveler	1
became	1
absorbed	1
in	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
stranger	1
closed	1
the	1
book,	1
putting	1
in	1
a	1
marker,	1
and	1
again,	1
leaning	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
sofa,	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
former	1
position	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes,	1
fixed	1
his	1
steady	1
and	1
severe	1
gaze	1
straight	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
face.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
confused	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
that	1
look,	1
but	1
the	1
bright	1
old	1
eyes	1
attracted	1
him	1
irresistibly.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
addressing	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
deliberate	1
and	1
loud	1
voice.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
silently	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
continued	1
the	1
stranger,	1
"and	1
of	1
your	1
misfortune."	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
emphasize	1
the	1
last	1
word,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say--"Yes,	1
misfortune!	1
Call	1
it	1
what	1
you	1
please,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
Moscow	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune."--"I	1
regret	1
it	1
very	1
much,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir."	1
	1
Pierre	1
flushed	1
and,	1
hurriedly	1
putting	1
his	1
legs	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
bed,	1
bent	1
forward	1
toward	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
and	1
timid	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
referred	1
to	1
this	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
but	1
for	1
greater	1
reasons."	1
	1
He	1
paused,	1
his	1
gaze	1
still	1
on	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
moved	1
aside	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
inviting	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
reluctant	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
this	1
old	1
man,	1
but,	1
submitting	1
to	1
him	1
involuntarily,	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
unhappy,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
the	1
stranger	1
continued.	1
"You	1
are	1
young	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
old.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
help	1
you	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
lies	1
in	1
my	1
power."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you.	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
traveling	1
from?"	1
	1
The	1
stranger's	1
face	1
was	1
not	1
genial,	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
cold	1
and	1
severe,	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this,	1
both	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
were	1
irresistibly	1
attractive	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
for	1
reason	1
you	1
don't	1
feel	1
inclined	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
"say	1
so,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir."	1
And	1
he	1
suddenly	1
smiled,	1
in	1
an	1
unexpected	1
and	1
tenderly	1
paternal	1
way.	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
not	1
at	1
all!	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
And	1
again,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
stranger's	1
hands,	1
he	1
looked	1
more	1
closely	1
at	1
the	1
ring,	1
with	1
its	1
skull--a	1
masonic	1
sign.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
ask,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"are	1
you	1
a	1
Mason?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
of	1
the	1
Freemasons,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger,	1
looking	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
"And	1
in	1
their	1
name	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
I	1
hold	1
out	1
a	1
brotherly	1
hand	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
smiling,	1
and	1
wavering	1
between	1
the	1
confidence	1
the	1
personality	1
of	1
the	1
Freemason	1
inspired	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
habit	1
of	1
ridiculing	1
the	1
masonic	1
beliefs--"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
understanding--how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
put	1
it?--I	1
am	1
afraid	1
my	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
so	1
opposed	1
to	1
yours	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
understand	1
one	1
another."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
your	1
outlook,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason,	1
"and	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
life	1
you	1
mention,	1
and	1
which	1
you	1
think	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
mental	1
efforts,	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
people,	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
invariable	1
fruit	1
of	1
pride,	1
indolence,	1
and	1
ignorance.	1
Forgive	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
it	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
addressed	1
you.	1
Your	1
view	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
regrettable	1
delusion."	1
	1
"Just	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
suppose	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
deluded,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
never	1
dare	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
truth,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason,	1
whose	1
words	1
struck	1
Pierre	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
their	1
precision	1
and	1
firmness.	1
"No	1
one	1
can	1
attain	1
to	1
truth	1
by	1
himself.	1
Only	1
by	1
laying	1
stone	1
on	1
stone	1
with	1
the	1
cooperation	1
of	1
all,	1
by	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
generations	1
from	1
our	1
forefather	1
Adam	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
times,	1
is	1
that	1
temple	1
reared	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
worthy	1
dwelling	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
God,"	1
he	1
added,	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe...	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
God,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
regretfully	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
effort,	1
feeling	1
it	1
essential	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
smiled	1
as	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
with	1
millions	1
in	1
hand	1
might	1
smile	1
at	1
a	1
poor	1
fellow	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he,	1
poor	1
man,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
five	1
rubles	1
that	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
happy.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
Him,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason.	1
"You	1
cannot	1
know	1
Him.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
Him	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
you	1
are	1
unhappy."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
am	1
unhappy,"	1
assented	1
Pierre.	1
"But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?"	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
Him	1
not,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
unhappy.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
Him,	1
but	1
He	1
is	1
here,	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
words,	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
those	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
thou	1
hast	1
just	1
uttered!"	1
pronounced	1
the	1
Mason	1
in	1
a	1
stern	1
and	1
tremulous	1
voice.	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
and	1
sighed,	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
calm	1
himself.	1
	1
"If	1
He	1
were	1
not,"	1
he	1
said	1
quietly,	1
"you	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
speaking	1
of	1
Him,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
Of	1
what,	1
of	1
whom,	1
are	1
we	1
speaking?	1
Whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
denied?"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
asked	1
with	1
exulting	1
austerity	1
and	1
authority	1
in	1
his	1
voice.	1
"Who	1
invented	1
Him,	1
if	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
exist?	1
Whence	1
came	1
thy	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
Being?	1
didst	1
thou,	1
and	1
why	1
did	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
conceive	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
Being,	1
a	1
Being	1
all-powerful,	1
eternal,	1
and	1
infinite	1
in	1
all	1
His	1
attributes?..."	1
	1
He	1
stopped	1
and	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
break	1
this	1
silence.	1
	1
"He	1
exists,	1
but	1
to	1
understand	1
Him	1
is	1
hard,"	1
the	1
Mason	1
began	1
again,	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
Pierre	1
but	1
straight	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
turning	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
hands	1
which	1
from	1
excitement	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
still.	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
existence	1
thou	1
didst	1
doubt	1
I	1
could	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
thee,	1
could	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
show	1
him	1
to	1
thee.	1
But	1
how	1
can	1
I,	1
an	1
insignificant	1
mortal,	1
show	1
His	1
omnipotence,	1
His	1
infinity,	1
and	1
all	1
His	1
mercy	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
blind,	1
or	1
who	1
shuts	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
or	1
understand	1
Him	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
or	1
understand	1
his	1
own	1
vileness	1
and	1
sinfulness?"	1
He	1
paused	1
again.	1
"Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
Thou	1
dreamest	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
wise	1
because	1
thou	1
couldst	1
utter	1
those	1
blasphemous	1
words,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
with	1
a	1
somber	1
and	1
scornful	1
smile.	1
"And	1
thou	1
art	1
more	1
foolish	1
and	1
unreasonable	1
than	1
a	1
little	1
child,	1
who,	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
a	1
skillfully	1
made	1
watch,	1
dares	1
to	1
say	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
its	1
use,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
master	1
who	1
made	1
it.	1
To	1
know	1
Him	1
is	1
hard....	1
For	1
ages,	1
from	1
our	1
forefather	1
Adam	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
day,	1
we	1
labor	1
to	1
attain	1
that	1
knowledge	1
and	1
are	1
still	1
infinitely	1
far	1
from	1
our	1
aim;	1
but	1
in	1
our	1
lack	1
of	1
understanding	1
we	1
see	1
only	1
our	1
weakness	1
and	1
His	1
greatness...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
with	1
swelling	1
heart,	1
gazing	1
into	1
the	1
Mason's	1
face	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
not	1
interrupting	1
or	1
questioning	1
him,	1
but	1
believing	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
what	1
the	1
stranger	1
said.	1
Whether	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
wise	1
reasoning	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
Mason's	1
words,	1
or	1
believed	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
believes,	1
in	1
the	1
speaker's	1
tone	1
of	1
conviction	1
and	1
earnestness,	1
or	1
the	1
tremor	1
of	1
the	1
speaker's	1
voice--which	1
sometimes	1
almost	1
broke--or	1
those	1
brilliant	1
aged	1
eyes	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
this	1
conviction,	1
or	1
the	1
calm	1
firmness	1
and	1
certainty	1
of	1
his	1
vocation,	1
which	1
radiated	1
from	1
his	1
whole	1
being	1
(and	1
which	1
struck	1
Pierre	1
especially	1
by	1
contrast	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
dejection	1
and	1
hopelessness)--at	1
any	1
rate,	1
Pierre	1
longed	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
believe,	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
joyful	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort,	1
regeneration,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
life.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended	1
by	1
reason,	1
but	1
by	1
life,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason.	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
with	1
dismay	1
doubts	1
reawakening.	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
clearness,	1
any	1
weakness,	1
in	1
the	1
Mason's	1
arguments;	1
he	1
dreaded	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
him.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man	1
cannot	1
attain	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
speak."	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
smiled	1
with	1
his	1
gentle	1
fatherly	1
smile.	1
	1
"The	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
and	1
truth	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
purest	1
liquid	1
we	1
may	1
wish	1
to	1
imbibe,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Can	1
I	1
receive	1
that	1
pure	1
liquid	1
into	1
an	1
impure	1
vessel	1
and	1
judge	1
of	1
its	1
purity?	1
Only	1
by	1
the	1
inner	1
purification	1
of	1
myself	1
can	1
I	1
retain	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
purity	1
the	1
liquid	1
I	1
receive."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
that	1
is	1
so,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
joyfully.	1
	1
"The	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
is	1
not	1
founded	1
on	1
reason	1
alone,	1
not	1
on	1
those	1
worldly	1
sciences	1
of	1
physics,	1
history,	1
chemistry,	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
into	1
which	1
intellectual	1
knowledge	1
is	1
divided.	1
The	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
is	1
one.	1
The	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
has	1
but	1
one	1
science--the	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
whole--the	1
science	1
explaining	1
the	1
whole	1
creation	1
and	1
man's	1
place	1
in	1
it.	1
To	1
receive	1
that	1
science	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
purify	1
and	1
renew	1
one's	1
inner	1
self,	1
and	1
so	1
before	1
one	1
can	1
know,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
to	1
perfect	1
one's	1
self.	1
And	1
to	1
attain	1
this	1
end,	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
light	1
called	1
conscience	1
that	1
God	1
has	1
implanted	1
in	1
our	1
souls."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
assented	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Look	1
then	1
at	1
thy	1
inner	1
self	1
with	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
ask	1
thyself	1
whether	1
thou	1
art	1
content	1
with	1
thyself.	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
attained	1
relying	1
on	1
reason	1
only?	1
What	1
art	1
thou?	1
You	1
are	1
young,	1
you	1
are	1
rich,	1
you	1
are	1
clever,	1
you	1
are	1
well	1
educated.	1
And	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
good	1
gifts?	1
Are	1
you	1
content	1
with	1
yourself	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
life?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
hate	1
my	1
life,"	1
Pierre	1
muttered,	1
wincing.	1
	1
"Thou	1
hatest	1
it.	1
Then	1
change	1
it,	1
purify	1
thyself;	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
purified,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
gain	1
wisdom.	1
Look	1
at	1
your	1
life,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
How	1
have	1
you	1
spent	1
it?	1
In	1
riotous	1
orgies	1
and	1
debauchery,	1
receiving	1
everything	1
from	1
society	1
and	1
giving	1
nothing	1
in	1
return.	1
You	1
have	1
become	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
wealth.	1
How	1
have	1
you	1
used	1
it?	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
for	1
your	1
neighbor?	1
Have	1
you	1
ever	1
thought	1
of	1
your	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
slaves?	1
Have	1
you	1
helped	1
them	1
physically	1
and	1
morally?	1
No!	1
You	1
have	1
profited	1
by	1
their	1
toil	1
to	1
lead	1
a	1
profligate	1
life.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done.	1
Have	1
you	1
chosen	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
your	1
neighbor?	1
No!	1
You	1
have	1
spent	1
your	1
life	1
in	1
idleness.	1
Then	1
you	1
married,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir--took	1
on	1
yourself	1
responsibility	1
for	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
woman;	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done?	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
helped	1
her	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
truth,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
but	1
have	1
thrust	1
her	1
into	1
an	1
abyss	1
of	1
deceit	1
and	1
misery.	1
A	1
man	1
offended	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
shot	1
him,	1
and	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
God	1
and	1
hate	1
your	1
life.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
strange	1
in	1
that,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir!"	1
	1
After	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Mason,	1
as	1
if	1
tired	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
discourse,	1
again	1
leaned	1
his	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
that	1
aged,	1
stern,	1
motionless,	1
almost	1
lifeless	1
face	1
and	1
moved	1
his	1
lips	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
sound.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
say,	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
vile,	1
idle,	1
vicious	1
life!"	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
break	1
the	1
silence.	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
huskily,	1
as	1
old	1
men	1
do,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
"How	1
about	1
the	1
horses?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"The	1
exchange	1
horses	1
have	1
just	1
come,"	1
answered	1
the	1
servant.	1
"Will	1
you	1
not	1
rest	1
here?"	1
	1
"No,	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
harness."	1
	1
"Can	1
he	1
really	1
be	1
going	1
away	1
leaving	1
me	1
alone	1
without	1
having	1
told	1
me	1
all,	1
and	1
without	1
promising	1
to	1
help	1
me?"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
rising	1
with	1
downcast	1
head;	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
pace	1
the	1
room,	1
glancing	1
occasionally	1
at	1
the	1
Mason.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
led	1
a	1
contemptible	1
and	1
profligate	1
life,	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"But	1
this	1
man	1
knows	1
the	1
truth	1
and,	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to,	1
could	1
disclose	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
Mason,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to.	1
The	1
traveler,	1
having	1
packed	1
his	1
things	1
with	1
his	1
practiced	1
hands,	1
began	1
fastening	1
his	1
coat.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
indifferent	1
politeness:	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
now,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir?"	1
	1
"I?...	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg,"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
in	1
a	1
childlike,	1
hesitating	1
voice.	1
"I	1
thank	1
you.	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
said.	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
bad.	1
With	1
my	1
whole	1
soul	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
be,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
help	1
from	1
anyone....	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
I,	1
above	1
all,	1
who	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
everything.	1
Help	1
me,	1
teach	1
me,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
I	1
may..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on.	1
He	1
gulped	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
evidently	1
considering.	1
	1
"Help	1
comes	1
from	1
God	1
alone,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
such	1
measure	1
of	1
help	1
as	1
our	1
Order	1
can	1
bestow	1
it	1
will	1
render	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
Hand	1
this	1
to	1
Count	1
Willarski"	1
(he	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
notebook	1
and	1
wrote	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
folded	1
in	1
four).	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
advice.	1
When	1
you	1
reach	1
the	1
capital,	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
devote	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
solitude	1
and	1
self-examination	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
resume	1
your	1
former	1
way	1
of	1
life.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
journey,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
he	1
added,	1
seeing	1
that	1
his	1
servant	1
had	1
entered...	1
"and	1
success."	1
	1
The	1
traveler	1
was	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
Bazdeev,	1
as	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
from	1
the	1
postmaster's	1
book.	1
Bazdeev	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best-known	1
Freemasons	1
and	1
Martinists,	1
even	1
in	1
Novikov's	1
time.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
gone,	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
or	1
order	1
horses	1
but	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
pondering	1
over	1
his	1
vicious	1
past,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
sense	1
of	1
beginning	1
anew	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
blissful,	1
irreproachable,	1
virtuous	1
future	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
easy.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
vicious	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
somehow	1
forgotten	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
virtuous.	1
Not	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
doubts	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
firmly	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
of	1
men	1
united	1
in	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
supporting	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
virtue,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
Freemasonry	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
Petersburg	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
anyone	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
arrival,	1
he	1
went	1
nowhere	1
and	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
in	1
reading	1
Thomas	1
a	1
Kempis,	1
whose	1
book	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
him	1
by	1
someone	1
unknown.	1
One	1
thing	1
he	1
continually	1
realized	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
that	1
book:	1
the	1
joy,	1
hitherto	1
unknown	1
to	1
him,	1
of	1
believing	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
attaining	1
perfection,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
active	1
brotherly	1
love	1
among	1
men,	1
which	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
had	1
revealed	1
to	1
him.	1
A	1
week	1
after	1
his	1
arrival,	1
the	1
young	1
Polish	1
count,	1
Willarski,	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
had	1
known	1
slightly	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society,	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
one	1
evening	1
in	1
the	1
official	1
and	1
ceremonious	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
Dolokhov's	1
second	1
had	1
called	1
on	1
him,	1
and,	1
having	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
addressed	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
and	1
an	1
offer,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
said	1
without	1
sitting	1
down.	1
"A	1
person	1
of	1
very	1
high	1
standing	1
in	1
our	1
Brotherhood	1
has	1
made	1
application	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
into	1
our	1
Order	1
before	1
the	1
usual	1
term	1
and	1
has	1
proposed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
sponsor.	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
a	1
sacred	1
duty	1
to	1
fulfill	1
that	1
person's	1
wishes.	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
of	1
Freemasons	1
under	1
my	1
sponsorship?"	1
	1
The	1
cold,	1
austere	1
tone	1
of	1
this	1
man,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
almost	1
always	1
before	1
met	1
at	1
balls,	1
amiably	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
brilliant	1
women,	1
surprised	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
do	1
wish	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Willarski	1
bowed	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"One	1
more	1
question,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"which	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
answer	1
in	1
all	1
sincerity--not	1
as	1
a	1
future	1
Mason	1
but	1
as	1
an	1
honest	1
man:	1
have	1
you	1
renounced	1
your	1
former	1
convictions--do	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
God?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
considered.	1
	1
"Yes...	1
yes,	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
God,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case..."	1
began	1
Willarski,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
God,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
we	1
can	1
go,"	1
said	1
Willarski.	1
"My	1
carriage	1
is	1
at	1
your	1
service."	1
	1
Willarski	1
was	1
silent	1
throughout	1
the	1
drive.	1
To	1
Pierre's	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
should	1
answer,	1
Willarski	1
only	1
replied	1
that	1
brothers	1
more	1
worthy	1
than	1
he	1
would	1
test	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
Having	1
entered	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
house	1
where	1
the	1
Lodge	1
had	1
its	1
headquarters,	1
and	1
having	1
ascended	1
a	1
dark	1
staircase,	1
they	1
entered	1
a	1
small	1
well-lit	1
anteroom	1
where	1
they	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
cloaks	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
servant.	1
From	1
there	1
they	1
passed	1
into	1
another	1
room.	1
A	1
man	1
in	1
strange	1
attire	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Willarski,	1
stepping	1
toward	1
him,	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
French	1
in	1
an	1
undertone	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
wardrobe	1
in	1
which	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
garments	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before.	1
Having	1
taken	1
a	1
kerchief	1
from	1
the	1
cupboard,	1
Willarski	1
bound	1
Pierre's	1
eyes	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
tied	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
knot	1
behind,	1
catching	1
some	1
hairs	1
painfully	1
in	1
the	1
knot.	1
Then	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
face	1
down,	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
led	1
him	1
forward.	1
The	1
hairs	1
tied	1
in	1
the	1
knot	1
hurt	1
Pierre	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
lines	1
of	1
pain	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
shamefaced	1
smile.	1
His	1
huge	1
figure,	1
with	1
arms	1
hanging	1
down	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
puckered,	1
though	1
smiling	1
face,	1
moved	1
after	1
Willarski	1
with	1
uncertain,	1
timid	1
steps.	1
	1
Having	1
led	1
him	1
about	1
ten	1
paces,	1
Willarski	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Whatever	1
happens	1
to	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
must	1
bear	1
it	1
all	1
manfully	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
join	1
our	1
Brotherhood."	1
(Pierre	1
nodded	1
affirmatively.)	1
"When	1
you	1
hear	1
a	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
you	1
will	1
uncover	1
your	1
eyes,"	1
added	1
Willarski.	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
courage	1
and	1
success,"	1
and,	1
pressing	1
Pierre's	1
hand,	1
he	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
Left	1
alone,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
on	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
kerchief,	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
off,	1
but	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
again.	1
The	1
five	1
minutes	1
spent	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
bandaged	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
an	1
hour.	1
His	1
arms	1
felt	1
numb,	1
his	1
legs	1
almost	1
gave	1
way,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
tired	1
out.	1
He	1
experienced	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
most	1
complex	1
sensations.	1
He	1
felt	1
afraid	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
showing	1
his	1
fear.	1
He	1
felt	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
and	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
revealed	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
felt	1
joyful	1
that	1
the	1
moment	1
had	1
come	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
last	1
start	1
on	1
that	1
path	1
of	1
regeneration	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
actively	1
virtuous	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dreaming	1
since	1
he	1
met	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich.	1
Loud	1
knocks	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
the	1
bandage	1
off	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
glanced	1
around	1
him.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
in	1
black	1
darkness,	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
lamp	1
was	1
burning	1
inside	1
something	1
white.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
nearer	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
lamp	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
black	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
an	1
open	1
book.	1
The	1
book	1
was	1
the	1
Gospel,	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
thing	1
with	1
the	1
lamp	1
inside	1
was	1
a	1
human	1
skull	1
with	1
its	1
cavities	1
and	1
teeth.	1
After	1
reading	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Gospel:	1
"In	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
the	1
Word	1
and	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
with	1
God,"	1
Pierre	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
large	1
open	1
box	1
filled	1
with	1
something.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
coffin	1
with	1
bones	1
inside.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
saw.	1
Hoping	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
an	1
entirely	1
new	1
life	1
quite	1
unlike	1
the	1
old	1
one,	1
he	1
expected	1
everything	1
to	1
be	1
unusual,	1
even	1
more	1
unusual	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
seeing.	1
A	1
skull,	1
a	1
coffin,	1
the	1
Gospel--it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
even	1
more.	1
Trying	1
to	1
stimulate	1
his	1
emotions	1
he	1
looked	1
around.	1
"God,	1
death,	1
love,	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
of	1
man,"	1
he	1
kept	1
saying	1
to	1
himself,	1
associating	1
these	1
words	1
with	1
vague	1
yet	1
joyful	1
ideas.	1
The	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
someone	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
dim	1
light,	1
to	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
already	1
become	1
accustomed,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
rather	1
short	1
man.	1
Having	1
evidently	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
light	1
into	1
the	1
darkness,	1
the	1
man	1
paused,	1
then	1
moved	1
with	1
cautious	1
steps	1
toward	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
placed	1
on	1
it	1
his	1
small	1
leather-gloved	1
hands.	1
	1
This	1
short	1
man	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
leather	1
apron	1
which	1
covered	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
legs;	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
necklace	1
above	1
which	1
rose	1
a	1
high	1
white	1
ruffle,	1
outlining	1
his	1
rather	1
long	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
from	1
below.	1
	1
"For	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
hither?"	1
asked	1
the	1
newcomer,	1
turning	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
direction	1
at	1
a	1
slight	1
rustle	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
latter.	1
"Why	1
have	1
you,	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
light,	1
come	1
here?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
seek	1
from	1
us?	1
Wisdom,	1
virtue,	1
enlightenment?"	1
	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
came	1
in,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
awe	1
and	1
veneration	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
in	1
his	1
boyhood	1
at	1
confession;	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
one	1
socially	1
a	1
complete	1
stranger,	1
yet	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
of	1
man.	1
With	1
bated	1
breath	1
and	1
beating	1
heart	1
he	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
(by	1
which	1
name	1
the	1
brother	1
who	1
prepared	1
a	1
seeker	1
for	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
was	1
known).	1
Drawing	1
nearer,	1
he	1
recognized	1
in	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
knew,	1
Smolyaninov,	1
and	1
it	1
mortified	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
newcomer	1
was	1
an	1
acquaintance--he	1
wished	1
him	1
simply	1
a	1
brother	1
and	1
a	1
virtuous	1
instructor.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
had	1
to	1
repeat	1
his	1
question.	1
	1
"Yes...	1
I...	1
I...	1
desire	1
regeneration,"	1
Pierre	1
uttered	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Smolyaninov,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
at	1
once:	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
by	1
which	1
our	1
holy	1
Order	1
will	1
help	1
you	1
to	1
reach	1
your	1
aim?"	1
said	1
he	1
quietly	1
and	1
quickly.	1
	1
"I...	1
hope...	1
for	1
guidance...	1
help...	1
in	1
regeneration,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
and	1
some	1
difficulty	1
in	1
utterance	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
excitement	1
and	1
to	1
being	1
unaccustomed	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
abstract	1
matters	1
in	1
Russian.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
your	1
conception	1
of	1
Freemasonry?"	1
	1
"I	1
imagine	1
that	1
Freemasonry	1
is	1
the	1
fraternity	1
and	1
equality	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
virtuous	1
aims,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
inadequacy	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
for	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
"I	1
imagine..."	1
	1
"Good!"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
quickly,	1
apparently	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
answer.	1
"Have	1
you	1
sought	1
for	1
means	1
of	1
attaining	1
your	1
aim	1
in	1
religion?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
considered	1
it	1
erroneous	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
it,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
so	1
softly	1
that	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
atheist,"	1
answered	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
seeking	1
for	1
truth	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
follow	1
its	1
laws	1
in	1
your	1
life,	1
therefore	1
you	1
seek	1
wisdom	1
and	1
virtue.	1
Is	1
that	1
not	1
so?"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
assented	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
Rhetor	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat,	1
crossed	1
his	1
gloved	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
"Now	1
I	1
must	1
disclose	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
chief	1
aim	1
of	1
our	1
Order,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
if	1
this	1
aim	1
coincides	1
with	1
yours,	1
you	1
may	1
enter	1
our	1
Brotherhood	1
with	1
profit.	1
The	1
first	1
and	1
chief	1
object	1
of	1
our	1
Order,	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
rests	1
and	1
which	1
no	1
human	1
power	1
can	1
destroy,	1
is	1
the	1
preservation	1
and	1
handing	1
on	1
to	1
posterity	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
important	1
mystery...	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
remotest	1
ages,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
man--a	1
mystery	1
on	1
which	1
perhaps	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
mankind	1
depends.	1
But	1
since	1
this	1
mystery	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nature	1
that	1
nobody	1
can	1
know	1
or	1
use	1
it	1
unless	1
he	1
be	1
prepared	1
by	1
long	1
and	1
diligent	1
self-purification,	1
not	1
everyone	1
can	1
hope	1
to	1
attain	1
it	1
quickly.	1
Hence	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
secondary	1
aim,	1
that	1
of	1
preparing	1
our	1
members	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
reform	1
their	1
hearts,	1
to	1
purify	1
and	1
enlighten	1
their	1
minds,	1
by	1
means	1
handed	1
on	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
tradition	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
striven	1
to	1
attain	1
this	1
mystery,	1
and	1
thereby	1
to	1
render	1
them	1
capable	1
of	1
receiving	1
it.	1
	1
"By	1
purifying	1
and	1
regenerating	1
our	1
members	1
we	1
try,	1
thirdly,	1
to	1
improve	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race,	1
offering	1
it	1
in	1
our	1
members	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
piety	1
and	1
virtue,	1
and	1
thereby	1
try	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
might	1
to	1
combat	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
sways	1
the	1
world.	1
Think	1
this	1
over	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
again."	1
	1
"To	1
combat	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
sways	1
the	1
world..."	1
Pierre	1
repeated,	1
and	1
a	1
mental	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
future	1
activity	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
imagined	1
men	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
been	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago,	1
and	1
he	1
addressed	1
an	1
edifying	1
exhortation	1
to	1
them.	1
He	1
imagined	1
to	1
himself	1
vicious	1
and	1
unfortunate	1
people	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
assist	1
by	1
word	1
and	1
deed,	1
imagined	1
oppressors	1
whose	1
victims	1
he	1
would	1
rescue.	1
Of	1
the	1
three	1
objects	1
mentioned	1
by	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
this	1
last,	1
that	1
of	1
improving	1
mankind,	1
especially	1
appealed	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
important	1
mystery	1
mentioned	1
by	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
though	1
it	1
aroused	1
his	1
curiosity,	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
essential,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
aim,	1
that	1
of	1
purifying	1
and	1
regenerating	1
himself,	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
interest	1
him	1
because	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
felt	1
with	1
delight	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
perfectly	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
faults	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
later,	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
returned	1
to	1
inform	1
the	1
seeker	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
virtues,	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
steps	1
of	1
Solomon's	1
temple,	1
which	1
every	1
Freemason	1
should	1
cultivate	1
in	1
himself.	1
These	1
virtues	1
were:	1
1.	1
Discretion,	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
Order.	1
2.	1
Obedience	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
higher	1
ranks	1
in	1
the	1
Order.	1
3.	1
Morality.	1
4.	1
Love	1
of	1
mankind.	1
5.	1
Courage.	1
6.	1
Generosity.	1
7.	1
The	1
love	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
seventh	1
place,	1
try,	1
by	1
the	1
frequent	1
thought	1
of	1
death,"	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
said,	1
"to	1
bring	1
yourself	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
dreaded	1
foe,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
friend	1
that	1
frees	1
the	1
soul	1
grown	1
weary	1
in	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
virtue	1
from	1
this	1
distressful	1
life,	1
and	1
leads	1
it	1
to	1
its	1
place	1
of	1
recompense	1
and	1
peace."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
so,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
when	1
after	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
went	1
away,	1
leaving	1
him	1
to	1
solitary	1
meditation.	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
so,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
life,	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
now	1
gradually	1
opening	1
before	1
me."	1
But	1
five	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
virtues	1
which	1
Pierre	1
recalled,	1
counting	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
fingers,	1
he	1
felt	1
already	1
in	1
his	1
soul:	1
courage,	1
generosity,	1
morality,	1
love	1
of	1
mankind,	1
and	1
especially	1
obedience--which	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
virtue,	1
but	1
a	1
joy.	1
(He	1
now	1
felt	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
lawlessness	1
and	1
to	1
submit	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
indubitable	1
truth.)	1
He	1
forgot	1
what	1
the	1
seventh	1
virtue	1
was	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
recall	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
time	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
came	1
back	1
more	1
quickly	1
and	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
firm	1
in	1
his	1
intention	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
ready	1
for	1
everything,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
also	1
inform	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
"that	1
our	1
Order	1
delivers	1
its	1
teaching	1
not	1
in	1
words	1
only	1
but	1
also	1
by	1
other	1
means,	1
which	1
may	1
perhaps	1
have	1
a	1
stronger	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
sincere	1
seeker	1
after	1
wisdom	1
and	1
virtue	1
than	1
mere	1
words.	1
This	1
chamber	1
with	1
what	1
you	1
see	1
therein	1
should	1
already	1
have	1
suggested	1
to	1
your	1
heart,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
sincere,	1
more	1
than	1
words	1
could	1
do.	1
You	1
will	1
perhaps	1
also	1
see	1
in	1
your	1
further	1
initiation	1
a	1
like	1
method	1
of	1
enlightenment.	1
Our	1
Order	1
imitates	1
the	1
ancient	1
societies	1
that	1
explained	1
their	1
teaching	1
by	1
hieroglyphics.	1
A	1
hieroglyph,"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor,	1
"is	1
an	1
emblem	1
of	1
something	1
not	1
cognizable	1
by	1
the	1
senses	1
but	1
which	1
possesses	1
qualities	1
resembling	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
symbol."	1
	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
what	1
a	1
hieroglyph	1
was,	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
speak.	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
in	1
silence,	1
feeling	1
from	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
his	1
ordeal	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
begin.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
are	1
resolved,	1
I	1
must	1
begin	1
your	1
initiation,"	1
said	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
coming	1
closer	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"In	1
token	1
of	1
generosity	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
all	1
your	1
valuables."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
here,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
supposing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
he	1
possessed.	1
	1
"What	1
you	1
have	1
with	1
you:	1
watch,	1
money,	1
rings...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
quickly	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
watch,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
manage	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
wedding	1
ring	1
off	1
his	1
fat	1
finger.	1
When	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
said:	1
	1
"In	1
token	1
of	1
obedience,	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
undress."	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
coat,	1
waistcoat,	1
and	1
left	1
boot	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Rhetor's	1
instructions.	1
The	1
Mason	1
drew	1
the	1
shirt	1
back	1
from	1
Pierre's	1
left	1
breast,	1
and	1
stooping	1
down	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
left	1
leg	1
of	1
his	1
trousers	1
to	1
above	1
the	1
knee.	1
Pierre	1
hurriedly	1
began	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
boot	1
also	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
tuck	1
up	1
the	1
other	1
trouser	1
leg	1
to	1
save	1
this	1
stranger	1
the	1
trouble,	1
but	1
the	1
Mason	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
necessary	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
slipper	1
for	1
his	1
left	1
foot.	1
With	1
a	1
childlike	1
smile	1
of	1
embarrassment,	1
doubt,	1
and	1
self-derision,	1
which	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
against	1
his	1
will,	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
hanging	1
down	1
and	1
legs	1
apart,	1
before	1
his	1
brother	1
Rhetor,	1
and	1
awaited	1
his	1
further	1
commands.	1
	1
"And	1
now,	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
candor,	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
me	1
your	1
chief	1
passion,"	1
said	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
"My	1
passion!	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
so	1
many,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"That	1
passion	1
which	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
others	1
caused	1
you	1
to	1
waver	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
virtue,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mason.	1
	1
Pierre	1
paused,	1
seeking	1
a	1
reply.	1
	1
"Wine?	1
Gluttony?	1
Idleness?	1
Laziness?	1
Irritability?	1
Anger?	1
Women?"	1
He	1
went	1
over	1
his	1
vices	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
not	1
knowing	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
pre-eminence.	1
	1
"Women,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
scarcely	1
audible	1
voice.	1
	1
The	1
Mason	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
said	1
nothing	1
after	1
this	1
answer.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and,	1
taking	1
the	1
kerchief	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
again	1
bound	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"For	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you--turn	1
all	1
your	1
attention	1
upon	1
yourself,	1
put	1
a	1
bridle	1
on	1
your	1
senses,	1
and	1
seek	1
blessedness,	1
not	1
in	1
passion	1
but	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
heart.	1
The	1
source	1
of	1
blessedness	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
us	1
but	1
within...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
already	1
long	1
been	1
feeling	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
refreshing	1
source	1
of	1
blessedness	1
which	1
now	1
flooded	1
his	1
heart	1
with	1
glad	1
emotion.	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
this	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
chamber	1
to	1
fetch	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
the	1
Rhetor	1
but	1
Pierre's	1
sponsor,	1
Willarski,	1
whom	1
he	1
recognized	1
by	1
his	1
voice.	1
To	1
fresh	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
his	1
resolution	1
Pierre	1
replied:	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
agree,"	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
beaming,	1
childlike	1
smile,	1
his	1
fat	1
chest	1
uncovered,	1
stepping	1
unevenly	1
and	1
timidly	1
in	1
one	1
slippered	1
and	1
one	1
booted	1
foot,	1
he	1
advanced,	1
while	1
Willarski	1
held	1
a	1
sword	1
to	1
his	1
bare	1
chest.	1
He	1
was	1
conducted	1
from	1
that	1
room	1
along	1
passages	1
that	1
turned	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
Lodge.	1
Willarski	1
coughed,	1
he	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
the	1
masonic	1
knock	1
with	1
mallets,	1
the	1
doors	1
opened	1
before	1
them.	1
A	1
bass	1
voice	1
(Pierre	1
was	1
still	1
blindfolded)	1
questioned	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Then	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
led	1
somewhere	1
still	1
blindfolded,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
along	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
allegories	1
of	1
the	1
toils	1
of	1
his	1
pilgrimage,	1
of	1
holy	1
friendship,	1
of	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Architect	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
courage	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
endure	1
toils	1
and	1
dangers.	1
During	1
these	1
wanderings,	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
now	1
as	1
the	1
"Seeker,"	1
now	1
as	1
the	1
"Sufferer,"	1
and	1
now	1
as	1
the	1
"Postulant,"	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
various	1
knockings	1
with	1
mallets	1
and	1
swords.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
some	1
object	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
hesitation	1
and	1
uncertainty	1
among	1
his	1
conductors.	1
He	1
heard	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
disputing	1
in	1
whispers	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
insisting	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
led	1
along	1
a	1
certain	1
carpet.	1
After	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
something,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
hold	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
compasses	1
to	1
his	1
left	1
breast	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
and	1
to	1
repeat	1
after	1
someone	1
who	1
read	1
aloud	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
fidelity	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Order.	1
The	1
candles	1
were	1
then	1
extinguished	1
and	1
some	1
spirit	1
lighted,	1
as	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
by	1
the	1
smell,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
now	1
see	1
the	1
lesser	1
light.	1
The	1
bandage	1
was	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
eyes	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
faint	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
spirit,	1
Pierre,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saw	1
several	1
men	1
standing	1
before	1
him,	1
wearing	1
aprons	1
like	1
the	1
Rhetor's	1
and	1
holding	1
swords	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
pointed	1
at	1
his	1
breast.	1
Among	1
them	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
white	1
shirt	1
was	1
stained	1
with	1
blood.	1
On	1
seeing	1
this,	1
Pierre	1
moved	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
breast	1
toward	1
the	1
swords,	1
meaning	1
them	1
to	1
pierce	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
swords	1
were	1
drawn	1
back	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
blindfolded	1
again.	1
	1
"Now	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
the	1
lesser	1
light,"	1
uttered	1
a	1
voice.	1
Then	1
the	1
candles	1
were	1
relit	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
the	1
full	1
light;	1
the	1
bandage	1
was	1
again	1
removed	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
voices	1
said	1
together:	1
"Sic	1
transit	1
gloria	1
mundi."	1
	1
Pierre	1
gradually	1
began	1
to	1
recover	1
himself	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
at	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
it.	1
Round	1
a	1
long	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
black	1
sat	1
some	1
twelve	1
men	1
in	1
garments	1
like	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
seen.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
Pierre	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society.	1
In	1
the	1
President's	1
chair	1
sat	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
cross	1
hanging	1
from	1
his	1
neck.	1
On	1
his	1
right	1
sat	1
the	1
Italian	1
abbe	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
had	1
met	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
two	1
years	1
before.	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
present	1
a	1
very	1
distinguished	1
dignitary	1
and	1
a	1
Swiss	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
tutor	1
at	1
the	1
Kuragins'.	1
All	1
maintained	1
a	1
solemn	1
silence,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
who	1
held	1
a	1
mallet	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Let	1
into	1
the	1
wall	1
was	1
a	1
star-shaped	1
light.	1
At	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
carpet	1
with	1
various	1
figures	1
worked	1
upon	1
it,	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
something	1
resembling	1
an	1
altar	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
a	1
Testament	1
and	1
a	1
skull.	1
Round	1
it	1
stood	1
seven	1
large	1
candlesticks	1
like	1
those	1
used	1
in	1
churches.	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
brothers	1
led	1
Pierre	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
altar,	1
placed	1
his	1
feet	1
at	1
right	1
angles,	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
lie	1
down,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
prostrate	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
Gates	1
of	1
the	1
Temple.	1
	1
"He	1
must	1
first	1
receive	1
the	1
trowel,"	1
whispered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
brothers.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
hush,	1
please!"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
perplexed,	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
his	1
shortsighted	1
eyes	1
without	1
obeying,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
doubts	1
arose	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
"Where	1
am	1
I?	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
doing?	1
Aren't	1
they	1
laughing	1
at	1
me?	1
Shan't	1
I	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
remember	1
this?"	1
But	1
these	1
doubts	1
only	1
lasted	1
a	1
moment.	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
serious	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
around,	1
remembered	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
through,	1
and	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
halfway.	1
He	1
was	1
aghast	1
at	1
his	1
hesitation	1
and,	1
trying	1
to	1
arouse	1
his	1
former	1
devotional	1
feeling,	1
prostrated	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
Gates	1
of	1
the	1
Temple.	1
And	1
really,	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
devotion	1
returned	1
to	1
him	1
even	1
more	1
strongly	1
than	1
before.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
there	1
some	1
time,	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
get	1
up,	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
leather	1
apron,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
wore,	1
was	1
put	1
on	1
him:	1
he	1
was	1
given	1
a	1
trowel	1
and	1
three	1
pairs	1
of	1
gloves,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master	1
addressed	1
him.	1
He	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
to	1
stain	1
the	1
whiteness	1
of	1
that	1
apron,	1
which	1
symbolized	1
strength	1
and	1
purity;	1
then	1
of	1
the	1
unexplained	1
trowel,	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
toil	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
cleanse	1
his	1
own	1
heart	1
from	1
vice,	1
and	1
indulgently	1
to	1
smooth	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
neighbor.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
pair	1
of	1
gloves,	1
a	1
man's,	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
their	1
meaning	1
but	1
must	1
keep	1
them.	1
The	1
second	1
pair	1
of	1
man's	1
gloves	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
wear	1
at	1
the	1
meetings,	1
and	1
finally	1
of	1
the	1
third,	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
women's	1
gloves,	1
he	1
said:	1
"Dear	1
brother,	1
these	1
woman's	1
gloves	1
are	1
intended	1
for	1
you	1
too.	1
Give	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
whom	1
you	1
shall	1
honor	1
most	1
of	1
all.	1
This	1
gift	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
pledge	1
of	1
your	1
purity	1
of	1
heart	1
to	1
her	1
whom	1
you	1
select	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
worthy	1
helpmeet	1
in	1
Masonry."	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
he	1
added:	1
"But	1
beware,	1
dear	1
brother,	1
that	1
these	1
gloves	1
do	1
not	1
deck	1
hands	1
that	1
are	1
unclean."	1
While	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master	1
said	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
grew	1
embarrassed.	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
grew	1
still	1
more	1
confused,	1
blushed	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
till	1
tears	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
began	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
uneasily,	1
and	1
an	1
awkward	1
pause	1
followed.	1
	1
This	1
silence	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
who	1
led	1
Pierre	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
manuscript	1
book	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
figures	1
on	1
it:	1
the	1
sun,	1
the	1
moon,	1
a	1
hammer,	1
a	1
plumb	1
line,	1
a	1
trowel,	1
a	1
rough	1
stone	1
and	1
a	1
squared	1
stone,	1
a	1
pillar,	1
three	1
windows,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Then	1
a	1
place	1
was	1
assigned	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
he	1
was	1
shown	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
Lodge,	1
told	1
the	1
password,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
was	1
permitted	1
to	1
sit	1
down.	1
The	1
Grand	1
Master	1
began	1
reading	1
the	1
statutes.	1
They	1
were	1
very	1
long,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
from	1
joy,	1
agitation,	1
and	1
embarrassment,	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
read.	1
He	1
managed	1
to	1
follow	1
only	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
these	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"In	1
our	1
temples	1
we	1
recognize	1
no	1
other	1
distinctions,"	1
read	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master,	1
"but	1
those	1
between	1
virtue	1
and	1
vice.	1
Beware	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
distinctions	1
which	1
may	1
infringe	1
equality.	1
Fly	1
to	1
a	1
brother's	1
aid	1
whoever	1
he	1
may	1
be,	1
exhort	1
him	1
who	1
goeth	1
astray,	1
raise	1
him	1
that	1
falleth,	1
never	1
bear	1
malice	1
or	1
enmity	1
toward	1
thy	1
brother.	1
Be	1
kindly	1
and	1
courteous.	1
Kindle	1
in	1
all	1
hearts	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
virtue.	1
Share	1
thy	1
happiness	1
with	1
thy	1
neighbor,	1
and	1
may	1
envy	1
never	1
dim	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
that	1
bliss.	1
Forgive	1
thy	1
enemy,	1
do	1
not	1
avenge	1
thyself	1
except	1
by	1
doing	1
him	1
good.	1
Thus	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
highest	1
law	1
thou	1
shalt	1
regain	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
dignity	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
lost."	1
	1
He	1
finished	1
and,	1
getting	1
up,	1
embraced	1
and	1
kissed	1
Pierre,	1
who,	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
looked	1
round	1
him,	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
congratulations	1
and	1
greetings	1
from	1
acquaintances	1
that	1
met	1
him	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
He	1
acknowledged	1
no	1
acquaintances	1
but	1
saw	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
only	1
brothers,	1
and	1
burned	1
with	1
impatience	1
to	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
Grand	1
Master	1
rapped	1
with	1
his	1
mallet.	1
All	1
the	1
Masons	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
places,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
read	1
an	1
exhortation	1
on	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
humility.	1
	1
The	1
Grand	1
Master	1
proposed	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
duty	1
should	1
be	1
performed,	1
and	1
the	1
distinguished	1
dignitary	1
who	1
bore	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
"Collector	1
of	1
Alms"	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
brothers.	1
Pierre	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
subscribe	1
all	1
he	1
had,	1
but	1
fearing	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
look	1
like	1
pride	1
subscribed	1
the	1
same	1
amount	1
as	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
The	1
meeting	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
on	1
reaching	1
home	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
returned	1
from	1
a	1
long	1
journey	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
dozens	1
of	1
years,	1
had	1
become	1
completely	1
changed,	1
and	1
had	1
quite	1
left	1
behind	1
his	1
former	1
habits	1
and	1
way	1
of	1
life.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
into	1
the	1
Lodge,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
home	1
reading	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
fathom	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
Square,	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
which	1
symbolized	1
God,	1
another	1
moral	1
things,	1
a	1
third	1
physical	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
these.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
attention	1
wandered	1
from	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
the	1
Square	1
and	1
he	1
formed	1
in	1
imagination	1
a	1
new	1
plan	1
of	1
life.	1
On	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
Lodge,	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
a	1
rumor	1
of	1
his	1
duel	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wiser	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
Petersburg.	1
Pierre	1
proposed	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
estates	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
there	1
attending	1
to	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
serfs.	1
He	1
was	1
joyfully	1
planning	1
this	1
new	1
life,	1
when	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
suddenly	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
in	1
Moscow?	1
Why	1
have	1
you	1
quarreled	1
with	1
Helene,	1
mon	1
cher?	1
You	1
are	1
under	1
a	1
delusion,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
"I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
positively	1
that	1
Helene	1
is	1
as	1
innocent	1
before	1
you	1
as	1
Christ	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
Jews."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
simply	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
friend?	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
understand	1
it	1
all,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"You	1
behaved	1
as	1
becomes	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
values	1
his	1
honor,	1
perhaps	1
too	1
hastily,	1
but	1
we	1
won't	1
go	1
into	1
that.	1
But	1
consider	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
placing	1
her	1
and	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
society,	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
court,"	1
he	1
added,	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice.	1
"She	1
is	1
living	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
here.	1
Remember,	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
Pierre's	1
arm	1
downwards,	1
"it	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
misunderstanding.	1
I	1
expect	1
you	1
feel	1
it	1
so	1
yourself.	1
Let	1
us	1
write	1
her	1
a	1
letter	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
she'll	1
come	1
here	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
explained,	1
or	1
else,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
it's	1
quite	1
likely	1
you'll	1
have	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
it."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
gave	1
Pierre	1
a	1
significant	1
look.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
from	1
reliable	1
sources	1
that	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
is	1
taking	1
a	1
keen	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
affair.	1
You	1
know	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
gracious	1
to	1
Helene."	1
	1
Pierre	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
speak,	1
but,	1
on	1
one	1
hand,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
feared	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
decided	1
refusal	1
and	1
disagreement	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
answer	1
his	1
father-in-law.	1
Moreover,	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
masonic	1
statutes,	1
"be	1
kindly	1
and	1
courteous,"	1
recurred	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
blinked,	1
went	1
red,	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again,	1
struggling	1
with	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
thing	1
in	1
life--to	1
say	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
to	1
a	1
man's	1
face,	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
the	1
other,	1
whoever	1
he	1
might	1
be,	1
did	1
not	1
expect.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
submitting	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
tone	1
of	1
careless	1
self-assurance	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
withstand	1
it	1
now,	1
but	1
he	1
also	1
felt	1
that	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
now	1
his	1
future	1
depended--whether	1
he	1
would	1
follow	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
road,	1
or	1
that	1
new	1
path	1
so	1
attractively	1
shown	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
Masons,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
firmly	1
believed	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
reborn	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
life.	1
	1
"Now,	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
playfully,	1
"say	1
'yes,'	1
and	1
I'll	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
myself,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
kill	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf."	1
	1
But	1
before	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
playful	1
speech,	1
Pierre,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
fury	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
like	1
his	1
father,	1
muttered	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
	1
"Prince,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
here.	1
Go,	1
please	1
go!"	1
And	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
"Go!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
amazed	1
at	1
himself	1
and	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
confusion	1
and	1
fear	1
that	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
face.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
Are	1
you	1
ill?"	1
	1
"Go!"	1
the	1
quivering	1
voice	1
repeated.	1
And	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
receiving	1
any	1
explanation.	1
	1
A	1
week	1
later,	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
taken	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
friends,	1
the	1
Masons,	1
and	1
leaving	1
large	1
sums	1
of	1
money	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
alms,	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
estates.	1
His	1
new	1
brethren	1
gave	1
him	1
letters	1
to	1
the	1
Kiev	1
and	1
Odessa	1
Masons	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
guide	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
new	1
activity.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
The	1
duel	1
between	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
hushed	1
up	1
and,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
severity	1
regarding	1
duels	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
neither	1
the	1
principals	1
nor	1
their	1
seconds	1
suffered	1
for	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
duel,	1
confirmed	1
by	1
Pierre's	1
rupture	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
was	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
society.	1
Pierre	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
regarded	1
with	1
patronizing	1
condescension	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son,	1
and	1
petted	1
and	1
extolled	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
match	1
in	1
Russia,	1
had	1
sunk	1
greatly	1
in	1
the	1
esteem	1
of	1
society	1
after	1
his	1
marriage--	1
when	1
the	1
marriageable	1
daughters	1
and	1
their	1
mothers	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
hope	1
from	1
him--especially	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish,	1
to	1
court	1
society's	1
favor.	1
Now	1
he	1
alone	1
was	1
blamed	1
for	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
insanely	1
jealous	1
and	1
subject	1
like	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
fits	1
of	1
bloodthirsty	1
rage.	1
And	1
when	1
after	1
Pierre's	1
departure	1
Helene	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
she	1
was	1
received	1
by	1
all	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
not	1
only	1
cordially,	1
but	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
deference	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
misfortune.	1
When	1
conversation	1
turned	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
Helene	1
assumed	1
a	1
dignified	1
expression,	1
which	1
with	1
characteristic	1
tact	1
she	1
had	1
acquired	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
its	1
significance.	1
This	1
expression	1
suggested	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
endure	1
her	1
troubles	1
uncomplainingly	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
a	1
cross	1
laid	1
upon	1
her	1
by	1
God.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
expressed	1
his	1
opinion	1
more	1
openly.	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
when	1
Pierre	1
was	1
mentioned	1
and,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
forehead,	1
remarked:	1
	1
"A	1
bit	1
touched--I	1
always	1
said	1
so."	1
	1
"I	1
said	1
from	1
the	1
first,"	1
declared	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
referring	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
"I	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
before	1
anyone	1
else"	1
(she	1
insisted	1
on	1
her	1
priority)	1
"that	1
that	1
senseless	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
spoiled	1
by	1
the	1
depraved	1
ideas	1
of	1
these	1
days.	1
I	1
said	1
so	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
everybody	1
was	1
in	1
raptures	1
about	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad,	1
and	1
when,	1
if	1
you	1
remember,	1
he	1
posed	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Marat	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
soirees.	1
And	1
how	1
has	1
it	1
ended?	1
I	1
was	1
against	1
this	1
marriage	1
even	1
then	1
and	1
foretold	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
happened."	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
continued	1
to	1
give	1
on	1
free	1
evenings	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
soirees	1
as	1
before--such	1
as	1
she	1
alone	1
had	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
arranging--at	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
"the	1
cream	1
of	1
really	1
good	1
society,	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
the	1
intellectual	1
essence	1
of	1
Petersburg,"	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
put	1
it.	1
Besides	1
this	1
refined	1
selection	1
of	1
society	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
receptions	1
were	1
also	1
distinguished	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
always	1
presented	1
some	1
new	1
and	1
interesting	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
visitors	1
and	1
that	1
nowhere	1
else	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
thermometer	1
of	1
legitimate	1
Petersburg	1
court	1
society	1
so	1
dearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
indicated.	1
	1
Toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
1806,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
sad	1
details	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army	1
at	1
Jena	1
and	1
Auerstadt	1
and	1
the	1
surrender	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
Prussian	1
fortresses	1
had	1
been	1
received,	1
when	1
our	1
troops	1
had	1
already	1
entered	1
Prussia	1
and	1
our	1
second	1
war	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
beginning,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
gave	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
soirees.	1
The	1
"cream	1
of	1
really	1
good	1
society"	1
consisted	1
of	1
the	1
fascinating	1
Helene,	1
forsaken	1
by	1
her	1
husband,	1
Mortemart,	1
the	1
delightful	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
Vienna,	1
two	1
diplomatists,	1
the	1
old	1
aunt,	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
referred	1
to	1
in	1
that	1
drawing	1
room	1
as	1
"a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
merit"	1
(un	1
homme	1
de	1
beaucoup	1
de	1
merite),	1
a	1
newly	1
appointed	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
less	1
noteworthy	1
persons.	1
	1
The	1
novelty	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
setting	1
before	1
her	1
guests	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
Boris	1
Drubetskoy,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
as	1
a	1
special	1
messenger	1
from	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army	1
and	1
was	1
aide-de-camp	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
personage.	1
	1
The	1
temperature	1
shown	1
by	1
the	1
political	1
thermometer	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
this:	1
	1
"Whatever	1
the	1
European	1
sovereigns	1
and	1
commanders	1
may	1
do	1
to	1
countenance	1
Bonaparte,	1
and	1
to	1
cause	1
me,	1
and	1
us	1
in	1
general,	1
annoyance	1
and	1
mortification,	1
our	1
opinion	1
of	1
Bonaparte	1
cannot	1
alter.	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
express	1
our	1
sincere	1
views	1
on	1
that	1
subject,	1
and	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
and	1
others:	1
'So	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you.	1
Tu	1
l'as	1
voulu,	1
George	1
Dandin,'	1
that's	1
all	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
it!"	1
	1
When	1
Boris,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
guests,	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
had	1
assembled,	1
and	1
the	1
conversation,	1
guided	1
by	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
was	1
about	1
our	1
diplomatic	1
relations	1
with	1
Austria	1
and	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
an	1
alliance	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
Boris,	1
grown	1
more	1
manly	1
and	1
looking	1
fresh,	1
rosy	1
and	1
self-possessed,	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
elegantly	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
an	1
aide-de-	1
camp	1
and	1
was	1
duly	1
conducted	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
respects	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
and	1
then	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
circle.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
shriveled	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
several	1
persons	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
whispered	1
description	1
of	1
each.	1
	1
"Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
Kuragin,	1
M.	1
Krug,	1
the	1
charge	1
d'affaires	1
from	1
Copenhagen--a	1
profound	1
intellect,"	1
and	1
simply,	1
"Mr.	1
Shitov--a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
merit"--this	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
usually	1
so	1
described.	1
	1
Thanks	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
efforts,	1
his	1
own	1
tastes,	1
and	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
his	1
reserved	1
nature,	1
Boris	1
had	1
managed	1
during	1
his	1
service	1
to	1
place	1
himself	1
very	1
advantageously.	1
He	1
was	1
aide-de-camp	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
personage,	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
mission	1
to	1
Prussia,	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
there	1
as	1
a	1
special	1
messenger.	1
He	1
had	1
become	1
thoroughly	1
conversant	1
with	1
that	1
unwritten	1
code	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
pleased	1
at	1
Olmutz	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
which	1
an	1
ensign	1
might	1
rank	1
incomparably	1
higher	1
than	1
a	1
general,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
which	1
what	1
was	1
needed	1
for	1
success	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
not	1
effort	1
or	1
work,	1
or	1
courage,	1
or	1
perseverance,	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
can	1
grant	1
rewards,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
often	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
his	1
success	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
inability	1
of	1
others	1
to	1
understand	1
these	1
things.	1
In	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
discovery	1
his	1
whole	1
manner	1
of	1
life,	1
all	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
old	1
friends,	1
all	1
his	1
plans	1
for	1
his	1
future,	1
were	1
completely	1
altered.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
rich,	1
but	1
would	1
spend	1
his	1
last	1
groat	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
dressed	1
than	1
others,	1
and	1
would	1
rather	1
deprive	1
himself	1
of	1
many	1
pleasures	1
than	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
shabby	1
equipage	1
or	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
uniform.	1
He	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
and	1
sought	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
only	1
those	1
above	1
him	1
in	1
position	1
and	1
who	1
could	1
therefore	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
liked	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
despised	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
childish	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
army.	1
To	1
be	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
considered	1
an	1
important	1
step	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
understood	1
his	1
role,	1
letting	1
his	1
hostess	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
whatever	1
interest	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
offer.	1
He	1
himself	1
carefully	1
scanned	1
each	1
face,	1
appraising	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
establishing	1
intimacy	1
with	1
each	1
of	1
those	1
present,	1
and	1
the	1
advantages	1
that	1
might	1
accrue.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
seat	1
indicated	1
to	1
him	1
beside	1
the	1
fair	1
Helene	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
conversation.	1
	1
"Vienna	1
considers	1
the	1
bases	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
treaty	1
so	1
unattainable	1
that	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
continuity	1
of	1
most	1
brilliant	1
successes	1
would	1
secure	1
them,	1
and	1
she	1
doubts	1
the	1
means	1
we	1
have	1
of	1
gaining	1
them.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
actual	1
phrase	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
Vienna	1
cabinet,"	1
said	1
the	1
Danish	1
charge	1
d'affaires.	1
	1
"The	1
doubt	1
is	1
flattering,"	1
said	1
"the	1
man	1
of	1
profound	1
intellect,"	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile.	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
distinguish	1
between	1
the	1
Vienna	1
cabinet	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Austria,"	1
said	1
Mortemart.	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Austria	1
can	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
cabinet	1
that	1
says	1
it."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
vicomte,"	1
put	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"L'Urope"	1
(for	1
some	1
reason	1
she	1
called	1
it	1
Urope	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
a	1
specially	1
refined	1
French	1
pronunciation	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
allow	1
herself	1
when	1
conversing	1
with	1
a	1
Frenchman),	1
"L'Urope	1
ne	1
sera	1
jamais	1
notre	1
alliee	1
sincere."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Europe	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
our	1
sincere	1
ally."	1
	1
After	1
that	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
courage	1
and	1
firmness	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
draw	1
Boris	1
into	1
the	1
conversation.	1
	1
Boris	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
speakers,	1
awaiting	1
his	1
turn,	1
but	1
managed	1
meanwhile	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
repeatedly	1
at	1
his	1
neighbor,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene,	1
whose	1
eyes	1
several	1
times	1
met	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
handsome	1
young	1
aide-de-camp	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Speaking	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Prussia,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
very	1
naturally	1
asked	1
Boris	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
about	1
his	1
journey	1
to	1
Glogau	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
state	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army.	1
Boris,	1
speaking	1
with	1
deliberation,	1
told	1
them	1
in	1
pure,	1
correct	1
French	1
many	1
interesting	1
details	1
about	1
the	1
armies	1
and	1
the	1
court,	1
carefully	1
abstaining	1
from	1
expressing	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
about	1
the	1
facts	1
he	1
was	1
recounting.	1
For	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
engrossed	1
the	1
general	1
attention,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
novelty	1
she	1
had	1
served	1
up	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
pleasure	1
by	1
all	1
her	1
visitors.	1
The	1
greatest	1
attention	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
Boris'	1
narrative	1
was	1
shown	1
by	1
Helene.	1
She	1
asked	1
him	1
several	1
questions	1
about	1
his	1
journey	1
and	1
seemed	1
greatly	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
smile.	1
	1
"You	1
absolutely	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
me,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
implied	1
that,	1
for	1
certain	1
considerations	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
of,	1
this	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary.	1
	1
"On	1
Tuesday	1
between	1
eight	1
and	1
nine.	1
It	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
great	1
pleasure."	1
	1
Boris	1
promised	1
to	1
fulfill	1
her	1
wish	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
her,	1
when	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
called	1
him	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
that	1
her	1
aunt	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
her	1
husband,	1
of	1
course?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
indicating	1
Helene	1
with	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
gesture.	1
"Ah,	1
she	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
charming	1
woman!	1
Don't	1
mention	1
him	1
before	1
her--please	1
don't!	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
painful	1
for	1
her!"	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
When	1
Boris	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
had	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
company.	1
	1
Bending	1
forward	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
he	1
said:	1
"Le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse!"	1
and	1
having	1
said	1
this	1
laughed.	1
Everyone	1
turned	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"Le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse?"	1
Hippolyte	1
said	1
interrogatively,	1
again	1
laughing,	1
and	1
then	1
calmly	1
and	1
seriously	1
sat	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
on,	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
decided	1
to	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
how	1
at	1
Potsdam	1
the	1
impious	1
Bonaparte	1
had	1
stolen	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Frederick	1
the	1
Great.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Frederick	1
the	1
Great	1
which	1
I..."	1
she	1
began,	1
but	1
Hippolyte	1
interrupted	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse..."	1
and	1
again,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
all	1
turned	1
toward	1
him,	1
excused	1
himself	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
frowned.	1
Mortemart,	1
Hippolyte's	1
friend,	1
addressed	1
him	1
firmly.	1
	1
"Come	1
now,	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse?"	1
	1
Hippolyte	1
laughed	1
as	1
if	1
ashamed	1
of	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
nothing.	1
I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
say..."	1
(he	1
wanted	1
to	1
repeat	1
a	1
joke	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
Vienna	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
trying	1
all	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
get	1
in)	1
"I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
wrong	1
to	1
fight	1
pour	1
le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse!"	1
	1
Boris	1
smiled	1
circumspectly,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
as	1
ironical	1
or	1
appreciative	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
joke	1
was	1
received.	1
Everybody	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Your	1
joke	1
is	1
too	1
bad,	1
it's	1
witty	1
but	1
unjust,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
shaking	1
her	1
little	1
shriveled	1
finger	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
not	1
fighting	1
pour	1
le	1
Roi	1
de	1
Prusse,	1
but	1
for	1
right	1
principles.	1
Oh,	1
that	1
wicked	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
did	1
not	1
flag	1
all	1
evening	1
and	1
turned	1
chiefly	1
on	1
the	1
political	1
news.	1
It	1
became	1
particularly	1
animated	1
toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
the	1
rewards	1
bestowed	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
were	1
mentioned.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
N--	1
N--	1
received	1
a	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
the	1
portrait	1
last	1
year?"	1
said	1
"the	1
man	1
of	1
profound	1
intellect."	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
S--	1
S--	1
get	1
the	1
same	1
distinction?"	1
	1
"Pardon	1
me!	1
A	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
portrait	1
is	1
a	1
reward	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
distinction,"	1
said	1
the	1
diplomatist--"a	1
gift,	1
rather."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
precedents,	1
I	1
may	1
mention	1
Schwarzenberg."	1
	1
"It's	1
impossible,"	1
replied	1
another.	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
bet?	1
The	1
ribbon	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
is	1
a	1
different	1
matter...."	1
	1
When	1
everybody	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
Helene	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
very	1
little	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
again	1
turned	1
to	1
Boris,	1
asking	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
caressing	1
significant	1
command	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
on	1
Tuesday.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
me,"	1
she	1
said,	1
turning	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
toward	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sad	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
exalted	1
patroness,	1
supported	1
Helene's	1
wish.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
some	1
words	1
Boris	1
had	1
spoken	1
that	1
evening	1
about	1
the	1
Prussian	1
army,	1
Helene	1
had	1
suddenly	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
promise	1
to	1
explain	1
that	1
necessity	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
on	1
Tuesday.	1
	1
But	1
on	1
Tuesday	1
evening,	1
having	1
come	1
to	1
Helene's	1
splendid	1
salon,	1
Boris	1
received	1
no	1
clear	1
explanation	1
of	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come.	1
There	1
were	1
other	1
guests	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
talked	1
little	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
only	1
as	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
taking	1
leave	1
said	1
unexpectedly	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
with	1
a	1
strangely	1
unsmiling	1
face:	1
"Come	1
to	1
dinner	1
tomorrow...	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
You	1
must	1
come....	1
Come!"	1
	1
During	1
that	1
stay	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
Boris	1
became	1
an	1
intimate	1
in	1
the	1
countess'	1
house.	1

war	1
was	1
flaming	1
up	1
and	1
nearing	1
the	1
Russian	1
frontier.	1
Everywhere	1
one	1
heard	1
curses	1
on	1
Bonaparte,	1
"the	1
enemy	1
of	1
mankind."	1
Militiamen	1
and	1
recruits	1
were	1
being	1
enrolled	1
in	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
war	1
came	1
contradictory	1
news,	1
false	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
therefore	1
variously	1
interpreted.	1
The	1
life	1
of	1
old	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
greatly	1
changed	1
since	1
1805.	1
	1
In	1
1806	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
made	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
eight	1
commanders	1
in	1
chief	1
then	1
appointed	1
to	1
supervise	1
the	1
enrollment	1
decreed	1
throughout	1
Russia.	1
Despite	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
age,	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
particularly	1
noticeable	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
refuse	1
a	1
duty	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself,	1
and	1
this	1
fresh	1
opportunity	1
for	1
action	1
gave	1
him	1
new	1
energy	1
and	1
strength.	1
He	1
was	1
continually	1
traveling	1
through	1
the	1
three	1
provinces	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
was	1
pedantic	1
in	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
his	1
duties,	1
severe	1
to	1
cruel	1
with	1
his	1
subordinates,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
everything	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
himself.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
ceased	1
taking	1
lessons	1
in	1
mathematics	1
from	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
with	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
and	1
little	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
(as	1
his	1
grandfather	1
called	1
him).	1
The	1
baby	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
lived	1
with	1
his	1
wet	1
nurse	1
and	1
nurse	1
Savishna	1
in	1
the	1
late	1
princess'	1
rooms	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
nursery,	1
taking	1
a	1
mother's	1
place	1
to	1
her	1
little	1
nephew	1
as	1
best	1
she	1
could.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
too,	1
seemed	1
passionately	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
boy,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
often	1
deprived	1
herself	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
friend	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
dandling	1
the	1
little	1
angel--as	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
nephew--and	1
playing	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
Near	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
chapel	1
over	1
the	1
tomb	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
chapel	1
was	1
a	1
marble	1
monument	1
brought	1
from	1
Italy,	1
representing	1
an	1
angel	1
with	1
outspread	1
wings	1
ready	1
to	1
fly	1
upwards.	1
The	1
angel's	1
upper	1
lip	1
was	1
slightly	1
raised	1
as	1
though	1
about	1
to	1
smile,	1
and	1
once	1
on	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chapel	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
admitted	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
that	1
the	1
angel's	1
face	1
reminded	1
them	1
strangely	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
still	1
stranger,	1
though	1
of	1
this	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
the	1
sculptor	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
angel's	1
face,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
read	1
the	1
same	1
mild	1
reproach	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
dead	1
wife:	1
"Ah,	1
why	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
this	1
to	1
me?"	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
return	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
made	1
over	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
large	1
estate,	1
Bogucharovo,	1
about	1
twenty-five	1
miles	1
from	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
Partly	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
depressing	1
memories	1
associated	1
with	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
partly	1
because	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
feel	1
equal	1
to	1
bearing	1
with	1
his	1
father's	1
peculiarities,	1
and	1
partly	1
because	1
he	1
needed	1
solitude,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
Bogucharovo,	1
began	1
building	1
and	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
there.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
Austerlitz	1
campaign	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
continue	1
his	1
military	1
service,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
war	1
recommenced	1
and	1
everybody	1
had	1
to	1
serve,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
post	1
under	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
recruitment	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
avoid	1
active	1
service.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
changed	1
roles	1
since	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1805.	1
The	1
old	1
man,	1
roused	1
by	1
activity,	1
expected	1
the	1
best	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
new	1
campaign,	1
while	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
taking	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
secretly	1
regretting	1
this,	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
dark	1
side.	1
	1
On	1
February	1
26,	1
1807,	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
set	1
off	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
circuits.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remained	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
as	1
usual	1
during	1
his	1
father's	1
absence.	1
Little	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
unwell	1
for	1
four	1
days.	1
The	1
coachman	1
who	1
had	1
driven	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
town	1
returned	1
bringing	1
papers	1
and	1
letters	1
for	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Not	1
finding	1
the	1
young	1
prince	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
the	1
valet	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
letters	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
apartments,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
there.	1
He	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
please,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
Petrusha	1
has	1
brought	1
some	1
papers,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
nursemaids	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
child's	1
little	1
chair	1
while,	1
frowning	1
and	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands,	1
he	1
poured	1
drops	1
from	1
a	1
medicine	1
bottle	1
into	1
a	1
wineglass	1
half	1
full	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
said	1
crossly,	1
and,	1
his	1
hand	1
shaking	1
unintentionally,	1
he	1
poured	1
too	1
many	1
drops	1
into	1
the	1
glass.	1
He	1
threw	1
the	1
mixture	1
onto	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
more	1
water.	1
The	1
maid	1
brought	1
it.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
child's	1
cot,	1
two	1
boxes,	1
two	1
armchairs,	1
a	1
table,	1
a	1
child's	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
sitting.	1
The	1
curtains	1
were	1
drawn,	1
and	1
a	1
single	1
candle	1
was	1
burning	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
screened	1
by	1
a	1
bound	1
music	1
book	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
cot.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
addressing	1
her	1
brother	1
from	1
beside	1
the	1
cot	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
standing,	1
"better	1
wait	1
a	1
bit...	1
later..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
leave	1
off,	1
you	1
always	1
talk	1
nonsense	1
and	1
keep	1
putting	1
things	1
off--	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
it!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
an	1
exasperated	1
whisper,	1
evidently	1
meaning	1
to	1
wound	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,	1
really...	1
it's	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
wake	1
him...	1
he's	1
asleep,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
entreaty.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
bed,	1
wineglass	1
in	1
hand.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
we'd	1
really	1
better	1
not	1
wake	1
him,"	1
he	1
said	1
hesitating.	1
	1
"As	1
you	1
please...	1
really...	1
I	1
think	1
so...	1
but	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
evidently	1
intimidated	1
and	1
confused	1
that	1
her	1
opinion	1
had	1
prevailed.	1
She	1
drew	1
her	1
brother's	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
was	1
calling	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
night	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
slept,	1
watching	1
the	1
boy	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
fever.	1
These	1
last	1
days,	1
mistrusting	1
their	1
household	1
doctor	1
and	1
expecting	1
another	1
for	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
town,	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
trying	1
first	1
one	1
remedy	1
and	1
then	1
another.	1
Worn	1
out	1
by	1
sleeplessness	1
and	1
anxiety	1
they	1
threw	1
their	1
burden	1
of	1
sorrow	1
on	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
reproached	1
and	1
disputed	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
	1
"Petrusha	1
has	1
come	1
with	1
papers	1
from	1
your	1
father,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
maid.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
"Devil	1
take	1
them!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
and	1
after	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
verbal	1
instructions	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
sent	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
correspondence	1
and	1
his	1
father's	1
letter,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
"Well?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Still	1
the	1
same.	1
Wait,	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake.	1
Karl	1
Ivanich	1
always	1
says	1
that	1
sleep	1
is	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
anything,"	1
whispered	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
felt	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
burning	1
hot.	1
	1
"Confound	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
Karl	1
Ivanich!"	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
glass	1
with	1
the	1
drops	1
and	1
again	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cot.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
don't!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
scowled	1
at	1
her	1
angrily	1
though	1
also	1
with	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
stooped	1
glass	1
in	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
infant.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
wish	1
it,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
beg	1
you--give	1
it	1
him!"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
shrugged	1
her	1
shoulders	1
but	1
took	1
the	1
glass	1
submissively	1
and	1
calling	1
the	1
nurse	1
began	1
giving	1
the	1
medicine.	1
The	1
child	1
screamed	1
hoarsely.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
winced	1
and,	1
clutching	1
his	1
head,	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
	1
He	1
still	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
letters	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Opening	1
them	1
mechanically	1
he	1
began	1
reading.	1
The	1
old	1
prince,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
using	1
abbreviations,	1
wrote	1
in	1
his	1
large	1
elongated	1
hand	1
on	1
blue	1
paper	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
Have	1
just	1
this	1
moment	1
received	1
by	1
special	1
messenger	1
very	1
joyful	1
news--if	1
it's	1
not	1
false.	1
Bennigsen	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
obtained	1
a	1
complete	1
victory	1
over	1
Buonaparte	1
at	1
Eylau.	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
everyone	1
is	1
rejoicing,	1
and	1
the	1
rewards	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
are	1
innumerable.	1
Though	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
German--I	1
congratulate	1
him!	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
commander	1
at	1
Korchevo--a	1
certain	1
Khandrikov--is	1
up	1
to;	1
till	1
now	1
the	1
additional	1
men	1
and	1
provisions	1
have	1
not	1
arrived.	1
Gallop	1
off	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
say	1
I'll	1
have	1
his	1
head	1
off	1
if	1
everything	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
week.	1
Have	1
received	1
another	1
letter	1
about	1
the	1
Preussisch-Eylau	1
battle	1
from	1
Petenka--he	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
it--and	1
it's	1
all	1
true.	1
When	1
mischief-makers	1
don't	1
meddle	1
even	1
a	1
German	1
beats	1
Buonaparte.	1
He	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
fleeing	1
in	1
great	1
disorder.	1
Mind	1
you	1
gallop	1
off	1
to	1
Korchevo	1
without	1
delay	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
instructions!	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sighed	1
and	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
another	1
envelope.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
closely	1
written	1
letter	1
of	1
two	1
sheets	1
from	1
Bilibin.	1
He	1
folded	1
it	1
up	1
without	1
reading	1
it	1
and	1
reread	1
his	1
father's	1
letter,	1
ending	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Gallop	1
off	1
to	1
Korchevo	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
instructions!"	1
	1
"No,	1
pardon	1
me,	1
I	1
won't	1
go	1
now	1
till	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
better,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
still	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
cot,	1
gently	1
rocking	1
the	1
baby.	1
	1
"Ah	1
yes,	1
and	1
what	1
else	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
that's	1
unpleasant?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
recalling	1
his	1
father's	1
letter.	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
have	1
gained	1
a	1
victory	1
over	1
Bonaparte,	1
just	1
when	1
I'm	1
not	1
serving.	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
he's	1
always	1
poking	1
fun	1
at	1
me....	1
Ah,	1
well!	1
Let	1
him!"	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
reading	1
Bilibin's	1
letter	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
French.	1
He	1
read	1
without	1
understanding	1
half	1
of	1
it,	1
read	1
only	1
to	1
forget,	1
if	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
too	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
so	1
painfully	1
to	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Bilibin	1
was	1
now	1
at	1
army	1
headquarters	1
in	1
a	1
diplomatic	1
capacity,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
wrote	1
in	1
French	1
and	1
used	1
French	1
jests	1
and	1
French	1
idioms,	1
he	1
described	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
with	1
a	1
fearless	1
self-censure	1
and	1
self-	1
derision	1
genuinely	1
Russian.	1
Bilibin	1
wrote	1
that	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
diplomatic	1
discretion	1
tormented	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
a	1
reliable	1
correspondent	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
bile	1
he	1
had	1
accumulated	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
army.	1
The	1
letter	1
was	1
old,	1
having	1
been	1
written	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
at	1
Preussisch-	1
Eylau.	1
	1
"Since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
brilliant	1
success	1
at	1
Austerlitz,"	1
wrote	1
Bilibin,	1
"as	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
dear	1
prince,	1
I	1
never	1
leave	1
headquarters.	1
I	1
have	1
certainly	1
acquired	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
war,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
me;	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
three	1
months	1
is	1
incredible.	1
	1
"I	1
begin	1
ab	1
ovo.	1
'The	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race,'	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
attacks	1
the	1
Prussians.	1
The	1
Prussians	1
are	1
our	1
faithful	1
allies	1
who	1
have	1
only	1
betrayed	1
us	1
three	1
times	1
in	1
three	1
years.	1
We	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
cause,	1
but	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
that	1
'the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race'	1
pays	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
our	1
fine	1
speeches	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
rude	1
and	1
savage	1
way	1
throws	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
Prussians	1
without	1
giving	1
them	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
parade	1
they	1
had	1
begun,	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
twists	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
he	1
breaks	1
them	1
to	1
smithereens	1
and	1
installs	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
at	1
Potsdam.	1
	1
"'I	1
most	1
ardently	1
desire,'	1
writes	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
to	1
Bonaparte,	1
'that	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
should	1
be	1
received	1
and	1
treated	1
in	1
my	1
palace	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
agreeable	1
to	1
yourself,	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
circumstances	1
allowed,	1
I	1
have	1
hastened	1
to	1
take	1
all	1
steps	1
to	1
that	1
end.	1
May	1
I	1
have	1
succeeded!'	1
The	1
Prussian	1
generals	1
pride	1
themselves	1
on	1
being	1
polite	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
their	1
arms	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
demand.	1
	1
"The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
garrison	1
at	1
Glogau,	1
with	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men,	1
asks	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
summoned	1
to	1
surrender....	1
All	1
this	1
is	1
absolutely	1
true.	1
	1
"In	1
short,	1
hoping	1
to	1
settle	1
matters	1
by	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
warlike	1
attitude,	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
landed	1
ourselves	1
in	1
war,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
in	1
war	1
on	1
our	1
own	1
frontiers,	1
with	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia.	1
We	1
have	1
everything	1
in	1
perfect	1
order,	1
only	1
one	1
little	1
thing	1
is	1
lacking,	1
namely,	1
a	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
As	1
it	1
was	1
considered	1
that	1
the	1
Austerlitz	1
success	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
decisive	1
had	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
young,	1
all	1
our	1
octogenarians	1
were	1
reviewed,	1
and	1
of	1
Prozorovski	1
and	1
Kamenski	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
preferred.	1
The	1
general	1
comes	1
to	1
us,	1
Suvorov-	1
like,	1
in	1
a	1
kibitka,	1
and	1
is	1
received	1
with	1
acclamations	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
triumph.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
4th,	1
the	1
first	1
courier	1
arrives	1
from	1
Petersburg.	1
The	1
mails	1
are	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
room,	1
for	1
he	1
likes	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
himself.	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
to	1
help	1
sort	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
take	1
those	1
meant	1
for	1
us.	1
The	1
field	1
marshal	1
looks	1
on	1
and	1
waits	1
for	1
letters	1
addressed	1
to	1
him.	1
We	1
search,	1
but	1
none	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
The	1
field	1
marshal	1
grows	1
impatient	1
and	1
sets	1
to	1
work	1
himself	1
and	1
finds	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
Count	1
T.,	1
Prince	1
V.,	1
and	1
others.	1
Then	1
he	1
bursts	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
wild	1
furies	1
and	1
rages	1
at	1
everyone	1
and	1
everything,	1
seizes	1
the	1
letters,	1
opens	1
them,	1
and	1
reads	1
those	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor	1
addressed	1
to	1
others.	1
'Ah!	1
So	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
treat	1
me!	1
No	1
confidence	1
in	1
me!	1
Ah,	1
ordered	1
to	1
keep	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
me!	1
Very	1
well	1
then!	1
Get	1
along	1
with	1
you!'	1
So	1
he	1
writes	1
the	1
famous	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
General	1
Bennigsen:	1
	1
'I	1
am	1
wounded	1
and	1
cannot	1
ride	1
and	1
consequently	1
cannot	1
command	1
the	1
army.	1
You	1
have	1
brought	1
your	1
army	1
corps	1
to	1
Pultusk,	1
routed:	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
exposed,	1
and	1
without	1
fuel	1
or	1
forage,	1
so	1
something	1
must	1
be	1
done,	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
yourself	1
reported	1
to	1
Count	1
Buxhowden	1
yesterday,	1
you	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
retreating	1
to	1
our	1
frontier--which	1
do	1
today.'	1
	1
"'From	1
all	1
my	1
riding,'	1
he	1
writes	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
'I	1
have	1
got	1
a	1
saddle	1
sore	1
which,	1
coming	1
after	1
all	1
my	1
previous	1
journeys,	1
quite	1
prevents	1
my	1
riding	1
and	1
commanding	1
so	1
vast	1
an	1
army,	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
passed	1
on	1
the	1
command	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
next	1
in	1
seniority,	1
Count	1
Buxhowden,	1
having	1
sent	1
him	1
my	1
whole	1
staff	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
belongs	1
to	1
it,	1
advising	1
him	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
bread,	1
to	1
move	1
farther	1
into	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
Prussia,	1
for	1
only	1
one	1
day's	1
ration	1
of	1
bread	1
remains,	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
regiments	1
none	1
at	1
all,	1
as	1
reported	1
by	1
the	1
division	1
commanders,	1
Ostermann	1
and	1
Sedmoretzki,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
has	1
been	1
eaten	1
up.	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
remain	1
in	1
hospital	1
at	1
Ostrolenka	1
till	1
I	1
recover.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
humbly	1
submit	1
my	1
report,	1
with	1
the	1
information	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
army	1
remains	1
in	1
its	1
present	1
bivouac	1
another	1
fortnight	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
healthy	1
man	1
left	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
spring.	1
	1
"'Grant	1
leave	1
to	1
retire	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
seat	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
already	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
dishonored	1
by	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
fulfill	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
glorious	1
task	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
chosen.	1
I	1
shall	1
await	1
your	1
most	1
gracious	1
permission	1
here	1
in	1
hospital,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
secretary	1
rather	1
than	1
commander	1
in	1
the	1
army.	1
My	1
removal	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
does	1
not	1
produce	1
the	1
slightest	1
stir--a	1
blind	1
man	1
has	1
left	1
it.	1
There	1
are	1
thousands	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
in	1
Russia.'	1
	1
"The	1
field	1
marshal	1
is	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
he	1
punishes	1
us	1
all,	1
isn't	1
it	1
logical?	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
act.	1
Those	1
that	1
follow	1
are	1
naturally	1
increasingly	1
interesting	1
and	1
entertaining.	1
After	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
departure	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
must	1
give	1
battle.	1
Buxhowden	1
is	1
commander-in-chief	1
by	1
seniority,	1
but	1
General	1
Bennigsen	1
does	1
not	1
quite	1
see	1
it;	1
more	1
particularly	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
corps	1
who	1
are	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
battle	1
'on	1
his	1
own	1
hand'	1
as	1
the	1
Germans	1
say.	1
He	1
does	1
so.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Pultusk,	1
which	1
is	1
considered	1
a	1
great	1
victory	1
but	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
was	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
We	1
civilians,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
way	1
of	1
deciding	1
whether	1
a	1
battle	1
was	1
won	1
or	1
lost.	1
Those	1
who	1
retreat	1
after	1
a	1
battle	1
have	1
lost	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
say;	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
who	1
lost	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Pultusk.	1
In	1
short,	1
we	1
retreat	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
but	1
send	1
a	1
courier	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
with	1
news	1
of	1
a	1
victory,	1
and	1
General	1
Bennigsen,	1
hoping	1
to	1
receive	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
as	1
a	1
reward	1
for	1
his	1
victory,	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
General	1
Buxhowden.	1
During	1
this	1
interregnum	1
we	1
begin	1
a	1
very	1
original	1
and	1
interesting	1
series	1
of	1
maneuvers.	1
Our	1
aim	1
is	1
no	1
longer,	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be,	1
to	1
avoid	1
or	1
attack	1
the	1
enemy,	1
but	1
solely	1
to	1
avoid	1
General	1
Buxhowden	1
who	1
by	1
right	1
of	1
seniority	1
should	1
be	1
our	1
chief.	1
So	1
energetically	1
do	1
we	1
pursue	1
this	1
aim	1
that	1
after	1
crossing	1
an	1
unfordable	1
river	1
we	1
burn	1
the	1
bridges	1
to	1
separate	1
ourselves	1
from	1
our	1
enemy,	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
is	1
not	1
Bonaparte	1
but	1
Buxhowden.	1
General	1
Buxhowden	1
was	1
all	1
but	1
attacked	1
and	1
captured	1
by	1
a	1
superior	1
enemy	1
force	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
maneuvers	1
that	1
enabled	1
us	1
to	1
escape	1
him.	1
Buxhowden	1
pursues	1
us--we	1
scuttle.	1
He	1
hardly	1
crosses	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
our	1
side	1
before	1
we	1
recross	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
At	1
last	1
our	1
enemy,	1
Buxhowden,	1
catches	1
us	1
and	1
attacks.	1
Both	1
generals	1
are	1
angry,	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
is	1
a	1
challenge	1
on	1
Buxhowden's	1
part	1
and	1
an	1
epileptic	1
fit	1
on	1
Bennigsen's.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
critical	1
moment	1
the	1
courier	1
who	1
carried	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
our	1
victory	1
at	1
Pultusk	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
returns	1
bringing	1
our	1
appointment	1
as	1
commander-in-chief,	1
and	1
our	1
first	1
foe,	1
Buxhowden,	1
is	1
vanquished;	1
we	1
can	1
now	1
turn	1
our	1
thoughts	1
to	1
the	1
second,	1
Bonaparte.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
turns	1
out,	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
third	1
enemy	1
rises	1
before	1
us--namely	1
the	1
Orthodox	1
Russian	1
soldiers,	1
loudly	1
demanding	1
bread,	1
meat,	1
biscuits,	1
fodder,	1
and	1
whatnot!	1
The	1
stores	1
are	1
empty,	1
the	1
roads	1
impassable.	1
The	1
Orthodox	1
begin	1
looting,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
which	1
our	1
last	1
campaign	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
idea.	1
Half	1
the	1
regiments	1
form	1
bands	1
and	1
scour	1
the	1
countryside	1
and	1
put	1
everything	1
to	1
fire	1
and	1
sword.	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
are	1
totally	1
ruined,	1
the	1
hospitals	1
overflow	1
with	1
sick,	1
and	1
famine	1
is	1
everywhere.	1
Twice	1
the	1
marauders	1
even	1
attack	1
our	1
headquarters,	1
and	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
has	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
battalion	1
to	1
disperse	1
them.	1
During	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
attacks	1
they	1
carried	1
off	1
my	1
empty	1
portmanteau	1
and	1
my	1
dressing	1
gown.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
proposes	1
to	1
give	1
all	1
commanders	1
of	1
divisions	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
shoot	1
marauders,	1
but	1
I	1
much	1
fear	1
this	1
will	1
oblige	1
one	1
half	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
shoot	1
the	1
other."	1
	1
At	1
first	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
read	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
only,	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
(although	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
was	1
safe	1
to	1
trust	1
Bilibin),	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
began	1
to	1
interest	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
thus	1
far,	1
he	1
crumpled	1
the	1
letter	1
up	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
that	1
vexed	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
out	1
there	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
part	1
could	1
perturb	1
him.	1
He	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes,	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
all	1
interest	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
read,	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
nursery.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
strange	1
noise	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
alarm	1
lest	1
something	1
should	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
child	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
letter.	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
door	1
and	1
opened	1
it.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
nurse	1
was	1
hiding	1
something	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
look	1
and	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
by	1
the	1
cot.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
he	1
heard	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
despairing	1
whisper	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
after	1
long	1
sleeplessness	1
and	1
long	1
anxiety,	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
panic--it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead.	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
seemed	1
to	1
confirm	1
this	1
terror.	1
	1
"All	1
is	1
over,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
sweat	1
broke	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
forehead.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
cot	1
in	1
confusion,	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
it	1
empty	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
been	1
hiding	1
the	1
dead	1
baby.	1
He	1
drew	1
the	1
curtain	1
aside	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
his	1
frightened,	1
restless	1
eyes	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
baby.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
saw	1
him:	1
the	1
rosy	1
boy	1
had	1
tossed	1
about	1
till	1
he	1
lay	1
across	1
the	1
bed	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
pillow,	1
and	1
was	1
smacking	1
his	1
lips	1
in	1
his	1
sleep	1
and	1
breathing	1
evenly.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
as	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
boy	1
like	1
that,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
lost	1
him.	1
He	1
bent	1
over	1
him	1
and,	1
as	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
taught	1
him,	1
tried	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
whether	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
still	1
feverish.	1
The	1
soft	1
forehead	1
was	1
moist.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
touched	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
hand;	1
even	1
the	1
hair	1
was	1
wet,	1
so	1
profusely	1
had	1
the	1
child	1
perspired.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
evidently	1
the	1
crisis	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
convalescent.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
longed	1
to	1
snatch	1
up,	1
to	1
squeeze,	1
to	1
hold	1
to	1
his	1
heart,	1
this	1
helpless	1
little	1
creature,	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
He	1
stood	1
over	1
him,	1
gazing	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
which	1
showed	1
under	1
the	1
blanket.	1
He	1
heard	1
a	1
rustle	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
shadow	1
appeared	1
under	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
the	1
cot.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round,	1
but	1
still	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
infant's	1
face	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
regular	1
breathing.	1
The	1
dark	1
shadow	1
was	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cot	1
with	1
noiseless	1
steps,	1
lifted	1
the	1
curtain,	1
and	1
dropped	1
it	1
again	1
behind	1
her.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
recognized	1
her	1
without	1
looking	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
pressed	1
it.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
perspired,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
so."	1
	1
The	1
child	1
moved	1
slightly	1
in	1
his	1
sleep,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
against	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
sister.	1
In	1
the	1
dim	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
curtain	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
shone	1
more	1
brightly	1
than	1
usual	1
from	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
them.	1
She	1
leaned	1
over	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
slightly	1
catching	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
the	1
cot.	1
Each	1
made	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
warning	1
gesture	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
beneath	1
the	1
curtain	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
leave	1
that	1
seclusion	1
where	1
they	1
three	1
were	1
shut	1
off	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
move	1
away,	1
ruffling	1
his	1
hair	1
against	1
the	1
muslin	1
of	1
the	1
curtain.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
left	1
me	1
now,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
his	1
admission	1
to	1
the	1
masonic	1
Brotherhood,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Kiev	1
province,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
of	1
serfs,	1
taking	1
with	1
him	1
full	1
directions	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
down	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
guidance	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
on	1
his	1
estates.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
Kiev	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
stewards	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
office	1
and	1
explained	1
to	1
them	1
his	1
intentions	1
and	1
wishes.	1
He	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
steps	1
would	1
be	1
taken	1
immediately	1
to	1
free	1
his	1
serfs--and	1
that	1
till	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overburdened	1
with	1
labor,	1
women	1
while	1
nursing	1
their	1
babies	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
work,	1
assistance	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
serfs,	1
punishments	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
admonitory	1
and	1
not	1
corporal,	1
and	1
hospitals,	1
asylums,	1
and	1
schools	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
established	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
estates.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
stewards	1
(there	1
were	1
semiliterate	1
foremen	1
among	1
them)	1
listened	1
with	1
alarm,	1
supposing	1
these	1
words	1
to	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
count	1
was	1
displeased	1
with	1
their	1
management	1
and	1
embezzlement	1
of	1
money,	1
some	1
after	1
their	1
first	1
fright	1
were	1
amused	1
by	1
Pierre's	1
lisp	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
words	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
before,	1
others	1
simply	1
enjoyed	1
hearing	1
how	1
the	1
master	1
talked,	1
while	1
the	1
cleverest	1
among	1
them,	1
including	1
the	1
chief	1
steward,	1
understood	1
from	1
this	1
speech	1
how	1
they	1
could	1
best	1
handle	1
the	1
master	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
ends.	1
	1
The	1
chief	1
steward	1
expressed	1
great	1
sympathy	1
with	1
Pierre's	1
intentions,	1
but	1
remarked	1
that	1
besides	1
these	1
changes	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
general	1
state	1
of	1
affairs	1
which	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
satisfactory.	1
	1
Despite	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
enormous	1
wealth,	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
an	1
income	1
which	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
amount	1
to	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
himself	1
far	1
poorer	1
than	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
an	1
allowance	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
rubles.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
dim	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
budget:	1
	1
About	1
80,000	1
went	1
in	1
payments	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
estates	1
to	1
the	1
Land	1
Bank,	1
about	1
30,000	1
went	1
for	1
the	1
upkeep	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
town	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
allowance	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
princesses;	1
about	1
15,000	1
was	1
given	1
in	1
pensions	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
amount	1
for	1
asylums;	1
150,000	1
alimony	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
countess;	1
about	1
70,000	1
went	1
for	1
interest	1
on	1
debts.	1
The	1
building	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
church,	1
previously	1
begun,	1
had	1
cost	1
about	1
10,000	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
rest,	1
about	1
100,000	1
rubles,	1
was	1
spent,	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
year	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
borrow.	1
Besides	1
this	1
the	1
chief	1
steward	1
wrote	1
every	1
year	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
fires	1
and	1
bad	1
harvests,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
rebuilding	1
factories	1
and	1
workshops.	1
So	1
the	1
first	1
task	1
Pierre	1
had	1
to	1
face	1
was	1
one	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
aptitude	1
or	1
inclination--practical	1
business.	1
	1
He	1
discussed	1
estate	1
affairs	1
every	1
day	1
with	1
his	1
chief	1
steward.	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
forward	1
matters	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
these	1
consultations	1
were	1
detached	1
from	1
real	1
affairs	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
link	1
up	1
with	1
them	1
or	1
make	1
them	1
move.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
the	1
chief	1
steward	1
put	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
worst	1
light,	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
paying	1
off	1
the	1
debts	1
and	1
undertaking	1
new	1
activities	1
with	1
serf	1
labor,	1
to	1
which	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
agree.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
Pierre	1
demanded	1
that	1
steps	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
liberate	1
the	1
serfs,	1
which	1
the	1
steward	1
met	1
by	1
showing	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
first	1
paying	1
off	1
the	1
loans	1
from	1
the	1
Land	1
Bank,	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
impossibility	1
of	1
a	1
speedy	1
emancipation.	1
	1
The	1
steward	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
impossible,	1
but	1
suggested	1
selling	1
the	1
forests	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Kostroma,	1
the	1
land	1
lower	1
down	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
Crimean	1
estate,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
possible:	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
operations	1
according	1
to	1
him	1
were	1
connected	1
with	1
such	1
complicated	1
measures--the	1
removal	1
of	1
injunctions,	1
petitions,	1
permits,	1
and	1
so	1
on--	1
that	1
Pierre	1
became	1
quite	1
bewildered	1
and	1
only	1
replied:	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
practical	1
persistence	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
himself	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
disliked	1
it	1
and	1
only	1
tried	1
to	1
pretend	1
to	1
the	1
steward	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
attending	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
steward	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
tried	1
to	1
pretend	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
these	1
consultations	1
very	1
valuable	1
for	1
the	1
proprietor	1
and	1
troublesome	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
In	1
Kiev	1
Pierre	1
found	1
some	1
people	1
he	1
knew,	1
and	1
strangers	1
hastened	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
joyfully	1
welcomed	1
the	1
rich	1
newcomer,	1
the	1
largest	1
landowner	1
of	1
the	1
province.	1
Temptations	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
greatest	1
weakness--	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
confessed	1
when	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
Lodge--were	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
them.	1
Again	1
whole	1
days,	1
weeks,	1
and	1
months	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
passed	1
in	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
rush	1
and	1
were	1
as	1
much	1
occupied	1
with	1
evening	1
parties,	1
dinners,	1
lunches,	1
and	1
balls,	1
giving	1
him	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
reflection,	1
as	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
lead	1
he	1
still	1
lived	1
the	1
old	1
life,	1
only	1
in	1
new	1
surroundings.	1
	1
Of	1
the	1
three	1
precepts	1
of	1
Freemasonry	1
Pierre	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
fulfill	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
enjoined	1
every	1
Mason	1
to	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
moral	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
virtues	1
he	1
lacked	1
two--morality	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
death.	1
He	1
consoled	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
fulfilled	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
precepts--that	1
of	1
reforming	1
the	1
human	1
race--and	1
had	1
other	1
virtues--love	1
of	1
his	1
neighbor,	1
and	1
especially	1
generosity.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
1807	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
visit	1
all	1
his	1
estates	1
and	1
see	1
for	1
himself	1
how	1
far	1
his	1
orders	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
out	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
state	1
were	1
the	1
serfs	1
whom	1
God	1
had	1
entrusted	1
to	1
his	1
care	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
benefit.	1
	1
The	1
chief	1
steward,	1
who	1
considered	1
the	1
young	1
count's	1
attempts	1
almost	1
insane--unprofitable	1
to	1
himself,	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
serfs--made	1
some	1
concessions.	1
Continuing	1
to	1
represent	1
the	1
liberation	1
of	1
the	1
serfs	1
as	1
impracticable,	1
he	1
arranged	1
for	1
the	1
erection	1
of	1
large	1
buildings--schools,	1
hospitals,	1
and	1
asylums--on	1
all	1
the	1
estates	1
before	1
the	1
master	1
arrived.	1
Everywhere	1
preparations	1
were	1
made	1
not	1
for	1
ceremonious	1
welcomes	1
(which	1
he	1
knew	1
Pierre	1
would	1
not	1
like),	1
but	1
for	1
just	1
such	1
gratefully	1
religious	1
ones,	1
with	1
offerings	1
of	1
icons	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
salt	1
of	1
hospitality,	1
as,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
understanding	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
would	1
touch	1
and	1
delude	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
southern	1
spring,	1
the	1
comfortable	1
rapid	1
traveling	1
in	1
a	1
Vienna	1
carriage,	1
and	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
all	1
had	1
a	1
gladdening	1
effect	1
on	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
estates	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
before	1
visited	1
were	1
each	1
more	1
picturesque	1
than	1
the	1
other;	1
the	1
serfs	1
everywhere	1
seemed	1
thriving	1
and	1
touchingly	1
grateful	1
for	1
the	1
benefits	1
conferred	1
on	1
them.	1
Everywhere	1
were	1
receptions,	1
which	1
though	1
they	1
embarrassed	1
Pierre	1
awakened	1
a	1
joyful	1
feeling	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
In	1
one	1
place	1
the	1
peasants	1
presented	1
him	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
salt	1
and	1
an	1
icon	1
of	1
Saint	1
Peter	1
and	1
Saint	1
Paul,	1
asking	1
permission,	1
as	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
their	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
benefits	1
he	1
had	1
conferred	1
on	1
them,	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
new	1
chantry	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
expense	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
Peter	1
and	1
Paul,	1
his	1
patron	1
saints.	1
In	1
another	1
place	1
the	1
women	1
with	1
infants	1
in	1
arms	1
met	1
him	1
to	1
thank	1
him	1
for	1
releasing	1
them	1
from	1
hard	1
work.	1
On	1
a	1
third	1
estate	1
the	1
priest,	1
bearing	1
a	1
cross,	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
surrounded	1
by	1
children	1
whom,	1
by	1
the	1
count's	1
generosity,	1
he	1
was	1
instructing	1
in	1
reading,	1
writing,	1
and	1
religion.	1
On	1
all	1
his	1
estates	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
brick	1
buildings	1
erected	1
or	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
erection,	1
all	1
on	1
one	1
plan,	1
for	1
hospitals,	1
schools,	1
and	1
almshouses,	1
which	1
were	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
opened.	1
Everywhere	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
stewards'	1
accounts,	1
according	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
serfs'	1
manorial	1
labor	1
had	1
been	1
diminished,	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
touching	1
thanks	1
of	1
deputations	1
of	1
serfs	1
in	1
their	1
full-skirted	1
blue	1
coats.	1
	1
What	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
presented	1
him	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
salt	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
chantry	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
Peter	1
and	1
Paul	1
was	1
a	1
market	1
village	1
where	1
a	1
fair	1
was	1
held	1
on	1
St.	1
Peter's	1
day,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
richest	1
peasants	1
(who	1
formed	1
the	1
deputation)	1
had	1
begun	1
the	1
chantry	1
long	1
before,	1
but	1
that	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
in	1
that	1
villages	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
poverty.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
the	1
nursing	1
mothers	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
sent	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
land,	1
they	1
did	1
still	1
harder	1
work	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
priest	1
who	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cross	1
oppressed	1
the	1
peasants	1
by	1
his	1
exactions,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
pupils'	1
parents	1
wept	1
at	1
having	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
secured	1
their	1
release	1
by	1
heavy	1
payments.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
brick	1
buildings,	1
built	1
to	1
plan,	1
were	1
being	1
built	1
by	1
serfs	1
whose	1
manorial	1
labor	1
was	1
thus	1
increased,	1
though	1
lessened	1
on	1
paper.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
where	1
the	1
steward	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
accounts	1
that	1
the	1
serfs'	1
payments	1
had	1
been	1
diminished	1
by	1
a	1
third,	1
their	1
obligatory	1
manorial	1
work	1
had	1
been	1
increased	1
by	1
a	1
half.	1
And	1
so	1
Pierre	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
his	1
estates	1
and	1
quite	1
recovered	1
the	1
philanthropic	1
mood	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
wrote	1
enthusiastic	1
letters	1
to	1
his	1
"brother-instructor"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
Grand	1
Master.	1
	1
"How	1
easy	1
it	1
is,	1
how	1
little	1
effort	1
it	1
needs,	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
good,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"and	1
how	1
little	1
attention	1
we	1
pay	1
to	1
it!"	1
	1
He	1
was	1
pleased	1
at	1
the	1
gratitude	1
he	1
received,	1
but	1
felt	1
abashed	1
at	1
receiving	1
it.	1
This	1
gratitude	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
for	1
these	1
simple,	1
kindly	1
people.	1
	1
The	1
chief	1
steward,	1
a	1
very	1
stupid	1
but	1
cunning	1
man	1
who	1
saw	1
perfectly	1
through	1
the	1
naive	1
and	1
intelligent	1
count	1
and	1
played	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
toy,	1
seeing	1
the	1
effect	1
these	1
prearranged	1
receptions	1
had	1
on	1
Pierre,	1
pressed	1
him	1
still	1
harder	1
with	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
impossibility	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
uselessness	1
of	1
freeing	1
the	1
serfs,	1
who	1
were	1
quite	1
happy	1
as	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
Pierre	1
in	1
his	1
secret	1
soul	1
agreed	1
with	1
the	1
steward	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
imagine	1
happier	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
God	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
free,	1
but	1
he	1
insisted,	1
though	1
reluctantly,	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
right.	1
The	1
steward	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
count's	1
wishes,	1
seeing	1
clearly	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
would	1
the	1
count	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
all	1
measures	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
forests	1
and	1
to	1
release	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Land	1
Bank,	1
but	1
would	1
probably	1
never	1
even	1
inquire	1
and	1
would	1
never	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
newly	1
erected	1
buildings	1
were	1
standing	1
empty	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
serfs	1
continued	1
to	1
give	1
in	1
money	1
and	1
work	1
all	1
that	1
other	1
people's	1
serfs	1
gave--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
them.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Returning	1
from	1
his	1
journey	1
through	1
South	1
Russia	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
Pierre	1
carried	1
out	1
an	1
intention	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
had	1
of	1
visiting	1
his	1
friend	1
Bolkonski,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
two	1
years.	1
	1
Bogucharovo	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
flat	1
uninteresting	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
among	1
fields	1
and	1
forests	1
of	1
fir	1
and	1
birch,	1
which	1
were	1
partly	1
cut	1
down.	1
The	1
house	1
lay	1
behind	1
a	1
newly	1
dug	1
pond	1
filled	1
with	1
water	1
to	1
the	1
brink	1
and	1
with	1
banks	1
still	1
bare	1
of	1
grass.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
that	1
stretched	1
along	1
the	1
highroad	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
copse	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
a	1
few	1
fir	1
trees.	1
	1
The	1
homestead	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
threshing	1
floor,	1
outhouses,	1
stables,	1
a	1
bathhouse,	1
a	1
lodge,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
brick	1
house	1
with	1
semicircular	1
facade	1
still	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
construction.	1
Round	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
a	1
garden	1
newly	1
laid	1
out.	1
The	1
fences	1
and	1
gates	1
were	1
new	1
and	1
solid;	1
two	1
fire	1
pumps	1
and	1
a	1
water	1
cart,	1
painted	1
green,	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
shed;	1
the	1
paths	1
were	1
straight,	1
the	1
bridges	1
were	1
strong	1
and	1
had	1
handrails.	1
Everything	1
bore	1
an	1
impress	1
of	1
tidiness	1
and	1
good	1
management.	1
Some	1
domestic	1
serfs	1
Pierre	1
met,	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
prince	1
lived,	1
pointed	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
newly	1
built	1
lodge	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
pond.	1
Anton,	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
looked	1
after	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
his	1
boyhood,	1
helped	1
Pierre	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage,	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
clean	1
little	1
anteroom.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
modesty	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
though	1
clean	1
house	1
after	1
the	1
brilliant	1
surroundings	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
last	1
met	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
He	1
quickly	1
entered	1
the	1
small	1
reception	1
room	1
with	1
its	1
still-unplastered	1
wooden	1
walls	1
redolent	1
of	1
pine,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
farther,	1
but	1
Anton	1
ran	1
ahead	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
knocked	1
at	1
a	1
door.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
is	1
it?"	1
came	1
a	1
sharp,	1
unpleasant	1
voice.	1
	1
"A	1
visitor,"	1
answered	1
Anton.	1
	1
"Ask	1
him	1
to	1
wait,"	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
was	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
being	1
pushed	1
back.	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
suddenly	1
came	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
frowning	1
and	1
looking	1
old.	1
Pierre	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
spectacles	1
kissed	1
his	1
friend	1
on	1
the	1
cheek	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
closely.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Pierre	1
said	1
nothing;	1
he	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
with	1
surprise.	1
He	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
him.	1
His	1
words	1
were	1
kindly	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
face,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
dull	1
and	1
lifeless	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
evident	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
joyous	1
and	1
glad	1
sparkle.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
grown	1
thinner,	1
paler,	1
and	1
more	1
manly-	1
looking,	1
but	1
what	1
amazed	1
and	1
estranged	1
Pierre	1
till	1
he	1
got	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
were	1
his	1
inertia	1
and	1
a	1
wrinkle	1
on	1
his	1
brow	1
indicating	1
prolonged	1
concentration	1
on	1
some	1
one	1
thought.	1
	1
As	1
is	1
usually	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
people	1
meeting	1
after	1
a	1
prolonged	1
separation,	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
before	1
their	1
conversation	1
could	1
settle	1
on	1
anything.	1
They	1
put	1
questions	1
and	1
gave	1
brief	1
replies	1
about	1
things	1
they	1
knew	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
talked	1
over	1
at	1
length.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
conversation	1
gradually	1
settled	1
on	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
topics	1
at	1
first	1
lightly	1
touched	1
on:	1
their	1
past	1
life,	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
Pierre's	1
journeys	1
and	1
occupations,	1
the	1
war,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
The	1
preoccupation	1
and	1
despondency	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
noticed	1
in	1
his	1
friend's	1
look	1
was	1
now	1
still	1
more	1
clearly	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
joyful	1
animation	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
or	1
the	1
future.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
sympathize	1
with	1
what	1
Pierre	1
was	1
saying,	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
The	1
latter	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
bad	1
taste	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
enthusiasms,	1
dreams,	1
and	1
hopes	1
of	1
happiness	1
or	1
goodness,	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
presence.	1
He	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
new	1
masonic	1
views,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
particularly	1
revived	1
and	1
strengthened	1
by	1
his	1
late	1
tour.	1
He	1
checked	1
himself,	1
fearing	1
to	1
seem	1
naive,	1
yet	1
he	1
felt	1
an	1
irresistible	1
desire	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
friend	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
quite	1
different,	1
and	1
better,	1
Pierre	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
through	1
since	1
then.	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
myself	1
again."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
have	1
altered	1
much,	1
very	1
much,	1
since	1
then,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
you?	1
What	1
are	1
your	1
plans?"	1
	1
"Plans!"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
ironically.	1
"My	1
plans?"	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
word.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
I'm	1
building.	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
settle	1
here	1
altogether	1
next	1
year...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
silently	1
and	1
searchingly	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face,	1
which	1
had	1
grown	1
much	1
older.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
ask..."	1
Pierre	1
began,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
talk	1
of	1
me?...	1
Talk	1
to	1
me,	1
yes,	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
travels	1
and	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
doing	1
on	1
your	1
estates."	1
	1
Pierre	1
began	1
describing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
on	1
his	1
estates,	1
trying	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
improvements	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
made.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
several	1
times	1
prompted	1
Pierre's	1
story	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
doing,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
an	1
old-time	1
story,	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
not	1
only	1
without	1
interest	1
but	1
even	1
as	1
if	1
ashamed	1
of	1
what	1
Pierre	1
was	1
telling	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
even	1
depressed	1
in	1
his	1
friend's	1
company	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
became	1
silent.	1
	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
evidently	1
also	1
felt	1
depressed	1
and	1
constrained	1
with	1
his	1
visitor,	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
bivouacking	1
here	1
and	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
round.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
sister	1
today.	1
I	1
will	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
her.	1
But	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
know	1
her	1
already,"	1
he	1
said,	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
entertain	1
a	1
visitor	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
found	1
nothing	1
in	1
common.	1
"We	1
will	1
go	1
after	1
dinner.	1
And	1
would	1
you	1
now	1
like	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
my	1
place?"	1
	1
They	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
till	1
dinnertime,	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
news	1
and	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
like	1
people	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
each	1
other	1
intimately.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
spoke	1
with	1
some	1
animation	1
and	1
interest	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
homestead	1
he	1
was	1
constructing	1
and	1
its	1
buildings,	1
but	1
even	1
here,	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
scaffolding,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
talk	1
explaining	1
the	1
future	1
arrangements	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
interrupted	1
himself:	1
	1
"However,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
interesting.	1
Let	1
us	1
have	1
dinner,	1
and	1
then	1
we'll	1
set	1
off."	1
	1
At	1
dinner,	1
conversation	1
turned	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
marriage.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Pierre	1
blushed,	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
said	1
hurriedly:	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
some	1
time	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
happened.	1
But	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over,	1
and	1
forever."	1
	1
"Forever?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Nothing's	1
forever."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
ended,	1
don't	1
you?	1
You	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
duel?"	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
that	1
too!"	1
	1
"One	1
thing	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
for	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
kill	1
that	1
man,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Why	1
so?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"To	1
kill	1
a	1
vicious	1
dog	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing	1
really."	1
	1
"No,	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
bad--wrong."	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
wrong?"	1
urged	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
man	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
wrong.	1
Men	1
always	1
did	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
err,	1
and	1
in	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
consider	1
right	1
and	1
wrong."	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
harm	1
to	1
another	1
is	1
wrong,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
his	1
arrival	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
roused,	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
talk,	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
express	1
what	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
present	1
state.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
has	1
told	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
bad	1
for	1
another	1
man?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Bad!	1
Bad!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre.	1
"We	1
all	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
bad	1
for	1
ourselves."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
know	1
that,	1
but	1
the	1
harm	1
I	1
am	1
conscious	1
of	1
in	1
myself	1
is	1
something	1
I	1
cannot	1
inflict	1
on	1
others,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
new	1
outlook	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
French.	1
"I	1
only	1
know	1
two	1
very	1
real	1
evils	1
in	1
life:	1
remorse	1
and	1
illness.	1
The	1
only	1
good	1
is	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
those	1
evils.	1
To	1
live	1
for	1
myself	1
avoiding	1
those	1
two	1
evils	1
is	1
my	1
whole	1
philosophy	1
now."	1
	1
"And	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
neighbor,	1
and	1
self-sacrifice?"	1
began	1
Pierre.	1
"No,	1
I	1
can't	1
agree	1
with	1
you!	1
To	1
live	1
only	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
repent	1
is	1
not	1
enough.	1
I	1
lived	1
like	1
that,	1
I	1
lived	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
ruined	1
my	1
life.	1
And	1
only	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
living,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
trying"	1
(Pierre's	1
modesty	1
made	1
him	1
correct	1
himself)	1
"to	1
live	1
for	1
others,	1
only	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
life.	1
No,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
really	1
believe	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying."	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
silently	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
an	1
ironic	1
smile.	1
	1
"When	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
sister,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
you'll	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
her,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
are	1
right	1
for	1
yourself,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
"but	1
everyone	1
lives	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
You	1
lived	1
for	1
yourself	1
and	1
say	1
you	1
nearly	1
ruined	1
your	1
life	1
and	1
only	1
found	1
happiness	1
when	1
you	1
began	1
living	1
for	1
others.	1
I	1
experienced	1
just	1
the	1
reverse.	1
I	1
lived	1
for	1
glory.--	1
And	1
after	1
all	1
what	1
is	1
glory?	1
The	1
same	1
love	1
of	1
others,	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
them,	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
their	1
approval.--So	1
I	1
lived	1
for	1
others,	1
and	1
not	1
almost,	1
but	1
quite,	1
ruined	1
my	1
life.	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
become	1
calmer	1
since	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
live	1
only	1
for	1
myself."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
living	1
only	1
for	1
yourself?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
growing	1
excited.	1
"What	1
about	1
your	1
son,	1
your	1
sister,	1
and	1
your	1
father?"	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
myself--they	1
are	1
not	1
others,"	1
explained	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"The	1
others,	1
one's	1
neighbors,	1
le	1
prochain,	1
as	1
you	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
call	1
it,	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
source	1
of	1
all	1
error	1
and	1
evil.	1
Le	1
prochain--your	1
Kiev	1
peasants	1
to	1
whom	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
good."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
mocking,	1
challenging	1
expression.	1
He	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
on.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
joking,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited.	1
"What	1
error	1
or	1
evil	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
wishing	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
even	1
doing	1
a	1
little--though	1
I	1
did	1
very	1
little	1
and	1
did	1
it	1
very	1
badly?	1
What	1
evil	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
it	1
if	1
unfortunate	1
people,	1
our	1
serfs,	1
people	1
like	1
ourselves,	1
were	1
growing	1
up	1
and	1
dying	1
with	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
truth	1
beyond	1
ceremonies	1
and	1
meaningless	1
prayers	1
and	1
are	1
now	1
instructed	1
in	1
a	1
comforting	1
belief	1
in	1
future	1
life,	1
retribution,	1
recompense,	1
and	1
consolation?	1
What	1
evil	1
and	1
error	1
are	1
there	1
in	1
it,	1
if	1
people	1
were	1
dying	1
of	1
disease	1
without	1
help	1
while	1
material	1
assistance	1
could	1
so	1
easily	1
be	1
rendered,	1
and	1
I	1
supplied	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
doctor,	1
a	1
hospital,	1
and	1
an	1
asylum	1
for	1
the	1
aged?	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
palpable,	1
unquestionable	1
good	1
if	1
a	1
peasant,	1
or	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
baby,	1
has	1
no	1
rest	1
day	1
or	1
night	1
and	1
I	1
give	1
them	1
rest	1
and	1
leisure?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
hurrying	1
and	1
lisping.	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
though	1
badly	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
extent;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
something	1
toward	1
it	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
action,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
that,	1
you	1
can't	1
make	1
me	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
yourself.	1
And	1
the	1
main	1
thing	1
is,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"that	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
know	1
for	1
certain,	1
that	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
doing	1
this	1
good	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
sure	1
happiness	1
in	1
life."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
if	1
you	1
put	1
it	1
like	1
that	1
it's	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
matter,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"I	1
build	1
a	1
house	1
and	1
lay	1
out	1
a	1
garden,	1
and	1
you	1
build	1
hospitals.	1
The	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
pastime.	1
But	1
what's	1
right	1
and	1
what's	1
good	1
must	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
one	1
who	1
knows	1
all,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
us.	1
Well,	1
you	1
want	1
an	1
argument,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"come	1
on	1
then."	1
	1
They	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
entrance	1
porch	1
which	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
veranda.	1
	1
"Come,	1
let's	1
argue	1
then,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"You	1
talk	1
of	1
schools,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
crooking	1
a	1
finger,	1
"education	1
and	1
so	1
forth;	1
that	1
is,	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
raise	1
him"	1
(pointing	1
to	1
a	1
peasant	1
who	1
passed	1
by	1
them	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap)	1
"from	1
his	1
animal	1
condition	1
and	1
awaken	1
in	1
him	1
spiritual	1
needs,	1
while	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
animal	1
happiness	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
happiness	1
possible,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
deprive	1
him	1
of.	1
I	1
envy	1
him,	1
but	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
without	1
giving	1
him	1
my	1
means.	1
Then	1
you	1
say,	1
'lighten	1
his	1
toil.'	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
it,	1
physical	1
labor	1
is	1
as	1
essential	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
existence,	1
as	1
mental	1
activity	1
is	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
me.	1
You	1
can't	1
help	1
thinking.	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
after	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
thoughts	1
come	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
sleep	1
but	1
toss	1
about	1
till	1
dawn,	1
because	1
I	1
think	1
and	1
can't	1
help	1
thinking,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
can't	1
help	1
plowing	1
and	1
mowing;	1
if	1
he	1
didn't,	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
drink	1
shop	1
or	1
fall	1
ill.	1
Just	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
his	1
terrible	1
physical	1
labor	1
but	1
should	1
die	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
week,	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
my	1
physical	1
idleness,	1
but	1
would	1
grow	1
fat	1
and	1
die.	1
The	1
third	1
thing--what	1
else	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
talked	1
about?"	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
crooked	1
a	1
third	1
finger.	1
"Ah,	1
yes,	1
hospitals,	1
medicine.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
fit,	1
he	1
is	1
dying,	1
and	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
bleed	1
him	1
and	1
patch	1
him	1
up.	1
He	1
will	1
drag	1
about	1
as	1
a	1
cripple,	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
everybody,	1
for	1
another	1
ten	1
years.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
far	1
easier	1
and	1
simpler	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
die.	1
Others	1
are	1
being	1
born	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
plenty	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
it	1
is.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
different	1
if	1
you	1
grudged	1
losing	1
a	1
laborer--that's	1
how	1
I	1
regard	1
him--but	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
cure	1
him	1
from	1
love	1
of	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
that.	1
And	1
besides,	1
what	1
a	1
notion	1
that	1
medicine	1
ever	1
cured	1
anyone!	1
Killed	1
them,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
he,	1
frowning	1
angrily	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
expressed	1
his	1
ideas	1
so	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
he	1
had	1
reflected	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
readily	1
and	1
rapidly	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
talked	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
His	1
glance	1
became	1
more	1
animated	1
as	1
his	1
conclusions	1
became	1
more	1
hopeless.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
is	1
dreadful,	1
dreadful!"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
how	1
one	1
can	1
live	1
with	1
such	1
ideas.	1
I	1
had	1
such	1
moments	1
myself	1
not	1
long	1
ago,	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
when	1
traveling,	1
but	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
I	1
collapsed	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
live	1
at	1
all--everything	1
seems	1
hateful	1
to	1
me...	1
myself	1
most	1
of	1
all.	1
Then	1
I	1
don't	1
eat,	1
don't	1
wash...	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
with	1
you?..."	1
	1
"Why	1
not	1
wash?	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
cleanly,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew;	1
"on	1
the	1
contrary	1
one	1
must	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
one's	1
life	1
as	1
pleasant	1
as	1
possible.	1
I'm	1
alive,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
fault,	1
so	1
I	1
must	1
live	1
out	1
my	1
life	1
as	1
best	1
I	1
can	1
without	1
hurting	1
others."	1
	1
"But	1
with	1
such	1
ideas	1
what	1
motive	1
have	1
you	1
for	1
living?	1
One	1
would	1
sit	1
without	1
moving,	1
undertaking	1
nothing...."	1
	1
"Life	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
leaves	1
one	1
no	1
peace.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
thankful	1
to	1
do	1
nothing,	1
but	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
local	1
nobility	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
choose	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
marshal;	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
necessary	1
qualifications	1
for	1
it--the	1
kind	1
of	1
good-natured,	1
fussy	1
shallowness	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
position.	1
Then	1
there's	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
built	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
nook	1
of	1
one's	1
own	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
be	1
quiet.	1
And	1
now	1
there's	1
this	1
recruiting."	1
	1
"Why	1
aren't	1
you	1
serving	1
in	1
the	1
army?"	1
	1
"After	1
Austerlitz!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gloomily.	1
"No,	1
thank	1
you	1
very	1
much!	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
myself	1
not	1
to	1
serve	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
active	1
Russian	1
army.	1
And	1
I	1
won't--not	1
even	1
if	1
Bonaparte	1
were	1
here	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
threatening	1
Bald	1
Hills--even	1
then	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
serve	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army!	1
Well,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
recovering	1
his	1
composure,	1
"now	1
there's	1
this	1
recruiting.	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
chief	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
Third	1
District,	1
and	1
my	1
only	1
way	1
of	1
avoiding	1
active	1
service	1
is	1
to	1
serve	1
under	1
him."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
are	1
serving?"	1
	1
"I	1
am."	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
a	1
little	1
while.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
serve?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
for	1
this	1
reason!	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
time.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
growing	1
old,	1
and	1
though	1
not	1
exactly	1
cruel	1
he	1
has	1
too	1
energetic	1
a	1
character.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
unlimited	1
power	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
terrible,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
has	1
this	1
authority	1
of	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
of	1
the	1
recruiting,	1
granted	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
two	1
hours	1
late	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
paymaster's	1
clerk	1
at	1
Yukhnovna	1
hanged,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"So	1
I	1
am	1
serving	1
because	1
I	1
alone	1
have	1
any	1
influence	1
with	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
can	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
actions	1
which	1
would	1
torment	1
him	1
afterwards."	1
	1
"Well,	1
there	1
you	1
see!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
imagine,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued.	1
"I	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
do	1
not,	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
care	1
about	1
that	1
scoundrel	1
of	1
a	1
clerk	1
who	1
had	1
stolen	1
some	1
boots	1
from	1
the	1
recruits;	1
I	1
should	1
even	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
hanged,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
my	1
father--that	1
again	1
is	1
for	1
myself."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
His	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
feverishly	1
while	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
actions	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
his	1
neighbor.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
liberate	1
your	1
serfs,"	1
he	1
continued;	1
"that	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
you--I	1
don't	1
suppose	1
you	1
ever	1
had	1
anyone	1
flogged	1
or	1
sent	1
to	1
Siberia--and	1
still	1
less	1
for	1
your	1
serfs.	1
If	1
they	1
are	1
beaten,	1
flogged,	1
or	1
sent	1
to	1
Siberia,	1
I	1
don't	1
suppose	1
they	1
are	1
any	1
the	1
worse	1
off.	1
In	1
Siberia	1
they	1
lead	1
the	1
same	1
animal	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
stripes	1
on	1
their	1
bodies	1
heal,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
happy	1
as	1
before.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
proprietors	1
who	1
perish	1
morally,	1
bring	1
remorse	1
upon	1
themselves,	1
stifle	1
this	1
remorse	1
and	1
grow	1
callous,	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
inflict	1
punishments	1
justly	1
and	1
unjustly.	1
It	1
is	1
those	1
people	1
I	1
pity,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
sake	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
liberate	1
the	1
serfs.	1
You	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
seen,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
how	1
good	1
men	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
those	1
traditions	1
of	1
unlimited	1
power,	1
in	1
time	1
when	1
they	1
grow	1
more	1
irritable,	1
become	1
cruel	1
and	1
harsh,	1
are	1
conscious	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
cannot	1
restrain	1
themselves	1
and	1
grow	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
miserable."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
spoke	1
so	1
earnestly	1
that	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
that	1
these	1
thoughts	1
had	1
been	1
suggested	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
by	1
his	1
father's	1
case.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"So	1
that's	1
what	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
for--human	1
dignity,	1
peace	1
of	1
mind,	1
purity,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
serfs'	1
backs	1
and	1
foreheads,	1
which,	1
beat	1
and	1
shave	1
as	1
you	1
may,	1
always	1
remain	1
the	1
same	1
backs	1
and	1
foreheads."	1
	1
"No,	1
no!	1
A	1
thousand	1
times	1
no!	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
agree	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Pierre	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
carriage	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
broke	1
the	1
silence	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
remarks	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper.	1
	1
Pointing	1
to	1
the	1
fields,	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
improvements	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
in	1
his	1
husbandry.	1
	1
Pierre	1
remained	1
gloomily	1
silent,	1
answering	1
in	1
monosyllables	1
and	1
apparently	1
immersed	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
thinking	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
unhappy,	1
had	1
gone	1
astray,	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
true	1
light,	1
and	1
that	1
he,	1
Pierre,	1
ought	1
to	1
aid,	1
enlighten,	1
and	1
raise	1
him.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
say,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
one	1
word,	1
one	1
argument,	1
would	1
upset	1
all	1
his	1
teaching,	1
and	1
he	1
shrank	1
from	1
beginning,	1
afraid	1
of	1
exposing	1
to	1
possible	1
ridicule	1
what	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
precious	1
and	1
sacred.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so?"	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
began,	1
lowering	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looking	1
like	1
a	1
bull	1
about	1
to	1
charge,	1
"why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
You	1
should	1
not	1
think	1
so."	1
	1
"Think?	1
What	1
about?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
surprise.	1
	1
"About	1
life,	1
about	1
man's	1
destiny.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
so.	1
I	1
myself	1
thought	1
like	1
that,	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
saved	1
me?	1
Freemasonry!	1
No,	1
don't	1
smile.	1
Freemasonry	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
religious	1
ceremonial	1
sect,	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was:	1
Freemasonry	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
best,	1
the	1
eternal,	1
aspects	1
of	1
humanity."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
Freemasonry	1
as	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
Freemasonry	1
is	1
the	1
teaching	1
of	1
Christianity	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
State	1
and	1
Church,	1
a	1
teaching	1
of	1
equality,	1
brotherhood,	1
and	1
love.	1
	1
"Only	1
our	1
holy	1
brotherhood	1
has	1
the	1
real	1
meaning	1
of	1
life,	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
a	1
dream,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Understand,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
that	1
outside	1
this	1
union	1
all	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
deceit	1
and	1
falsehood	1
and	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
nothing	1
is	1
left	1
for	1
an	1
intelligent	1
and	1
good	1
man	1
but	1
to	1
live	1
out	1
his	1
life,	1
like	1
you,	1
merely	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
harm	1
others.	1
But	1
make	1
our	1
fundamental	1
convictions	1
your	1
own,	1
join	1
our	1
brotherhood,	1
give	1
yourself	1
up	1
to	1
us,	1
let	1
yourself	1
be	1
guided,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
feel	1
yourself,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
myself,	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
vast	1
invisible	1
chain	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
hidden	1
in	1
heaven,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looking	1
straight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
words.	1
More	1
than	1
once,	1
when	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
prevented	1
his	1
catching	1
what	1
Pierre	1
said,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
repeat	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
peculiar	1
glow	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
eyes	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
silence,	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
would	1
not	1
interrupt	1
him	1
or	1
laugh	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
They	1
reached	1
a	1
river	1
that	1
had	1
overflowed	1
its	1
banks	1
and	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
cross	1
by	1
ferry.	1
While	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
horses	1
were	1
being	1
placed	1
on	1
it,	1
they	1
also	1
stepped	1
on	1
the	1
raft.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
leaning	1
his	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
raft	1
railing,	1
gazed	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
flooding	1
waters	1
glittering	1
in	1
the	1
setting	1
sun.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it?"	1
Pierre	1
asked.	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
silent?"	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
I	1
think	1
about	1
it?	1
I	1
am	1
listening	1
to	1
you.	1
It's	1
all	1
very	1
well....	1
You	1
say:	1
join	1
our	1
brotherhood	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
life,	1
the	1
destiny	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
laws	1
which	1
govern	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
who	1
are	1
we?	1
Men.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
everything?	1
Why	1
do	1
I	1
alone	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
see?	1
You	1
see	1
a	1
reign	1
of	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth	1
on	1
earth,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
it."	1
	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
a	1
future	1
life?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"A	1
future	1
life?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
repeated,	1
but	1
Pierre,	1
giving	1
him	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
reply,	1
took	1
the	1
repetition	1
for	1
a	1
denial,	1
the	1
more	1
readily	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
former	1
atheistic	1
convictions.	1
	1
"You	1
say	1
you	1
can't	1
see	1
a	1
reign	1
of	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth	1
on	1
earth.	1
Nor	1
could	1
I,	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
seen	1
if	1
one	1
looks	1
on	1
our	1
life	1
here	1
as	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
everything.	1
On	1
earth,	1
here	1
on	1
this	1
earth"	1
(Pierre	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
fields),	1
"there	1
is	1
no	1
truth,	1
all	1
is	1
false	1
and	1
evil;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
universe,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
kingdom	1
of	1
truth,	1
and	1
we	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
earth	1
are--eternally--children	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
universe.	1
Don't	1
I	1
feel	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
vast	1
harmonious	1
whole?	1
Don't	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
form	1
one	1
link,	1
one	1
step,	1
between	1
the	1
lower	1
and	1
higher	1
beings,	1
in	1
this	1
vast	1
harmonious	1
multitude	1
of	1
beings	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
Deity--the	1
Supreme	1
Power	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
the	1
term--is	1
manifest?	1
If	1
I	1
see,	1
clearly	1
see,	1
that	1
ladder	1
leading	1
from	1
plant	1
to	1
man,	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
breaks	1
off	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
go	1
farther	1
and	1
farther?	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
vanish,	1
since	1
nothing	1
vanishes	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
exist	1
and	1
always	1
have	1
existed.	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
beyond	1
me	1
and	1
above	1
me	1
there	1
are	1
spirits,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there	1
is	1
truth."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
Herder's	1
theory,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
can	1
convince	1
me,	1
dear	1
friend--life	1
and	1
death	1
are	1
what	1
convince.	1
What	1
convinces	1
is	1
when	1
one	1
sees	1
a	1
being	1
dear	1
to	1
one,	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
one's	1
own	1
life,	1
before	1
whom	1
one	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
right"	1
(Prince	1
Andrew's	1
voice	1
trembled	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
away),	1
"and	1
suddenly	1
that	1
being	1
is	1
seized	1
with	1
pain,	1
suffers,	1
and	1
ceases	1
to	1
exist....	1
Why?	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
answer.	1
And	1
I	1
believe	1
there	1
is....	1
That's	1
what	1
convinces,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
has	1
convinced	1
me,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"isn't	1
that	1
what	1
I'm	1
saying?"	1
	1
"No.	1
All	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
argument	1
that	1
convinces	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
life,	1
but	1
this:	1
when	1
you	1
go	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
with	1
someone	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
person	1
vanishes	1
there,	1
into	1
nowhere,	1
and	1
you	1
yourself	1
are	1
left	1
facing	1
that	1
abyss,	1
and	1
look	1
in.	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
in...."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
it	1
then!	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
there	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Someone?	1
There	1
is	1
the	1
future	1
life.	1
The	1
Someone	1
is--God."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
The	1
carriage	1
and	1
horses	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
taken	1
off,	1
onto	1
the	1
farther	1
bank,	1
and	1
reharnessed.	1
The	1
sun	1
had	1
sunk	1
half	1
below	1
the	1
horizon	1
and	1
an	1
evening	1
frost	1
was	1
starring	1
the	1
puddles	1
near	1
the	1
ferry,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
to	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
footmen,	1
coachmen,	1
and	1
ferrymen,	1
still	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
raft	1
and	1
talked.	1
	1
"If	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
future	1
life,	1
there	1
is	1
truth	1
and	1
good,	1
and	1
man's	1
highest	1
happiness	1
consists	1
in	1
striving	1
to	1
attain	1
them.	1
We	1
must	1
live,	1
we	1
must	1
love,	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
live	1
not	1
only	1
today	1
on	1
this	1
scrap	1
of	1
earth,	1
but	1
have	1
lived	1
and	1
shall	1
live	1
forever,	1
there,	1
in	1
the	1
Whole,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
sky.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stood	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
railing	1
of	1
the	1
raft	1
listening	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
he	1
gazed	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
red	1
reflection	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
gleaming	1
on	1
the	1
blue	1
waters.	1
There	1
was	1
perfect	1
stillness.	1
Pierre	1
became	1
silent.	1
The	1
raft	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
stopped	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
current	1
beat	1
softly	1
against	1
it	1
below.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
refrain	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
words,	1
whispering:	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
true,	1
believe	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
sighed,	1
and	1
glanced	1
with	1
a	1
radiant,	1
childlike,	1
tender	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
face,	1
flushed	1
and	1
rapturous,	1
but	1
yet	1
shy	1
before	1
his	1
superior	1
friend.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
if	1
it	1
only	1
were	1
so!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"However,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
on,"	1
he	1
added,	1
and,	1
stepping	1
off	1
the	1
raft,	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
to	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
pointed,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
Austerlitz	1
saw	1
that	1
high,	1
everlasting	1
sky	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
while	1
lying	1
on	1
that	1
battlefield;	1
and	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
slumbering,	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
best	1
within	1
him,	1
suddenly	1
awoke,	1
joyful	1
and	1
youthful,	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
It	1
vanished	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
customary	1
conditions	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
feeling	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
develop	1
existed	1
within	1
him.	1
His	1
meeting	1
with	1
Pierre	1
formed	1
an	1
epoch	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
life.	1
Though	1
outwardly	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
way,	1
inwardly	1
he	1
began	1
a	1
new	1
life.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
It	1
was	1
getting	1
dusk	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Pierre	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
As	1
they	1
approached	1
the	1
house,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
drew	1
Pierre's	1
attention	1
to	1
a	1
commotion	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
porch.	1
A	1
woman,	1
bent	1
with	1
age,	1
with	1
a	1
wallet	1
on	1
her	1
back,	1
and	1
a	1
short,	1
long-haired,	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
garment	1
had	1
rushed	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
carriage	1
driving	1
up.	1
Two	1
women	1
ran	1
out	1
after	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
four,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
carriage,	1
ran	1
in	1
dismay	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
back	1
porch.	1
	1
"Those	1
are	1
Mary's	1
'God's	1
folk,'"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"They	1
have	1
mistaken	1
us	1
for	1
my	1
father.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
matter	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
disobeys	1
him.	1
He	1
orders	1
these	1
pilgrims	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
away,	1
but	1
she	1
receives	1
them."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
are	1
'God's	1
folk'?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
answer.	1
The	1
servants	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
where	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
expected	1
back	1
soon.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
was	1
expected	1
back	1
any	1
minute.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
led	1
Pierre	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
apartments,	1
which	1
were	1
always	1
kept	1
in	1
perfect	1
order	1
and	1
readiness	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
house;	1
he	1
himself	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
sister,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre	1
when	1
he	1
returned.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
her	1
yet,	1
she	1
is	1
hiding	1
now,	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
'God's	1
folk.'	1
It	1
will	1
serve	1
her	1
right,	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
confused,	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
her	1
'God's	1
folk.'	1
It's	1
really	1
very	1
curious."	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
'God's	1
folk'?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Come,	1
and	1
you'll	1
see	1
for	1
yourself."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
really	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
red	1
patches	1
came	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
in.	1
In	1
her	1
snug	1
room,	1
with	1
lamps	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
icon	1
stand,	1
a	1
young	1
lad	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
nose	1
and	1
long	1
hair,	1
wearing	1
a	1
monk's	1
cassock,	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
beside	1
her,	1
behind	1
a	1
samovar.	1
Near	1
them,	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
sat	1
a	1
thin,	1
shriveled,	1
old	1
woman,	1
with	1
a	1
meek	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
childlike	1
face.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
warn	1
me?"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
with	1
mild	1
reproach,	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
before	1
her	1
pilgrims	1
like	1
a	1
hen	1
before	1
her	1
chickens.	1
	1
"Charmee	1
de	1
vous	1
voir.	1
Je	1
suis	1
tres	1
contente	1
de	1
vous	1
voir,"	1
*	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
She	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
now	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
Andrew,	1
his	1
misfortune	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
his	1
kindly,	1
simple	1
face	1
disposed	1
her	1
favorably	1
toward	1
him.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"I	1
like	1
you	1
very	1
much,	1
but	1
please	1
don't	1
laugh	1
at	1
my	1
people."	1
After	1
exchanging	1
the	1
first	1
greetings,	1
they	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
and	1
Ivanushka	1
is	1
here	1
too!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
glancing	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
pilgrim.	1
	1
"Andrew!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
imploringly.	1
"Il	1
faut	1
que	1
vous	1
sachiez	1
que	1
c'est	1
une	1
femme,"	1
*	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
au	1
nom	1
de	1
Dieu!"	1
*(2)	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
repeated.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
woman."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"For	1
heaven's	1
sake."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
ironical	1
tone	1
toward	1
the	1
pilgrims	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
helpless	1
attempts	1
to	1
protect	1
them	1
were	1
their	1
customary	1
long-established	1
relations	1
on	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
"Mais,	1
ma	1
bonne	1
amie,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"vous	1
devriez	1
au	1
contraire	1
m'être	1
reconnaissante	1
de	1
ce	1
que	1
j'explique	1
a	1
Pierre	1
votre	1
intimité	1
avec	1
ce	1
jeune	1
homme."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
ought	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
be	1
grateful	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
explaining	1
to	1
Pierre	1
your	1
intimacy	1
with	1
this	1
young	1
man."	1
	1
"Really?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
gazing	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
with	1
curiosity	1
and	1
seriousness	1
(for	1
which	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
specially	1
grateful	1
to	1
him)	1
into	1
Ivanushka's	1
face,	1
who,	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
being	1
spoken	1
about,	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
them	1
all	1
with	1
crafty	1
eyes.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
embarrassment	1
on	1
her	1
people's	1
account	1
was	1
quite	1
unnecessary.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
abashed.	1
The	1
old	1
woman,	1
lowering	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
casting	1
side	1
glances	1
at	1
the	1
newcomers,	1
had	1
turned	1
her	1
cup	1
upside	1
down	1
and	1
placed	1
a	1
nibbled	1
bit	1
of	1
sugar	1
beside	1
it,	1
and	1
sat	1
quietly	1
in	1
her	1
armchair,	1
though	1
hoping	1
to	1
be	1
offered	1
another	1
cup	1
of	1
tea.	1
Ivanushka,	1
sipping	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
saucer,	1
looked	1
with	1
sly	1
womanish	1
eyes	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
men.	1
	1
"Where	1
have	1
you	1
been?	1
To	1
Kiev?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
woman.	1
	1
"I	1
have,	1
good	1
sir,"	1
she	1
answered	1
garrulously.	1
"Just	1
at	1
Christmastime	1
I	1
was	1
deemed	1
worthy	1
to	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
and	1
heavenly	1
sacrament	1
at	1
the	1
shrine	1
of	1
the	1
saint.	1
And	1
now	1
I'm	1
from	1
Kolyazin,	1
master,	1
where	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
wonderful	1
blessing	1
has	1
been	1
revealed."	1
	1
"And	1
was	1
Ivanushka	1
with	1
you?"	1
	1
"I	1
go	1
by	1
myself,	1
benefactor,"	1
said	1
Ivanushka,	1
trying	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
a	1
bass	1
voice.	1
"I	1
only	1
came	1
across	1
Pelageya	1
in	1
Yukhnovo..."	1
	1
Pelageya	1
interrupted	1
her	1
companion;	1
she	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
"In	1
Kolyazin,	1
master,	1
a	1
wonderful	1
blessing	1
has	1
been	1
revealed."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
Some	1
new	1
relics?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
do	1
leave	1
off,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Don't	1
tell	1
him,	1
Pelageya."	1
	1
"No...	1
why	1
not,	1
my	1
dear,	1
why	1
shouldn't	1
I?	1
I	1
like	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
kind,	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
God's	1
chosen,	1
he's	1
a	1
benefactor,	1
he	1
once	1
gave	1
me	1
ten	1
rubles,	1
I	1
remember.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
Kiev,	1
Crazy	1
Cyril	1
says	1
to	1
me	1
(he's	1
one	1
of	1
God's	1
own	1
and	1
goes	1
barefoot	1
summer	1
and	1
winter),	1
he	1
says,	1
'Why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
place?	1
Go	1
to	1
Kolyazin	1
where	1
a	1
wonder-working	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Mother	1
of	1
God	1
has	1
been	1
revealed.'	1
On	1
hearing	1
those	1
words	1
I	1
said	1
good-by	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
folk	1
and	1
went."	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent,	1
only	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
woman	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
measured	1
tones,	1
drawing	1
in	1
her	1
breath.	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
come,	1
master,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
say	1
to	1
me:	1
'A	1
great	1
blessing	1
has	1
been	1
revealed,	1
holy	1
oil	1
trickles	1
from	1
the	1
cheeks	1
of	1
our	1
blessed	1
Mother,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Virgin	1
Mother	1
of	1
God'...."	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,	1
you	1
can	1
tell	1
us	1
afterwards,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
flushing.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
ask	1
her,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
it	1
yourselves?"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
master,	1
I	1
was	1
found	1
worthy.	1
Such	1
a	1
brightness	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
like	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
blessed	1
Mother's	1
cheek	1
it	1
drops	1
and	1
drops...."	1
	1
"But,	1
dear	1
me,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
fraud!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
naively,	1
who	1
had	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
the	1
pilgrim.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
master,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
saying?"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
horrified	1
Pelageya,	1
turning	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
for	1
support.	1
	1
"They	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
people,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
	1
"Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
woman,	1
crossing	1
herself.	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
so,	1
master!	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
believe,	1
and	1
said,	1
'The	1
monks	1
cheat,'	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he'd	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
went	1
blind.	1
And	1
he	1
dreamed	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Virgin	1
Mother	1
of	1
the	1
Kiev	1
catacombs	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
'Believe	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
whole.'	1
So	1
he	1
begged:	1
'Take	1
me	1
to	1
her,	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
her.'	1
It's	1
the	1
real	1
truth	1
I'm	1
telling	1
you,	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
myself.	1
So	1
he	1
was	1
brought,	1
quite	1
blind,	1
straight	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
goes	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
falls	1
down	1
and	1
says,	1
'Make	1
me	1
whole,'	1
says	1
he,	1
'and	1
I'll	1
give	1
thee	1
what	1
the	1
Tsar	1
bestowed	1
on	1
me.'	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
myself,	1
master,	1
the	1
star	1
is	1
fixed	1
into	1
the	1
icon.	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
He	1
received	1
his	1
sight!	1
It's	1
a	1
sin	1
to	1
speak	1
so.	1
God	1
will	1
punish	1
you,"	1
she	1
said	1
admonishingly,	1
turning	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
the	1
star	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
icon?"	1
Pierre	1
asked.	1
	1
"And	1
was	1
the	1
Holy	1
Mother	1
promoted	1
to	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
general?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Pelageya	1
suddenly	1
grew	1
quite	1
pale	1
and	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
master,	1
master,	1
what	1
a	1
sin!	1
And	1
you	1
who	1
have	1
a	1
son!"	1
she	1
began,	1
her	1
pallor	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
vivid	1
red.	1
"Master,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
said?	1
God	1
forgive	1
you!"	1
And	1
she	1
crossed	1
herself.	1
"Lord	1
forgive	1
him!	1
My	1
dear,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean?..."	1
she	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
almost	1
crying,	1
began	1
to	1
arrange	1
her	1
wallet.	1
She	1
evidently	1
felt	1
frightened	1
and	1
ashamed	1
to	1
have	1
accepted	1
charity	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
such	1
things	1
could	1
be	1
said,	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
now	1
to	1
forgo	1
the	1
charity	1
of	1
this	1
house.	1
	1
"Now,	1
why	1
need	1
you	1
do	1
it?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me?..."	1
	1
"Come,	1
Pelageya,	1
I	1
was	1
joking,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Princesse,	1
ma	1
parole,	1
je	1
n'ai	1
pas	1
voulu	1
l'offenser.	1
*	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
anything,	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
joking,"	1
he	1
said,	1
smiling	1
shyly	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
efface	1
his	1
offense.	1
"It	1
was	1
all	1
my	1
fault,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
was	1
only	1
joking."	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Princess,	1
on	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
offend	1
her."	1
	1
Pelageya	1
stopped	1
doubtfully,	1
but	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
sincere	1
penitence,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
glanced	1
so	1
meekly	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
gradually	1
reassured.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
The	1
pilgrim	1
woman	1
was	1
appeased	1
and,	1
being	1
encouraged	1
to	1
talk,	1
gave	1
a	1
long	1
account	1
of	1
Father	1
Amphilochus,	1
who	1
led	1
so	1
holy	1
a	1
life	1
that	1
his	1
hands	1
smelled	1
of	1
incense,	1
and	1
how	1
on	1
her	1
last	1
visit	1
to	1
Kiev	1
some	1
monks	1
she	1
knew	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
catacombs,	1
and	1
how	1
she,	1
taking	1
some	1
dried	1
bread	1
with	1
her,	1
had	1
spent	1
two	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
catacombs	1
with	1
the	1
saints.	1
"I'd	1
pray	1
awhile	1
to	1
one,	1
ponder	1
awhile,	1
then	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
another.	1
I'd	1
sleep	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
go	1
and	1
kiss	1
the	1
relics,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
peace	1
all	1
around,	1
such	1
blessedness,	1
that	1
one	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
out,	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
heaven	1
again."	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
attentively	1
and	1
seriously.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
then,	1
leaving	1
"God's	1
folk"	1
to	1
finish	1
their	1
tea,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
took	1
Pierre	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
kind,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
really	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
hurt	1
her	1
feelings.	1
I	1
understand	1
them	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
greatest	1
respect	1
for	1
them."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
silently	1
and	1
smiled	1
affectionately.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
you	1
see,	1
and	1
am	1
as	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
brother,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
find	1
Andrew?"	1
she	1
added	1
hurriedly,	1
not	1
giving	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
her	1
affectionate	1
words.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
anxious	1
about	1
him.	1
His	1
health	1
was	1
better	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
but	1
last	1
spring	1
his	1
wound	1
reopened	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
for	1
a	1
cure.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
very	1
much	1
afraid	1
for	1
him	1
spiritually.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
character	1
like	1
us	1
women	1
who,	1
when	1
we	1
suffer,	1
can	1
weep	1
away	1
our	1
sorrows.	1
He	1
keeps	1
it	1
all	1
within	1
him.	1
Today	1
he	1
is	1
cheerful	1
and	1
in	1
good	1
spirits,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
your	1
visit--he	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
like	1
that.	1
If	1
you	1
could	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
abroad.	1
He	1
needs	1
activity,	1
and	1
this	1
quiet	1
regular	1
life	1
is	1
very	1
bad	1
for	1
him.	1
Others	1
don't	1
notice	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
it."	1
	1
Toward	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
the	1
men	1
servants	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
hearing	1
the	1
bells	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
carriage	1
approaching.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Pierre	1
also	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
"Who's	1
that?"	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
noticing	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
Very	1
glad!	1
Kiss	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
having	1
learned	1
who	1
the	1
young	1
stranger	1
was.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
and	1
very	1
gracious	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Before	1
supper,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
study,	1
found	1
him	1
disputing	1
hotly	1
with	1
his	1
visitor.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
maintaining	1
that	1
a	1
time	1
would	1
come	1
when	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
wars.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
disputed	1
it	1
chaffingly,	1
but	1
without	1
getting	1
angry.	1
	1
"Drain	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
men's	1
veins	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
water	1
instead,	1
then	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
war!	1
Old	1
women's	1
nonsense--old	1
women's	1
nonsense!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
patted	1
Pierre	1
affectionately	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
evidently	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
was	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
papers	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
town.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
business.	1
	1
"The	1
marshal,	1
a	1
Count	1
Rostov,	1
hasn't	1
sent	1
half	1
his	1
contingent.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
town	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
invite	1
me	1
to	1
dinner--I	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
pretty	1
dinner!...	1
And	1
there,	1
look	1
at	1
this....	1
Well,	1
my	1
boy,"	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
went	1
on,	1
addressing	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
patting	1
Pierre	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
"A	1
fine	1
fellow--your	1
friend--I	1
like	1
him!	1
He	1
stirs	1
me	1
up.	1
Another	1
says	1
clever	1
things	1
and	1
one	1
doesn't	1
care	1
to	1
listen,	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
talks	1
rubbish	1
yet	1
stirs	1
an	1
old	1
fellow	1
up.	1
Well,	1
go!	1
Get	1
along!	1
Perhaps	1
I'll	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
supper.	1
We'll	1
have	1
another	1
dispute.	1
Make	1
friends	1
with	1
my	1
little	1
fool,	1
Princess	1
Mary,"	1
he	1
shouted	1
after	1
Pierre,	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Only	1
now,	1
on	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
did	1
Pierre	1
fully	1
realize	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
charm	1
of	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
That	1
charm	1
was	1
not	1
expressed	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
household.	1
With	1
the	1
stern	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
the	1
gentle,	1
timid	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
scarcely	1
known	1
them,	1
Pierre	1
at	1
once	1
felt	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
friend.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
fond	1
of	1
him	1
already.	1
Not	1
only	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
won	1
by	1
his	1
gentleness	1
with	1
the	1
pilgrims,	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
most	1
radiant	1
looks,	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
one-year-old	1
"Prince	1
Nicholas"	1
(as	1
his	1
grandfather	1
called	1
him)	1
smiled	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
pleasant	1
smiles	1
when	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
supper;	1
this	1
was	1
evidently	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
account.	1
And	1
during	1
the	1
two	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
visit	1
he	1
was	1
extremely	1
kind	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
visit	1
them	1
again.	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
met	1
together,	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
opinions	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
people	1
always	1
do	1
after	1
a	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
has	1
left,	1
but	1
as	1
seldom	1
happens,	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
anything	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
good	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
When	1
returning	1
from	1
his	1
leave,	1
Rostov	1
felt,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
how	1
close	1
was	1
the	1
bond	1
that	1
united	1
him	1
to	1
Denisov	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment.	1
	1
On	1
approaching	1
it,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
approaching	1
his	1
home	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
first	1
hussar	1
with	1
the	1
unbuttoned	1
uniform	1
of	1
his	1
regiment,	1
when	1
he	1
recognized	1
red-haired	1
Dementyev	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
picket	1
ropes	1
of	1
the	1
roan	1
horses,	1
when	1
Lavrushka	1
gleefully	1
shouted	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
"The	1
count	1
has	1
come!"	1
and	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
asleep	1
on	1
his	1
bed,	1
ran	1
all	1
disheveled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mud	1
hut	1
to	1
embrace	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
collected	1
round	1
to	1
greet	1
the	1
new	1
arrival,	1
Rostov	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
as	1
when	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
choked	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak.	1
The	1
regiment	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
home,	1
and	1
as	1
unalterably	1
dear	1
and	1
precious	1
as	1
his	1
parents'	1
house.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
reported	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
reassigned	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
squadron,	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
duty	1
and	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
foraging,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
again	1
entered	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
felt	1
himself	1
deprived	1
of	1
liberty	1
and	1
bound	1
in	1
one	1
narrow,	1
unchanging	1
frame,	1
he	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
sense	1
of	1
peace,	1
of	1
moral	1
support,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
sense	1
of	1
being	1
at	1
home	1
here	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
place,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
under	1
the	1
parental	1
roof.	1
But	1
here	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
turmoil	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
large,	1
where	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
his	1
right	1
place	1
and	1
took	1
mistaken	1
decisions;	1
here	1
was	1
no	1
Sonya	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
ought,	1
or	1
ought	1
not,	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
explanation;	1
here	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
going	1
there	1
or	1
not	1
going	1
there;	1
here	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
twenty-four	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
ways;	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
innumerable	1
crowd	1
of	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
not	1
one	1
was	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
farther	1
from	1
him	1
than	1
another;	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
uncertain	1
and	1
undefined	1
money	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
recall	1
that	1
terrible	1
loss	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
Here,	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
all	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
simple.	1
The	1
whole	1
world	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
unequal	1
parts:	1
one,	1
our	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment;	1
the	1
other,	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
was	1
no	1
concern	1
of	1
his.	1
In	1
the	1
regiment,	1
everything	1
was	1
definite:	1
who	1
was	1
lieutenant,	1
who	1
captain,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
fellow,	1
who	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
comrade.	1
The	1
canteenkeeper	1
gave	1
one	1
credit,	1
one's	1
pay	1
came	1
every	1
four	1
months,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
think	1
out	1
or	1
decide,	1
you	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
that	1
was	1
considered	1
bad	1
in	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment	1
and,	1
when	1
given	1
an	1
order,	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
clearly,	1
distinctly,	1
and	1
definitely	1
ordered--and	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well.	1
	1
Having	1
once	1
more	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
definite	1
conditions	1
of	1
this	1
regimental	1
life,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
the	1
joy	1
and	1
relief	1
a	1
tired	1
man	1
feels	1
on	1
lying	1
down	1
to	1
rest.	1
Life	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
during	1
this	1
campaign,	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
pleasanter	1
for	1
him,	1
because,	1
after	1
his	1
loss	1
to	1
Dolokhov	1
(for	1
which,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
family's	1
efforts	1
to	1
console	1
him,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
forgive	1
himself),	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
his	1
fault	1
by	1
serving,	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
before,	1
but	1
really	1
well,	1
and	1
by	1
being	1
a	1
perfectly	1
first-rate	1
comrade	1
and	1
officer--in	1
a	1
word,	1
a	1
splendid	1
man	1
altogether,	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
seemed	1
so	1
difficult	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
so	1
possible	1
in	1
the	1
regiment.	1
	1
After	1
his	1
losses,	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
pay	1
back	1
his	1
debt	1
to	1
his	1
parents	1
in	1
five	1
years.	1
He	1
received	1
ten	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year,	1
but	1
now	1
resolved	1
to	1
take	1
only	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
rest	1
to	1
repay	1
the	1
debt	1
to	1
his	1
parents.	1
	1
Our	1
army,	1
after	1
repeated	1
retreats	1
and	1
advances	1
and	1
battles	1
at	1
Pultusk	1
and	1
Preussisch-Eylau,	1
was	1
concentrated	1
near	1
Bartenstein.	1
It	1
was	1
awaiting	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
campaign.	1
	1
The	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment,	1
belonging	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
had	1
served	1
in	1
the	1
1805	1
campaign,	1
had	1
been	1
recruiting	1
up	1
to	1
strength	1
in	1
Russia,	1
and	1
arrived	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
actions	1
of	1
the	1
campaign.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
neither	1
at	1
Pultusk	1
nor	1
at	1
Preussisch-Eylau	1
and,	1
when	1
it	1
joined	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
was	1
attached	1
to	1
Platov's	1
division.	1
	1
Platov's	1
division	1
was	1
acting	1
independently	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
army.	1
Several	1
times	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment	1
had	1
exchanged	1
shots	1
with	1
the	1
enemy,	1
had	1
taken	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
once	1
had	1
even	1
captured	1
Marshal	1
Oudinot's	1
carriages.	1
In	1
April	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
were	1
stationed	1
immovably	1
for	1
some	1
weeks	1
near	1
a	1
totally	1
ruined	1
and	1
deserted	1
German	1
village.	1
	1
A	1
thaw	1
had	1
set	1
in,	1
it	1
was	1
muddy	1
and	1
cold,	1
the	1
ice	1
on	1
the	1
river	1
broke,	1
and	1
the	1
roads	1
became	1
impassable.	1
For	1
days	1
neither	1
provisions	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
nor	1
fodder	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
issued.	1
As	1
no	1
transports	1
could	1
arrive,	1
the	1
men	1
dispersed	1
about	1
the	1
abandoned	1
and	1
deserted	1
villages,	1
searching	1
for	1
potatoes,	1
but	1
found	1
few	1
even	1
of	1
these.	1
	1
Everything	1
had	1
been	1
eaten	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
had	1
all	1
fled--if	1
any	1
remained,	1
they	1
were	1
worse	1
than	1
beggars	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
could	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
them;	1
even	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
usually	1
pitiless	1
enough,	1
instead	1
of	1
taking	1
anything	1
from	1
them,	1
often	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
their	1
rations.	1
	1
The	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment	1
had	1
had	1
only	1
two	1
men	1
wounded	1
in	1
action,	1
but	1
had	1
lost	1
nearly	1
half	1
its	1
men	1
from	1
hunger	1
and	1
sickness.	1
In	1
the	1
hospitals,	1
death	1
was	1
so	1
certain	1
that	1
soldiers	1
suffering	1
from	1
fever,	1
or	1
the	1
swelling	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
bad	1
food,	1
preferred	1
to	1
remain	1
on	1
duty,	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
drag	1
their	1
legs	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
hospitals.	1
When	1
spring	1
came	1
on,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
found	1
a	1
plant	1
just	1
showing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
asparagus,	1
which,	1
for	1
some	1
reason,	1
they	1
called	1
"Mashka's	1
sweet	1
root."	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
bitter,	1
but	1
they	1
wandered	1
about	1
the	1
fields	1
seeking	1
it	1
and	1
dug	1
it	1
out	1
with	1
their	1
sabers	1
and	1
ate	1
it,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
ordered	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
noxious	1
plant.	1
That	1
spring	1
a	1
new	1
disease	1
broke	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
a	1
swelling	1
of	1
the	1
arms,	1
legs,	1
and	1
face,	1
which	1
the	1
doctors	1
attributed	1
to	1
eating	1
this	1
root.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
squadron	1
fed	1
chiefly	1
on	1
"Mashka's	1
sweet	1
root,"	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
week	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
biscuits	1
were	1
being	1
doled	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
pound	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
potatoes	1
received	1
had	1
sprouted	1
and	1
frozen.	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
also	1
had	1
been	1
fed	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
on	1
straw	1
from	1
the	1
thatched	1
roofs	1
and	1
had	1
become	1
terribly	1
thin,	1
though	1
still	1
covered	1
with	1
tufts	1
of	1
felty	1
winter	1
hair.	1
	1
Despite	1
this	1
destitution,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
went	1
on	1
living	1
just	1
as	1
usual.	1
Despite	1
their	1
pale	1
swollen	1
faces	1
and	1
tattered	1
uniforms,	1
the	1
hussars	1
formed	1
line	1
for	1
roll	1
call,	1
kept	1
things	1
in	1
order,	1
groomed	1
their	1
horses,	1
polished	1
their	1
arms,	1
brought	1
in	1
straw	1
from	1
the	1
thatched	1
roofs	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
fodder,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
dine	1
round	1
the	1
caldrons	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
hungry,	1
joking	1
about	1
their	1
nasty	1
food	1
and	1
their	1
hunger.	1
As	1
usual,	1
in	1
their	1
spare	1
time,	1
they	1
lit	1
bonfires,	1
steamed	1
themselves	1
before	1
them	1
naked;	1
smoked,	1
picked	1
out	1
and	1
baked	1
sprouting	1
rotten	1
potatoes,	1
told	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
stories	1
of	1
Potemkin's	1
and	1
Suvorov's	1
campaigns,	1
or	1
to	1
legends	1
of	1
Alesha	1
the	1
Sly,	1
or	1
the	1
priest's	1
laborer	1
Mikolka.	1
	1
The	1
officers,	1
as	1
usual,	1
lived	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes	1
in	1
the	1
roofless,	1
half-	1
ruined	1
houses.	1
The	1
seniors	1
tried	1
to	1
collect	1
straw	1
and	1
potatoes	1
and,	1
in	1
general,	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
men.	1
The	1
younger	1
ones	1
occupied	1
themselves	1
as	1
before,	1
some	1
playing	1
cards	1
(there	1
was	1
plenty	1
of	1
money,	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
food),	1
some	1
with	1
more	1
innocent	1
games,	1
such	1
as	1
quoits	1
and	1
skittles.	1
The	1
general	1
trend	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
was	1
rarely	1
spoken	1
of,	1
partly	1
because	1
nothing	1
certain	1
was	1
known	1
about	1
it,	1
partly	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
vague	1
feeling	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
main	1
it	1
was	1
going	1
badly.	1
	1
Rostov	1
lived,	1
as	1
before,	1
with	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
since	1
their	1
furlough	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
more	1
friendly	1
than	1
ever.	1
Denisov	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
Rostov's	1
family,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
tender	1
friendship	1
his	1
commander	1
showed	1
him,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
elder	1
hussar's	1
luckless	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
played	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
strengthening	1
their	1
friendship.	1
Denisov	1
evidently	1
tried	1
to	1
expose	1
Rostov	1
to	1
danger	1
as	1
seldom	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
action	1
greeted	1
his	1
safe	1
return	1
with	1
evident	1
joy.	1
On	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
foraging	1
expeditions,	1
in	1
a	1
deserted	1
and	1
ruined	1
village	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
provisions,	1
Rostov	1
found	1
a	1
family	1
consisting	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
Pole	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
with	1
an	1
infant	1
in	1
arms.	1
They	1
were	1
half	1
clad,	1
hungry,	1
too	1
weak	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
obtaining	1
a	1
conveyance.	1
Rostov	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
quarters,	1
placed	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
lodging,	1
and	1
kept	1
them	1
for	1
some	1
weeks	1
while	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
recovering.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
comrades,	1
talking	1
of	1
women,	1
began	1
chaffing	1
Rostov,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
wily	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
thing	1
if	1
he	1
introduced	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
pretty	1
Polish	1
girl	1
he	1
had	1
saved.	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
joke	1
as	1
an	1
insult,	1
flared	1
up,	1
and	1
said	1
such	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
Denisov	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
duel.	1
When	1
the	1
officer	1
had	1
gone	1
away,	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
what	1
Rostov's	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
Polish	1
girl	1
might	1
be,	1
began	1
to	1
upbraid	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
quickness	1
of	1
temper,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
replied:	1
	1
"Say	1
what	1
you	1
like....	1
She	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
sister	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
it	1
offended	1
me...	1
because...	1
well,	1
for	1
that	1
reason...."	1
	1
Denisov	1
patted	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
began	1
rapidly	1
pacing	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
way	1
at	1
moments	1
of	1
deep	1
feeling.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
a	1
mad	1
bweed	1
you	1
Wostovs	1
are!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
noticed	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
In	1
April	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
enlivened	1
by	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
had	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
review	1
he	1
held	1
at	1
Bartenstein,	1
as	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
outposts	1
far	1
beyond	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
They	1
were	1
bivouacking.	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Rostov	1
were	1
living	1
in	1
an	1
earth	1
hut,	1
dug	1
out	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
roofed	1
with	1
branches	1
and	1
turf.	1
The	1
hut	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
manner,	1
which	1
had	1
then	1
come	1
into	1
vogue.	1
A	1
trench	1
was	1
dug	1
three	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
feet	1
wide,	1
four	1
feet	1
eight	1
inches	1
deep,	1
and	1
eight	1
feet	1
long.	1
At	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
trench,	1
steps	1
were	1
cut	1
out	1
and	1
these	1
formed	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
vestibule.	1
The	1
trench	1
itself	1
was	1
the	1
room,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
lucky	1
ones,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
had	1
a	1
board,	1
lying	1
on	1
piles	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
opposite	1
the	1
entrance,	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
table.	1
On	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
trench,	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
cut	1
out	1
to	1
a	1
breadth	1
of	1
about	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
feet,	1
and	1
this	1
did	1
duty	1
for	1
bedsteads	1
and	1
couches.	1
The	1
roof	1
was	1
so	1
constructed	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
trench	1
and	1
could	1
even	1
sit	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
beds	1
if	1
one	1
drew	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
was	1
living	1
luxuriously	1
because	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
his	1
squadron	1
liked	1
him,	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
board	1
in	1
the	1
roof	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
end,	1
with	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
(broken	1
but	1
mended)	1
glass	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
window.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
cold,	1
embers	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
campfire	1
were	1
placed	1
on	1
a	1
bent	1
sheet	1
of	1
iron	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
"reception	1
room"--as	1
Denisov	1
called	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hut--and	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
so	1
warm	1
that	1
the	1
officers,	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
always	1
some	1
with	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
sat	1
in	1
their	1
shirt	1
sleeves.	1
	1
In	1
April,	1
Rostov	1
was	1
on	1
orderly	1
duty.	1
One	1
morning,	1
between	1
seven	1
and	1
eight,	1
returning	1
after	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night,	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
embers,	1
changed	1
his	1
rain-soaked	1
underclothes,	1
said	1
his	1
prayers,	1
drank	1
tea,	1
got	1
warm,	1
then	1
tidied	1
up	1
the	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
corner,	1
and,	1
his	1
face	1
glowing	1
from	1
exposure	1
to	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
with	1
nothing	1
on	1
but	1
his	1
shirt,	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
putting	1
his	1
arms	1
under	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
was	1
pleasantly	1
considering	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
being	1
promoted	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
for	1
his	1
last	1
reconnoitering	1
expedition,	1
and	1
was	1
awaiting	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
somewhere	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
wanted	1
a	1
talk.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
Denisov	1
shouting	1
in	1
a	1
vibrating	1
voice	1
behind	1
the	1
hut,	1
evidently	1
much	1
excited.	1
Rostov	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
see	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
to,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
quartermaster,	1
Topcheenko.	1
	1
"I	1
ordered	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
eat	1
that	1
Mashka	1
woot	1
stuff!"	1
Denisov	1
was	1
shouting.	1
"And	1
I	1
saw	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
how	1
Lazarchuk	1
bwought	1
some	1
fwom	1
the	1
fields."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
order	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
your	1
honor,	1
but	1
they	1
don't	1
obey,"	1
answered	1
the	1
quartermaster.	1
	1
Rostov	1
lay	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
and	1
thought	1
complacently:	1
"Let	1
him	1
fuss	1
and	1
bustle	1
now,	1
my	1
job's	1
done	1
and	1
I'm	1
lying	1
down--capitally!"	1
He	1
could	1
hear	1
that	1
Lavrushka--that	1
sly,	1
bold	1
orderly	1
of	1
Denisov's--was	1
talking,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
quartermaster.	1
Lavrushka	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
about	1
loaded	1
wagons,	1
biscuits,	1
and	1
oxen	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
for	1
provisions.	1
	1
Then	1
Denisov's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
shouting	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
away.	1
"Saddle!	1
Second	1
platoon!"	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
they	1
off	1
to	1
now?"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later,	1
Denisov	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
hut,	1
climbed	1
with	1
muddy	1
boots	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
lit	1
his	1
pipe,	1
furiously	1
scattered	1
his	1
things	1
about,	1
took	1
his	1
leaded	1
whip,	1
buckled	1
on	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
again.	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
inquiry	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
he	1
answered	1
vaguely	1
and	1
crossly	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
business.	1
	1
"Let	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
gweat	1
monarch	1
judge	1
me	1
afterwards!"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
going	1
out,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
heard	1
the	1
hoofs	1
of	1
several	1
horses	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
trouble	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
Denisov	1
had	1
gone.	1
Having	1
got	1
warm	1
in	1
his	1
corner,	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
hut	1
till	1
toward	1
evening.	1
Denisov	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
returned.	1
The	1
weather	1
had	1
cleared	1
up,	1
and	1
near	1
the	1
next	1
hut	1
two	1
officers	1
and	1
a	1
cadet	1
were	1
playing	1
svayka,	1
laughing	1
as	1
they	1
threw	1
their	1
missiles	1
which	1
buried	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
soft	1
mud.	1
Rostov	1
joined	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
game,	1
the	1
officers	1
saw	1
some	1
wagons	1
approaching	1
with	1
fifteen	1
hussars	1
on	1
their	1
skinny	1
horses	1
behind	1
them.	1
The	1
wagons	1
escorted	1
by	1
the	1
hussars	1
drew	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
picket	1
ropes	1
and	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
hussars	1
surrounded	1
them.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
Denisov	1
has	1
been	1
worrying,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"and	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
provisions."	1
	1
"So	1
they	1
are!"	1
said	1
the	1
officers.	1
"Won't	1
the	1
soldiers	1
be	1
glad!"	1
	1
A	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
hussars	1
came	1
Denisov,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
two	1
infantry	1
officers	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
talking.	1
	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
	1
"I	1
warn	1
you,	1
Captain,"	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
a	1
short	1
thin	1
man,	1
evidently	1
very	1
angry,	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Haven't	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
won't	1
give	1
them	1
up?"	1
replied	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
Captain.	1
It	1
is	1
mutiny--seizing	1
the	1
transport	1
of	1
one's	1
own	1
army.	1
Our	1
men	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
for	1
two	1
days."	1
	1
"And	1
mine	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
for	1
two	1
weeks,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
robbery!	1
You'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
sir!"	1
said	1
the	1
infantry	1
officer,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"Now,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
pestewing	1
me	1
for?"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
suddenly	1
losing	1
his	1
temper.	1
"I	1
shall	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
not	1
you,	1
and	1
you'd	1
better	1
not	1
buzz	1
about	1
here	1
till	1
you	1
get	1
hurt.	1
Be	1
off!	1
Go!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
at	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
then!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
little	1
officer,	1
undaunted	1
and	1
not	1
riding	1
away.	1
"If	1
you	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
rob,	1
I'll..."	1
	1
"Go	1
to	1
the	1
devil!	1
quick	1
ma'ch,	1
while	1
you're	1
safe	1
and	1
sound!"	1
and	1
Denisov	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
on	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
very	1
well!"	1
muttered	1
the	1
officer,	1
threateningly,	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
trotted	1
away,	1
jolting	1
in	1
his	1
saddle.	1
	1
"A	1
dog	1
astwide	1
a	1
fence!	1
A	1
weal	1
dog	1
astwide	1
a	1
fence!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov	1
after	1
him	1
(the	1
most	1
insulting	1
expression	1
a	1
cavalryman	1
can	1
address	1
to	1
a	1
mounted	1
infantryman)	1
and	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
he	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
	1
"I've	1
taken	1
twansports	1
from	1
the	1
infantwy	1
by	1
force!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"After	1
all,	1
can't	1
let	1
our	1
men	1
starve."	1
	1
The	1
wagons	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
hussars	1
had	1
been	1
consigned	1
to	1
an	1
infantry	1
regiment,	1
but	1
learning	1
from	1
Lavrushka	1
that	1
the	1
transport	1
was	1
unescorted,	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
hussars	1
had	1
seized	1
it	1
by	1
force.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
had	1
biscuits	1
dealt	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
freely,	1
and	1
they	1
even	1
shared	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
squadrons.	1
	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
sent	1
for	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
fingers	1
spread	1
out	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
said:	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
affair:	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
won't	1
begin	1
proceedings,	1
but	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
ride	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
and	1
settle	1
the	1
business	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
commissariat	1
department	1
and	1
if	1
possible	1
sign	1
a	1
receipt	1
for	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
stores	1
received.	1
If	1
not,	1
as	1
the	1
demand	1
was	1
booked	1
against	1
an	1
infantry	1
regiment,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
row	1
and	1
the	1
affair	1
may	1
end	1
badly."	1
	1
From	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander's,	1
Denisov	1
rode	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
with	1
a	1
sincere	1
desire	1
to	1
act	1
on	1
this	1
advice.	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
dugout	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
such	1
as	1
Rostov	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
seen	1
him	1
in.	1
Denisov	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
and	1
gasped	1
for	1
breath.	1
When	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter,	1
he	1
only	1
uttered	1
some	1
incoherent	1
oaths	1
and	1
threats	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse,	1
feeble	1
voice.	1
	1
Alarmed	1
at	1
Denisov's	1
condition,	1
Rostov	1
suggested	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
undress,	1
drink	1
some	1
water,	1
and	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
"Twy	1
me	1
for	1
wobbewy...	1
oh!	1
Some	1
more	1
water...	1
Let	1
them	1
twy	1
me,	1
but	1
I'll	1
always	1
thwash	1
scoundwels...	1
and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
the	1
Empewo'...	1
Ice..."	1
he	1
muttered.	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
doctor,	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
bleed	1
Denisov.	1
A	1
deep	1
saucer	1
of	1
black	1
blood	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
his	1
hairy	1
arm	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
was	1
he	1
able	1
to	1
relate	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
get	1
there,"	1
began	1
Denisov.	1
"'Now	1
then,	1
where's	1
your	1
chief's	1
quarters?'	1
They	1
were	1
pointed	1
out.	1
'Please	1
to	1
wait.'	1
'I've	1
widden	1
twenty	1
miles	1
and	1
have	1
duties	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
and	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
wait.	1
Announce	1
me.'	1
Vewy	1
well,	1
so	1
out	1
comes	1
their	1
head	1
chief--also	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
lecture	1
me:	1
'It's	1
wobbewy!'--'Wobbewy,'	1
I	1
say,	1
'is	1
not	1
done	1
by	1
man	1
who	1
seizes	1
pwovisions	1
to	1
feed	1
his	1
soldiers,	1
but	1
by	1
him	1
who	1
takes	1
them	1
to	1
fill	1
his	1
own	1
pockets!'	1
'Will	1
you	1
please	1
be	1
silent?'	1
'Vewy	1
good!'	1
Then	1
he	1
says:	1
'Go	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
weceipt	1
to	1
the	1
commissioner,	1
but	1
your	1
affair	1
will	1
be	1
passed	1
on	1
to	1
headquarters.'	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
commissioner.	1
I	1
enter,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
table...	1
who	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
No,	1
but	1
wait	1
a	1
bit!...	1
Who	1
is	1
it	1
that's	1
starving	1
us?"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
hitting	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
fist	1
of	1
his	1
newly	1
bled	1
arm	1
so	1
violently	1
that	1
the	1
table	1
nearly	1
broke	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
tumblers	1
on	1
it	1
jumped	1
about.	1
"Telyanin!	1
'What?	1
So	1
it's	1
you	1
who's	1
starving	1
us	1
to	1
death!	1
Is	1
it?	1
Take	1
this	1
and	1
this!'	1
and	1
I	1
hit	1
him	1
so	1
pat,	1
stwaight	1
on	1
his	1
snout...	1
'Ah,	1
what	1
a...	1
what	1
a...!'	1
and	1
I	1
sta'ted	1
fwashing	1
him...	1
Well,	1
I've	1
had	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
fun	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you!"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
gleeful	1
and	1
yet	1
angry,	1
his	1
white	1
teeth	1
showing	1
under	1
his	1
black	1
mustache.	1
"I'd	1
have	1
killed	1
him	1
if	1
they	1
hadn't	1
taken	1
him	1
away!"	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
shouting	1
for?	1
Calm	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"You've	1
set	1
your	1
arm	1
bleeding	1
afresh.	1
Wait,	1
we	1
must	1
tie	1
it	1
up	1
again."	1
	1
Denisov	1
was	1
bandaged	1
up	1
again	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
bed.	1
Next	1
day	1
he	1
woke	1
calm	1
and	1
cheerful.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
noon	1
the	1
adjutant	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
came	1
into	1
Rostov's	1
and	1
Denisov's	1
dugout	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
and	1
serious	1
face	1
and	1
regretfully	1
showed	1
them	1
a	1
paper	1
addressed	1
to	1
Major	1
Denisov	1
from	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
in	1
which	1
inquiries	1
were	1
made	1
about	1
yesterday's	1
occurrence.	1
The	1
adjutant	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
turn:	1
that	1
a	1
court-martial	1
had	1
been	1
appointed,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
severity	1
with	1
which	1
marauding	1
and	1
insubordination	1
were	1
now	1
regarded,	1
degradation	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
hoped	1
for.	1
	1
The	1
case,	1
as	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
offended	1
parties,	1
was	1
that,	1
after	1
seizing	1
the	1
transports,	1
Major	1
Denisov,	1
being	1
drunk,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
quartermaster	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
provocation	1
called	1
him	1
a	1
thief,	1
threatened	1
to	1
strike	1
him,	1
and	1
on	1
being	1
led	1
out	1
had	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
office	1
and	1
given	1
two	1
officials	1
a	1
thrashing,	1
and	1
dislocated	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
renewed	1
questions,	1
Denisov	1
said,	1
laughing,	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
some	1
other	1
fellow	1
had	1
got	1
mixed	1
up	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
nonsense	1
and	1
rubbish,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
fear	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
trial,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
those	1
scoundrels	1
dared	1
attack	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
answer	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
easily	1
forget.	1
	1
Denisov	1
spoke	1
contemptuously	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
matter,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
knew	1
him	1
too	1
well	1
not	1
to	1
detect	1
that	1
(while	1
hiding	1
it	1
from	1
others)	1
at	1
heart	1
he	1
feared	1
a	1
court-martial	1
and	1
was	1
worried	1
over	1
the	1
affair,	1
which	1
was	1
evidently	1
taking	1
a	1
bad	1
turn.	1
Every	1
day,	1
letters	1
of	1
inquiry	1
and	1
notices	1
from	1
the	1
court	1
arrived,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
May,	1
Denisov	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
hand	1
the	1
squadron	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
in	1
seniority	1
and	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
his	1
division	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
violence	1
at	1
the	1
commissariat	1
office.	1
On	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
Platov	1
reconnoitered	1
with	1
two	1
Cossack	1
regiments	1
and	1
two	1
squadrons	1
of	1
hussars.	1
Denisov,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont,	1
rode	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
outposts,	1
parading	1
his	1
courage.	1
A	1
bullet	1
fired	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
sharpshooter	1
hit	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fleshy	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
leg.	1
Perhaps	1
at	1
another	1
time	1
Denisov	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
regiment	1
for	1
so	1
slight	1
a	1
wound,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
excuse	1
himself	1
from	1
appearing	1
at	1
the	1
staff	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
hospital.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
In	1
June	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Friedland	1
was	1
fought,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
part,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
an	1
armistice	1
was	1
proclaimed.	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
felt	1
his	1
friend's	1
absence	1
very	1
much,	1
having	1
no	1
news	1
of	1
him	1
since	1
he	1
left	1
and	1
feeling	1
very	1
anxious	1
about	1
his	1
wound	1
and	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
his	1
affairs,	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
armistice	1
to	1
get	1
leave	1
to	1
visit	1
Denisov	1
in	1
hospital.	1
	1
The	1
hospital	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
Prussian	1
town	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
twice	1
devastated	1
by	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
troops.	1
Because	1
it	1
was	1
summer,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
beautiful	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
the	1
little	1
town	1
presented	1
a	1
particularly	1
dismal	1
appearance	1
with	1
its	1
broken	1
roofs	1
and	1
fences,	1
its	1
foul	1
streets,	1
tattered	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
drunken	1
soldiers	1
wandering	1
about.	1
	1
The	1
hospital	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
brick	1
building	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
frames	1
and	1
panes	1
broken	1
and	1
a	1
courtyard	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
wooden	1
fence	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
pulled	1
to	1
pieces.	1
Several	1
bandaged	1
soldiers,	1
with	1
pale	1
swollen	1
faces,	1
were	1
sitting	1
or	1
walking	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
Directly	1
Rostov	1
entered	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
was	1
enveloped	1
by	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
putrefaction	1
and	1
hospital	1
air.	1
On	1
the	1
stairs	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
Russian	1
army	1
doctor	1
smoking	1
a	1
cigar.	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
Russian	1
assistant.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
tear	1
myself	1
to	1
pieces,"	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
saying.	1
"Come	1
to	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
there."	1
	1
The	1
assistant	1
asked	1
some	1
further	1
questions.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
you	1
can!	1
Isn't	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
same?"	1
The	1
doctor	1
noticed	1
Rostov	1
coming	1
upstairs.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
sir?"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want?	1
The	1
bullets	1
having	1
spared	1
you,	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
typhus?	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
pesthouse,	1
sir."	1
	1
"How	1
so?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Typhus,	1
sir.	1
It's	1
death	1
to	1
go	1
in.	1
Only	1
we	1
two,	1
Makeev	1
and	1
I"	1
(he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
assistant),	1
"keep	1
on	1
here.	1
Some	1
five	1
of	1
us	1
doctors	1
have	1
died	1
in	1
this	1
place....	1
When	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
comes	1
he	1
is	1
done	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
week,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
with	1
evident	1
satisfaction.	1
"Prussian	1
doctors	1
have	1
been	1
invited	1
here,	1
but	1
our	1
allies	1
don't	1
like	1
it	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Rostov	1
explained	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
Major	1
Denisov	1
of	1
the	1
hussars,	1
who	1
was	1
wounded.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know.	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you,	1
sir.	1
Only	1
think!	1
I	1
am	1
alone	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
three	1
hospitals	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
hundred	1
patients!	1
It's	1
well	1
that	1
the	1
charitable	1
Prussian	1
ladies	1
send	1
us	1
two	1
pounds	1
of	1
coffee	1
and	1
some	1
lint	1
each	1
month	1
or	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
lost!"	1
he	1
laughed.	1
"Four	1
hundred,	1
sir,	1
and	1
they're	1
always	1
sending	1
me	1
fresh	1
ones.	1
There	1
are	1
four	1
hundred?	1
Eh?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
assistant.	1
	1
The	1
assistant	1
looked	1
fagged	1
out.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
vexed	1
and	1
impatient	1
for	1
the	1
talkative	1
doctor	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
"Major	1
Denisov,"	1
Rostov	1
said	1
again.	1
"He	1
was	1
wounded	1
at	1
Molliten."	1
	1
"Dead,	1
I	1
fancy.	1
Eh,	1
Makeev?"	1
queried	1
the	1
doctor,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
indifference.	1
	1
The	1
assistant,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
confirm	1
the	1
doctor's	1
words.	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
tall	1
and	1
with	1
reddish	1
hair?"	1
asked	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
Rostov	1
described	1
Denisov's	1
appearance.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
one	1
like	1
that,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
as	1
if	1
pleased.	1
"That	1
one	1
is	1
dead,	1
I	1
fancy.	1
However,	1
I'll	1
look	1
up	1
our	1
list.	1
We	1
had	1
a	1
list.	1
Have	1
you	1
got	1
it,	1
Makeev?"	1
	1
"Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
has	1
the	1
list,"	1
answered	1
the	1
assistant.	1
"But	1
if	1
you'll	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
officers'	1
wards	1
you'll	1
see	1
for	1
yourself,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you'd	1
better	1
not	1
go,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
"or	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
stay	1
here	1
yourself."	1
	1
But	1
Rostov	1
bowed	1
himself	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
assistant	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
"Only	1
don't	1
blame	1
me!"	1
the	1
doctor	1
shouted	1
up	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
Rostov	1
and	1
the	1
assistant	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
corridor.	1
The	1
smell	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
there	1
that	1
Rostov	1
held	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
pause	1
and	1
collect	1
his	1
strength	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
on.	1
A	1
door	1
opened	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
an	1
emaciated	1
sallow	1
man	1
on	1
crutches,	1
barefoot	1
and	1
in	1
underclothing,	1
limped	1
out	1
and,	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
doorpost,	1
looked	1
with	1
glittering	1
envious	1
eyes	1
at	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
passing.	1
Glancing	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded	1
were	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
on	1
straw	1
and	1
overcoats.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
look?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
see?"	1
said	1
the	1
assistant.	1
	1
But,	1
just	1
because	1
the	1
assistant	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
in,	1
Rostov	1
entered	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
ward.	1
The	1
foul	1
air,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
corridor,	1
was	1
still	1
stronger	1
here.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
different,	1
more	1
pungent,	1
and	1
one	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
where	1
it	1
originated.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
long	1
room,	1
brightly	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
through	1
the	1
large	1
windows,	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded	1
lay	1
in	1
two	1
rows	1
with	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
leaving	1
a	1
passage	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
Most	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
unconscious	1
and	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
newcomers.	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
conscious	1
raised	1
themselves	1
or	1
lifted	1
their	1
thin	1
yellow	1
faces,	1
and	1
all	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
Rostov	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
hope,	1
of	1
relief,	1
reproach,	1
and	1
envy	1
of	1
another's	1
health.	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
doors	1
into	1
the	1
two	1
adjoining	1
rooms	1
saw	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
there.	1
He	1
stood	1
still,	1
looking	1
silently	1
around.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
expected	1
such	1
a	1
sight.	1
Just	1
before	1
him,	1
almost	1
across	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
floor,	1
lay	1
a	1
sick	1
man,	1
probably	1
a	1
Cossack	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
cut	1
of	1
his	1
hair.	1
The	1
man	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
his	1
huge	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
outstretched.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
purple,	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
rolled	1
back	1
so	1
that	1
only	1
the	1
whites	1
were	1
seen,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
bare	1
legs	1
and	1
arms	1
which	1
were	1
still	1
red,	1
the	1
veins	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
cords.	1
He	1
was	1
knocking	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
floor,	1
hoarsely	1
uttering	1
some	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating.	1
Rostov	1
listened	1
and	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
word.	1
It	1
was	1
"drink,	1
drink,	1
a	1
drink!"	1
Rostov	1
glanced	1
round,	1
looking	1
for	1
someone	1
who	1
would	1
put	1
this	1
man	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
water.	1
	1
"Who	1
looks	1
after	1
the	1
sick	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
assistant.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
a	1
commissariat	1
soldier,	1
a	1
hospital	1
orderly,	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room,	1
marching	1
stiffly,	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Good	1
day,	1
your	1
honor!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
rolling	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
Rostov	1
and	1
evidently	1
mistaking	1
him	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hospital	1
authorities.	1
	1
"Get	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
water,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
honor,"	1
the	1
soldier	1
replied	1
complacently,	1
and	1
rolling	1
his	1
eyes	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
still	1
straighter,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
impossible	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
here,"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
out,	1
but	1
became	1
aware	1
of	1
an	1
intense	1
look	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
right,	1
and	1
he	1
turned.	1
Close	1
to	1
the	1
corner,	1
on	1
an	1
overcoat,	1
sat	1
an	1
old,	1
unshaven,	1
gray-bearded	1
soldier	1
as	1
thin	1
as	1
a	1
skeleton,	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
sallow	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
intently	1
fixed	1
on	1
Rostov.	1
The	1
man's	1
neighbor	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
whispered	1
something	1
to	1
him,	1
pointing	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
drew	1
nearer	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
leg	1
bent	1
under	1
him,	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
been	1
amputated	1
above	1
the	1
knee.	1
His	1
neighbor	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
who	1
lay	1
motionless	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
thrown	1
back,	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
snub	1
nose.	1
His	1
pale	1
waxen	1
face	1
was	1
still	1
freckled	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
rolled	1
back.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
soldier	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
chill	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
back.	1
	1
"Why,	1
this	1
one	1
seems..."	1
he	1
began,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
assistant.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
we've	1
been	1
begging,	1
your	1
honor,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
soldier,	1
his	1
jaw	1
quivering.	1
"He's	1
been	1
dead	1
since	1
morning.	1
After	1
all	1
we're	1
men,	1
not	1
dogs."	1
	1
"I'll	1
send	1
someone	1
at	1
once.	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away--taken	1
away	1
at	1
once,"	1
said	1
the	1
assistant	1
hurriedly.	1
"Let	1
us	1
go,	1
your	1
honor."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
let	1
us	1
go,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
hastily,	1
and	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
shrinking,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
pass	1
unnoticed	1
between	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
reproachful	1
envious	1
eyes	1
that	1
were	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Going	1
along	1
the	1
corridor,	1
the	1
assistant	1
led	1
Rostov	1
to	1
the	1
officers'	1
wards,	1
consisting	1
of	1
three	1
rooms,	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
which	1
stood	1
open.	1
There	1
were	1
beds	1
in	1
these	1
rooms	1
and	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded	1
officers	1
were	1
lying	1
or	1
sitting	1
on	1
them.	1
Some	1
were	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
hospital	1
dressing	1
gowns.	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
Rostov	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
officers'	1
ward	1
was	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
one	1
arm,	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
first	1
room	1
in	1
a	1
nightcap	1
and	1
hospital	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
with	1
a	1
pipe	1
between	1
his	1
teeth.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
before.	1
	1
"See	1
where	1
we've	1
met	1
again!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
man.	1
"Tushin,	1
Tushin,	1
don't	1
you	1
remember,	1
who	1
gave	1
you	1
a	1
lift	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern?	1
And	1
I've	1
had	1
a	1
bit	1
cut	1
off,	1
you	1
see..."	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
empty	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown.	1
"Looking	1
for	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
Denisov?	1
My	1
neighbor,"	1
he	1
added,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
who	1
Rostov	1
wanted.	1
"Here,	1
here,"	1
and	1
Tushin	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room,	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
sounds	1
of	1
several	1
laughing	1
voices.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
they	1
laugh,	1
or	1
even	1
live	1
at	1
all	1
here?"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
still	1
aware	1
of	1
that	1
smell	1
of	1
decomposing	1
flesh	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
ward,	1
and	1
still	1
seeming	1
to	1
see	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
those	1
envious	1
looks	1
which	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
both	1
sides,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
soldier	1
with	1
eyes	1
rolled	1
back.	1
	1
Denisov	1
lay	1
asleep	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
under	1
the	1
blanket,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
nearly	1
noon.	1
