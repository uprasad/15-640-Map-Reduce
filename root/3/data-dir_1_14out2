Still	1

across	1
a	1

without	1
any	1
premeditation	1
Prince	1
took	1
gain	1
confidence,	1

angrily	1
her	1

be	1
provocatively	1
happy."	1
what	1
nonsense	1
all	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
saying!"	1
thought	1
a	1
glancing	1
faces	1
"That's	1
and	1
that	1
society	1
had	1
a	1

handsome	1

everything	1

all	1
affected	1

was	1
not	1
and	1
was	1
evidently	1
but	1
even	1
waiting	1

seemed	1
feel	1
this,	1
and	1
they	1
forgot	1
duties	1
they	1
beautiful	1
her	1
radiant	1
and	1
broad,	1
and	1
seemed	1
very	1
candles	1
was	1
those	1
two	1
faces	1
alone.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
pleased	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
him.	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
man	1

not	1

hear,	1
understand	1
anything	1
Only	1
now	1
and	1
and	1
from	1
unexpectedly	1
is	1
all	1
he	1
thought.	1
how	1
has	1
all	1
happened?	1
I	1
that	1

because	1
everyone,	1

it,	1

that	1
I	1
I	1
disappoint	1
how	1
be?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
but	1
certainly	1
happen!"	1
thought	1
glancing	1
those	1
eyes.	1
Or	1
he	1
suddenly	1
feel	1
he	1
not	1
felt	1
attract	1
attention	1

be	1
a	1
man	1
plain	1
be	1
a	1
Paris	1

always	1
is	1
and	1
must	1
be	1

consoled	1
himself.	1
besides,	1
what	1
I	1
I	1
traveled	1
from	1
Prince	1
was	1
I	1
not	1
I	1
played	1
her	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
her	1
and	1
drove	1

was	1
her	1

seeing,	1
her	1
her	1
her	1
movements,	1
her	1
suddenly	1
that	1
was	1
not	1

he	1
was	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
they	1
all	1
so	1
and	1
he	1
chest,	1
raise	1
and	1
he	1
a	1
familiar	1
something	1
a	1
second	1
Pierre	1
was	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said.	1
you	1
you	1
last	1
from	1
Prince	1
a	1
absent-minded	1
you	1
dear	1
Prince	1
and	1
Pierre	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
and	1
Helene.	1
what	1
it,	1
you	1
all	1
thought	1
It's	1
and	1
he	1
gentle	1
childlike	1
smile,	1
and	1
"When	1
you	1
from	1
Prince	1
who	1
want	1
settle	1
a	1
one	1
trifles?"	1
thought	1
from	1
he	1
a	1
Pierre	1
partner	1
into	1
drawing	1
The	1
some	1
without	1
Helene.	1
Some,	1
distract	1
her	1
from	1
occupation,	1
came	1
up	1
her	1
a	1
and	1
go	1
away,	1
let	1
her	1
them	1
off.	1
The	1
diplomatist	1
a	1
silence	1
he	1
left	1
drawing	1
happiness.	1
The	1
old	1
grumbled	1
wife	1
asked	1
how	1
old	1
fool,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
Princess	1
be	1
beautiful	1
I	1
you,"	1
Anna	1
old	1
kissing	1
her	1
I	1
longer."	1
The	1
old	1
not	1

was	1
her	1
happiness.	1
While	1
Pierre	1

little	1
drawing	1
room	1
they	1
had	1
before,	1
last	1
six	1
but	1
had	1
never	1

he	1
felt	1
that	1
was	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
up	1

take	1
step.	1
felt	1
he	1

"This	1

some	1
him.	1
"This	1

But,	1
he	1

was	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
severity	1
and	1
he	1
down,	1
and	1
affectionately.	1
he	1
asked,	1
instantly	1

her	1
habitual	1
tenderness	1
natural	1
who	1
from	1

now	1
there's	1
Dolokhov	1

came	1

"Why	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
'Je	1

he	1
kept	1
himself.	1
he	1
had	1
tenth	1
