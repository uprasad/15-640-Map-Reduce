and	1
gloomy	1
faces	1
grew	1
ever	1
paler	1
and	1
gloomier.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
pale	1
and	1
gloomy	1
like	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
one	1
patch	1
to	1
another,	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
beside	1
an	1
oatfield,	1
with	1
head	1
bowed	1
and	1
arms	1
behind	1
his	1
back.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
no	1
orders	1
to	1
be	1
given.	1
Everything	1
went	1
on	1
of	1
itself.	1
The	1
killed	1
were	1
dragged	1
from	1
the	1
front,	1
the	1
wounded	1
carried	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
ranks	1
closed	1
up.	1
If	1
any	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
rear	1
they	1
returned	1
immediately	1
and	1
hastily.	1
At	1
first	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
considering	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
rouse	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
an	1
example,	1
walked	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
ranks,	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
became	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
he	1
could	1
teach	1
them.	1
All	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
as	1
of	1
every	1
soldier	1
there,	1
were	1
unconsciously	1
bent	1
on	1
avoiding	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
their	1
situation.	1
He	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
meadow,	1
dragging	1
his	1
feet,	1
rustling	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
dust	1
that	1
covered	1
his	1
boots;	1
now	1
he	1
took	1
big	1
strides	1
trying	1
to	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
footprints	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
meadow	1
by	1
the	1
mowers,	1
then	1
he	1
counted	1
his	1
steps,	1
calculating	1
how	1
often	1
he	1
must	1
walk	1
from	1
one	1
strip	1
to	1
another	1
to	1
walk	1
a	1
mile,	1
then	1
he	1
stripped	1
the	1
flowers	1
from	1
the	1
wormwood	1
that	1
grew	1
along	1
a	1
boundary	1
rut,	1
rubbed	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
palms,	1
and	1
smelled	1
their	1
pungent,	1
sweetly	1
bitter	1
scent.	1
Nothing	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
day's	1
thoughts.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing.	1
He	1
listened	1
with	1
weary	1
ears	1
to	1
the	1
ever-recurring	1
sounds,	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
whistle	1
of	1
flying	1
projectiles	1
from	1
the	1
booming	1
of	1
the	1
reports,	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
tiresomely	1
familiar	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
battalion,	1
and	1
waited.	1
"Here	1
it	1
comes...	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
coming	1
our	1
way	1
again!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
listening	1
to	1
an	1
approaching	1
whistle	1
in	1
the	1
hidden	1
region	1
of	1
smoke.	1
"One,	1
another!	1
Again!	1
It	1
has	1
hit...."	1
He	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
ranks.	1
"No,	1
it	1
has	1
gone	1
over.	1
But	1
this	1
one	1
has	1
hit!"	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
started	1
trying	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
boundary	1
strip	1
in	1
sixteen	1
paces.	1
A	1
whizz	1
and	1
a	1
thud!	1
Five	1
paces	1
from	1
him,	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
tore	1
up	1
the	1
dry	1
earth	1
and	1
disappeared.	1
A	1
chill	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
back.	1
Again	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
ranks.	1
Probably	1
many	1
had	1
been	1
hit--a	1
large	1
crowd	1
had	1
gathered	1
near	1
the	1
second	1
battalion.	1
	1
"Adjutant!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"Order	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
crowd	1
together."	1
	1
The	1
adjutant,	1
having	1
obeyed	1
this	1
instruction,	1
approached	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
From	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
a	1
battalion	1
commander	1
rode	1
up.	1
	1
"Look	1
out!"	1
came	1
a	1
frightened	1
cry	1
from	1
a	1
soldier	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
whirring	1
in	1
rapid	1
flight	1
and	1
alighting	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
a	1
shell	1
dropped	1
with	1
little	1
noise	1
within	1
two	1
steps	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
battalion	1
commander's	1
horse.	1
The	1
horse	1
first,	1
regardless	1
of	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
to	1
show	1
fear,	1
snorted,	1
reared	1
almost	1
throwing	1
the	1
major,	1
and	1
galloped	1
aside.	1
The	1
horse's	1
terror	1
infected	1
the	1
men.	1
	1
"Lie	1
down!"	1
cried	1
the	1
adjutant,	1
throwing	1
himself	1
flat	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
hesitated.	1
The	1
smoking	1
shell	1
spun	1
like	1
a	1
top	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
prostrate	1
adjutant,	1
near	1
a	1
wormwood	1
plant	1
between	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
the	1
meadow.	1
	1
"Can	1
this	1
be	1
death?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looking	1
with	1
a	1
quite	1
new,	1
envious	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
grass,	1
the	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
the	1
streamlet	1
of	1
smoke	1
that	1
curled	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
rotating	1
black	1
ball.	1
"I	1
cannot,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
die.	1
I	1
love	1
life--I	1
love	1
this	1
grass,	1
this	1
earth,	1
this	1
air...."	1
He	1
thought	1
this,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
remembered	1
that	1
people	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"It's	1
shameful,	1
sir!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"What..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
speaking.	1
At	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
an	1
explosion,	1
a	1
whistle	1
of	1
splinters	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
breaking	1
window	1
frame,	1
a	1
suffocating	1
smell	1
of	1
powder,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
started	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
raising	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
chest.	1
Several	1
officers	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
From	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
abdomen,	1
blood	1
was	1
welling	1
out	1
making	1
a	1
large	1
stain	1
on	1
the	1
grass.	1
	1
The	1
militiamen	1
with	1
stretchers	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
up	1
stood	1
behind	1
the	1
officers.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
grass,	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
and	1
noisily.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
waiting	1
for?	1
Come	1
along!"	1
	1
The	1
peasants	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
legs,	1
but	1
he	1
moaned	1
piteously	1
and,	1
exchanging	1
looks,	1
they	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
again.	1
	1
"Pick	1
him	1
up,	1
lift	1
him,	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same!"	1
cried	1
someone.	1
	1
They	1
again	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
stretcher.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
God!	1
My	1
God!	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
The	1
stomach?	1
That	1
means	1
death!	1
My	1
God!"--	1
voices	1
among	1
the	1
officers	1
were	1
heard	1
saying.	1
	1
"It	1
flew	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth	1
past	1
my	1
ear,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
The	1
peasants,	1
adjusting	1
the	1
stretcher	1
to	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
started	1
hurriedly	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
they	1
had	1
trodden	1
down,	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
station.	1
	1
"Keep	1
in	1
step!	1
Ah...	1
those	1
peasants!"	1
shouted	1
an	1
officer,	1
seizing	1
by	1
their	1
shoulders	1
and	1
checking	1
the	1
peasants,	1
who	1
were	1
walking	1
unevenly	1
and	1
jolting	1
the	1
stretcher.	1
	1
"Get	1
into	1
step,	1
Fedor...	1
I	1
say,	1
Fedor!"	1
said	1
the	1
foremost	1
peasant.	1
	1
"Now	1
that's	1
right!"	1
said	1
the	1
one	1
behind	1
joyfully,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
step.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!	1
Eh,	1
Prince!"	1
said	1
the	1
trembling	1
voice	1
of	1
Timokhin,	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
stretcher.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
speaker	1
from	1
the	1
stretcher	1
into	1
which	1
his	1
head	1
had	1
sunk	1
deep	1
and	1
again	1
his	1
eyelids	1
drooped.	1
	1
The	1
militiamen	1
carried	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
station	1
by	1
the	1
wood,	1
where	1
wagons	1
were	1
stationed.	1
The	1
dressing	1
station	1
consisted	1
of	1
three	1
tents	1
with	1
flaps	1
turned	1
back,	1
pitched	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
birch	1
wood.	1
In	1
the	1
wood,	1
wagons	1
and	1
horses	1
were	1
standing.	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
eating	1
oats	1
from	1
their	1
movable	1
troughs	1
and	1
sparrows	1
flew	1
down	1
and	1
pecked	1
the	1
grains	1
that	1
fell.	1
Some	1
crows,	1
scenting	1
blood,	1
flew	1
among	1
the	1
birch	1
trees	1
cawing	1
impatiently.	1
Around	1
the	1
tents,	1
over	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
acres,	1
bloodstained	1
men	1
in	1
various	1
garbs	1
stood,	1
sat,	1
or	1
lay.	1
Around	1
the	1
wounded	1
stood	1
crowds	1
of	1
soldier	1
stretcher-bearers	1
with	1
dismal	1
and	1
attentive	1
faces,	1
whom	1
the	1
officers	1
keeping	1
order	1
tried	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
drive	1
from	1
the	1
spot.	1
Disregarding	1
the	1
officers'	1
orders,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
stood	1
leaning	1
against	1
their	1
stretchers	1
and	1
gazing	1
intently,	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
comprehend	1
the	1
difficult	1
problem	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
before	1
them.	1
From	1
the	1
tents	1
came	1
now	1
loud	1
angry	1
cries	1
and	1
now	1
plaintive	1
groans.	1
Occasionally	1
dressers	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
fetch	1
water,	1
or	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
in	1
next.	1
The	1
wounded	1
men	1
awaiting	1
their	1
turn	1
outside	1
the	1
tents	1
groaned,	1
sighed,	1
wept,	1
screamed,	1
swore,	1
or	1
asked	1
for	1
vodka.	1
Some	1
were	1
delirious.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
bearers,	1
stepping	1
over	1
the	1
wounded	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
bandaged,	1
took	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tents	1
and	1
there	1
stopped,	1
awaiting	1
instructions.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
him.	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
meadow,	1
the	1
wormwood,	1
the	1
field,	1
the	1
whirling	1
black	1
ball,	1
and	1
his	1
sudden	1
rush	1
of	1
passionate	1
love	1
of	1
life.	1
Two	1
steps	1
from	1
him,	1
leaning	1
against	1
a	1
branch	1
and	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
attracting	1
general	1
attention,	1
stood	1
a	1
tall,	1
handsome,	1
black-haired	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
head.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
leg	1
by	1
bullets.	1
Around	1
him,	1
eagerly	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
talk,	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
wounded	1
and	1
stretcher-bearers	1
was	1
gathered.	1
	1
"We	1
kicked	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
there	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
chucked	1
everything,	1
we	1
grabbed	1
the	1
King	1
himself!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
looking	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
glittered	1
with	1
fever.	1
"If	1
only	1
reserves	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
just	1
then,	1
lads,	1
there	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
been	1
nothing	1
left	1
of	1
him!	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
surely..."	1
	1
Like	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
near	1
the	1
speaker,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes	1
and	1
experienced	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort.	1
"But	1
isn't	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
now?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"And	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
there,	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
there	1
been	1
here?	1
Why	1
was	1
I	1
so	1
reluctant	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
life?	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
understand."	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXVII	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
doctors	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
in	1
a	1
bloodstained	1
apron,	1
holding	1
a	1
cigar	1
between	1
the	1
thumb	1
and	1
little	1
finger	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
small	1
bloodstained	1
hands,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
smear	1
it.	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
him,	1
but	1
above	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
men.	1
He	1
evidently	1
wanted	1
a	1
little	1
respite.	1
After	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
he	1
sighed	1
and	1
looked	1
down.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
immediately,"	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
a	1
dresser	1
who	1
pointed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
Murmurs	1
arose	1
among	1
the	1
wounded	1
who	1
were	1
waiting.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
world	1
only	1
the	1
gentry	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
chance!"	1
remarked	1
one.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
carried	1
in	1
and	1
laid	1
on	1
a	1
table	1
that	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
been	1
cleared	1
and	1
which	1
a	1
dresser	1
was	1
washing	1
down.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
distinctly	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
tent.	1
The	1
pitiful	1
groans	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
the	1
torturing	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
thigh,	1
stomach,	1
and	1
back	1
distracted	1
him.	1
All	1
he	1
saw	1
about	1
him	1
merged	1
into	1
a	1
general	1
impression	1
of	1
naked,	1
bleeding	1
human	1
bodies	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
low	1
tent,	1
as	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
previously,	1
on	1
that	1
hot	1
August	1
day,	1
such	1
bodies	1
had	1
filled	1
the	1
dirty	1
pond	1
beside	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road.	1
Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
flesh,	1
the	1
same	1
chair	1
a	1
canon,	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
even	1
then	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
horror,	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
presentiment.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
three	1
operating	1
tables	1
in	1
the	1
tent.	1
Two	1
were	1
occupied,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
they	1
placed	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
For	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
witnessed	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
tables.	1
On	1
the	1
nearest	1
one	1
sat	1
a	1
Tartar,	1
probably	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
uniform	1
thrown	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
Four	1
soldiers	1
were	1
holding	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
spectacled	1
doctor	1
was	1
cutting	1
into	1
his	1
muscular	1
brown	1
back.	1
	1
"Ooh,	1
ooh,	1
ooh!"	1
grunted	1
the	1
Tartar,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
lifting	1
up	1
his	1
swarthy	1
snub-nosed	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
high	1
cheekbones,	1
and	1
baring	1
his	1
white	1
teeth,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
wriggle	1
and	1
twitch	1
his	1
body	1
and	1
utter	1
piercing,	1
ringing,	1
and	1
prolonged	1
yells.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
table,	1
round	1
which	1
many	1
people	1
were	1
crowding,	1
a	1
tall	1
well-fed	1
man	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
thrown	1
back.	1
His	1
curly	1
hair,	1
its	1
color,	1
and	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
seemed	1
strangely	1
familiar	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
Several	1
dressers	1
were	1
pressing	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
down.	1
One	1
large,	1
white,	1
plump	1
leg	1
twitched	1
rapidly	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
feverish	1
tremor.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
sobbing	1
and	1
choking	1
convulsively.	1
Two	1
doctors--one	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
trembling--were	1
silently	1
doing	1
something	1
to	1
this	1
man's	1
other,	1
gory	1
leg.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
with	1
the	1
Tartar,	1
whom	1
they	1
covered	1
with	1
an	1
overcoat,	1
the	1
spectacled	1
doctor	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
wiping	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
and	1
quickly	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
"Undress	1
him!	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
waiting	1
for?"	1
he	1
cried	1
angrily	1
to	1
the	1
dressers.	1
	1
His	1
very	1
first,	1
remotest	1
recollections	1
of	1
childhood	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
mind	1
when	1
the	1
dresser	1
with	1
sleeves	1
rolled	1
up	1
began	1
hastily	1
to	1
undo	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1
clothes	1
and	1
undressed	1
him.	1
The	1
doctor	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
wound,	1
felt	1
it,	1
and	1
sighed	1
deeply.	1
Then	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
someone,	1
and	1
the	1
torturing	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
abdomen	1
caused	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
lose	1
consciousness.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
splintered	1
portions	1
of	1
his	1
thighbone	1
had	1
been	1
extracted,	1
the	1
torn	1
flesh	1
cut	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
wound	1
bandaged.	1
Water	1
was	1
being	1
sprinkled	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
the	1
doctor	1
bent	1
over,	1
kissed	1
him	1
silently	1
on	1
the	1
lips,	1
and	1
hurried	1
away.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
sufferings	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
enduring,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
blissful	1
feeling	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
experienced	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
All	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
happiest	1
moments	1
of	1
his	1
life--especially	1
his	1
earliest	1
childhood,	1
when	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
undressed	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
when	1
leaning	1
over	1
him	1
his	1
nurse	1
sang	1
him	1
to	1
sleep	1
and	1
he,	1
burying	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
pillow,	1
felt	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
consciousness	1
of	1
life--returned	1
to	1
his	1
memory,	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
something	1
past	1
but	1
as	1
something	1
present.	1
	1
The	1
doctors	1
were	1
busily	1
engaged	1
with	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
whose	1
head	1
seemed	1
familiar	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew:	1
they	1
were	1
lifting	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
quiet	1
him.	1
	1
"Show	1
it	1
to	1
me....	1
Oh,	1
ooh...	1
Oh!	1
Oh,	1
ooh!"	1
his	1
frightened	1
moans	1
could	1
be	1
heard,	1
subdued	1
by	1
suffering	1
and	1
broken	1
by	1
sobs.	1
	1
Hearing	1
those	1
moans	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
wanted	1
to	1
weep.	1
Whether	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
dying	1
without	1
glory,	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
life,	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
memories	1
of	1
a	1
childhood	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
return,	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
suffering	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
suffering	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
near	1
him	1
was	1
groaning	1
so	1
piteously--he	1
felt	1
like	1
weeping	1
childlike,	1
kindly,	1
and	1
almost	1
happy	1
tears.	1
	1
The	1
wounded	1
man	1
was	1
shown	1
his	1
amputated	1
leg	1
stained	1
with	1
clotted	1
blood	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
boot	1
still	1
on.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh,	1
ooh!"	1
he	1
sobbed,	1
like	1
a	1
woman.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
beside	1
him,	1
preventing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
from	1
seeing	1
his	1
face,	1
moved	1
away.	1
	1
"My	1
God!	1
What	1
is	1
this?	1
Why	1
is	1
he	1
here?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
miserable,	1
sobbing,	1
enfeebled	1
man	1
whose	1
leg	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
amputated,	1
he	1
recognized	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin.	1
Men	1
were	1
supporting	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
offering	1
him	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
water,	1
but	1
his	1
trembling,	1
swollen	1
lips	1
could	1
not	1
grasp	1
its	1
rim.	1
Anatole	1
was	1
sobbing	1
painfully.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
he!	1
Yes,	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
somehow	1
closely	1
and	1
painfully	1
connected	1
with	1
me,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
not	1
yet	1
clearly	1
grasping	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
before	1
him.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
with	1
my	1
childhood	1
and	1
life?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
without	1
finding	1
an	1
answer.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
a	1
new	1
unexpected	1
memory	1
from	1
that	1
realm	1
of	1
pure	1
and	1
loving	1
childhood	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
remembered	1
Natasha	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
1810,	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
neck	1
and	1
arms	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
happy	1
face	1
ready	1
for	1
rapture,	1
and	1
love	1
and	1
tenderness	1
for	1
her,	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
vivid	1
than	1
ever,	1
awoke	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
now	1
remembered	1
the	1
connection	1
that	1
existed	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
dimly	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
through	1
tears	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
swollen	1
eyes.	1
He	1
remembered	1
everything,	1
and	1
ecstatic	1
pity	1
and	1
love	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
overflowed	1
his	1
happy	1
heart.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
restrain	1
himself	1
and	1
wept	1
tender	1
loving	1
tears	1
for	1
his	1
fellow	1
men,	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
their	1
errors.	1
	1
"Compassion,	1
love	1
of	1
our	1
brothers,	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
us	1
and	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
hate	1
us,	1
love	1
of	1
our	1
enemies;	1
yes,	1
that	1
love	1
which	1
God	1
preached	1
on	1
earth	1
and	1
which	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
taught	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand--that	1
is	1
what	1
made	1
me	1
sorry	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
life,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
remained	1
for	1
me	1
had	1
I	1
lived.	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late.	1
I	1
know	1
it!"	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXVIII	1
	1
The	1
terrible	1
spectacle	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
covered	1
with	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
heaviness	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
some	1
twenty	1
generals	1
he	1
knew	1
personally	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
or	1
wounded,	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
impotence	1
of	1
his	1
once	1
mighty	1
arm,	1
produced	1
an	1
unexpected	1
impression	1
on	1
Napoleon	1
who	1
usually	1
liked	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded,	1
thereby,	1
he	1
considered,	1
testing	1
his	1
strength	1
of	1
mind.	1
This	1
day	1
the	1
horrible	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
overcame	1
that	1
strength	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
constituted	1
his	1
merit	1
and	1
his	1
greatness.	1
He	1
rode	1
hurriedly	1
from	1
the	1
battlefield	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Shevardino	1
knoll,	1
where	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
campstool,	1
his	1
sallow	1
face	1
swollen	1
and	1
heavy,	1
his	1
eyes	1
dim,	1
his	1
nose	1
red,	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
hoarse,	1
involuntarily	1
listening,	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes,	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing.	1
With	1
painful	1
dejection	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
action,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
regarded	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
participant	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
arrest.	1
A	1
personal,	1
human	1
feeling	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1
moment	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
the	1
artificial	1
phantasm	1
of	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
so	1
long.	1
He	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
person	1
the	1
sufferings	1
and	1
death	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
The	1
heaviness	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
chest	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
suffering	1
and	1
death	1
for	1
himself.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
desire	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
victory,	1
or	1
glory	1
(what	1
need	1
had	1
he	1
for	1
any	1
more	1
glory?).	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
wished	1
for	1
was	1
rest,	1
tranquillity,	1
and	1
freedom.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
Semenovsk	1
heights	1
the	1
artillery	1
commander	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
several	1
batteries	1
of	1
artillery	1
up	1
to	1
those	1
heights	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
crowded	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Knyazkovo.	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
assented	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
orders	1
that	1
news	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
those	1
batteries	1
produced.	1
	1
An	1
adjutant	1
came	1
now	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
guns	1
had	1
been	1
concentrated	1
on	1
the	1
Russians,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ordered,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
still	1
held	1
their	1
ground.	1
	1
"Our	1
fire	1
is	1
mowing	1
them	1
down	1
by	1
rows,	1
but	1
still	1
they	1
hold	1
on,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"They	1
want	1
more!..."	1
said	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice.	1
	1
"Sire?"	1
asked	1
the	1
adjutant	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
remark.	1
	1
"They	1
want	1
more!"	1
croaked	1
Napoleon	1
frowning.	1
"Let	1
them	1
have	1
it!"	1
	1
Even	1
before	1
he	1
gave	1
that	1
order	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
desire,	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
order	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
was	1
being	1
done.	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
back	1
into	1
that	1
artificial	1
realm	1
of	1
imaginary	1
greatness,	1
and	1
again--as	1
a	1
horse	1
walking	1
a	1
treadmill	1
thinks	1
it	1
is	1
doing	1
something	1
for	1
itself--he	1
submissively	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
cruel,	1
sad,	1
gloomy,	1
and	1
inhuman	1
role	1
predestined	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
alone	1
were	1
the	1
mind	1
and	1
conscience	1
darkened	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
responsibility	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
lay	1
more	1
than	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
Never	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
could	1
he	1
understand	1
goodness,	1
beauty,	1
or	1
truth,	1
or	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
actions	1
which	1
were	1
too	1
contrary	1
to	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth,	1
too	1
remote	1
from	1
everything	1
human,	1
for	1
him	1
ever	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
grasp	1
their	1
meaning.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
disavow	1
his	1
actions,	1
belauded	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
half	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
repudiate	1
truth,	1
goodness,	1
and	1
all	1
humanity.	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
over	1
the	1
battlefield	1
strewn	1
with	1
men	1
killed	1
and	1
maimed	1
(by	1
his	1
will	1
as	1
he	1
believed),	1
did	1
he	1
reckon	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
how	1
many	1
Russians	1
there	1
were	1
for	1
each	1
Frenchman	1
and,	1
deceiving	1
himself,	1
find	1
reason	1
for	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
calculation	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
five	1
Russians	1
for	1
every	1
Frenchman.	1
Not	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
alone	1
did	1
he	1
write	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Paris	1
that	1
"the	1
battle	1
field	1
was	1
superb,"	1
because	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
corpses	1
lay	1
there,	1
but	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
St.	1
Helena	1
in	1
the	1
peaceful	1
solitude	1
where	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
devote	1
his	1
leisure	1
to	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
deeds	1
he	1
had	1
done,	1
he	1
wrote:	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
war	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
popular	1
war	1
of	1
modern	1
times:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
war	1
of	1
good	1
sense,	1
for	1
real	1
interests,	1
for	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
security	1
of	1
all;	1
it	1
was	1
purely	1
pacific	1
and	1
conservative.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
war	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
cause,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
uncertainties	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
security.	1
A	1
new	1
horizon	1
and	1
new	1
labors	1
were	1
opening	1
out,	1
full	1
of	1
well-being	1
and	1
prosperity	1
for	1
all.	1
The	1
European	1
system	1
was	1
already	1
founded;	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
was	1
to	1
organize	1
it.	1
	1
Satisfied	1
on	1
these	1
great	1
points	1
and	1
with	1
tranquility	1
everywhere,	1
I	1
too	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
my	1
Congress	1
and	1
my	1
Holy	1
Alliance.	1
Those	1
ideas	1
were	1
stolen	1
from	1
me.	1
In	1
that	1
reunion	1
of	1
great	1
sovereigns	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
discussed	1
our	1
interests	1
like	1
one	1
family,	1
and	1
have	1
rendered	1
account	1
to	1
the	1
peoples	1
as	1
clerk	1
to	1
master.	1
	1
Europe	1
would	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
soon	1
have	1
been,	1
in	1
fact,	1
but	1
one	1
people,	1
and	1
anyone	1
who	1
traveled	1
anywhere	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
himself	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
fatherland.	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
demanded	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
all	1
navigable	1
rivers	1
for	1
everybody,	1
that	1
the	1
seas	1
should	1
be	1
common	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
standing	1
armies	1
should	1
be	1
reduced	1
henceforth	1
to	1
mere	1
guards	1
for	1
the	1
sovereigns.	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
to	1
France,	1
to	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
great,	1
strong,	1
magnificent,	1
peaceful,	1
and	1
glorious	1
fatherland,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
proclaimed	1
her	1
frontiers	1
immutable;	1
all	1
future	1
wars	1
purely	1
defensive,	1
all	1
aggrandizement	1
antinational.	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
associated	1
my	1
son	1
in	1
the	1
Empire;	1
my	1
dictatorship	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
finished,	1
and	1
his	1
constitutional	1
reign	1
would	1
have	1
begun.	1
	1
Paris	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
capital	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
the	1
envy	1
of	1
the	1
nations!	1
	1
My	1
leisure	1
then,	1
and	1
my	1
old	1
age,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
devoted,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
Empress	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
royal	1
apprenticeship	1
of	1
my	1
son,	1
to	1
leisurely	1
visiting,	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
horses	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
true	1
country	1
couple,	1
every	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
Empire,	1
receiving	1
complaints,	1
redressing	1
wrongs,	1
and	1
scattering	1
public	1
buildings	1
and	1
benefactions	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
everywhere.	1
	1
Napoleon,	1
predestined	1
by	1
Providence	1
for	1
the	1
gloomy	1
role	1
of	1
executioner	1
of	1
the	1
peoples,	1
assured	1
himself	1
that	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
his	1
actions	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
peoples'	1
welfare	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
control	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
millions	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
power	1
confer	1
benefactions.	1
	1
"Of	1
four	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
who	1
crossed	1
the	1
Vistula,"	1
he	1
wrote	1
further	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
war,	1
"half	1
were	1
Austrians,	1
Prussians,	1
Saxons,	1
Poles,	1
Bavarians,	1
Wurttembergers,	1
Mecklenburgers,	1
Spaniards,	1
Italians,	1
and	1
Neapolitans.	1
The	1
Imperial	1
army,	1
strictly	1
speaking,	1
was	1
one	1
third	1
composed	1
of	1
Dutch,	1
Belgians,	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine,	1
Piedmontese,	1
Swiss,	1
Genevese,	1
Tuscans,	1
Romans,	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
Thirty-second	1
Military	1
Division,	1
of	1
Bremen,	1
of	1
Hamburg,	1
and	1
so	1
on:	1
it	1
included	1
scarcely	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
thousand	1
who	1
spoke	1
French.	1
The	1
Russian	1
expedition	1
actually	1
cost	1
France	1
less	1
than	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
men;	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
in	1
its	1
retreat	1
from	1
Vilna	1
to	1
Moscow	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
various	1
battles	1
four	1
times	1
more	1
men	1
than	1
the	1
French	1
army;	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
cost	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
Russians	1
who	1
died	1
of	1
cold	1
and	1
want	1
in	1
the	1
woods;	1
finally,	1
in	1
its	1
march	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
Oder	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
also	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
severity	1
of	1
the	1
season;	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
reached	1
Vilna	1
it	1
numbered	1
only	1
fifty	1
thousand,	1
and	1
at	1
Kalisch	1
less	1
than	1
eighteen	1
thousand."	1
	1
He	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Russia	1
came	1
about	1
by	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
the	1
horrors	1
that	1
occurred	1
did	1
not	1
stagger	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
boldly	1
took	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
for	1
what	1
happened,	1
and	1
his	1
darkened	1
mind	1
found	1
justification	1
in	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
among	1
the	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
who	1
perished	1
there	1
were	1
fewer	1
Frenchmen	1
than	1
Hessians	1
and	1
Bavarians.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXIX	1
	1
Several	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
lay	1
in	1
diverse	1
postures	1
and	1
various	1
uniforms	1
on	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
meadows	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
Davydov	1
family	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
crown	1
serfs--those	1
fields	1
and	1
meadows	1
where	1
for	1
hundreds	1
of	1
years	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
Gorki,	1
Shevardino,	1
and	1
Semenovsk	1
had	1
reaped	1
their	1
harvests	1
and	1
pastured	1
their	1
cattle.	1
At	1
the	1
dressing	1
stations	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
earth	1
were	1
soaked	1
with	1
blood	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
of	1
some	1
three	1
acres	1
around.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
various	1
arms,	1
wounded	1
and	1
unwounded,	1
with	1
frightened	1
faces,	1
dragged	1
themselves	1
back	1
to	1
Mozhaysk	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
army	1
and	1
back	1
to	1
Valuevo	1
from	1
the	1
other.	1
Other	1
crowds,	1
exhausted	1
and	1
hungry,	1
went	1
forward	1
led	1
by	1
their	1
officers.	1
Others	1
held	1
their	1
ground	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
fire.	1
	1
Over	1
the	1
whole	1
field,	1
previously	1
so	1
gaily	1
beautiful	1
with	1
the	1
glitter	1
of	1
bayonets	1
and	1
cloudlets	1
of	1
smoke	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
sun,	1
there	1
now	1
spread	1
a	1
mist	1
of	1
damp	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
acid	1
smell	1
of	1
saltpeter	1
and	1
blood.	1
Clouds	1
gathered	1
and	1
drops	1
of	1
rain	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded,	1
on	1
the	1
frightened,	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
hesitating	1
men,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say:	1
"Enough,	1
men!	1
Enough!	1
Cease...	1
bethink	1
yourselves!	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
doing?"	1
	1
To	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
both	1
sides	1
alike,	1
worn	1
out	1
by	1
want	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
rest,	1
it	1
began	1
equally	1
to	1
appear	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
continue	1
to	1
slaughter	1
one	1
another;	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
expressed	1
hesitation,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
arose	1
in	1
every	1
soul:	1
"For	1
what,	1
for	1
whom,	1
must	1
I	1
kill	1
and	1
be	1
killed?...	1
You	1
may	1
go	1
and	1
kill	1
whom	1
you	1
please,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
anymore!"	1
By	1
evening	1
this	1
thought	1
had	1
ripened	1
in	1
every	1
soul.	1
At	1
any	1
moment	1
these	1
men	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
seized	1
with	1
horror	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
and	1
might	1
have	1
thrown	1
up	1
everything	1
and	1
run	1
away	1
anywhere.	1
	1
But	1
though	1
toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
the	1
men	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing,	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
leave	1
off,	1
some	1
incomprehensible,	1
mysterious	1
power	1
continued	1
to	1
control	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
still	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
charges,	1
loaded,	1
aimed,	1
and	1
applied	1
the	1
match,	1
though	1
only	1
one	1
artilleryman	1
survived	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
three,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
stumbled	1
and	1
panted	1
with	1
fatigue,	1
perspiring	1
and	1
stained	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
powder.	1
The	1
cannon	1
balls	1
flew	1
just	1
as	1
swiftly	1
and	1
cruelly	1
from	1
both	1
sides,	1
crushing	1
human	1
bodies,	1
and	1
that	1
terrible	1
work	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Him	1
who	1
governs	1
men	1
and	1
worlds	1
continued.	1
	1
Anyone	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
disorganized	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that,	1
if	1
only	1
the	1
French	1
made	1
one	1
more	1
slight	1
effort,	1
it	1
would	1
disappear;	1
and	1
anyone	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
need	1
only	1
make	1
one	1
more	1
slight	1
effort	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
would	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
But	1
neither	1
the	1
French	1
nor	1
the	1
Russians	1
made	1
that	1
effort,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
battle	1
burned	1
slowly	1
out.	1
	1
The	1
Russians	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
that	1
effort	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
attacking	1
the	1
French.	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
they	1
stood	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
they	1
still	1
did	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
But	1
even	1
had	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
been	1
to	1
drive	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
their	1
positions,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
this	1
last	1
effort,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
up,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
though	1
still	1
holding	1
their	1
positions	1
they	1
had	1
lost	1
ONE	1
HALF	1
of	1
their	1
army.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
with	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
former	1
victories	1
during	1
fifteen	1
years,	1
with	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
invincibility,	1
with	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
captured	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
battlefield	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
only	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
their	1
men	1
and	1
still	1
had	1
their	1
Guards	1
intact,	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
made	1
that	1
effort.	1
The	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
from	1
its	1
position	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
that	1
effort,	1
for	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
Russians	1
continued	1
to	1
block	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Moscow	1
as	1
before,	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
attained	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
efforts	1
and	1
losses	1
were	1
in	1
vain.	1
But	1
the	1
French	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
that	1
effort.	1
Some	1
historians	1
say	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
need	1
only	1
have	1
used	1
his	1
Old	1
Guards,	1
who	1
were	1
intact,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
won.	1
To	1
speak	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
Napoleon	1
sent	1
his	1
Guards	1
is	1
like	1
talking	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
autumn	1
became	1
spring.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
be.	1
Napoleon	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
Guards,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to,	1
but	1
because	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done.	1
All	1
the	1
generals,	1
officers,	1
and	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
knew	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done,	1
because	1
the	1
flagging	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
it.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
Napoleon	1
alone	1
who	1
had	1
experienced	1
that	1
nightmare	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
arm	1
being	1
stricken	1
powerless,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
generals	1
and	1
soldiers	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
whether	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
or	1
not,	1
after	1
all	1
their	1
experience	1
of	1
previous	1
battles--when	1
after	1
one	1
tenth	1
of	1
such	1
efforts	1
the	1
enemy	1
had	1
fled--experienced	1
a	1
similar	1
feeling	1
of	1
terror	1
before	1
an	1
enemy	1
who,	1
after	1
losing	1
HALF	1
his	1
men,	1
stood	1
as	1
threateningly	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
The	1
moral	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
attacking	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
exhausted.	1
Not	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
victory	1
which	1
is	1
defined	1
by	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
pieces	1
of	1
material	1
fastened	1
to	1
sticks,	1
called	1
standards,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
had	1
stood	1
and	1
were	1
standing,	1
but	1
a	1
moral	1
victory	1
that	1
convinces	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
moral	1
superiority	1
of	1
his	1
opponent	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
impotence	1
was	1
gained	1
by	1
the	1
Russians	1
at	1
Borodino.	1
The	1
French	1
invaders,	1
like	1
an	1
infuriated	1
animal	1
that	1
has	1
in	1
its	1
onslaught	1
received	1
a	1
mortal	1
wound,	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
perishing,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
stop,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
weaker	1
by	1
one	1
half,	1
could	1
help	1
swerving.	1
By	1
impetus	1
gained,	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
still	1
able	1
to	1
roll	1
forward	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
there,	1
without	1
further	1
effort	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Russians,	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
perish,	1
bleeding	1
from	1
the	1
mortal	1
wound	1
it	1
had	1
received	1
at	1
Borodino.	1
The	1
direct	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
Napoleon's	1
senseless	1
flight	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
his	1
retreat	1
along	1
the	1
old	1
Smolensk	1
road,	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
invading	1
army	1
of	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
downfall	1
of	1
Napoleonic	1
France,	1
on	1
which	1
at	1
Borodino	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
an	1
opponent	1
of	1
stronger	1
spirit	1
had	1
been	1
laid.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Absolute	1
continuity	1
of	1
motion	1
is	1
not	1
comprehensible	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
mind.	1
Laws	1
of	1
motion	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
become	1
comprehensible	1
to	1
man	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
examines	1
arbitrarily	1
selected	1
elements	1
of	1
that	1
motion;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
a	1
large	1
proportion	1
of	1
human	1
error	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
arbitrary	1
division	1
of	1
continuous	1
motion	1
into	1
discontinuous	1
elements.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
well	1
known,	1
so-called	1
sophism	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
consisting	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
Achilles	1
could	1
never	1
catch	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
tortoise	1
he	1
was	1
following,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
traveled	1
ten	1
times	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
tortoise.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
Achilles	1
has	1
covered	1
the	1
distance	1
that	1
separated	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
tortoise,	1
the	1
tortoise	1
has	1
covered	1
one	1
tenth	1
of	1
that	1
distance	1
ahead	1
of	1
him:	1
when	1
Achilles	1
has	1
covered	1
that	1
tenth,	1
the	1
tortoise	1
has	1
covered	1
another	1
one	1
hundredth,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
forever.	1
This	1
problem	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
ancients	1
insoluble.	1
The	1
absurd	1
answer	1
(that	1
Achilles	1
could	1
never	1
overtake	1
the	1
tortoise)	1
resulted	1
from	1
this:	1
that	1
motion	1
was	1
arbitrarily	1
divided	1
into	1
discontinuous	1
elements,	1
whereas	1
the	1
motion	1
both	1
of	1
Achilles	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
tortoise	1
was	1
continuous.	1
	1
By	1
adopting	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller	1
elements	1
of	1
motion	1
we	1
only	1
approach	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
problem,	1
but	1
never	1
reach	1
it.	1
Only	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
admitted	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
infinitely	1
small,	1
and	1
the	1
resulting	1
geometrical	1
progression	1
with	1
a	1
common	1
ratio	1
of	1
one	1
tenth,	1
and	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
this	1
progression	1
to	1
infinity,	1
do	1
we	1
reach	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
problem.	1
	1
A	1
modern	1
branch	1
of	1
mathematics	1
having	1
achieved	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
infinitely	1
small	1
can	1
now	1
yield	1
solutions	1
in	1
other	1
more	1
complex	1
problems	1
of	1
motion	1
which	1
used	1
to	1
appear	1
insoluble.	1
	1
This	1
modern	1
branch	1
of	1
mathematics,	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
ancients,	1
when	1
dealing	1
with	1
problems	1
of	1
motion	1
admits	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
infinitely	1
small,	1
and	1
so	1
conforms	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
condition	1
of	1
motion	1
(absolute	1
continuity)	1
and	1
thereby	1
corrects	1
the	1
inevitable	1
error	1
which	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
cannot	1
avoid	1
when	1
it	1
deals	1
with	1
separate	1
elements	1
of	1
motion	1
instead	1
of	1
examining	1
continuous	1
motion.	1
	1
In	1
seeking	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
historical	1
movement	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happens.	1
The	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity,	1
arising	1
as	1
it	1
does	1
from	1
innumerable	1
arbitrary	1
human	1
wills,	1
is	1
continuous.	1
	1
To	1
understand	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
this	1
continuous	1
movement	1
is	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
history.	1
But	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
these	1
laws,	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
human	1
wills,	1
man's	1
mind	1
postulates	1
arbitrary	1
and	1
disconnected	1
units.	1
The	1
first	1
method	1
of	1
history	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
arbitrarily	1
selected	1
series	1
of	1
continuous	1
events	1
and	1
examine	1
it	1
apart	1
from	1
others,	1
though	1
there	1
is	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
beginning	1
to	1
any	1
event,	1
for	1
one	1
event	1
always	1
flows	1
uninterruptedly	1
from	1
another.	1
	1
The	1
second	1
method	1
is	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
man--a	1
king	1
or	1
a	1
commander--as	1
equivalent	1
to	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
many	1
individual	1
wills;	1
whereas	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
individual	1
wills	1
is	1
never	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
historic	1
personage.	1
	1
Historical	1
science	1
in	1
its	1
endeavor	1
to	1
draw	1
nearer	1
to	1
truth	1
continually	1
takes	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller	1
units	1
for	1
examination.	1
But	1
however	1
small	1
the	1
units	1
it	1
takes,	1
we	1
feel	1
that	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
unit	1
disconnected	1
from	1
others,	1
or	1
to	1
assume	1
a	1
beginning	1
of	1
any	1
phenomenon,	1
or	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
many	1
men	1
is	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
historic	1
personage,	1
is	1
in	1
itself	1
false.	1
	1
It	1
needs	1
no	1
critical	1
exertion	1
to	1
reduce	1
utterly	1
to	1
dust	1
any	1
deductions	1
drawn	1
from	1
history.	1
It	1
is	1
merely	1
necessary	1
to	1
select	1
some	1
larger	1
or	1
smaller	1
unit	1
as	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
observation--as	1
criticism	1
has	1
every	1
right	1
to	1
do,	1
seeing	1
that	1
whatever	1
unit	1
history	1
observes	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
arbitrarily	1
selected.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
taking	1
infinitesimally	1
small	1
units	1
for	1
observation	1
(the	1
differential	1
of	1
history,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
individual	1
tendencies	1
of	1
men)	1
and	1
attaining	1
to	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
integrating	1
them	1
(that	1
is,	1
finding	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
these	1
infinitesimals)	1
can	1
we	1
hope	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
in	1
Europe	1
present	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
movement	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
people.	1
Men	1
leave	1
their	1
customary	1
pursuits,	1
hasten	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
Europe	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
plunder	1
and	1
slaughter	1
one	1
another,	1
triumph	1
and	1
are	1
plunged	1
in	1
despair,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
years	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
altered	1
and	1
presents	1
an	1
intensive	1
movement	1
which	1
first	1
increases	1
and	1
then	1
slackens.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
movement,	1
by	1
what	1
laws	1
was	1
it	1
governed?	1
asks	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
The	1
historians,	1
replying	1
to	1
this	1
question,	1
lay	1
before	1
us	1
the	1
sayings	1
and	1
doings	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
dozen	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
building	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Paris,	1
calling	1
these	1
sayings	1
and	1
doings	1
"the	1
Revolution";	1
then	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
detailed	1
biography	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
of	1
certain	1
people	1
favorable	1
or	1
hostile	1
to	1
him;	1
tell	1
of	1
the	1
influence	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
had	1
on	1
others,	1
and	1
say:	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
this	1
movement	1
took	1
place	1
and	1
those	1
are	1
its	1
laws.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man	1
not	1
only	1
refuses	1
to	1
believe	1
this	1
explanation,	1
but	1
plainly	1
says	1
that	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
explanation	1
is	1
fallacious,	1
because	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
weaker	1
phenomenon	1
is	1
taken	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
a	1
stronger.	1
The	1
sum	1
of	1
human	1
wills	1
produced	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
those	1
wills	1
first	1
tolerated	1
and	1
then	1
destroyed	1
them.	1
	1
"But	1
every	1
time	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
conquests	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
conquerors;	1
every	1
time	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
any	1
state	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
great	1
men,"	1
says	1
history.	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
human	1
reason	1
replies:	1
every	1
time	1
conquerors	1
appear	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
wars,	1
but	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
conquerors	1
caused	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
a	1
war	1
in	1
the	1
personal	1
activity	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
man.	1
Whenever	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
watch	1
and	1
its	1
hands	1
point	1
to	1
ten,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
bells	1
of	1
the	1
neighboring	1
church;	1
but	1
because	1
the	1
bells	1
begin	1
to	1
ring	1
when	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
clock	1
reach	1
ten,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
is	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
watch.	1
	1
Whenever	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
a	1
locomotive	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
whistle	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
valves	1
opening	1
and	1
wheels	1
turning;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
whistling	1
and	1
the	1
turning	1
of	1
wheels	1
are	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
engine.	1
	1
The	1
peasants	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
cold	1
wind	1
blows	1
in	1
late	1
spring	1
because	1
the	1
oaks	1
are	1
budding,	1
and	1
really	1
every	1
spring	1
cold	1
winds	1
do	1
blow	1
when	1
the	1
oak	1
is	1
budding.	1
But	1
though	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
causes	1
the	1
cold	1
winds	1
to	1
blow	1
when	1
the	1
oak	1
buds	1
unfold,	1
I	1
cannot	1
agree	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
that	1
the	1
unfolding	1
of	1
the	1
oak	1
buds	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
cold	1
wind,	1
for	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
beyond	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
buds.	1
I	1
see	1
only	1
a	1
coincidence	1
of	1
occurrences	1
such	1
as	1
happens	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
and	1
however	1
carefully	1
I	1
observe	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
watch,	1
and	1
the	1
valves	1
and	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
engine,	1
and	1
the	1
oak,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
discover	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
ringing,	1
the	1
engine	1
moving,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
winds	1
of	1
spring.	1
To	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
entirely	1
change	1
my	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
and	1
study	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
steam,	1
of	1
the	1
bells,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wind.	1
History	1
must	1
do	1
the	1
same.	1
And	1
attempts	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
made.	1
	1
To	1
study	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
history	1
we	1
must	1
completely	1
change	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
our	1
observation,	1
must	1
leave	1
aside	1
kings,	1
ministers,	1
and	1
generals,	1
and	1
study	1
the	1
common,	1
infinitesimally	1
small	1
elements	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
masses	1
are	1
moved.	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
say	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
advance	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
toward	1
an	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
history;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
only	1
along	1
that	1
path	1
does	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
discovering	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
history	1
lie,	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
yet	1
not	1
a	1
millionth	1
part	1
as	1
much	1
mental	1
effort	1
has	1
been	1
applied	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
by	1
historians	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
devoted	1
to	1
describing	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
various	1
kings,	1
commanders,	1
and	1
ministers	1
and	1
propounding	1
the	1

reflections	1
concerning	1
these	1
actions.	1

to	1
Borodino.	1
The	1
French	1
army	1
pushed	1
on	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
its	1
goal,	1
its	1
impetus	1
ever	1
increasing	1
as	1
it	1
neared	1
its	1
aim,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
velocity	1
of	1
a	1
falling	1
body	1
increases	1
as	1
it	1
approaches	1
the	1
earth.	1
Behind	1
it	1
were	1
seven	1
hundred	1
miles	1
of	1
hunger-stricken,	1
hostile	1
country;	1
ahead	1
were	1
a	1
few	1
dozen	1
miles	1
separating	1
it	1
from	1
its	1
goal.	1
Every	1
soldier	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
felt	1
this	1
and	1
the	1
invasion	1
moved	1
on	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
momentum.	1
	1
The	1
more	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
retreated	1
the	1
more	1
fiercely	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
flared	1
up,	1
and	1
while	1
it	1
retreated	1
the	1
army	1
increased	1
and	1
consolidated.	1
At	1
Borodino	1
a	1
collision	1
took	1
place.	1
Neither	1
army	1
was	1
broken	1
up,	1
but	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
retreated	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
collision	1
as	1
inevitably	1
as	1
a	1
ball	1
recoils	1
after	1
colliding	1
with	1
another	1
having	1
a	1
greater	1
momentum,	1
and	1
with	1
equal	1
inevitability	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
invasion	1
that	1
had	1
advanced	1
with	1
such	1
momentum	1
rolled	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
distance,	1
though	1
the	1
collision	1
had	1
deprived	1
it	1
of	1
all	1
its	1
force.	1
	1
The	1
Russians	1
retreated	1
eighty	1
miles--to	1
beyond	1
Moscow--and	1
the	1
French	1
reached	1
Moscow	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill.	1
For	1
five	1
weeks	1
after	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
battle.	1
The	1
French	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
As	1
a	1
bleeding,	1
mortally	1
wounded	1
animal	1
licks	1
its	1
wounds,	1
they	1
remained	1
inert	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
five	1
weeks,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly,	1
with	1
no	1
fresh	1
reason,	1
fled	1
back:	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
dash	1
for	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
and	1
(after	1
a	1
victory--for	1
at	1
Malo-	1
Yaroslavets	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
conflict	1
again	1
remained	1
theirs)	1
without	1
undertaking	1
a	1
single	1
serious	1
battle,	1
they	1
fled	1
still	1
more	1
rapidly	1
back	1
to	1
Smolensk,	1
beyond	1
Smolensk,	1
beyond	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
beyond	1
Vilna,	1
and	1
farther	1
still.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
of	1
August,	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
army	1
were	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
a	1
victory.	1
Kutuzov	1
reported	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
He	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
a	1
fresh	1
conflict	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
did	1
this	1
not	1
to	1
deceive	1
anyone,	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
beaten,	1
as	1
everyone	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
knew	1
it.	1
	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
next	1
day	1
reports	1
came	1
in	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
of	1
unheard-of	1
losses,	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
half	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
a	1
fresh	1
battle	1
proved	1
physically	1
impossible.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
give	1
battle	1
before	1
information	1
had	1
been	1
collected,	1
the	1
wounded	1
gathered	1
in,	1
the	1
supplies	1
of	1
ammunition	1
replenished,	1
the	1
slain	1
reckoned	1
up,	1
new	1
officers	1
appointed	1
to	1
replace	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
had	1
food	1
and	1
sleep.	1
And	1
meanwhile,	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
battle,	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
advanced	1
of	1
itself	1
upon	1
the	1
Russians,	1
carried	1
forward	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
momentum	1
now	1
seemingly	1
increased	1
in	1
inverse	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
square	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
from	1
its	1
aim.	1
Kutuzov's	1
wish	1
was	1
to	1
attack	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
desired	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
But	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
attack	1
the	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient,	1
there	1
must	1
also	1
be	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
doing	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
possibility	1
did	1
not	1
exist.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
retreat	1
a	1
day's	1
march,	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
retreat	1
another	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
day's	1
march,	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
when	1
the	1
army	1
drew	1
near	1
Moscow--despite	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
in	1
all	1
ranks--the	1
force	1
of	1
circumstances	1
compelled	1
it	1
to	1
retire	1
beyond	1
Moscow.	1
And	1
the	1
troops	1
retired	1
one	1
more,	1
last,	1
day's	1
march,	1
and	1
abandoned	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
For	1
people	1
accustomed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
plans	1
of	1
campaign	1
and	1
battles	1
are	1
made	1
by	1
generals--as	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
sitting	1
over	1
a	1
map	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
may	1
imagine	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
arranged	1
things	1
in	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
battle--the	1
questions	1
present	1
themselves:	1
Why	1
did	1
Kutuzov	1
during	1
the	1
retreat	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
or	1
that?	1
Why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
before	1
reaching	1
Fili?	1
Why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
retire	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
abandoning	1
Moscow?	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
People	1
accustomed	1
to	1
think	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
forget,	1
or	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
the	1
inevitable	1
conditions	1
which	1
always	1
limit	1
the	1
activities	1
of	1
any	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
The	1
activity	1
of	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
does	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
resemble	1
the	1
activity	1
we	1
imagine	1
to	1
ourselves	1
when	1
we	1
sit	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
our	1
studies	1
examining	1
some	1
campaign	1
on	1
the	1
map,	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
on	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
side	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
known	1
locality,	1
and	1
begin	1
our	1
plans	1
from	1
some	1
given	1
moment.	1
A	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
never	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
any	1
event--the	1
position	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
always	1
contemplate	1
it.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
shifting	1
events	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
never	1
can	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
consider	1
the	1
whole	1
import	1
of	1
an	1
event	1
that	1
is	1
occurring.	1
Moment	1
by	1
moment	1
the	1
event	1
is	1
imperceptibly	1
shaping	1
itself,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
this	1
continuous,	1
uninterrupted	1
shaping	1
of	1
events	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
complex	1
play	1
of	1
intrigues,	1
worries,	1
contingencies,	1
authorities,	1
projects,	1
counsels,	1
threats,	1
and	1
deceptions	1
and	1
is	1
continually	1
obliged	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
innumerable	1
questions	1
addressed	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
constantly	1
conflict	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Learned	1
military	1
authorities	1
quite	1
seriously	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
should	1
have	1
moved	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
long	1
before	1
reaching	1
Fili,	1
and	1
that	1
somebody	1
actually	1
submitted	1
such	1
a	1
proposal	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
a	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
especially	1
at	1
a	1
difficult	1
moment,	1
has	1
always	1
before	1
him	1
not	1
one	1
proposal	1
but	1
dozens	1
simultaneously.	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
proposals,	1
based	1
on	1
strategics	1
and	1
tactics,	1
contradict	1
each	1
other.	1
	1
A	1
commander-in-chief's	1
business,	1
it	1
would	1
seem,	1
is	1
simply	1
to	1
choose	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
projects.	1
But	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
do.	1
Events	1
and	1
time	1
do	1
not	1
wait.	1
For	1
instance,	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
it	1
is	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
cross	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
an	1
adjutant	1
gallops	1
up	1
from	1
Miloradovich	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
engage	1
the	1
French	1
or	1
retire.	1
An	1
order	1
must	1
be	1
given	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
that	1
instant.	1
And	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
retreat	1
carries	1
us	1
past	1
the	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
adjutant	1
comes	1
the	1
commissary	1
general	1
asking	1
where	1
the	1
stores	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
hospitals	1
asks	1
where	1
the	1
wounded	1
are	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
a	1
courier	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
brings	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
sovereign	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
abandoning	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
commander-in-	1
chief's	1
rival,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
undermining	1
him	1
(and	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
not	1
merely	1
one	1
but	1
several	1
such),	1
presents	1
a	1
new	1
project	1
diametrically	1
opposed	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
and	1
the	1
commander-in-	1
chief	1
himself	1
needs	1
sleep	1
and	1
refreshment	1
to	1
maintain	1
his	1
energy	1
and	1
a	1
respectable	1
general	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
overlooked	1
in	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
rewards	1
comes	1
to	1
complain,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
pray	1
to	1
be	1
defended,	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
sent	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
locality	1
comes	1
in	1
and	1
gives	1
a	1
report	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
the	1
officer	1
previously	1
sent;	1
and	1
a	1
spy,	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
on	1
reconnaissance,	1
all	1
describe	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
army	1
differently.	1
People	1
accustomed	1
to	1
misunderstand	1
or	1
to	1
forget	1
these	1
inevitable	1
conditions	1
of	1
a	1
commander-in-chief's	1
actions	1
describe	1
to	1
us,	1
for	1
instance,	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
Fili	1
and	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
could,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
quite	1
freely	1
decide	1
whether	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow	1
or	1
defend	1
it;	1
whereas,	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
less	1
than	1
four	1
miles	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
no	1
such	1
question	1
existed.	1
When	1
had	1
that	1
question	1
been	1
settled?	1
At	1
Drissa	1
and	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
most	1
palpably	1
of	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fourth	1
of	1
August	1
at	1
Shevardino	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-	1
sixth	1
at	1
Borodino,	1
and	1
each	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
and	1
minute	1
of	1
the	1
retreat	1
from	1
Borodino	1
to	1
Fili.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
When	1
Ermolov,	1
having	1
been	1
sent	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
position,	1
told	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
there	1
before	1
Moscow	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
retreat,	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
your	1
hand,"	1
said	1
he	1
and,	1
turning	1
it	1
over	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
pulse,	1
added:	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
well,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
Think	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
could	1
not	1
yet	1
admit	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
retreating	1
beyond	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill,	1
four	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
gate	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
Kutuzov	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
by	1
the	1
roadside.	1
A	1
great	1
crowd	1
of	1
generals	1
gathered	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
joined	1
them.	1
This	1
brilliant	1
company	1
separated	1
into	1
several	1
groups	1
who	1
all	1
discussed	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
the	1
position,	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
plans	1
suggested,	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
military	1
questions	1
generally.	1
Though	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
summoned	1
for	1
the	1
purpose,	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
called,	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
war.	1
The	1
conversations	1
all	1
dealt	1
with	1
public	1
questions.	1
If	1
anyone	1
gave	1
or	1
asked	1
for	1
personal	1
news,	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
and	1
they	1
immediately	1
reverted	1
to	1
general	1
matters.	1
No	1
jokes,	1
or	1
laughter,	1
or	1
smiles	1
even,	1
were	1
seen	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
men.	1
They	1
evidently	1
all	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
hold	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
height	1
the	1
situation	1
demanded.	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
groups,	1
while	1
talking	1
among	1
themselves,	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
near	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
(whose	1
bench	1
formed	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
gathering)	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
overhear	1
them.	1
The	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
and	1
sometimes	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
repeat	1
their	1
remarks,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversations	1
or	1
express	1
any	1
opinion.	1
After	1
hearing	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
these	1
groups	1
he	1
generally	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
disappointment,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
anything	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
hear.	1
Some	1
discussed	1
the	1
position	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
chosen,	1
criticizing	1
not	1
the	1
position	1
itself	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
mental	1
capacity	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
chosen	1
it.	1
Others	1
argued	1
that	1
a	1
mistake	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
earlier	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
battle	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
fought	1
two	1
days	1
before.	1
Others	1
again	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Salamanca,	1
which	1
was	1
described	1
by	1
Crosart,	1
a	1
newly	1
arrived	1
Frenchman	1
in	1
a	1
Spanish	1
uniform.	1
(This	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
German	1
princes	1
serving	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
were	1
discussing	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Saragossa	1
and	1
considering	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
defending	1
Moscow	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
manner.)	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
telling	1
a	1
fourth	1
group	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
the	1
city	1
train	1
bands	1
under	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
capital,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
regretting	1
having	1
been	1
left	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening,	1
and	1
that	1
had	1
he	1
known	1
it	1
sooner	1
things	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
different....	1
A	1
fifth	1
group,	1
displaying	1
the	1
profundity	1
of	1
their	1
strategic	1
perceptions,	1
discussed	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
troops	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
to	1
take.	1
A	1
sixth	1
group	1
was	1
talking	1
absolute	1
nonsense.	1
Kutuzov's	1
expression	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
preoccupied	1
and	1
gloomy.	1
From	1
all	1
this	1
talk	1
he	1
saw	1
only	1
one	1
thing:	1
that	1
to	1
defend	1
Moscow	1
was	1
a	1
physical	1
impossibility	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
meaning	1
of	1
those	1
words,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
so	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
senseless	1
commander	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
orders	1
to	1
fight,	1
confusion	1
would	1
result	1
but	1
the	1
battle	1
would	1
still	1
not	1
take	1
place.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
because	1
the	1
commanders	1
not	1
merely	1
all	1
recognized	1
the	1
position	1
to	1
be	1
impossible,	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
conversations	1
were	1
only	1
discussing	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
after	1
its	1
inevitable	1
abandonment.	1
How	1
could	1
the	1
commanders	1
lead	1
their	1
troops	1
to	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
they	1
considered	1
impossible	1
to	1
hold?	1
The	1
lower-grade	1
officers	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
soldiers	1
(who	1
too	1
reason)	1
also	1
considered	1
the	1
position	1
impossible	1
and	1
therefore	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
fight,	1
fully	1
convinced	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
defeat.	1
If	1
Bennigsen	1
insisted	1
on	1
the	1
position	1
being	1
defended	1
and	1
others	1
still	1
discussed	1
it,	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
important	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
pretext	1
for	1
disputes	1
and	1
intrigue.	1
This	1
Kutuzov	1
knew	1
well.	1
	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
had	1
chosen	1
the	1
position,	1
warmly	1
displayed	1
his	1
Russian	1
patriotism	1
(Kutuzov	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
this	1
without	1
wincing)	1
by	1
insisting	1
that	1
Moscow	1
must	1
be	1
defended.	1
His	1
aim	1
was	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
daylight	1
to	1
Kutuzov:	1
if	1
the	1
defense	1
failed,	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
Kutuzov	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
army	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
Sparrow	1
Hills	1
without	1
giving	1
battle;	1
if	1
it	1
succeeded,	1
to	1
claim	1
the	1
success	1
as	1
his	1
own;	1
or	1
if	1
battle	1
were	1
not	1
given,	1
to	1
clear	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
of	1
abandoning	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
this	1
intrigue	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
occupy	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
mind.	1
One	1
terrible	1
question	1
absorbed	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
question	1
he	1
heard	1
no	1
reply	1
from	1
anyone.	1
The	1
question	1
for	1
him	1
now	1
was:	1
"Have	1
I	1
really	1
allowed	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
reach	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
when	1
did	1
I	1
do	1
so?	1
When	1
was	1
it	1
decided?	1
Can	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
yesterday	1
when	1
I	1
ordered	1
Platov	1
to	1
retreat,	1
or	1
was	1
it	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
nap	1
and	1
told	1
Bennigsen	1
to	1
issue	1
orders?	1
Or	1
was	1
it	1
earlier	1
still?...	1
When,	1
when	1
was	1
this	1
terrible	1
affair	1
decided?	1
Moscow	1
must	1
be	1
abandoned.	1
The	1
army	1
must	1
retreat	1
and	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
must	1
be	1
given."	1
To	1
give	1
that	1
terrible	1
order	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
equivalent	1
to	1
resigning	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
he	1
love	1
power	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
accustomed	1
(the	1
honours	1
awarded	1
to	1
Prince	1
Prozorovski,	1
under	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
in	1
Turkey,	1
galled	1
him),	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
save	1
Russia	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
why,	1
against	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
wish	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
commander-in-chief.	1
He	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
maintain	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
these	1
difficult	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
encounter	1
the	1
invincible	1
Napoleon	1
without	1
fear,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
issue.	1
But	1
something	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
decided,	1
and	1
these	1
conversations	1
around	1
him	1
which	1
were	1
assuming	1
too	1
free	1
a	1
character	1
must	1
be	1
stopped.	1
	1
He	1
called	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
generals	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"My	1
head,	1
be	1
it	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
itself,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
bench,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
to	1
Fili	1
where	1
his	1
carriages	1
were	1
waiting.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
The	1
Council	1
of	1
War	1
began	1
to	1
assemble	1
at	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
in	1
the	1
better	1
and	1
roomier	1
part	1
of	1
Andrew	1
Savostyanov's	1
hut.	1
The	1
men,	1
women,	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
peasant	1
family	1
crowded	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
room	1
across	1
the	1
passage.	1
Only	1
Malasha,	1
Andrew's	1
six-year-old	1
granddaughter	1
whom	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
had	1
petted	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
sugar	1
while	1
drinking	1
his	1
tea,	1
remained	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
brick	1
oven	1
in	1
the	1
larger	1
room.	1
Malasha	1
looked	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
oven	1
with	1
shy	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
faces,	1
uniforms,	1
and	1
decorations	1
of	1
the	1
generals,	1
who	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
broad	1
benches	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
under	1
the	1
icons.	1
"Granddad"	1
himself,	1
as	1
Malasha	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
called	1
Kutuzov,	1
sat	1
apart	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
corner	1
behind	1
the	1
oven.	1
He	1
sat,	1
sunk	1
deep	1
in	1
a	1
folding	1
armchair,	1
and	1
continually	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
unbuttoned,	1
still	1
seemed	1
to	1
pinch	1
his	1
neck.	1
Those	1
who	1
entered	1
went	1
up	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
marshal;	1
he	1
pressed	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
some	1
and	1
nodded	1
to	1
others.	1
His	1
adjutant	1
Kaysarov	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
draw	1
back	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
facing	1
Kutuzov,	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
moved	1
his	1
hand	1
angrily	1
and	1
Kaysarov	1
understood	1
that	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
Round	1
the	1
peasant's	1
deal	1
table,	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
maps,	1
plans,	1
pencils,	1
and	1
papers,	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
gathered	1
that	1
the	1
orderlies	1
brought	1
in	1
another	1
bench	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
beside	1
the	1
table.	1
Ermolov,	1
Kaysarov,	1
and	1
Toll,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
arrived,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
this	1
bench.	1
In	1
the	1
foremost	1
place,	1
immediately	1
under	1
the	1
icons,	1
sat	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly,	1
his	1
high	1
forehead	1
merging	1
into	1
his	1
bald	1
crown.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
St.	1
George's	1
Cross	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
looked	1
pale	1
and	1
ill.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
feverish	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
shivering	1
and	1
in	1
pain.	1
Beside	1
him	1
sat	1
Uvarov,	1
who	1
with	1
rapid	1
gesticulations	1
was	1
giving	1
him	1
some	1
information,	1
speaking	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
did.	1
Chubby	1
little	1
Dokhturov	1
was	1
listening	1
attentively	1
with	1
eyebrows	1
raised	1
and	1
arms	1
folded	1
on	1
his	1
stomach.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
sat	1
Count	1
Ostermann-	1
Tolstoy,	1
seemingly	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts.	1
His	1
broad	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
bold	1
features	1
and	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
was	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
hand.	1
Raevski,	1
twitching	1
forward	1
the	1
black	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
temples	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit,	1
glanced	1
now	1
at	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
impatience.	1
Konovnitsyn's	1
firm,	1
handsome,	1
and	1
kindly	1
face	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
tender,	1
sly	1
smile.	1
His	1
glance	1
met	1
Malasha's,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
caused	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
to	1
smile.	1
	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
waiting	1
for	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
inspecting	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
finishing	1
his	1
savory	1
dinner.	1
They	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
four	1
till	1
six	1
o'clock	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
their	1
deliberations	1
all	1
that	1
time	1
but	1
talked	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
of	1
other	1
matters.	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
Bennigsen	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
hut	1
did	1
Kutuzov	1
leave	1
his	1
corner	1
and	1
draw	1
toward	1
the	1
table,	1
but	1
not	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
candles	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
there	1
to	1
light	1
up	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
Bennigsen	1
opened	1
the	1
council	1
with	1
the	1
question:	1
"Are	1
we	1
to	1
abandon	1
Russia's	1
ancient	1
and	1
sacred	1
capital	1
without	1
a	1
struggle,	1
or	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
defend	1
it?"	1
A	1
prolonged	1
and	1
general	1
silence	1
followed.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
frown	1
on	1
every	1
face	1
and	1
only	1
Kutuzov's	1
angry	1
grunts	1
and	1
occasional	1
cough	1
broke	1
the	1
silence.	1
All	1
eyes	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
him.	1
Malasha	1
too	1
looked	1
at	1
"Granddad."	1
She	1
was	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
saw	1
how	1
his	1
face	1
puckered;	1
he	1
seemed	1
about	1
to	1
cry,	1
but	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long.	1
	1
"Russia's	1
ancient	1
and	1
sacred	1
capital!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
said,	1
repeating	1
Bennigsen's	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice	1
and	1
thereby	1
drawing	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
false	1
note	1
in	1
them.	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
that	1
that	1
question	1
has	1
no	1
meaning	1
for	1
a	1
Russian."	1
(He	1
lurched	1
his	1
heavy	1
body	1
forward.)	1
"Such	1
a	1
question	1
cannot	1
be	1
put;	1
it	1
is	1
senseless!	1
The	1
question	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
to	1
meet	1
to	1
discuss	1
is	1
a	1
military	1
one.	1
The	1
question	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
saving	1
Russia.	1
Is	1
it	1
better	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle,	1
or	1
by	1
accepting	1
battle	1
to	1
risk	1
losing	1
the	1
army	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Moscow?	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
question	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
want	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
and	1
he	1
sank	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair.	1
	1
The	1
discussion	1
began.	1
Bennigsen	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
consider	1
his	1
game	1
lost.	1
Admitting	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
Barclay	1
and	1
others	1
that	1
a	1
defensive	1
battle	1
at	1
Fili	1
was	1
impossible,	1
but	1
imbued	1
with	1
Russian	1
patriotism	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
proposed	1
to	1
move	1
troops	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
right	1
flank	1
the	1
following	1
day.	1
Opinions	1
were	1
divided,	1
and	1
arguments	1
were	1
advanced	1
for	1
and	1
against	1
that	1
project.	1
Ermolov,	1
Dokhturov,	1
and	1
Raevski	1
agreed	1
with	1
Bennigsen.	1
Whether	1
feeling	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
before	1
abandoning	1
the	1
capital	1
or	1
guided	1
by	1
other,	1
personal	1
considerations,	1
these	1
generals	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
this	1
council	1
could	1
not	1
alter	1
the	1
inevitable	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
and	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
in	1
effect	1
already	1
abandoned.	1
The	1
other	1
generals,	1
however,	1
understood	1
it	1
and,	1
leaving	1
aside	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
army	1
should	1
take	1
in	1
its	1
retreat.	1
Malasha,	1
who	1
kept	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
before	1
her,	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
differently.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
personal	1
struggle	1
between	1
"Granddad"	1
and	1
"Long-coat"	1
as	1
she	1
termed	1
Bennigsen.	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
grew	1
spiteful	1
when	1
they	1
spoke	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
sided	1
with	1
"Granddad."	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
noticed	1
"Granddad"	1
give	1
Bennigsen	1
a	1
quick,	1
subtle	1
glance,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
her	1
joys	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
"Granddad"	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
"Long-coat"	1
which	1
settled	1
him.	1
Bennigsen	1
suddenly	1
reddened	1
and	1
paced	1
angrily	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
What	1
so	1
affected	1
him	1
was	1
Kutuzov's	1
calm	1
and	1
quiet	1
comment	1
on	1
the	1
advantage	1
or	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
Bennigsen's	1
proposal	1
to	1
move	1
troops	1
by	1
night	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
right	1
wing.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
approve	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
plan.	1
Moving	1
troops	1
in	1
close	1
proximity	1
to	1
an	1
enemy	1
is	1
always	1
dangerous,	1
and	1
military	1
history	1
supports	1
that	1
view.	1
For	1
instance..."	1
Kutuzov	1
seemed	1
to	1
reflect,	1
searching	1
for	1
an	1
example,	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
clear,	1
naive	1
look	1
at	1
Bennigsen	1
he	1
added:	1
"Oh	1
yes;	1
take	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Friedland,	1
which	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
count	1
well	1
remembers,	1
and	1
which	1
was...	1
not	1
fully	1
successful,	1
only	1
because	1
our	1
troops	1
were	1
rearranged	1
too	1
near	1
the	1
enemy..."	1
	1
There	1
followed	1
a	1
momentary	1
pause,	1
which	1
seemed	1
very	1
long	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
The	1
discussion	1
recommenced,	1
but	1
pauses	1
frequently	1
occurred	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said.	1
	1
During	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
pauses	1
Kutuzov	1
heaved	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
as	1
if	1
preparing	1
to	1
speak.	1
They	1
all	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
gentlemen,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
who	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
broken	1
crockery,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
rising	1
slowly	1
he	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
"Gentlemen,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
your	1
views.	1
Some	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
me.	1
But	1
I,"	1
he	1
paused,	1
"by	1
the	1
authority	1
entrusted	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
Sovereign	1
and	1
country,	1
order	1
a	1
retreat."	1
	1
After	1
that	1
the	1
generals	1
began	1
to	1
disperse	1
with	1
the	1
solemnity	1
and	1
circumspect	1
silence	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
leaving,	1
after	1
a	1
funeral.	1
	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
generals,	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
strain	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
had	1
spoken	1
during	1
the	1
council,	1
communicated	1
something	1
to	1
their	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
Malasha,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
expected	1
for	1
supper,	1
climbed	1
carefully	1
backwards	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
oven,	1
her	1
bare	1
little	1
feet	1
catching	1
at	1
its	1
projections,	1
and	1
slipping	1
between	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
she	1
darted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
dismissed	1
the	1
generals	1
Kutuzov	1
sat	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
thinking	1
always	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
terrible	1
question:	1
"When,	1
when	1
did	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow	1
become	1
inevitable?	1
When	1
was	1
that	1
done	1
which	1
settled	1
the	1
matter?	1
And	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
this,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant	1
Schneider	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
came	1
in	1
late	1
that	1
night.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
this!	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
this	1
would	1
happen."	1
	1
"You	1
should	1
take	1
some	1
rest,	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness,"	1
replied	1
Schneider.	1
	1
"But	1
no!	1
They	1
shall	1
eat	1
horseflesh	1
yet,	1
like	1
the	1
Turks!"	1
exclaimed	1
Kutuzov	1
without	1
replying,	1
striking	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
podgy	1
fist.	1
"They	1
shall	1
too,	1
if	1
only..."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
At	1
that	1
very	1
time,	1
in	1
circumstances	1
even	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
retreating	1
without	1
a	1
battle,	1
namely	1
the	1
evacuation	1
and	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
Rostopchin,	1
who	1
is	1
usually	1
represented	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
instigator	1
of	1
that	1
event,	1
acted	1
in	1
an	1
altogether	1
different	1
manner	1
from	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
the	1
abandonment	1
and	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
was	1
as	1
inevitable	1
as	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
beyond	1
Moscow	1
without	1
fighting.	1
	1
Every	1
Russian	1
might	1
have	1
predicted	1
it,	1
not	1
by	1
reasoning	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
feeling	1
implanted	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
The	1
same	1
thing	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
Moscow	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
towns	1
and	1
villages	1
on	1
Russian	1
soil	1
beginning	1
with	1
Smolensk,	1
without	1
the	1
participation	1
of	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
and	1
his	1
broadsheets.	1
The	1
people	1
awaited	1
the	1
enemy	1
unconcernedly,	1
did	1
not	1
riot	1
or	1
become	1
excited	1
or	1
tear	1
anyone	1
to	1
pieces,	1
but	1
faced	1
its	1
fate,	1
feeling	1
within	1
it	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
find	1
what	1
it	1
should	1
do	1
at	1
that	1
most	1
difficult	1
moment.	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
enemy	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
wealthy	1
classes	1
went	1
away	1
abandoning	1
their	1
property,	1
while	1
the	1
poorer	1
remained	1
and	1
burned	1
and	1
destroyed	1
what	1
was	1
left.	1
	1
The	1
consciousness	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
so	1
was	1
and	1
is	1
present	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
every	1
Russian.	1
And	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
a	1
foreboding	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
taken,	1
was	1
present	1
in	1
Russian	1
Moscow	1
society	1
in	1
1812.	1
Those	1
who	1
had	1
quitted	1
Moscow	1
already	1
in	1
July	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
August	1
showed	1
that	1
they	1
expected	1
this.	1
Those	1
who	1
went	1
away,	1
taking	1
what	1
they	1
could	1
and	1
abandoning	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
half	1
their	1
belongings,	1
did	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
latent	1
patriotism	1
which	1
expresses	1
itself	1
not	1
by	1
phrases	1
or	1
by	1
giving	1
one's	1
children	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
fatherland	1
and	1
similar	1
unnatural	1
exploits,	1
but	1
unobtrusively,	1
simply,	1
organically,	1
and	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
always	1
produces	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
results.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
disgraceful	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
danger;	1
only	1
cowards	1
are	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
Moscow,"	1
they	1
were	1
told.	1
In	1
his	1
broadsheets	1
Rostopchin	1
impressed	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
was	1
shameful.	1
They	1
were	1
ashamed	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
cowards,	1
ashamed	1
to	1
leave,	1
but	1
still	1
they	1
left,	1
knowing	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
Why	1
did	1
they	1
go?	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
scared	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
accounts	1
of	1
horrors	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
committed	1
in	1
conquered	1
countries.	1
The	1
first	1
people	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
were	1
the	1
rich	1
educated	1
people	1
who	1
knew	1
quite	1
well	1
that	1
Vienna	1
and	1
Berlin	1
had	1
remained	1
intact	1
and	1
that	1
during	1
Napoleon's	1
occupation	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
had	1
spent	1
their	1
time	1
pleasantly	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
charming	1
Frenchmen	1
whom	1
the	1
Russians,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
Russian	1
ladies,	1
then	1
liked	1
so	1
much.	1
	1
They	1
went	1
away	1
because	1
for	1
Russians	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
things	1
would	1
go	1
well	1
or	1
ill	1
under	1
French	1
rule	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
It	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
French	1
rule,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
worst	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
happen.	1
They	1
went	1
away	1
even	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
rapidly	1
after	1
it,	1
despite	1
Rostopchin's	1
calls	1
to	1
defend	1
Moscow	1
or	1
the	1
announcement	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
wonder-working	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Iberian	1
Mother	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
fight,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
balloons	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
despite	1
all	1
the	1
nonsense	1
Rostopchin	1
wrote	1
in	1
his	1
broadsheets.	1
They	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
fight,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
succeed	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
take	1
young	1
ladies	1
and	1
house	1
serfs	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
quarter	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
fight	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
away,	1
sorry	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
abandon	1
their	1
property	1
to	1
destruction.	1
They	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
tremendous	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
immense	1
and	1
wealthy	1
city	1
being	1
given	1
over	1
to	1
destruction,	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
city	1
with	1
wooden	1
buildings	1
was	1
certain	1
when	1
abandoned	1
by	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
to	1
be	1
burned.	1
They	1
went	1
away	1
each	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
their	1
going	1
away	1
that	1
the	1
momentous	1
event	1
was	1
accomplished	1
that	1
will	1
always	1
remain	1
the	1
greatest	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people.	1
The	1
lady	1
who,	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
stopped	1
by	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
orders,	1
had	1
already	1
in	1
June	1
moved	1
with	1
her	1
Negroes	1
and	1
her	1
women	1
jesters	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
her	1
Saratov	1
estate,	1
with	1
a	1
vague	1
consciousness	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
Bonaparte's	1
servant,	1
was	1
really,	1
simply,	1
and	1
truly	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
great	1
work	1
which	1
saved	1
Russia.	1
But	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
who	1
now	1
taunted	1
those	1
who	1
left	1
Moscow	1
and	1
now	1
had	1
the	1
government	1
offices	1
removed;	1
now	1
distributed	1
quite	1
useless	1
weapons	1
to	1
the	1
drunken	1
rabble;	1
now	1
had	1
processions	1
displaying	1
the	1
icons,	1
and	1
now	1
forbade	1
Father	1
Augustin	1
to	1
remove	1
icons	1
or	1
the	1
relics	1
of	1
saints;	1
now	1
seized	1
all	1
the	1
private	1
carts	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
on	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty-six	1
of	1
them	1
removed	1
the	1
balloon	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
constructed	1
by	1
Leppich;	1
now	1
hinted	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
burn	1
Moscow	1
and	1
related	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
now	1
wrote	1
a	1
proclamation	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
solemnly	1
upbraiding	1
them	1
for	1
having	1
destroyed	1
his	1
Orphanage;	1
now	1
claimed	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
having	1
hinted	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
burn	1
Moscow	1
and	1
now	1
repudiated	1
the	1
deed;	1
now	1
ordered	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
catch	1
all	1
spies	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
now	1
reproached	1
them	1
for	1
doing	1
so;	1
now	1
expelled	1
all	1
the	1
French	1
residents	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
now	1
allowed	1
Madame	1
Aubert-Chalme	1
(the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
French	1
colony	1
in	1
Moscow)	1
to	1
remain,	1
but	1
ordered	1
the	1
venerable	1
old	1
postmaster	1
Klyucharev	1
to	1
be	1
arrested	1
and	1
exiled	1
for	1
no	1
particular	1
offense;	1
now	1
assembled	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
now,	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
them,	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
killed	1
and	1
himself	1
drove	1
away	1
by	1
a	1
back	1
gate;	1
now	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
survive	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
now	1
wrote	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Helene,	1
having	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
court	1
from	1
Vilna	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
a	1
difficult	1
position.	1
	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
she	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
special	1
protection	1
of	1
a	1
grandee	1
who	1
occupied	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
posts	1
in	1
the	1
Empire.	1
In	1
Vilna	1
she	1
had	1
formed	1
an	1
intimacy	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
foreign	1
prince.	1
When	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
both	1
the	1
magnate	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
were	1
there,	1
and	1
both	1
claimed	1
their	1
rights.	1
Helene	1
was	1
faced	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
problem--how	1
to	1
preserve	1
her	1
intimacy	1
with	1
both	1
without	1
offending	1
either.	1
	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
difficult	1
or	1
even	1
impossible	1
to	1
another	1
woman	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
the	1
least	1
embarrassment	1
to	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova,	1
who	1
evidently	1
deserved	1
her	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
woman.	1
Had	1
she	1
attempted	1
concealment,	1
or	1
tried	1
to	1
extricate	1
herself	1
from	1
her	1
awkward	1
position	1
by	1
cunning,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
spoiled	1
her	1
case	1
by	1
acknowledging	1
herself	1
guilty.	1
But	1
Helene,	1
like	1
a	1
really	1
great	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
do	1
whatever	1
he	1
pleases,	1
at	1
once	1
assumed	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
to	1
be	1
correct,	1
as	1
she	1
sincerely	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
that	1
everyone	1
else	1
was	1
to	1
blame.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
young	1
foreigner	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
reproach	1
her,	1
she	1
lifted	1
her	1
beautiful	1
head	1
and,	1
half	1
turning	1
to	1
him,	1
said	1
firmly:	1
"That's	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
man--selfish	1
and	1
cruel!	1
I	1
expected	1
nothing	1
else.	1
A	1
woman	1
sacrifices	1
herself	1
for	1
you,	1
she	1
suffers,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
her	1
reward!	1
What	1
right	1
have	1
you,	1
monseigneur,	1
to	1
demand	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
attachments	1
and	1
friendships?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
me!"	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
Helene	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
other	1
sentiments	1
for	1
me	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
father,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
shut	1
my	1
door	1
on	1
him.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
repay	1
kindness	1
with	1
ingratitude!	1
Know,	1
monseigneur,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
relates	1
to	1
my	1
intimate	1
feelings	1
I	1
render	1
account	1
only	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
conscience,"	1
she	1
concluded,	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
beautiful,	1
fully	1
expanded	1
bosom	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven.	1
	1
"But	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
listen	1
to	1
me!"	1
	1
"Marry	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
slave!"	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
impossible."	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
deign	1
to	1
demean	1
yourself	1
by	1
marrying	1
me,	1
you..."	1
said	1
Helene,	1
beginning	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
her,	1
but	1
Helene,	1
as	1
if	1
quite	1
distraught,	1
said	1
through	1
her	1
tears	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
marrying,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
precedents	1
(there	1
were	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
time	1
very	1
few,	1
but	1
she	1
mentioned	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
exalted	1
personages),	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
her	1
husband's	1
wife,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
sacrificed.	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
law,	1
religion..."	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
already	1
yielding.	1
	1
"The	1
law,	1
religion...	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
invented	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
can't	1
arrange	1
that?"	1
said	1
Helene.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
so	1
simple	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
not	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
applied	1
for	1
advice	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
intimate	1
terms.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
enchanting	1
fetes	1
which	1
Helene	1
gave	1
at	1
her	1
country	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Stone	1
Island,	1
the	1
charming	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
Jobert,	1
a	1
man	1
no	1
longer	1
young,	1
with	1
snow	1
white	1
hair	1
and	1
brilliant	1
black	1
eyes,	1
a	1
Jesuit	1
a	1
robe	1
courte	1
*	1
was	1
presented	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
illuminations	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
music	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
of	1
Christ,	1
of	1
the	1
Sacred	1
Heart,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
consolations	1
the	1
one	1
true	1
Catholic	1
religion	1
affords	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
next.	1
Helene	1
was	1
touched,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
tears	1
rose	1
to	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
Jobert	1
and	1
their	1
voices	1
trembled.	1
A	1
dance,	1
for	1
which	1
her	1
partner	1
came	1
to	1
seek	1
her,	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
her	1
discourse	1
with	1
her	1
future	1
directeur	1
de	1
conscience,	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
evening	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
Jobert	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
Helene	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
alone,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
often	1
came	1
again.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Lay	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
countess	1
to	1
a	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
church,	1
where	1
she	1
knelt	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
led.	1
The	1
enchanting,	1
middle-aged	1
Frenchman	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
and,	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
afterward	1
described	1
it,	1
she	1
felt	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
fresh	1
breeze	1
wafted	1
into	1
her	1
soul.	1
It	1
was	1
explained	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
la	1
grace.	1
	1
After	1
that	1
a	1
long-frocked	1
abbe	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
confessed	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
absolved	1
her	1
from	1
her	1
sins.	1
Next	1
day	1
she	1
received	1
a	1
box	1
containing	1
the	1
Sacred	1
Host,	1
which	1
was	1
left	1
at	1
her	1
house	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
partake	1
of.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
Helene	1
learned	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
Catholic	1
Church	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
the	1
Pope	1
himself	1
would	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
would	1
send	1
her	1
a	1
certain	1
document.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
around	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
all	1
the	1
attention	1
devoted	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
so	1
many	1
clever	1
men	1
and	1
expressed	1
in	1
such	1
pleasant,	1
refined	1
ways,	1
and	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
dove-like	1
purity	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
(she	1
wore	1
only	1
white	1
dresses	1
and	1
white	1
ribbons	1
all	1
that	1
time)	1
gave	1
her	1
pleasure,	1
but	1
her	1
pleasure	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
forget	1
her	1
aim.	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
happens	1
in	1
contests	1
of	1
cunning	1
that	1
a	1
stupid	1
person	1
gets	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
cleverer	1
ones,	1
Helene--having	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
main	1
object	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
trouble	1
was,	1
after	1
converting	1
her	1
to	1
Catholicism,	1
to	1
obtain	1
money	1
from	1
her	1
for	1
Jesuit	1
institutions	1
(as	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
received	1
indications)-before	1
parting	1
with	1
her	1
money	1
insisted	1
that	1
the	1
various	1
operations	1
necessary	1
to	1
free	1
her	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
should	1
be	1
performed.	1
In	1
her	1
view	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
every	1
religion	1
was	1
merely	1
to	1
preserve	1
certain	1
proprieties	1
while	1
affording	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
human	1
desires.	1
And	1
with	1
this	1
aim,	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
talks	1
with	1
her	1
Father	1
Confessor,	1
she	1
insisted	1
on	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question,	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
was	1
she	1
bound	1
by	1
her	1
marriage?	1
	1
They	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
by	1
a	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
scent	1
of	1
flowers	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window.	1
Helene	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
white	1
dress,	1
transparent	1
over	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
bosom.	1
The	1
abbe,	1
a	1
well-fed	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
plump,	1
clean-shaven	1
chin,	1
a	1
pleasant	1
firm	1
mouth,	1
and	1
white	1
hands	1
meekly	1
folded	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
sat	1
close	1
to	1
Helene	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
a	1
peaceful	1
look	1
of	1
delight	1
at	1
her	1
beauty,	1
occasionally	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
explained	1
his	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
Helene	1
with	1
an	1
uneasy	1
smile	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
his	1
plump,	1
clean-shaven,	1
blackish	1
cheeks	1
and	1
every	1
moment	1
expected	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
fresh	1
turn.	1
But	1
the	1
abbe,	1
though	1
he	1
evidently	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
his	1
companion,	1
was	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
mastery	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
The	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
Confessor's	1
arguments	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
"Ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
undertaking,	1
you	1
made	1
a	1
vow	1
of	1
conjugal	1
fidelity	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
by	1
entering	1
the	1
married	1
state	1
without	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
religious	1
significance	1
of	1
marriage,	1
committed	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
sacrilege.	1
That	1
marriage	1
lacked	1
the	1
dual	1
significance	1
it	1
should	1
have	1
had.	1
Yet	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
your	1
vow	1
was	1
binding.	1
You	1
swerved	1
from	1
it.	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
commit	1
by	1
so	1
acting?	1
A	1
venial,	1
or	1
a	1
mortal,	1
sin?	1
A	1
venial	1
sin,	1
for	1
you	1
acted	1
without	1
evil	1
intention.	1
If	1
now	1
you	1
married	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
bearing	1
children,	1
your	1
sin	1
might	1
be	1
forgiven.	1
But	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
again	1
a	1
twofold	1
one:	1
firstly..."	1
	1
But	1
suddenly	1
Helene,	1
who	1
was	1
getting	1
bored,	1
said	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
bewitching	1
smiles:	1
"But	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
having	1
espoused	1
the	1
true	1
religion	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
bound	1
by	1
what	1
a	1
false	1
religion	1
laid	1
upon	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
director	1
of	1
her	1
conscience	1
was	1
astounded	1
at	1
having	1
the	1
case	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
thus	1
with	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
Columbus'	1
egg.	1
He	1
was	1
delighted	1
at	1
the	1
unexpected	1
rapidity	1
of	1
his	1
pupil's	1
progress,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
abandon	1
the	1
edifice	1
of	1
argument	1
he	1
had	1
laboriously	1
constructed.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
understand	1
one	1
another,	1
Countess,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
began	1
refuting	1
his	1
spiritual	1
daughter's	1
arguments.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Helene	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
from	1
the	1
ecclesiastical	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
directors	1
were	1
making	1
difficulties	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
apprehensive	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
would	1
be	1
regarded	1
by	1
the	1
secular	1
authorities.	1
	1
So	1
she	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
prepare	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
society.	1
She	1
provoked	1
the	1
jealousy	1
of	1
the	1
elderly	1
magnate	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
other	1
suitor;	1
that	1
is,	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
right	1
over	1
her	1
was	1
to	1
marry	1
her.	1
The	1
elderly	1
magnate	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
as	1
much	1
taken	1
aback	1
by	1
this	1
suggestion	1
of	1
marriage	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
whose	1
husband	1
was	1
alive,	1
as	1
the	1
younger	1
man	1
had	1
been,	1
but	1
Helene's	1
imperturbable	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
as	1
marrying	1
a	1
maiden	1
had	1
its	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
too.	1
Had	1
Helene	1
herself	1
shown	1
the	1
least	1
sign	1
of	1
hesitation,	1
shame,	1
or	1
secrecy,	1
her	1
cause	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
been	1
lost;	1
but	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
she	1
show	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
secrecy	1
or	1
shame,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
with	1
good-natured	1
naivete	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
intimate	1
friends	1
(and	1
these	1
were	1
all	1
Petersburg)	1
that	1
both	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
the	1
magnate	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
both	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
grieving	1
either.	1
	1
A	1
rumor	1
immediately	1
spread	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
not	1
that	1
Helene	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
divorced	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
(had	1
such	1
a	1
report	1
spread	1
many	1
would	1
have	1
opposed	1
so	1
illegal	1
an	1
intention)	1
but	1
simply	1
that	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
interesting	1
Helene	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
she	1
should	1
marry.	1
The	1
question	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
whether	1
this	1
was	1
possible,	1
but	1
only	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
better	1
match	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
would	1
be	1
regarded	1
at	1
court.	1
There	1
were,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
some	1
rigid	1
individuals	1
unable	1
to	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
question,	1
who	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
project	1
a	1
desecration	1
of	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
marriage,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
such	1
and	1
they	1
remained	1
silent,	1
while	1
the	1
majority	1
were	1
interested	1
in	1
Helene's	1
good	1
fortune	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
match	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
advantageous.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
to	1
remarry	1
while	1
one	1
had	1
a	1
husband	1
living	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
discuss,	1
for	1
that	1
question	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
settled	1
by	1
people	1
"wiser	1
than	1
you	1
or	1
me,"	1
as	1
they	1
said,	1
and	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
that	1
decision	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
risk	1
exposing	1
one's	1
stupidity	1
and	1
incapacity	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
Only	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
Akhrosimova,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
that	1
summer	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sons,	1
allowed	1
herself	1
plainly	1
to	1
express	1
an	1
opinion	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
one.	1
Meeting	1
Helene	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
she	1
stopped	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and,	1
amid	1
general	1
silence,	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
gruff	1
voice:	1
"So	1
wives	1
of	1
living	1
men	1
have	1
started	1
marrying	1
again!	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
have	1
invented	1
a	1
novelty?	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
forestalled,	1
my	1
dear!	1
It	1
was	1
thought	1
of	1
long	1
ago.	1
It	1
is	1
done	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
brothels,"	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
turning	1
up	1
her	1
wide	1
sleeves	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
threatening	1
gesture	1
and	1
glancing	1
sternly	1
round,	1
moved	1
across	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Though	1
people	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
she	1
was	1
regarded	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
a	1
buffoon,	1
and	1
so	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
they	1
only	1
noticed,	1
and	1
repeated	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
the	1
one	1
coarse	1
word	1
she	1
had	1
used,	1
supposing	1
the	1
whole	1
sting	1
of	1
her	1
remark	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
that	1
word.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
of	1
late	1
very	1
often	1
forgot	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
repeated	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
a	1
hundred	1
times,	1
remarked	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
whenever	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
see	1
her:	1
	1
"Helene,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you,"	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
lead	1
her	1
aside,	1
drawing	1
her	1
hand	1
downward.	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
certain	1
projects	1
concerning...	1
you	1
know.	1
Well	1
my	1
dear	1
child,	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
your	1
father's	1
heart	1
rejoices	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
you...	1
You	1
have	1
suffered	1
so	1
much....	1
But,	1
my	1
dear	1
child,	1
consult	1
only	1
your	1
own	1
heart.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say,"	1
and	1
concealing	1
his	1
unvarying	1
emotion	1
he	1
would	1
press	1
his	1
cheek	1
against	1
his	1
daughter's	1
and	1
move	1
away.	1
	1
Bilibin,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
his	1
reputation	1
of	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
clever	1
man,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
disinterested	1
friends	1
so	1
brilliant	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
Helene	1
always	1
has--men	1
friends	1
who	1
can	1
never	1
change	1
into	1
lovers--once	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
intimate	1
gathering.	1
	1
"Listen,	1
Bilibin,"	1
said	1
Helene	1
(she	1
always	1
called	1
friends	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
by	1
their	1
surnames),	1
and	1
she	1
touched	1
his	1
coat	1
sleeve	1
with	1
her	1
white,	1
beringed	1
fingers.	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
a	1
sister,	1
what	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do.	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
two?"	1
	1
Bilibin	1
wrinkled	1
up	1
the	1
skin	1
over	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
pondered,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
taking	1
me	1
unawares,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"As	1
a	1
true	1
friend,	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
and	1
thought	1
again	1
about	1
your	1
affair.	1
You	1
see,	1
if	1
you	1
marry	1
the	1
prince"--he	1
meant	1
the	1
younger	1
man--and	1
he	1
crooked	1
one	1
finger,	1
"you	1
forever	1
lose	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
marrying	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
displease	1
the	1
court	1
besides.	1
(You	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
connection.)	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
marry	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
his	1
last	1
days	1
happy,	1
and	1
as	1
widow	1
of	1
the	1
Grand...	1
the	1
prince	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
making	1
a	1
mesalliance	1
by	1
marrying	1
you,"	1
and	1
Bilibin	1
smoothed	1
out	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
true	1
friend!"	1
said	1
Helene	1
beaming,	1
and	1
again	1
touching	1
Bilibin's	1
sleeve.	1
"But	1
I	1
love	1
them,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
distress	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
them	1
both."	1
	1
Bilibin	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
not	1
even	1
he	1
could	1
help	1
in	1
that	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"Une	1
maitresse-femme!	1
*	1
That's	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
putting	1
things	1
squarely.	1
She	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
all	1
three	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
	1
*	1
A	1
masterly	1
woman.	1
	1
"But	1
tell	1
me,	1
how	1
will	1
your	1
husband	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
matter?"	1
Bilibin	1
asked,	1
his	1
reputation	1
being	1
so	1
well	1
established	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
fear	1
to	1
ask	1
so	1
naive	1
a	1
question.	1
"Will	1
he	1
agree?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
so!"	1
said	1
Helene,	1
who	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
imagined	1
that	1
Pierre	1
too	1
loved	1
her.	1
"He	1
will	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
Bilibin	1
puckered	1
his	1
skin	1
in	1
preparation	1
for	1
something	1
witty.	1
	1
"Even	1
divorce	1
you?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Helene	1
laughed.	1
	1
Among	1
those	1
who	1
ventured	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
justifiability	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
marriage	1
was	1
Helene's	1
mother,	1
Princess	1
Kuragina.	1
She	1
was	1
continually	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy	1
of	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
jealousy	1
concerned	1
a	1
subject	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
heart,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
reconcile	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
idea.	1
She	1
consulted	1
a	1
Russian	1
priest	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
divorce	1
and	1
remarriage	1
during	1
a	1
husband's	1
lifetime,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
delight	1
showed	1
her	1
a	1
text	1
in	1
the	1
Gospel	1
which	1
(as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him)	1
plainly	1
forbids	1
remarriage	1
while	1
the	1
husband	1
is	1
alive.	1
	1
Armed	1
with	1
these	1
arguments,	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
unanswerable,	1
she	1
drove	1
to	1
her	1
daughter's	1
early	1
one	1
morning	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
alone.	1
	1
Having	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
objections,	1
Helene	1
smiled	1
blandly	1
and	1
ironically.	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
says	1
plainly:	1
'Whosoever	1
shall	1
marry	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
divorced...'"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
princess.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Maman,	1
ne	1
dites	1
pas	1
de	1
betises.	1
Vous	1
ne	1
comprenez	1
rien.	1
Dans	1
ma	1
position	1
j'ai	1
des	1
devoirs,"	1
*	1
said	1
Helene	1
changing	1
from	1
Russian,	1
in	1
which	1
language	1
she	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
case	1
did	1
not	1
sound	1
quite	1
clear,	1
into	1
French	1
which	1
suited	1
it	1
better.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Oh,	1
Mamma,	1
don't	1
talk	1
nonsense!	1
You	1
don't	1
understand	1
anything.	1
In	1
my	1
position	1
I	1
have	1
obligations."	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear...."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Mamma,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don't	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Father,	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
grant	1
dispensations..."	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
the	1
lady	1
companion	1
who	1
lived	1
with	1
Helene	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
His	1
Highness	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
	1
"Non,	1
dites-lui	1
que	1
je	1
ne	1
veux	1
pas	1
le	1
voir,	1
que	1
je	1
suis	1
furieuse	1
contre	1
lui,	1
parce	1
qu'il	1
m'a	1
manque	1
parole."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"No,	1
tell	1
him	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
furious	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
keeping	1
his	1
word	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Comtesse,	1
a	1
tout	1
peche	1
misericorde,"	1
*	1
said	1
a	1
fair-haired	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
face	1
and	1
nose,	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Countess,	1
there	1
is	1
mercy	1
for	1
every	1
sin."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
princess	1
rose	1
respectfully	1
and	1
curtsied.	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
her.	1
The	1
princess	1
nodded	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
sidled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
she	1
is	1
right,"	1
thought	1
the	1
old	1
princess,	1
all	1
her	1
convictions	1
dissipated	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
His	1
Highness.	1
"She	1
is	1
right,	1
but	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
in	1
our	1
irrecoverable	1
youth	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it?	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
simple,"	1
she	1
thought	1
as	1
she	1
got	1
into	1
her	1
carriage.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
August	1
Helene's	1
affairs	1
were	1
clearly	1
defined	1
and	1
she	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
her	1
husband--who,	1
as	1
she	1
imagined,	1
loved	1
her	1
very	1
much--informing	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
intention	1
to	1
marry	1
N.N.	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
embraced	1
the	1
one	1
true	1
faith,	1
and	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
formalities	1
necessary	1
for	1
a	1
divorce,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
bearer	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
to	1
have	1
you,	1
my	1
friend,	1
in	1
His	1
holy	1
and	1
powerful	1
keeping--Your	1
friend	1
Helene.	1
	1
This	1
letter	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
house	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
run	1
down	1
from	1
Raevski's	1
battery	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
a	1
gully	1
to	1
Knyazkovo	1
with	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
reached	1
the	1
dressing	1
station,	1
and	1
seeing	1
blood	1
and	1
hearing	1
cries	1
and	1
groans	1
hurried	1
on,	1
still	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
crowds	1
of	1
soldiers.	1
	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
now	1
desired	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
from	1
the	1
terrible	1
sensations	1
amid	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
sleep	1
quietly	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
bed.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
would	1
he	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
felt.	1
But	1
such	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
Though	1
shells	1
and	1
bullets	1
did	1
not	1
whistle	1
over	1
the	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
still	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
there	1
was	1
what	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle.	1
There	1
were	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
suffering,	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
strangely	1
indifferent	1
faces,	1
the	1
same	1
blood,	1
the	1
same	1
soldiers'	1
overcoats,	1
the	1
same	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing	1
which,	1
though	1
distant	1
now,	1
still	1
aroused	1
terror,	1
and	1
besides	1
this	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
foul	1
air	1
and	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
Having	1
gone	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
miles	1
along	1
the	1
Mozhaysk	1
road,	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
roadside.	1
	1
Dusk	1
had	1
fallen,	1
and	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
guns	1
died	1
away.	1
Pierre	1
lay	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
shadows	1
that	1
moved	1
past	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
He	1
was	1
continually	1
imagining	1
that	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
was	1
flying	1
toward	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
terrific	1
whizz,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
shuddered	1
and	1
sat	1
up.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
how	1
long	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
three	1
soldiers,	1
having	1
brought	1
some	1
firewood,	1
settled	1
down	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
lighting	1
a	1
fire.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
threw	1
sidelong	1
glances	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
got	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
burn	1
and	1
placed	1
an	1
iron	1
pot	1
on	1
it	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
broke	1
some	1
dried	1
bread	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
little	1
dripping.	1
The	1
pleasant	1
odor	1
of	1
greasy	1
viands	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
smoke.	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
sighed.	1
The	1
three	1
soldiers	1
were	1
eating	1
and	1
talking	1
among	1
themselves,	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
may	1
you	1
be?"	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
suddenly	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
evidently	1
meaning	1
what	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
had	1
in	1
mind,	1
namely:	1
"If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
eat	1
we'll	1
give	1
you	1
some	1
food,	1
only	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
whether	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
honest	1
man."	1
	1
"I,	1
I..."	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
feeling	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
minimize	1
his	1
social	1
position	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
better	1
understood	1
by	1
them.	1
"By	1
rights	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
militia	1
officer,	1
but	1
my	1
men	1
are	1
not	1
here.	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
have	1
lost	1
them."	1
	1
"There	1
now!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
	1
Another	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Would	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
mash?"	1
the	1
first	1
soldier	1
asked,	1
and	1
handed	1
Pierre	1
a	1
wooden	1
spoon	1
after	1
licking	1
it	1
clean.	1
	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
began	1
eating	1
the	1
mash,	1
as	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
cauldron,	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
more	1
delicious	1
than	1
any	1
food	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
tasted.	1
As	1
he	1
sat	1
bending	1
greedily	1
over	1
it,	1
helping	1
himself	1
to	1
large	1
spoonfuls	1
and	1
chewing	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"Where	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
to?	1
Tell	1
us!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"To	1
Mozhaysk."	1
	1
"You're	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
aren't	1
you?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"And	1
what's	1
your	1
name?"	1
	1
"Peter	1
Kirilych."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
Peter	1
Kirilych,	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
us,	1
we'll	1
take	1
you	1
there."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
total	1
darkness	1
the	1
soldiers	1
walked	1
with	1
Pierre	1
to	1
Mozhaysk.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
got	1
near	1
Mozhaysk	1
and	1
began	1
ascending	1
the	1
steep	1
hill	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
the	1
cocks	1
were	1
already	1
crowing.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
his	1
inn	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
passed	1
it.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
soon	1
have	1
remembered	1
this,	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
state	1
of	1
forgetfulness,	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
halfway	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
stumbled	1
upon	1
his	1
groom,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
was	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
inn.	1
The	1
groom	1
recognized	1
Pierre	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
by	1
his	1
white	1
hat.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Why,	1
we	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
despair!	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
on	1
foot?	1
And	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going,	1
please?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
stopped.	1
	1
"So	1
you've	1
found	1
your	1
folk?"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
Peter	1
Kirilych--isn't	1
it?"	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
Peter	1
Kirilych!"	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
the	1
other	1
voices	1
repeat.	1
	1
"Good-bye!"	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
turned	1
with	1
his	1
groom	1
toward	1
the	1
inn.	1
	1
"I	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
something!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"No,	1
better	1
not!"	1
said	1
another,	1
inner	1
voice.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
room	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
inn,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
occupied.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
and,	1
covering	1
himself	1
up	1
head	1
and	1
all,	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
carriage.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
Pierre	1
laid	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
before	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
falling	1
asleep,	1
but	1
suddenly,	1
almost	1
with	1
the	1
distinctness	1
of	1
reality,	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
boom,	1
boom,	1
boom	1
of	1
firing,	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
projectiles,	1
groans	1
and	1
cries,	1
and	1
smelled	1
blood	1
and	1
powder,	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
dread	1
of	1
death	1
seized	1
him.	1
Filled	1
with	1
fright	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
cloak.	1
All	1
was	1
tranquil	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
Only	1
someone's	1
orderly	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
gateway,	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud,	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
innkeeper.	1
Above	1
Pierre's	1
head	1
some	1
pigeons,	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
movement	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
sitting	1
up,	1
fluttered	1
under	1
the	1
dark	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
penthouse.	1
The	1
whole	1
courtyard	1
was	1
permeated	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
peaceful	1
smell	1
of	1
stable	1
yards,	1
delightful	1
to	1
Pierre	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
clear	1
starry	1
sky	1
between	1
the	1
dark	1
roofs	1
of	1
two	1
penthouses.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
that!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
covering	1
up	1
his	1
head	1
again.	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
is	1
fear,	1
and	1
how	1
shamefully	1
I	1
yielded	1
to	1
it!	1
But	1
they...	1
they	1
were	1
steady	1
and	1
calm	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
to	1
the	1
end..."	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
They,	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
mind,	1
were	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
battery,	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
food,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
prayed	1
before	1
the	1
icon.	1
They,	1
those	1
strange	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
previously	1
known,	1
stood	1
out	1
clearly	1
and	1
sharply	1
from	1
everyone	1
else.	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
a	1
soldier,	1
just	1
a	1
soldier!"	1
thought	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
"to	1
enter	1
communal	1
life	1
completely,	1
to	1
be	1
imbued	1
by	1
what	1
makes	1
them	1
what	1
they	1
are.	1
But	1
how	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
superfluous,	1
devilish	1
burden	1
of	1
my	1
outer	1
man?	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
my	1
father,	1
as	1
I	1
wanted	1
to.	1
Or	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
soldier	1
after	1
the	1
duel	1
with	1
Dolokhov."	1
And	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
challenged	1
Dolokhov	1
flashed	1
through	1
Pierre's	1
mind,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
benefactor	1
at	1
Torzhok.	1
And	1
now	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
solemn	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
lodge	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1
It	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
and	1
someone	1
near	1
and	1
dear	1
to	1
him	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
he!	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
benefactor.	1
But	1
he	1
died!"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
died,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
alive.	1
How	1
sorry	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
and	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
alive	1
again!"	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
sat	1
Anatole,	1
Dolokhov,	1
Nesvitski,	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
them	1
(in	1
his	1
dream	1
the	1
category	1
to	1
which	1
these	1
men	1
belonged	1
was	1
as	1
clearly	1
defined	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
the	1
category	1
of	1
those	1
he	1
termed	1
they),	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
those	1
people,	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Dolokhov,	1
shouting	1
and	1
singing	1
loudly;	1
yet	1
through	1
their	1
shouting	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
benefactor	1
was	1
heard	1
speaking	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
was	1
as	1
weighty	1
and	1
uninterrupted	1
as	1
the	1
booming	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield,	1
but	1
pleasant	1
and	1
comforting.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
his	1
benefactor	1
was	1
saying,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
(the	1
categories	1
of	1
thoughts	1
were	1
also	1
quite	1
distinct	1
in	1
his	1
dream)	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
goodness	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
being	1
what	1
they	1
were.	1
And	1
they	1
with	1
their	1
simple,	1
kind,	1
firm	1
faces	1
surrounded	1
his	1
benefactor	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
But	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
kindly	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
Wishing	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
to	1
attract	1
their	1
attention,	1
he	1
got	1
up,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
his	1
legs	1
grew	1
cold	1
and	1
bare.	1
	1
He	1
felt	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
arm	1
covered	1
his	1
legs	1
from	1
which	1
his	1
cloak	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
slipped.	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
rearranging	1
his	1
cloak	1
Pierre	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
same	1
penthouse	1
roofs,	1
posts,	1
and	1
yard,	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
bluish,	1
lit	1
up,	1
and	1
glittering	1
with	1
frost	1
or	1
dew.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
dawn,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"But	1
that's	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
want.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
understand	1
my	1
benefactor's	1
words."	1
Again	1
he	1
covered	1
himself	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
cloak,	1
but	1
now	1
neither	1
the	1
lodge	1
nor	1
his	1
benefactor	1
was	1
there.	1
There	1
were	1
only	1
thoughts	1
clearly	1
expressed	1
in	1
words,	1
thoughts	1
that	1
someone	1
was	1
uttering	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
formulating.	1
	1
Afterwards	1
when	1
he	1
recalled	1
those	1
thoughts	1
Pierre	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
someone	1
outside	1
himself	1
had	1
spoken	1
them,	1
though	1
the	1
impressions	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
had	1
evoked	1
them.	1
He	1
had	1
never,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
express	1
his	1
thoughts	1
like	1
that	1
when	1
awake.	1
	1
"To	1
endure	1
war	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
subordination	1
of	1
man's	1
freedom	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God,"	1
the	1
voice	1
had	1
said.	1
"Simplicity	1
is	1
submission	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God;	1
you	1
cannot	1
escape	1
from	1
Him.	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
simple.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
talk,	1
but	1
act.	1
The	1
spoken	1
word	1
is	1
silver	1
but	1
the	1
unspoken	1
is	1
golden.	1
Man	1
can	1
be	1
master	1
of	1
nothing	1
while	1
he	1
fears	1
death,	1
but	1
he	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
fear	1
it	1
possesses	1
all.	1
If	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
suffering,	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
his	1
limitations,	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
himself.	1
The	1
hardest	1
thing	1
(Pierre	1
went	1
on	1
thinking,	1
or	1
hearing,	1
in	1
his	1
dream)	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
in	1
your	1
soul	1
to	1
unite	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all.	1
To	1
unite	1
all?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"No,	1
not	1
to	1
unite.	1
Thoughts	1
cannot	1
be	1
united,	1
but	1
to	1
harness	1
all	1
these	1
thoughts	1
together	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
need!	1
Yes,	1
one	1
must	1
harness	1
them,	1
must	1
harness	1
them!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
with	1
inward	1
rapture,	1
feeling	1
that	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
they	1
alone	1
expressed	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
solved	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
tormented	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
one	1
must	1
harness,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
harness."	1
	1
"Time	1
to	1
harness,	1
time	1
to	1
harness,	1
your	1
excellency!	1
Your	1
excellency!"	1
some	1
voice	1
was	1
repeating.	1
"We	1
must	1
harness,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
harness...."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
groom,	1
trying	1
to	1
wake	1
him.	1
The	1
sun	1
shone	1
straight	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
face.	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
dirty	1
innyard	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
which	1
soldiers	1
were	1
watering	1
their	1
lean	1
horses	1
at	1
the	1
pump	1
while	1
carts	1
were	1
passing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate.	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
repugnance,	1
and	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
quickly	1
fell	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
carriage	1
seat.	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
that,	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
understand	1
that.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
revealing	1
itself	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
dream.	1
One	1
second	1
more	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
understood	1
it	1
all!	1
But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?	1
Harness,	1
but	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
harness	1
everything?"	1
and	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
with	1
horror	1
that	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
thought	1
in	1
the	1
dream	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
	1
The	1
groom,	1
the	1
coachman,	1
and	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
told	1
Pierre	1
that	1
an	1
officer	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
already	1
near	1
Mozhaysk	1
and	1
that	1
our	1
men	1
were	1
leaving	1
it.	1
	1
Pierre	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
having	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
harness	1
and	1
overtake	1
him,	1
went	1
on	1
foot	1
through	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
were	1
moving	1
on,	1
leaving	1
about	1
ten	1
thousand	1
wounded	1
behind	1
them.	1
There	1
were	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
yards,	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
and	1
the	1
streets	1
were	1
crowded	1
with	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
streets,	1
around	1
carts	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
away,	1
shouts,	1
curses,	1
and	1
blows	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Pierre	1
offered	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
carriage,	1
which	1
had	1
overtaken	1
him,	1
to	1
a	1
wounded	1
general	1
he	1
knew,	1
and	1
drove	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
Pierre	1
was	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
brother-in-law	1
Anatole	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
On	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
of	1
August	1
Pierre	1
reached	1
Moscow.	1
Close	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
for	1
you	1
everywhere,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"The	1
count	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
particularly.	1
He	1
asks	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
matter."	1
	1
Without	1
going	1
home,	1
Pierre	1
took	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Moscow	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
only	1
that	1
morning	1
returned	1
to	1
town	1
from	1
his	1
summer	1
villa	1
at	1
Sokolniki.	1
The	1
anteroom	1
and	1
reception	1
room	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
officials	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
summoned	1
or	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
orders.	1
Vasilchikov	1
and	1
Platov	1
had	1
already	1
seen	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
defend	1
Moscow	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
surrendered.	1
Though	1
this	1
news	1
was	1
being	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
the	1
officials--the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
government	1
departments--knew	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
enemy's	1
hands,	1
just	1
as	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
himself	1
knew	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
escape	1
personal	1
responsibility	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
their	1
various	1
departments.	1
	1
As	1
Pierre	1
was	1
entering	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
a	1
courier	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Rostopchin's	1
private	1
room.	1
	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
questions	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
greeted,	1
the	1
courier	1
made	1
a	1
despairing	1
gesture	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
While	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
Pierre	1
with	1
weary	1
eyes	1
watched	1
the	1
various	1
officials,	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
military	1
and	1
civilian,	1
who	1
were	1
there.	1
They	1
all	1
seemed	1
dissatisfied	1
and	1
uneasy.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
men,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
knew.	1
After	1
greeting	1
Pierre	1
they	1
continued	1
their	1
conversation.	1
	1
"If	1
they're	1
sent	1
out	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
again	1
later	1
on	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
harm,	1
but	1
as	1
things	1
are	1
now	1
one	1
can't	1
answer	1
for	1
anything."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
writes..."	1
said	1
another,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
printed	1
sheet	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"That's	1
another	1
matter.	1
That's	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
people,"	1
said	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
a	1
fresh	1
broadsheet."	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
it	1
and	1
began	1
reading.	1
	1
His	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
has	1
passed	1
through	1
Mozhaysk	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
join	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
moving	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
has	1
taken	1
up	1
a	1
strong	1
position	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
will	1
not	1
soon	1
attack	1
him.	1
Forty	1
eight	1
guns	1
with	1
ammunition	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
him	1
from	1
here,	1
and	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
says	1
he	1
will	1
defend	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
drop	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
is	1
even	1
ready	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
Do	1
not	1
be	1
upset,	1
brothers,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
courts	1
are	1
closed;	1
things	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
order,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
deal	1
with	1
villains	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
way!	1
When	1
the	1
time	1
comes	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
both	1
town	1
and	1
peasant	1
lads	1
and	1
will	1
raise	1
the	1
cry	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
beforehand,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
wanted	1
yet	1
so	1
I	1
hold	1
my	1
peace.	1
An	1
ax	1
will	1
be	1
useful,	1
a	1
hunting	1
spear	1
not	1
bad,	1
but	1
a	1
three-pronged	1
fork	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
of	1
all:	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
is	1
no	1
heavier	1
than	1
a	1
sheaf	1
of	1
rye.	1
Tomorrow	1
after	1
dinner	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
Iberian	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Mother	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
the	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
Catherine	1
Hospital	1
where	1
we	1
will	1
have	1
some	1
water	1
blessed.	1
That	1
will	1
help	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
well	1
quicker.	1
I,	1
too,	1
am	1
well	1
now:	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
eyes	1
was	1
sore	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
with	1
both.	1
	1
"But	1
military	1
men	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
town,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"and	1
that	1
the	1
position..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course!	1
That's	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
saying,"	1
replied	1
the	1
first	1
speaker.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
mean	1
by	1
'One	1
of	1
my	1
eyes	1
was	1
sore	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
with	1
both'?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
had	1
a	1
sty,"	1
replied	1
the	1
adjutant	1
smiling,	1
"and	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
upset	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
people	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him.	1
By	1
the	1
by,	1
Count,"	1
he	1
added	1
suddenly,	1
addressing	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"we	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
family	1
troubles	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
countess,	1
your	1
wife..."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
nothing,"	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
unconcernedly.	1
"But	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
heard?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well,	1
you	1
know	1
people	1
often	1
invent	1
things.	1
I	1
only	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
heard."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
hear?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
they	1
say,"	1
continued	1
the	1
adjutant	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile,	1
"that	1
the	1
countess,	1
your	1
wife,	1
is	1
preparing	1
to	1
go	1
abroad.	1
I	1
expect	1
it's	1
nonsense...."	1
	1
"Possibly,"	1
remarked	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
absent-mindedly.	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
that?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
indicating	1
a	1
short	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
blue	1
peasant	1
overcoat,	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
snow-white	1
beard	1
and	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
a	1
ruddy	1
face.	1
	1
"He?	1
That's	1
a	1
tradesman,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
he's	1
the	1
restaurant	1
keeper,	1
Vereshchagin.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
that	1
affair	1
with	1
the	1
proclamation."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
so	1
that	1
is	1
Vereshchagin!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
firm,	1
calm	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
seeking	1
any	1
indication	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
traitor.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
he	1
himself,	1
that's	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
fellow	1
who	1
wrote	1
the	1
proclamation,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"The	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
in	1
prison	1
and	1
I	1
expect	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
hard	1
with	1
him."	1
	1
An	1
old	1
gentleman	1
wearing	1
a	1
star	1
and	1
another	1
official,	1
a	1
German	1
wearing	1
a	1
cross	1
round	1
his	1
neck,	1
approached	1
the	1
speaker.	1
	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
complicated	1
story,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
"That	1
proclamation	1
appeared	1
about	1
two	1
months	1
ago.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
informed	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
matter.	1
Gabriel	1
Ivanovich	1
here	1
made	1
the	1
inquiries.	1
The	1
proclamation	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
exactly	1
sixty-	1
three	1
hands.	1
He	1
asked	1
one,	1
'From	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
it?'	1
'From	1
so-and-so.'	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
one.	1
'From	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
it?'	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
till	1
he	1
reached	1
Vereshchagin,	1
a	1
half	1
educated	1
tradesman,	1
you	1
know,	1
'a	1
pet	1
of	1
a	1
trader,'"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant	1
smiling.	1
"They	1
asked	1
him,	1
'Who	1
gave	1
it	1
you?'	1
And	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
knew	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
it	1
from.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
had	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
Postmaster.	1
But	1
evidently	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
some	1
understanding.	1
He	1
replied:	1
'From	1
no	1
one;	1
I	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
myself.'	1
They	1
threatened	1
and	1
questioned	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
stuck	1
to	1
that:	1
'I	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
myself.'	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
man.	1
'From	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
the	1
proclamation?'	1
'I	1
wrote	1
it	1
myself.'	1
Well,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
count,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant	1
cheerfully,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pride,	1
"he	1
flared	1
up	1
dreadfully--and	1
just	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
fellow's	1
audacity,	1
lying,	1
and	1
obstinacy!"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
count	1
wanted	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
Klyucharev?	1
I	1
understand!"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,"	1
rejoined	1
the	1
adjutant	1
in	1
dismay.	1
"Klyucharev	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
sins	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
without	1
that	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
banished.	1
But	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
much	1
annoyed.	1
'How	1
could	1
you	1
have	1
written	1
it	1
yourself?'	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
Hamburg	1
Gazette	1
that	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
'Here	1
it	1
is!	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
write	1
it	1
yourself	1
but	1
translated	1
it,	1
and	1
translated	1
it	1
abominably,	1
because	1
you	1
don't	1
even	1
know	1
French,	1
you	1
fool.'	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
'No,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'I	1
have	1
not	1
read	1
any	1
papers,	1
I	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
myself.'	1
'If	1
that's	1
so,	1
you're	1
a	1
traitor	1
and	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
tried,	1
and	1
you'll	1
be	1
hanged!	1
Say	1
from	1
whom	1
you	1
had	1
it.'	1
'I	1
have	1
seen	1
no	1
papers,	1
I	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
myself.'	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
the	1
father	1
fetched,	1
but	1
the	1
fellow	1
stuck	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
trial	1
and	1
condemned	1
to	1
hard	1
labor,	1
I	1
believe.	1
Now	1
the	1
father	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
intercede	1
for	1
him.	1
But	1
he's	1
a	1
good-for-nothing	1
lad!	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
tradesman's	1
son,	1
a	1
dandy	1
and	1
lady-killer.	1
He	1
attended	1
some	1
lectures	1
somewhere	1
and	1
imagines	1
that	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
no	1
match	1
for	1
him.	1
That's	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow	1
he	1
is.	1
His	1
father	1
keeps	1
a	1
cookshop	1
here	1
by	1
the	1
Stone	1
Bridge,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
icon	1
of	1
God	1
Almighty	1
painted	1
with	1
a	1
scepter	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
an	1
orb	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
Well,	1
he	1
took	1
that	1
icon	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
do?	1
He	1
found	1
some	1
scoundrel	1
of	1
a	1
painter..."	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
fresh	1
tale	1
Pierre	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
private	1
room	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
puckering	1
his	1
face,	1
was	1
rubbing	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
A	1
short	1
man	1
was	1
saying	1
something,	1
but	1
when	1
Pierre	1
entered	1
he	1
stopped	1
speaking	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
great	1
warrior?"	1
said	1
Rostopchin	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
short	1
man	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
"We	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
prowess.	1
But	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
Between	1
ourselves,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
do	1
you	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Masons?"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
severely,	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
wrong	1
about	1
it	1
which	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
intended	1
to	1
pardon.	1
Pierre	1
remained	1
silent.	1
"I	1
am	1
well	1
informed,	1
my	1
friend,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
aware	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
Masons	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
on	1
pretense	1
of	1
saving	1
mankind	1
wish	1
to	1
ruin	1
Russia."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Mason,"	1
Pierre	1
replied.	1
	1
"There,	1
you	1
see,	1
mon	1
cher!	1
I	1
expect	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
Messrs.	1
Speranski	1
and	1
Magnitski	1
have	1
been	1
deported	1
to	1
their	1
proper	1
place.	1
Mr.	1
Klyucharev	1
has	1
been	1
treated	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
others	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
of	1
building	1
up	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Solomon	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
their	1
fatherland.	1
You	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
reasons	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
exiled	1
the	1
Postmaster	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
harmful	1
person.	1
It	1
has	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge	1
that	1
you	1
lent	1
him	1
your	1
carriage	1
for	1
his	1
removal	1
from	1
town,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
even	1
accepted	1
papers	1
from	1
him	1
for	1
safe	1
custody.	1
I	1
like	1
you	1
and	1
don't	1
wish	1
you	1
any	1
harm	1
and--as	1
you	1
are	1
only	1
half	1
my	1
age--I	1
advise	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
father	1
would,	1
to	1
cease	1
all	1
communication	1
with	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
stamp	1
and	1
to	1
leave	1
here	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
did	1
Klyucharev	1
do	1
wrong,	1
Count?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
know,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
ask,"	1
shouted	1
Rostopchin.	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
accused	1
of	1
circulating	1
Napoleon's	1
proclamation	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
so,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Rostopchin,	1
"and	1
Vereshchagin..."	1
	1
"There	1
we	1
are!"	1
Rostopchin	1
shouted	1
at	1
Pierre	1
louder	1
than	1
before,	1
frowning	1
suddenly.	1
"Vereshchagin	1
is	1
a	1
renegade	1
and	1
a	1
traitor	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
punished	1
as	1
he	1
deserves,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
vindictive	1
heat	1
with	1
which	1
people	1
speak	1
when	1
recalling	1
an	1
insult.	1
"But	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
summon	1
you	1
to	1
discuss	1
my	1
actions,	1
but	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
advice--or	1
an	1
order	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
it.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
break	1
off	1
all	1
communication	1
with	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
Klyucharev.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
knock	1
the	1
nonsense	1
out	1
of	1
anybody"--	1
but	1
probably	1
realizing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
shouting	1
at	1
Bezukhov	1
who	1
so	1
far	1
was	1
not	1
guilty	1
of	1
anything,	1
he	1
added,	1
taking	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
manner,	1
"We	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
disaster	1
and	1
I	1
haven't	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
polite	1
to	1
everybody	1
who	1
has	1
business	1
with	1
me.	1
My	1
head	1
is	1
sometimes	1
in	1
a	1
whirl.	1
Well,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
personally?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
nothing,"	1
answered	1
Pierre	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes	1
or	1
changing	1
the	1
thoughtful	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
frowned.	1
	1
"A	1
word	1
of	1
friendly	1
advice,	1
mon	1
cher.	1
Be	1
off	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
Happy	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
ears	1
to	1
hear.	1
Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
Oh,	1
by	1
the	1
by!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
through	1
the	1
doorway	1
after	1
Pierre,	1
"is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
countess	1
has	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
clutches	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Jesus?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
left	1
Rostopchin's	1
room	1
more	1
sullen	1
and	1
angry	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
shown	1
himself.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
home	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
getting	1
dark.	1
Some	1
eight	1
people	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
that	1
evening:	1
the	1
secretary	1
of	1
a	1
committee,	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
his	1
battalion,	1
his	1
steward,	1
his	1
major-domo,	1
and	1
various	1
petitioners.	1
They	1
all	1
had	1
business	1
with	1
Pierre	1
and	1
wanted	1
decisions	1
from	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
questions	1
and	1
only	1
answered	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
these	1
people.	1
When	1
left	1
alone	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
opened	1
and	1
read	1
his	1
wife's	1
letter.	1
	1
"They,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
at	1
the	1
battery,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
killed...	1
that	1
old	1
man...	1
Simplicity	1
is	1
submission	1
to	1
God.	1
Suffering	1
is	1
necessary...	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all...	1
one	1
must	1
harness...	1
my	1
wife	1
is	1
getting	1
married...	1
One	1
must	1
forget	1
and	1
understand..."	1
And	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
bed	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
it	1
without	1
undressing	1
and	1
immediately	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
awoke	1
next	1
morning	1
the	1
major-domo	1
came	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
special	1
messenger,	1
a	1
police	1
officer,	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
left	1
or	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
A	1
dozen	1
persons	1
who	1
had	1
business	1
with	1
Pierre	1
were	1
awaiting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
dressed	1
hurriedly	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
porch	1
and	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
Bezukhov's	1
household,	1
despite	1
all	1
the	1
search	1
they	1
made,	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
again	1
or	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
till	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
that	1
is,	1
till	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
entry	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
After	1
Petya	1
had	1
joined	1
Obolenski's	1
regiment	1
of	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
left	1
for	1
Belaya	1
Tserkov	1
where	1
that	1
regiment	1
was	1
forming,	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
terror.	1
The	1
thought	1
that	1
both	1
her	1
sons	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
war,	1
had	1
both	1
gone	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
wing,	1
that	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
either	1
or	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
might	1
be	1
killed	1
like	1
the	1
three	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintances,	1
struck	1
her	1
that	1
summer	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
with	1
cruel	1
clearness.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
Nicholas	1
back	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
herself	1
to	1
join	1
Petya,	1
or	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
an	1
appointment	1
somewhere	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
but	1
neither	1
of	1
these	1
proved	1
possible.	1
Petya	1
could	1
not	1
return	1
unless	1
his	1
regiment	1
did	1
so	1
or	1
unless	1
he	1
was	1
transferred	1
to	1
another	1
regiment	1
on	1
active	1
service.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
somewhere	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
sent	1
a	1
word	1
since	1
his	1
last	1
letter,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
detailed	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
meeting	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
The	1
countess	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
at	1
night,	1
or	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
fall	1
asleep	1
dreamed	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
sons	1
lying	1
dead.	1
After	1
many	1
consultations	1
and	1
conversations,	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
last	1
devised	1
means	1
to	1
tranquillize	1
her.	1
He	1
got	1
Petya	1
transferred	1
from	1
Obolenski's	1
regiment	1
to	1
Bezukhov's,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
training	1
near	1
Moscow.	1
Though	1
Petya	1
would	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
this	1
transfer	1
would	1
give	1
the	1
countess	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
seeing	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sons	1
under	1
her	1
wing,	1
and	1
she	1
hoped	1
to	1
arrange	1
matters	1
for	1
her	1
Petya	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
again,	1
but	1
always	1
get	1
him	1
appointed	1
to	1
places	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
battle.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
alone	1
was	1
in	1
danger	1
the	1
countess	1
imagined	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
her	1
first-born	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
her	1
other	1
children	1
and	1
even	1
reproached	1
herself	1
for	1
it;	1
but	1
when	1
her	1
youngest:	1
the	1
scapegrace	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
bad	1
at	1
lessons,	1
was	1
always	1
breaking	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
making	1
himself	1
a	1
nuisance	1
to	1
everybody,	1
that	1
snub-nosed	1
Petya	1
with	1
his	1
merry	1
black	1
eyes	1
and	1
fresh	1
rosy	1
cheeks	1
where	1
soft	1
down	1
was	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
show--when	1
he	1
was	1
thrown	1
amid	1
those	1
big,	1
dreadful,	1
cruel	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
fighting	1
somewhere	1
about	1
something	1
and	1
apparently	1
finding	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it--then	1
his	1
mother	1
thought	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
more,	1
much	1
more,	1
than	1
all	1
her	1
other	1
children.	1
The	1
nearer	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
for	1
Petya	1
to	1
return,	1
the	1
more	1
uneasy	1
grew	1
the	1
countess.	1
She	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
happiness.	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
of	1
her	1
beloved	1
Natasha,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
irritated	1
her.	1
"What	1
do	1
I	1
want	1
with	1
them?	1
I	1
want	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
Petya,"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
August	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
received	1
another	1
letter	1
from	1
Nicholas.	1
He	1
wrote	1
from	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Voronezh	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
procure	1
remounts,	1
but	1
that	1
letter	1
did	1
not	1
set	1
the	1
countess	1
at	1
ease.	1
Knowing	1
that	1
one	1
son	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
danger	1
she	1
became	1
the	1
more	1
anxious	1
about	1
Petya.	1
	1
Though	1
by	1
the	1
twentieth	1
of	1
August	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
acquaintances	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
though	1
everybody	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
countess	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
leaving	1
before	1
her	1
treasure,	1
her	1
adored	1
Petya,	1
returned.	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
of	1
August	1
he	1
arrived.	1
The	1
passionate	1
tenderness	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
mother	1
received	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
please	1
the	1
sixteen-year-old	1
officer.	1
Though	1
she	1
concealed	1
from	1
him	1
her	1
intention	1
of	1
keeping	1
him	1
under	1
her	1
wing,	1
Petya	1
guessed	1
her	1
designs,	1
and	1
instinctively	1
fearing	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
emotion	1
when	1
with	1
her--might	1
"become	1
womanish"	1
as	1
he	1
termed	1
it	1
to	1
himself--he	1
treated	1
her	1
coldly,	1
avoided	1
her,	1
and	1
during	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow	1
attached	1
himself	1
exclusively	1
to	1
Natasha	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
particularly	1
brotherly	1
tenderness,	1
almost	1
lover-like.	1
	1
Owing	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
customary	1
carelessness	1
nothing	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
their	1
departure	1
by	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
of	1
August	1
and	1
the	1
carts	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
their	1
Ryazan	1
and	1
Moscow	1
estates	1
to	1
remove	1
their	1
household	1
belongings	1
did	1
not	1
arrive	1
till	1
the	1
thirtieth.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
till	1
the	1
thirty-first	1
all	1
Moscow	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bustle	1
and	1
commotion.	1
Every	1
day	1
thousands	1
of	1
men	1
wounded	1
at	1
Borodino	1
were	1
brought	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
gate	1
and	1
taken	1
to	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
thousands	1
of	1
carts	1
conveyed	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
their	1
possessions	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
gates.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
Rostopchin's	1
broadsheets,	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
them	1
or	1
independently	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
strangest	1
and	1
most	1
contradictory	1
rumors	1
were	1
current	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
Some	1
said	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
city,	1
others	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
icons	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
and	1
everybody	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
ordered	1
to	1
leave.	1
Some	1
said	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
another	1
battle	1
after	1
Borodino	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
been	1
routed,	1
while	1
others	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
reported	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
Some	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
Moscow	1
militia	1
which,	1
preceded	1
by	1
the	1
clergy,	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills;	1
others	1
whispered	1
that	1
Augustin	1
had	1
been	1
forbidden	1
to	1
leave,	1
that	1
traitors	1
had	1
been	1
seized,	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
rioting	1
and	1
robbing	1
people	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
talk;	1
in	1
reality	1
(though	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
Fili,	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
held)	1
both	1
those	1
who	1
went	1
away	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
remained	1
behind	1
felt,	1
though	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
it,	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
abandoned,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
save	1
their	1
belongings.	1
It	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
suddenly	1
break	1
up	1
and	1
change,	1
but	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
nothing	1
had	1
done	1
so.	1
As	1
a	1
criminal	1
who	1
is	1
being	1
led	1
to	1
execution	1
knows	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
die	1
immediately,	1
but	1
yet	1
looks	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
straightens	1
the	1
cap	1
that	1
is	1
awry	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
so	1
Moscow	1
involuntarily	1
continued	1
its	1
wonted	1
life,	1
though	1
it	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
its	1
destruction	1
was	1
near	1
when	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
which	1
its	1
people	1
were	1
accustomed	1
to	1
submit	1
would	1
be	1
completely	1
upset.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
three	1
days	1
preceding	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
Moscow	1
the	1
whole	1
Rostov	1
family	1
was	1
absorbed	1
in	1
various	1
activities.	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov,	1
continually	1
drove	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
collecting	1
the	1
current	1
rumors	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
gave	1
superficial	1
and	1
hasty	1
orders	1
at	1
home	1
about	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
their	1
departure.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
watched	1
the	1
things	1
being	1
packed,	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
everything,	1
was	1
constantly	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
Petya	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
Natasha	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
spent	1
all	1
his	1
time.	1
Sonya	1
alone	1
directed	1
the	1
practical	1
side	1
of	1
matters	1
by	1
getting	1
things	1
packed.	1
But	1
of	1
late	1
Sonya	1
had	1
been	1
particularly	1
sad	1
and	1
silent.	1
Nicholas'	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
mentioned	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
elicited,	1
in	1
her	1
presence,	1
joyous	1
comments	1
from	1
the	1
countess,	1
who	1
saw	1
an	1
intervention	1
of	1
Providence	1
in	1
this	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
never	1
pleased	1
at	1
Bolkonski's	1
engagement	1
to	1
Natasha,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
"but	1
I	1
always	1
wanted	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
princess,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
presentiment	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
happen.	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
it	1
would	1
be!"	1
	1
Sonya	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
true:	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
possibility	1
of	1
retrieving	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
affairs	1
was	1
by	1
Nicholas	1
marrying	1
a	1
rich	1
woman,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
match.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
bitter	1
for	1
her.	1
But	1
despite	1
her	1
grief,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
just	1
because	1
of	1
it,	1
she	1
took	1
on	1
herself	1
all	1
the	1
difficult	1
work	1
of	1
directing	1
the	1
storing	1
and	1
packing	1
of	1
their	1
things	1
and	1
was	1
busy	1
for	1
whole	1
days.	1
The	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
any	1
orders	1
to	1
give.	1
Petya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
far	1
from	1
helping	1
their	1
parents,	1
were	1
generally	1
a	1
nuisance	1
and	1
a	1
hindrance	1
to	1
everyone.	1
Almost	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
the	1
house	1
resounded	1
with	1
their	1
running	1
feet,	1
their	1
cries,	1
and	1
their	1
spontaneous	1
laughter.	1
They	1
laughed	1
and	1
were	1
gay	1
not	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
laugh,	1
but	1
because	1
gaiety	1
and	1
mirth	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
so	1
everything	1
that	1
happened	1
was	1
a	1
cause	1
for	1
gaiety	1
and	1
laughter	1
to	1
them.	1
Petya	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
because	1
having	1
left	1
home	1
a	1
boy	1
he	1
had	1
returned	1
(as	1
everybody	1
told	1
him)	1
a	1
fine	1
young	1
man,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Belaya	1
Tserkov	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
soon	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
fighting	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
because	1
Natasha,	1
whose	1
lead	1
he	1
always	1
followed,	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
spirits.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
gay	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
sad	1
too	1
long	1
and	1
now	1
nothing	1
reminded	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
sadness,	1
and	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
feeling	1
well.	1
She	1
was	1
also	1
happy	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
someone	1
to	1
adore	1
her:	1
the	1
adoration	1
of	1
others	1
was	1
a	1
lubricant	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
her	1
machine	1
needed	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
run	1
freely--	1
and	1
Petya	1
adored	1
her.	1
Above	1
all,	1
they	1
were	1
gay	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
war	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
fighting	1
at	1
the	1
town	1
gates,	1
arms	1
were	1
being	1
given	1
out,	1
everybody	1
was	1
escaping--going	1
away	1
somewhere,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
was	1
happening,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
always	1
exciting,	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
young.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
On	1
Saturday,	1
the	1
thirty-first	1
of	1
August,	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
seemed	1
topsy-turvy.	1
All	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
open,	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
out	1
or	1
moved	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
mirrors	1
and	1
pictures	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
down.	1
There	1
were	1
trunks	1
in	1
the	1
rooms,	1
and	1
hay,	1
wrapping	1
paper,	1
and	1
ropes	1
were	1
scattered	1
about.	1
The	1
peasants	1
and	1
house	1
serfs	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
things	1
were	1
treading	1
heavily	1
on	1
the	1
parquet	1
floors.	1
The	1
yard	1
was	1
crowded	1
with	1
peasant	1
carts,	1
some	1
loaded	1
high	1
and	1
already	1
corded	1
up,	1
others	1
still	1
empty.	1
	1
The	1
voices	1
and	1
footsteps	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
servants	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
carts	1
resounded	1
as	1
they	1
shouted	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
since	1
morning.	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
brought	1
on	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
turmoil	1
and	1
was	1
lying	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
vinegar	1
compress	1
on	1
her	1
head.	1
Petya	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home,	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
visit	1
a	1
friend	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
transfer	1
from	1
the	1
militia	1
to	1
the	1
active	1
army.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
looking	1
after	1
the	1
packing	1
of	1
the	1
glass	1
and	1
china.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
her	1
dismantled	1
room	1
with	1
dresses,	1
ribbons,	1
and	1
scarves	1
strewn	1
all	1
about	1
her,	1
gazing	1
fixedly	1
at	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
holding	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
the	1
old	1
ball	1
dress	1
(already	1
out	1
of	1
fashion)	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
Petersburg	1
ball.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
doing	1
nothing	1
when	1
everyone	1
else	1
was	1
so	1
busy,	1
and	1
several	1
times	1
that	1
morning	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
set	1
to	1
work,	1
but	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
except	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
might.	1
For	1
a	1
while	1
she	1
had	1
stood	1
beside	1
Sonya	1
while	1
the	1
china	1
was	1
being	1
packed	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
help,	1
but	1
soon	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
to	1
pack	1
her	1
own	1
things.	1
At	1
first	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
amusing	1
to	1
give	1
away	1
dresses	1
and	1
ribbons	1
to	1
the	1
maids,	1
but	1
when	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
packed,	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
dull.	1
	1
"Dunyasha,	1
you	1
pack!	1
You	1
will,	1
won't	1
you,	1
dear?"	1
And	1
when	1
Dunyasha	1
willingly	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
all	1
for	1
her,	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
took	1
her	1
old	1
ball	1
dress,	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
reverie	1
quite	1
unrelated	1
to	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
occupied	1
her	1
thoughts	1
now.	1
She	1
was	1
roused	1
from	1
her	1
reverie	1
by	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
(which	1
was	1
theirs)	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
hurried	1
footsteps	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
porch.	1
Natasha	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
An	1
enormously	1
long	1
row	1
of	1
carts	1
full	1
of	1
wounded	1
men	1
had	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
The	1
housekeeper,	1
the	1
old	1
nurse,	1
the	1
cooks,	1
coachmen,	1
maids,	1
footmen,	1
postilions,	1
and	1
scullions	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
wounded.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
throwing	1
a	1
clean	1
pocket	1
handkerchief	1
over	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
holding	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
each	1
hand,	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
The	1
former	1
housekeeper,	1
old	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
had	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
by	1
the	1
gate,	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
cart	1
with	1
a	1
hood	1
constructed	1
of	1
bast	1
mats,	1
and	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
a	1
pale	1
young	1
officer	1
who	1
lay	1
inside.	1
Natasha	1
moved	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
forward	1
and	1
stopped	1
shyly,	1
still	1
holding	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
have	1
nobody	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
she	1
was	1
saying.	1
"You	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
comfortable	1
somewhere	1
in	1
a	1
house...	1
in	1
ours,	1
for	1
instance...	1
the	1
family	1
are	1
leaving."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
allowed,"	1
replied	1
the	1
officer	1
in	1
a	1
weak	1
voice.	1
"Here	1
is	1
our	1
commanding	1
officer...	1
ask	1
him,"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
stout	1
major	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
back	1
along	1
the	1
street	1
past	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
carts.	1
	1
Natasha	1
glanced	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
officer	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
major.	1
	1
"May	1
the	1
wounded	1
men	1
stay	1
in	1
our	1
house?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
The	1
major	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Which	1
one	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
Ma'am'selle?"	1
said	1
he,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
smiling.	1
	1
Natasha	1
quietly	1
repeated	1
her	1
question,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
manner	1
were	1
so	1
serious,	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
holding	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
that	1
the	1
major	1
ceased	1
smiling	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
reflection--	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
possible--replied	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
why	1
not?	1
They	1
may,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
slight	1
inclination	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
Natasha	1
stepped	1
back	1
quickly	1
to	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
who	1
stood	1
talking	1
compassionately	1
to	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
"They	1
may.	1
He	1
says	1
they	1
may!"	1
whispered	1
Natasha.	1
	1
The	1
cart	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
officer	1
lay	1
was	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
yard,	1
and	1
dozens	1
of	1
carts	1
with	1
wounded	1
men	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
invitation	1
of	1
the	1
townsfolk	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
the	1
yards	1
and	1
to	1
draw	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
entrances	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
in	1
Povarskaya	1
Street.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
dealing	1
with	1
new	1
people	1
outside	1
the	1
ordinary	1
routine	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
She	1
and	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
as	1
possible	1
into	1
their	1
yard.	1
	1
"Your	1
Papa	1
must	1
be	1
told,	1
though,"	1
said	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna.	1
	1
"Never	1
mind,	1
never	1
mind,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter?	1
For	1
one	1
day	1
we	1
can	1
move	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
They	1
can	1
have	1
all	1
our	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
house."	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
young	1
lady,	1
you	1
do	1
take	1
things	1
into	1
your	1
head!	1
Even	1
if	1
we	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
wing,	1
the	1
men's	1
room,	1
or	1
the	1
nurse's	1
room,	1
we	1
must	1
ask	1
permission."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I'll	1
ask."	1
	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
through	1
the	1
half-open	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
vinegar	1
and	1
Hoffman's	1
drops.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
asleep,	1
Mamma?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
sleep-?"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
waking	1
up	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
dropping	1
into	1
a	1
doze.	1
	1
"Mamma	1
darling!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
kneeling	1
by	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
bringing	1
her	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
mother's,	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry,	1
forgive	1
me,	1
I'll	1
never	1
do	1
it	1
again;	1
I	1
woke	1
you	1
up!	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
has	1
sent	1
me:	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
some	1
wounded	1
here--officers.	1
Will	1
you	1
let	1
them	1
come?	1
They	1
have	1
nowhere	1
to	1
go.	1
I	1
knew	1
you'd	1
let	1
them	1
come!"	1
she	1
said	1
quickly	1
all	1
in	1
one	1
breath.	1
	1
"What	1
officers?	1
Whom	1
have	1
they	1
brought?	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
anything	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Natasha	1
laughed,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
too	1
smiled	1
slightly.	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
you'd	1
give	1
permission...	1
so	1
I'll	1
tell	1
them,"	1
and,	1
having	1
kissed	1
her	1
mother,	1
Natasha	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
hall	1
she	1
met	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
bad	1
news.	1
	1
"We've	1
stayed	1
too	1
long!"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
involuntary	1
vexation.	1
"The	1
club	1
is	1
closed	1
and	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
leaving."	1
	1
"Papa,	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
right--I've	1
invited	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
into	1
the	1
house?"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
it	1
is,"	1
he	1
answered	1
absently.	1
"That's	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
indulge	1
in	1
trifles	1
now,	1
but	1
to	1
help	1
to	1
pack,	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
must	1
go,	1
go,	1
go!...."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
count	1
gave	1
a	1
similar	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
major-domo	1
and	1
the	1
servants.	1
	1
At	1
dinner	1
Petya	1
having	1
returned	1
home	1
told	1
them	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
heard.	1
He	1
said	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
been	1
getting	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
Rostopchin's	1
broadsheet	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
sound	1
a	1
call	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
advance,	1
the	1
order	1
had	1
certainly	1
already	1
been	1
given	1
for	1
everyone	1
to	1
go	1
armed	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
tomorrow,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
big	1
battle	1
there.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
looked	1
with	1
timid	1
horror	1
at	1
her	1
son's	1
eager,	1
excited	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this.	1
She	1
realized	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
his	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
(she	1
knew	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
engagement)	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
men,	1
honor,	1
and	1
the	1
fatherland-	1
-something	1
senseless,	1
masculine,	1
and	1
obstinate	1
which	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
contradicting,	1
and	1
her	1
plans	1
would	1
be	1
spoiled;	1
and	1
so,	1
hoping	1
to	1
arrange	1
to	1
leave	1
before	1
then	1
and	1
take	1
Petya	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
their	1
protector	1
and	1
defender,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
him,	1
but	1
after	1
dinner	1
called	1
the	1
count	1
aside	1
and	1
implored	1
him	1
with	1
tears	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
away	1
quickly,	1
that	1
very	1
night	1
if	1
possible.	1
With	1
a	1
woman's	1
involuntary	1
loving	1
cunning	1
she,	1
who	1
till	1
then	1
had	1
not	1
shown	1
any	1
alarm,	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
die	1
of	1
fright	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
that	1
very	1
night.	1
Without	1
any	1
pretense	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
afraid	1
of	1
everything.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
daughter,	1
increased	1
the	1
countess'	1
fears	1
still	1
more	1
by	1
telling	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
a	1
spirit	1
dealer's	1
in	1
Myasnitski	1
Street.	1
When	1
returning	1
by	1
that	1
street	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
pass	1
because	1
of	1
a	1
drunken	1
crowd	1
rioting	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
shop.	1
She	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
driven	1
home	1
by	1
a	1
side	1
street	1
and	1
the	1
cabman	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
breaking	1
open	1
the	1
barrels	1
at	1
the	1
drink	1
store,	1
having	1
received	1
orders	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
After	1
dinner	1
the	1
whole	1
Rostov	1
household	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
enthusiastic	1
haste	1
packing	1
their	1
belongings	1
and	1
preparing	1
for	1
their	1
departure.	1
The	1
old	1
count,	1
suddenly	1
setting	1
to	1
work,	1
kept	1
passing	1
from	1
the	1
yard	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
back	1
again,	1
shouting	1
confused	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
hurrying	1
people,	1
and	1
flurrying	1
them	1
still	1
more.	1
Petya	1
directed	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
Sonya,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
contradictory	1
orders,	1
lost	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
servants	1
ran	1
noisily	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
yard,	1
shouting	1
and	1
disputing.	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
the	1
ardor	1
characteristic	1
of	1
all	1
she	1
did	1
suddenly	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
too.	1
At	1
first	1
her	1
intervention	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
packing	1
was	1
received	1
skeptically.	1
Everybody	1
expected	1
some	1
prank	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
obey	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
resolutely	1
and	1
passionately	1
demanded	1
obedience,	1
grew	1
angry	1
and	1
nearly	1
cried	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
heed	1
her,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
in	1
making	1
them	1
believe	1
her.	1
Her	1
first	1
exploit,	1
which	1
cost	1
her	1
immense	1
effort	1
and	1
established	1
her	1
authority,	1
was	1
the	1
packing	1
of	1
the	1
carpets.	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
valuable	1
Gobelin	1
tapestries	1
and	1
Persian	1
carpets	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
When	1
Natasha	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
two	1
cases	1
were	1
standing	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
one	1
almost	1
full	1
up	1
with	1
crockery,	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
carpets.	1
There	1
was	1
also	1
much	1
china	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
tables,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
was	1
being	1
brought	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
storeroom.	1
A	1
third	1
case	1
was	1
needed	1
and	1
servants	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
fetch	1
it.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
wait	1
a	1
bit--we'll	1
pack	1
everything	1
into	1
these,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"You	1
can't,	1
Miss,	1
we	1
have	1
tried	1
to,"	1
said	1
the	1
butler's	1
assistant.	1
	1
"No,	1
wait	1
a	1
minute,	1
please."	1
	1
And	1
Natasha	1
began	1
rapidly	1
taking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
dishes	1
and	1
plates	1
wrapped	1
in	1
paper.	1
	1
"The	1
dishes	1
must	1
go	1
in	1
here	1
among	1
the	1
carpets,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"Why,	1
it's	1
a	1
mercy	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
the	1
carpets	1
alone	1
into	1
three	1
cases,"	1
said	1
the	1
butler's	1
assistant.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
wait,	1
please!"	1
And	1
Natasha	1
began	1
rapidly	1
and	1
deftly	1
sorting	1
out	1
the	1
things.	1
"These	1
aren't	1
needed,"	1
said	1
she,	1
putting	1
aside	1
some	1
plates	1
of	1
Kiev	1
ware.	1
"These--yes,	1
these	1
must	1
go	1
among	1
the	1
carpets,"	1
she	1
said,	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
Saxony	1
china	1
dishes.	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Natasha!	1
Leave	1
it	1
alone!	1
We'll	1
get	1
it	1
all	1
packed,"	1
urged	1
Sonya	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
she	1
is!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
major-domo.	1
	1
But	1
Natasha	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
in.	1
She	1
turned	1
everything	1
out	1
and	1
began	1
quickly	1
repacking,	1
deciding	1
that	1
the	1
inferior	1
Russian	1
carpets	1
and	1
unnecessary	1
crockery	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
at	1
all.	1
When	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cases,	1
they	1
recommenced	1
packing,	1
and	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
cheaper	1
things	1
not	1
worth	1
taking	1
had	1
nearly	1
all	1
been	1
rejected,	1
the	1
valuable	1
ones	1
really	1
did	1
all	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
two	1
cases.	1
Only	1
the	1
lid	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
containing	1
the	1
carpets	1
would	1
not	1
shut	1
down.	1
A	1
few	1
more	1
things	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
out,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
insisted	1
on	1
having	1
her	1
own	1
way.	1
She	1
packed,	1
repacked,	1
pressed,	1
made	1
the	1
butler's	1
assistant	1
and	1
Petya--whom	1
she	1
had	1
drawn	1
into	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
packing--press	1
on	1
the	1
lid,	1
and	1
made	1
desperate	1
efforts	1
herself.	1
	1
"That's	1
enough,	1
Natasha,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
"I	1
see	1
you	1
were	1
right,	1
but	1
just	1
take	1
out	1
the	1
top	1
one."	1
	1
"I	1
won't!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
holding	1
back	1
the	1
hair	1
that	1
hung	1
over	1
her	1
perspiring	1
face,	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
pressed	1
down	1
the	1
carpets.	1
"Now	1
press,	1
Petya!	1
Press,	1
Vasilich,	1
press	1
hard!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
	1
The	1
carpets	1
yielded	1
and	1
the	1
lid	1
closed;	1
Natasha,	1
clapping	1
her	1
hands,	1
screamed	1
with	1
delight	1
and	1
tears	1
fell	1
from	1
her	1
eyes.	1
But	1
this	1
only	1
lasted	1
a	1
moment.	1
She	1
at	1
once	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
afresh	1
and	1
they	1
now	1
trusted	1
her	1
completely.	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
not	1
angry	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Natasha	1
had	1
countermanded	1
an	1
order	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
a	1
cart	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
loaded,	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
corded	1
up.	1
Thanks	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
directions	1
the	1
work	1
now	1
went	1
on	1
expeditiously,	1
unnecessary	1
things	1
were	1
left,	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
valuable	1
packed	1
as	1
compactly	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
But	1
hard	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
worked	1
till	1
quite	1
late	1
that	1
night,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
everything	1
packed.	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
having	1
put	1
off	1
their	1
departure	1
till	1
next	1
morning,	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
slept	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
without	1
undressing.	1
	1
That	1
night	1
another	1
wounded	1
man	1
was	1
driven	1
down	1
the	1
Povarskaya,	1
and	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
had	1
him	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
yard.	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
concluded	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
man.	1
He	1
was	1
being	1
conveyed	1
in	1
a	1
caleche	1
with	1
a	1
raised	1
hood,	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
covered	1
by	1
an	1
apron.	1
On	1
the	1
box	1
beside	1
the	1
driver	1
sat	1
a	1
venerable	1
old	1
attendant.	1
A	1
doctor	1
and	1
two	1
soldiers	1
followed	1
the	1
carriage	1
in	1
a	1
cart.	1
	1
"Please	1
come	1
in	1
here.	1
The	1
masters	1
are	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
will	1
be	1
empty,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
attendant.	1
	1
"Well,	1
perhaps,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"We	1
don't	1
expect	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
home	1
alive!	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
it's	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
from	1
here,	1
and	1
there's	1
nobody	1
living	1
in	1
it."	1
	1
"Do	1
us	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
come	1
in,	1
there's	1
plenty	1
of	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
master's	1
house.	1
Come	1
in,"	1
said	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna.	1
"Is	1
he	1
very	1
ill?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
The	1
attendant	1
made	1
a	1
hopeless	1
gesture.	1
	1
"We	1
don't	1
expect	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
home!	1
We	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
doctor."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
got	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cart.	1
	1
"All	1
right!"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
servant	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
caleche,	1
looked	1
into	1
it,	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disconsolately,	1
told	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
stopped	1
beside	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna.	1
	1
"O,	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ!"	1
she	1
murmured.	1
	1
She	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"The	1
masters	1
won't	1
object..."	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
avoid	1
carrying	1
the	1
man	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wing	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
Madame	1
Schoss'.	1
	1
This	1
wounded	1
man	1
was	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
Moscow's	1
last	1
day	1
had	1
come.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
clear	1
bright	1
autumn	1
day,	1
a	1
Sunday.	1
The	1
church	1
bells	1
everywhere	1
were	1
ringing	1
for	1
service,	1
just	1
as	1
usual	1
on	1
Sundays.	1
Nobody	1
seemed	1
yet	1
to	1
realize	1
what	1
awaited	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
Only	1
two	1
things	1
indicated	1
the	1
social	1
condition	1
of	1
Moscow--the	1
rabble,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
poor	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
commodities.	1
An	1
enormous	1
crowd	1
of	1
factory	1
hands,	1
house	1
serfs,	1
and	1
peasants,	1
with	1
whom	1
some	1
officials,	1
seminarists,	1
and	1
gentry	1
were	1
mingled,	1
had	1
gone	1
early	1
that	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills.	1
Having	1
waited	1
there	1
for	1
Rostopchin	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
up,	1
they	1
became	1
convinced	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
surrendered,	1
and	1
then	1
dispersed	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
town	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
houses	1
and	1
cookshops.	1
Prices	1
too	1
that	1
day	1
indicated	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
affairs.	1
The	1
price	1
of	1
weapons,	1
of	1
gold,	1
of	1
carts	1
and	1
horses,	1
kept	1
rising,	1
but	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
paper	1
money	1
and	1
city	1
articles	1
kept	1
falling,	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
midday	1
there	1
were	1
instances	1
of	1
carters	1
removing	1
valuable	1
goods,	1
such	1
as	1
cloth,	1
and	1
receiving	1
in	1
payment	1
a	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
carted,	1
while	1
peasant	1
horses	1
were	1
fetching	1
five	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
each,	1
and	1
furniture,	1
mirrors,	1
and	1
bronzes	1
were	1
being	1
given	1
away	1
for	1
nothing.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
staid	1
old-fashioned	1
house	1
the	1
dissolution	1
of	1
former	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
but	1
little	1
noticeable.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
serfs	1
the	1
only	1
indication	1
was	1
that	1
three	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
huge	1
retinue	1
disappeared	1
during	1
the	1
night,	1
but	1
nothing	1
was	1
stolen;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
their	1
possessions,	1
the	1
thirty	1
peasant	1
carts	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
their	1
estates	1
and	1
which	1
many	1
people	1
envied	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
extremely	1
valuable	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
offered	1
enormous	1
sums	1
of	1
money	1
for	1
them.	1
Not	1
only	1
were	1
huge	1
sums	1
offered	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
carts,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
and	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
orderlies	1
and	1
servants	1
sent	1
by	1
wounded	1
officers	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
wounded	1
men	1
dragged	1
themselves	1
there	1
from	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
from	1
neighboring	1
houses	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
accommodated,	1
entreating	1
the	1
servants	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
them	1
a	1
lift	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
major-domo	1
to	1
whom	1
these	1
entreaties	1
were	1
addressed,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
wounded,	1
resolutely	1
refused,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
dare	1
not	1
even	1
mention	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
Pity	1
these	1
wounded	1
men	1
as	1
one	1
might,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
given	1
one	1
cart	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
refuse	1
another,	1
or	1
all	1
the	1
carts	1
and	1
one's	1
own	1
carriages	1
as	1
well.	1
Thirty	1
carts	1
could	1
not	1
save	1
all	1
the	1
wounded	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
catastrophe	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
disregard	1
oneself	1
and	1
one's	1
own	1
family.	1
So	1
thought	1
the	1
major-domo	1
on	1
his	1
master's	1
behalf.	1
	1
On	1
waking	1
up	1
that	1
morning	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
left	1
his	1
bedroom	1
softly,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
wake	1
the	1
countess	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
only	1
toward	1
morning,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
in	1
his	1
lilac	1
silk	1
dressing	1
gown.	1
In	1
the	1
yard	1
stood	1
the	1
carts	1
ready	1
corded.	1
The	1
carriages	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
porch.	1
The	1
major-domo	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
porch	1
talking	1
to	1
an	1
elderly	1
orderly	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
pale	1
young	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
arm.	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
count	1
the	1
major-	1
domo	1
made	1
a	1
significant	1
and	1
stern	1
gesture	1
to	1
them	1
both	1
to	1
go	1
away.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Vasilich,	1
is	1
everything	1
ready?"	1
asked	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
stroking	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
he	1
looked	1
good-naturedly	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
the	1
orderly	1
and	1
nodded	1
to	1
them.	1
(He	1
liked	1
to	1
see	1
new	1
faces.)	1
	1
"We	1
can	1
harness	1
at	1
once,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
right.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
countess	1
wakes	1
we'll	1
be	1
off,	1
God	1
willing!	1
What	1
is	1
it,	1
gentlemen?"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
officer.	1
"Are	1
you	1
staying	1
in	1
my	1
house?"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
suddenly	1
his	1
face	1
flushed	1
crimson.	1
	1
"Count,	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
allow	1
me...	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
some	1
corner	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
carts!	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
here	1
with	1
me....	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
on	1
a	1
loaded	1
cart..."	1
	1
Before	1
the	1
officer	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
the	1
orderly	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
request	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
yes,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
hastily.	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
pleased,	1
very	1
pleased.	1
Vasilich,	1
you'll	1
see	1
to	1
it.	1
Just	1
unload	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
carts.	1
Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it...	1
do	1
what's	1
necessary..."	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
muttering	1
some	1
indefinite	1
order.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
warm	1
gratitude	1
on	1
the	1
officer's	1
face	1
had	1
already	1
sealed	1
the	1
order.	1
The	1
count	1
looked	1
around	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
yard,	1
at	1
the	1
gates,	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
wings,	1
wounded	1
officers	1
and	1
their	1
orderlies	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
"Please	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
gallery,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
the	1
major-domo.	1
"What	1
are	1
your	1
orders	1
about	1
the	1
pictures?"	1
	1
The	1
count	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
him,	1
repeating	1
his	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
refuse	1
the	1
wounded	1
who	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
lift.	1
	1
"Well,	1
never	1
mind,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
can	1
be	1
unloaded,"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
soft,	1
confidential	1
voice,	1
as	1
though	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
overheard.	1
	1
At	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
the	1
countess	1
woke	1
up,	1
and	1
Matrena	1
Timofeevna,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
lady's	1
maid	1
before	1
her	1
marriage	1
and	1
now	1
performed	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
chief	1
gendarme's	1
duty	1
for	1
her,	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
was	1
much	1
offended	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ladies'	1
summer	1
dresses	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
behind.	1
On	1
inquiry,	1
the	1
countess	1
learned	1
that	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
was	1
offended	1
because	1
her	1
trunk	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
down	1
from	1
its	1
cart,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
loads	1
were	1
being	1
uncorded	1
and	1
the	1
luggage	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carts	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
wounded	1
men	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
had	1
ordered	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
countess	1
sent	1
for	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
this,	1
my	1
dear?	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
the	1
luggage	1
is	1
being	1
unloaded."	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
love,	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you...	1
Countess	1
dear...	1
an	1
officer	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
carts	1
for	1
the	1
wounded.	1
After	1
all,	1
ours	1
are	1
things	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
bought	1
but	1
think	1
what	1
being	1
left	1
behind	1
means	1
to	1
them!...	1
Really	1
now,	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
yard--we	1
asked	1
them	1
in	1
ourselves	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
officers	1
among	1
them....	1
You	1
know,	1
I	1
think,	1
my	1
dear...	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
taken...	1
where's	1
the	1
hurry?"	1
	1
The	1
count	1
spoke	1
timidly,	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
talking	1
of	1
money	1
matters.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
this	1
tone	1
as	1
a	1
precursor	1
of	1
news	1
of	1
something	1
detrimental	1
to	1
the	1
children's	1
interests,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
gallery	1
or	1
conservatory,	1
the	1
inauguration	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
theater	1
or	1
an	1
orchestra.	1
She	1
was	1
accustomed	1
always	1
to	1
oppose	1
anything	1
announced	1
in	1
that	1
timid	1
tone	1
and	1
considered	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
She	1
assumed	1
her	1
dolefully	1
submissive	1
manner	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband:	1
"Listen	1
to	1
me,	1
Count,	1
you	1
have	1
managed	1
matters	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
getting	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
all	1
our--all	1
the	1
children's	1
property!	1
You	1
said	1
yourself	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles'	1
worth	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
I	1
don't	1
consent,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
don't!	1
Do	1
as	1
you	1
please!	1
It's	1
the	1
government's	1
business	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
wounded;	1
they	1
know	1
that.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
Lopukhins	1
opposite,	1
they	1
cleared	1
out	1
everything	1
two	1
days	1
ago.	1
That's	1
what	1
other	1
people	1
do.	1
It's	1
only	1
we	1
who	1
are	1
such	1
fools.	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
on	1
me,	1
have	1
some	1
for	1
the	1
children."	1
	1
Flourishing	1
his	1
arms	1
in	1
despair	1
the	1
count	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
replying.	1
	1
"Papa,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
that	1
for?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
mother's	1
room.	1
	1
"Nothing!	1
What	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
yours?"	1
muttered	1
the	1
count	1
angrily.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
heard,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Why	1
does	1
Mamma	1
object?"	1
	1
"What	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
yours?"	1
cried	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
Natasha	1
stepped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
pondered.	1
	1
"Papa!	1
Here's	1
Berg	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
us,"	1
said	1
she,	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Berg,	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
son-in-law,	1
was	1
already	1
a	1
colonel	1
wearing	1
the	1
orders	1
of	1
Vladimir	1
and	1
Anna,	1
and	1
he	1
still	1
filled	1
the	1
quiet	1
and	1
agreeable	1
post	1
of	1
assistant	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
assistant	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
Second	1
Army.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
the	1
army.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
asking	1
for	1
leave	1
to	1
visit	1
Moscow	1
and	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
there.	1
So	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
for	1
family	1
and	1
domestic	1
reasons.	1
	1
Berg	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father-in-law's	1
house	1
in	1
his	1
spruce	1
little	1
trap	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
sleek	1
roans,	1
exactly	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
prince.	1
He	1
looked	1
attentively	1
at	1
the	1
carts	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
while	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
clean	1
pocket	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
tied	1
a	1
knot	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
anteroom	1
Berg	1
ran	1
with	1
smooth	1
though	1
impatient	1
steps	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
he	1
embraced	1
the	1
count,	1
kissed	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
"Mamma's"	1
health.	1
	1
"Health,	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
like	1
this?"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Come,	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
news!	1
Is	1
the	1
army	1
retreating	1
or	1
will	1
there	1
be	1
another	1
battle?"	1
	1
"God	1
Almighty	1
alone	1
can	1
decide	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
our	1
fatherland,	1
Papa,"	1
said	1
Berg.	1
"The	1
army	1
is	1
burning	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
heroism	1
and	1
the	1
leaders,	1
so	1
to	1
say,	1
have	1
now	1
assembled	1
in	1
council.	1
No	1
one	1
knows	1
what	1
is	1
coming.	1
But	1
in	1
general	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
Papa,	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
heroic	1
spirit,	1
the	1
truly	1
antique	1
valor	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
which	1
they--which	1
it"	1
(he	1
corrected	1
himself)	1
"has	1
shown	1
or	1
displayed	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-sixth--	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
words	1
worthy	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
justice!	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Papa"	1
(he	1
smote	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
breast	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
speaking	1
had	1
done,	1
but	1
Berg	1
did	1
it	1
a	1
trifle	1
late	1
for	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
struck	1
his	1
breast	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
"Russian	1
army"),	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
frankly	1
that	1
we,	1
the	1
commanders,	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
to	1
urge	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
or	1
anything	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
could	1
hardly	1
restrain	1
those...	1
those...	1
yes,	1
those	1
exploits	1
of	1
antique	1
valor,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
rapidly.	1
"General	1
Barclay	1
de	1
Tolly	1
risked	1
his	1
life	1
everywhere	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
troops,	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you.	1
Our	1
corps	1
was	1
stationed	1
on	1
a	1
hillside.	1
You	1
can	1
imagine!"	1
	1
And	1
Berg	1
related	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
tales	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
those	1
days.	1
Natasha	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
intent	1
gaze	1
that	1
confused	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
some	1
question.	1
	1
"Altogether	1
such	1
heroism	1
as	1
was	1
displayed	1
by	1
the	1
Russian	1
warriors	1
cannot	1
be	1
imagined	1
or	1
adequately	1
praised!"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
glancing	1
round	1
at	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
anxious	1
to	1
conciliate	1
her,	1
replying	1
to	1
her	1
intent	1
look	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"'Russia	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
she	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
her	1
sons!'	1
Isn't	1
it	1
so,	1
Papa?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
the	1
countess	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
weary	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
expression.	1
Berg	1
hurriedly	1
jumped	1
up,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
asked	1
about	1
her	1
health,	1
and,	1
swaying	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
to	1
express	1
sympathy,	1
remained	1
standing	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
sincerely	1
that	1
these	1
are	1
hard	1
and	1
sad	1
times	1
for	1
every	1
Russian.	1
But	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
anxious?	1
You	1
have	1
still	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
away...."	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
think	1
what	1
the	1
servants	1
are	1
about,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
nothing	1
is	1
ready	1
yet.	1
Somebody	1
after	1
all	1
must	1
see	1
to	1
things.	1
One	1
misses	1
Mitenka	1
at	1
such	1
times.	1
There	1
won't	1
be	1
any	1
end	1
to	1
it."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
evidently	1
restrained	1
himself.	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Berg	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
blow	1
his	1
nose	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
knot	1
in	1
it,	1
pondered,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
sadly	1
and	1
significantly.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
favor	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
you,	1
Papa,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Hm..."	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
stopped.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
driving	1
past	1
Yusupov's	1
house	1
just	1
now,"	1
said	1
Berg	1
with	1
a	1
laugh,	1
"when	1
the	1
steward,	1
a	1
man	1
I	1
know,	1
ran	1
out	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
whether	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
buy	1
something.	1
I	1
went	1
in	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
chiffonier	1
and	1
a	1
dressing	1
table.	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
dear	1
Vera	1
wanted	1
a	1
chiffonier	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
how	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
dispute	1
about	1
it."	1
(At	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
chiffonier	1
and	1
dressing	1
table	1
Berg	1
involuntarily	1
changed	1
his	1
tone	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
pleasure	1
at	1
his	1
admirable	1
domestic	1
arrangements.)	1
"And	1
it's	1
such	1
a	1
beauty!	1
It	1
pulls	1
out	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
secret	1
English	1
drawer,	1
you	1
know!	1
And	1
dear	1
Vera	1
has	1
long	1
wanted	1
one.	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
surprise,	1
you	1
see.	1
I	1
saw	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
peasant	1
carts	1
in	1
your	1
yard.	1
Please	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
one,	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
the	1
man	1
well,	1
and..."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
frowned	1
and	1
coughed.	1
	1
"Ask	1
the	1
countess,	1
I	1
don't	1
give	1
orders."	1
	1
"If	1
it's	1
inconvenient,	1
please	1
don't,"	1
said	1
Berg.	1
"Only	1
I	1
so	1
wanted	1
it,	1
for	1
dear	1
Vera's	1
sake."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
devil,	1
all	1
of	1
you!	1
To	1
the	1
devil,	1
the	1
devil,	1
the	1
devil..."	1
cried	1
the	1
old	1
count.	1
"My	1
head's	1
in	1
a	1
whirl!"	1
	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
countess	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Mamma!	1
Yes,	1
these	1
are	1
very	1
hard	1
times!"	1
said	1
Berg.	1
	1
Natasha	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
finding	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
reach	1
some	1
decision,	1
first	1
followed	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
downstairs.	1
	1
Petya	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
porch,	1
engaged	1
in	1
giving	1
out	1
weapons	1
to	1
the	1
servants	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
loaded	1
carts	1
were	1
still	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
Two	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
uncorded	1
and	1
a	1
wounded	1
officer	1
was	1
climbing	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
helped	1
by	1
an	1
orderly.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
it's	1
about?"	1
Petya	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
She	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
what	1
were	1
their	1
parents	1
quarreling	1
about.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
	1
"It's	1
because	1
Papa	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
carts	1
to	1
the	1
wounded,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
"Vasilich	1
told	1
me.	1
I	1
consider..."	1
	1
"I	1
consider,"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
almost	1
shouted,	1
turning	1
her	1
angry	1
face	1
to	1
Petya,	1
"I	1
consider	1
it	1
so	1
horrid,	1
so	1
abominable,	1
so...	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what.	1
Are	1
we	1
despicable	1
Germans?"	1
	1
Her	1
throat	1
quivered	1
with	1
convulsive	1
sobs	1
and,	1
afraid	1
of	1
weakening	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
her	1
anger	1
run	1
to	1
waste,	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
rushed	1
headlong	1
up	1
the	1
stairs.	1
	1
Berg	1
was	1
sitting	1
beside	1
the	1
countess	1
consoling	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
respectful	1
attention	1
of	1
a	1
relative.	1
The	1
count,	1
pipe	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
when	1
Natasha,	1
her	1
face	1
distorted	1
by	1
anger,	1
burst	1
in	1
like	1
a	1
tempest	1
and	1
approached	1
her	1
mother	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps.	1
	1
"It's	1
horrid!	1
It's	1
abominable!"	1
she	1
screamed.	1
"You	1
can't	1
possibly	1
have	1
ordered	1
it!"	1
	1
Berg	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
perplexed	1
and	1
frightened.	1
The	1
count	1
stood	1
still	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
listened.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
it's	1
impossible:	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
yard!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"They	1
will	1
be	1
left!..."	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
Who	1
are	1
'they'?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
the	1
wounded!	1
It's	1
impossible,	1
Mamma.	1
It's	1
monstrous!...	1
No,	1
Mamma	1
darling,	1
it's	1
not	1
the	1
thing.	1
Please	1
forgive	1
me,	1
darling....	1
Mamma,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
what	1
we	1
take	1
away?	1
Only	1
look	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
yard...	1
Mamma!...	1
It's	1
impossible!"	1
	1
The	1
count	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
listened	1
without	1
turning	1
round.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
sniffed	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
face	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
daughter,	1
saw	1
her	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
shame	1
for	1
her	1
mother,	1
saw	1
her	1
agitation,	1
and	1
understood	1
why	1
her	1
husband	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
now,	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
round	1
quite	1
disconcerted.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
like!	1
Am	1
I	1
hindering	1
anyone?"	1
she	1
said,	1
not	1
surrendering	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
"Mamma,	1
darling,	1
forgive	1
me!"	1
	1
But	1
the	1
countess	1
pushed	1
her	1
daughter	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,	1
you	1
order	1
what	1
is	1
right....	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
she,	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyes	1
shamefacedly.	1
	1
"The	1
eggs...	1
the	1
eggs	1
are	1
teaching	1
the	1
hen,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
count	1
through	1
tears	1
of	1
joy,	1
and	1
he	1
embraced	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
look	1
of	1
shame	1
on	1
his	1
breast.	1
	1
"Papa!	1
Mamma!	1
May	1
I	1
see	1
to	1
it?	1
May	1
I?..."	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
"We	1
will	1
still	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
most	1
necessary	1
things."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
nodded	1
affirmatively,	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
at	1
the	1
rapid	1
pace	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
run	1
when	1
playing	1
at	1
tag,	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
ballroom	1
to	1
the	1
anteroom	1
and	1
downstairs	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
The	1
servants	1
gathered	1
round	1
Natasha,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
the	1
strange	1
order	1
she	1
brought	1
them	1
until	1
the	1
count	1
himself,	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
name,	1
confirmed	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
carts	1
to	1
the	1
wounded	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
trunks	1
to	1
the	1
storerooms.	1
When	1
they	1
understood	1
that	1
order	1
the	1
servants	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
this	1
new	1
task	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
zeal.	1
It	1
no	1
longer	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
done,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
anyone	1
that	1
the	1
wounded	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
the	1
goods	1
carted	1
away	1
but	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
The	1
whole	1
household,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
it	1
sooner,	1
set	1
eagerly	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
task	1
of	1
placing	1
the	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
carts.	1
The	1
wounded	1
dragged	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
rooms	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
pale	1
but	1
happy	1
faces	1
round	1
the	1
carts.	1
The	1
news	1
that	1
carts	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
spread	1
to	1
the	1
neighboring	1
houses,	1
from	1
which	1
wounded	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
yard.	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
asked	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
unload	1
the	1
carts	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
things.	1
But	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
unloading,	1
once	1
started,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
arrested.	1
It	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
matter	1
whether	1
all	1
or	1
only	1
half	1
the	1
things	1
were	1
left	1
behind.	1
Cases	1
full	1
of	1
china,	1
bronzes,	1
pictures,	1
and	1
mirrors	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
carefully	1
packed	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
now	1
lay	1
about	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
still	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
searching	1
for	1
and	1
finding	1
possibilities	1
of	1
unloading	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
wounded	1
have	1
another	1
and	1
yet	1
another	1
cart.	1
	1
"We	1
can	1
take	1
four	1
more	1
men,"	1
said	1
the	1
steward.	1
"They	1
can	1
have	1
my	1
trap,	1
or	1
else	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
of	1
them?"	1
	1
"Let	1
them	1
have	1
my	1
wardrobe	1
cart,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
"Dunyasha	1
can	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
carriage."	1
	1
They	1
unloaded	1
the	1
wardrobe	1
cart	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
wounded	1
men	1
from	1
a	1
house	1
two	1
doors	1
off.	1
The	1
whole	1
household,	1
servants	1
included,	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
animated.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
rapturous	1
excitement	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
"What	1
could	1
we	1
fasten	1
this	1
onto?"	1
asked	1
the	1
servants,	1
trying	1
to	1
fix	1
a	1
trunk	1
on	1
the	1
narrow	1
footboard	1
behind	1
a	1
carriage.	1
"We	1
must	1
keep	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
cart."	1
	1
"What's	1
in	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"The	1
count's	1
books."	1
	1
"Leave	1
it,	1
Vasilich	1
will	1
put	1
it	1
away.	1
It's	1
not	1
wanted."	1
	1
The	1
phaeton	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
people	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
Count	1
Peter	1
could	1
sit.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
box.	1
You'll	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
box,	1
won't	1
you,	1
Petya?"	1
cried	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Sonya	1
too	1
was	1
busy	1
all	1
this	1
time,	1
but	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
her	1
efforts	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
Natasha's.	1
She	1
was	1
putting	1
away	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
countess	1
wished,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
much	1
taken	1
away	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
possible.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Before	1
two	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
four	1
carriages,	1
packed	1
full	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
horses	1
harnessed,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
One	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
carts	1
with	1
the	1
wounded	1
had	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
The	1
caleche	1
in	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
being	1
taken	1
attracted	1
Sonya's	1
attention	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
the	1
front	1
porch.	1
With	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
a	1
maid	1
she	1
was	1
arranging	1
a	1
seat	1
for	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
the	1
huge	1
high	1
coach	1
that	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
entrance.	1
	1
"Whose	1
caleche	1
is	1
that?"	1
she	1
inquired,	1
leaning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
window.	1
	1
"Why,	1
didn't	1
you	1
know,	1
Miss?"	1
replied	1
the	1
maid.	1
"The	1
wounded	1
prince:	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
our	1
house	1
and	1
is	1
going	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
"But	1
who	1
is	1
it?	1
What's	1
his	1
name?"	1
	1
"It's	1
our	1
intended	1
that	1
was--Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
himself!	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
dying,"	1
replied	1
the	1
maid	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
Sonya	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
countess.	1
The	1
countess,	1
tired	1
out	1
and	1
already	1
dressed	1
in	1
shawl	1
and	1
bonnet	1
for	1
her	1
journey,	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
household	1
to	1
assemble	1
for	1
the	1
usual	1
silent	1
prayer	1
with	1
closed	1
doors	1
before	1
starting.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Mamma,"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
"Prince	1
Andrew	1
is	1
here,	1
mortally	1
wounded.	1
He	1
is	1
going	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
in	1
dismay	1
and,	1
seizing	1
Sonya's	1
arm,	1
glanced	1
around.	1
	1
"Natasha?"	1
she	1
murmured.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
this	1
news	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
significance	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
They	1
knew	1
their	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
alarm	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
she	1
heard	1
this	1
news	1
stifled	1
all	1
sympathy	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
they	1
both	1
liked.	1
	1
"Natasha	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
yet,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
with	1
us,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"You	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
dying?"	1
	1
Sonya	1
nodded.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
put	1
her	1
arms	1
around	1
Sonya	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"The	1
ways	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
past	1
finding	1
out!"	1
she	1
thought,	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
Almighty	1
Hand,	1
hitherto	1
unseen,	1
was	1
becoming	1
manifest	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
now	1
taking	1
place.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Mamma?	1
Everything	1
is	1
ready.	1
What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
asked	1
Natasha,	1
as	1
with	1
animated	1
face	1
she	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Nothing,"	1
answered	1
the	1
countess.	1
"If	1
everything	1
is	1
ready	1
let	1
us	1
start."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
countess	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
reticule	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
agitated	1
face.	1
Sonya	1
embraced	1
Natasha	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
inquiringly.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
has	1
happened?"	1
	1
"Nothing...	1
No..."	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
something	1
very	1
bad	1
for	1
me?	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
persisted	1
Natasha	1
with	1
her	1
quick	1
intuition.	1
	1
Sonya	1
sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
The	1
count,	1
Petya,	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
and	1
Vasilich	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and,	1
having	1
closed	1
the	1
doors,	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
remained	1
for	1
some	1
moments	1
silently	1
seated	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
rise,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
sigh	1
crossed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
icon.	1
All	1
the	1
others	1
did	1
the	1
same.	1
Then	1
the	1
count	1
embraced	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
and	1
Vasilich,	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
caught	1
at	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
shoulder	1
he	1
patted	1
their	1
backs	1
lightly	1
with	1
some	1
vaguely	1
affectionate	1
and	1
comforting	1
words.	1
The	1
countess	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
oratory	1
and	1
there	1
Sonya	1
found	1
her	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
before	1
the	1
icons	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
(The	1
most	1
precious	1
ones,	1
with	1
which	1
some	1
family	1
tradition	1
was	1
connected,	1
were	1
being	1
taken	1
with	1
them.)	1
	1
In	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
Petya	1
had	1
armed	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
daggers,	1
with	1
trousers	1
tucked	1
inside	1
their	1
high	1
boots	1
and	1
with	1
belts	1
and	1
girdles	1
tightened,	1
were	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
those	1
remaining	1
behind.	1
	1
As	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
at	1
a	1
departure,	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
or	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
place,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
two	1
menservants	1
stood	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
waiting	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
countess	1
in,	1
while	1
maids	1
rushed	1
with	1
cushions	1
and	1
bundles	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
carriages,	1
the	1
caleche,	1
the	1
phaeton,	1
and	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
"They	1
always	1
will	1
forget	1
everything!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
can't	1
sit	1
like	1
that?"	1
	1
And	1
Dunyasha,	1
with	1
clenched	1
teeth,	1
without	1
replying	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
aggrieved	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
hastily	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
coach	1
to	1
rearrange	1
the	1
seat.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
those	1
servants!"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
swaying	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
Efim,	1
the	1
old	1
coachman,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
the	1
countess	1
trusted	1
to	1
drive	1
her,	1
sat	1
perched	1
up	1
high	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
glance	1
round	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
behind	1
him.	1
From	1
thirty	1
years'	1
experience	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
some	1
time	1
yet	1
before	1
the	1
order,	1
"Be	1
off,	1
in	1
God's	1
name!"	1
would	1
be	1
given	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
even	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
stopped	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
more	1
while	1
they	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
fetch	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
even	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
again	1
be	1
stopped	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
herself	1
would	1
lean	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
beg	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
heaven	1
to	1
drive	1
carefully	1
down	1
the	1
hill.	1
He	1
knew	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
therefore	1
waited	1
calmly	1
for	1
what	1
would	1
happen,	1
with	1
more	1
patience	1
than	1
the	1
horses,	1
especially	1
the	1
near	1
one,	1
the	1
chestnut	1
Falcon,	1
who	1
was	1
pawing	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
champing	1
his	1
bit.	1
At	1
last	1
all	1
were	1
seated,	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
were	1
folded	1
and	1
pulled	1
up,	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut,	1
somebody	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
a	1
traveling	1
case,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
leaned	1
out	1
and	1
said	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
say.	1
Then	1
Efim	1
deliberately	1
doffed	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
began	1
crossing	1
himself.	1
The	1
postilion	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
servants	1
did	1
the	1
same.	1
"Off,	1
in	1
God's	1
name!"	1
said	1
Efim,	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
hat.	1
"Start!"	1
The	1
postilion	1
started	1
the	1
horses,	1
the	1
off	1
pole	1
horse	1
tugged	1
at	1
his	1
collar,	1
the	1
high	1
springs	1
creaked,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
swayed.	1
The	1
footman	1
sprang	1
onto	1
the	1
box	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
coach	1
which	1
jolted	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
onto	1
the	1
uneven	1
roadway;	1
the	1
other	1
vehicles	1
jolted	1
in	1
their	1
turn,	1
and	1
the	1
procession	1
of	1
carriages	1
moved	1
up	1
the	1
street.	1
In	1
the	1
carriages,	1
the	1
caleche,	1
and	1
the	1
phaeton,	1
all	1
crossed	1
themselves	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
the	1
church	1
opposite	1
the	1
house.	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
walked	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
vehicles	1
seeing	1
the	1
travelers	1
off.	1
	1
Rarely	1
had	1
Natasha	1
experienced	1
so	1
joyful	1
a	1
feeling	1
as	1
now,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
beside	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
slowly	1
receding	1
walls	1
of	1
forsaken,	1
agitated	1
Moscow.	1
Occasionally	1
she	1
leaned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
window	1
and	1
looked	1
back	1
and	1
then	1
forward	1
at	1
the	1
long	1
train	1
of	1
wounded	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
Almost	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
raised	1
hood	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
caleche.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
each	1
time	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
procession	1
her	1
eyes	1
sought	1
that	1
caleche.	1
She	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
front.	1
	1
In	1
Kudrino,	1
from	1
the	1
Nikitski,	1
Presnya,	1
and	1
Podnovinsk	1
Streets	1
came	1
several	1
other	1
trains	1
of	1
vehicles	1
similar	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs',	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
Sadovaya	1
Street	1
the	1
carriages	1
and	1
carts	1
formed	1
two	1
rows	1
abreast.	1
	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
round	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
water	1
tower	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
inquisitively	1
and	1
alertly	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
people	1
driving	1
or	1
walking	1
past,	1
suddenly	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
joyful	1
surprise:	1
	1
"Dear	1
me!	1
Mamma,	1
Sonya,	1
look,	1
it's	1
he!"	1
	1
"Who?	1
Who?"	1
	1
"Look!	1
Yes,	1
on	1
my	1
word,	1
it's	1
Bezukhov!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
putting	1
her	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
staring	1
at	1
a	1
tall,	1
stout	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
coachman's	1
long	1
coat,	1
who	1
from	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
walking	1
and	1
moving	1
was	1
evidently	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
disguise,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
passing	1
under	1
the	1
arch	1
of	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
tower	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
small,	1
sallow-faced,	1
beardless	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
frieze	1
coat.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
really	1
is	1
Bezukhov	1
in	1
a	1
coachman's	1
coat,	1
with	1
a	1
queer-looking	1
old	1
boy.	1
Really,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
"look,	1
look!"	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
he.	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
such	1
nonsense?"	1
	1
"Mamma,"	1
screamed	1
Natasha,	1
"I'll	1
stake	1
my	1
head	1
it's	1
he!	1
I	1
assure	1
you!	1
Stop,	1
stop!"	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
coachman.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
coachman	1
could	1
not	1
stop,	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
Meshchanski	1
Street	1
came	1
more	1
carts	1
and	1
carriages,	1
and	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
being	1
shouted	1
at	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
and	1
not	1
block	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
In	1
fact,	1
however,	1
though	1
now	1
much	1
farther	1
off	1
than	1
before,	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
all	1
saw	1
Pierre--or	1
someone	1
extraordinarily	1
like	1
him--in	1
a	1
coachman's	1
coat,	1
going	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
with	1
head	1
bent	1
and	1
a	1
serious	1
face	1
beside	1
a	1
small,	1
beardless	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
footman.	1
That	1
old	1
man	1
noticed	1
a	1
face	1
thrust	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
window	1
gazing	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
respectfully	1
touching	1
Pierre's	1
elbow	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
carriage.	1
Pierre,	1
evidently	1
engrossed	1
in	1
thought,	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
understand	1
him.	1
At	1
length	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
indicated,	1
he	1
recognized	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
following	1
his	1
first	1
impulse	1
stepped	1
instantly	1
and	1
rapidly	1
toward	1
the	1
coach.	1
But	1
having	1
taken	1
a	1
dozen	1
steps	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
remember	1
something	1
and	1
stopped.	1
	1
Natasha's	1
face,	1
leaning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
beamed	1
with	1
quizzical	1
kindliness.	1
	1
"Peter	1
Kirilovich,	1
come	1
here!	1
We	1
have	1
recognized	1
you!	1
This	1
is	1
wonderful!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing?	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
like	1
this?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
her	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
awkwardly	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
along	1
beside	1
her	1
while	1
the	1
coach	1
still	1
moved	1
on.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
Count?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
a	1
surprised	1
and	1
commiserating	1
tone.	1
	1
"What?	1
What?	1
Why?	1
Don't	1
ask	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Natasha	1
whose	1
radiant,	1
happy	1
expression--of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her--filled	1
him	1
with	1
enchantment.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
remaining	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
then?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
hesitated.	1
	1
"In	1
Moscow?"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
questioning	1
tone.	1
"Yes,	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Good-bye!"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
if	1
only	1
I	1
were	1
a	1
man!	1
I'd	1
certainly	1
stay	1
with	1
you.	1
How	1
splendid!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Mamma,	1
if	1
you'll	1
let	1
me,	1
I'll	1
stay!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
absently	1
at	1
Natasha	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
the	1
countess	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
battle,	1
we	1
heard."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was,"	1
Pierre	1
answered.	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
another	1
battle	1
tomorrow..."	1
he	1
began,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
Count?	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
like	1
yourself...."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
ask	1
me,	1
don't	1
ask	1
me!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
myself.	1
Tomorrow...	1
But	1
no!	1
Good-bye,	1
good-by!"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
"It's	1
an	1
awful	1
time!"	1
and	1
dropping	1
behind	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
stepped	1
onto	1
the	1
pavement.	1
	1
Natasha	1
continued	1
to	1
lean	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
beaming	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
kindly,	1
slightly	1
quizzical,	1
happy	1
smile.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
days,	1
ever	1
since	1
leaving	1
home,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
deceased	1
benefactor,	1
Bazdeev.	1
This	1
is	1
how	1
it	1
happened.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
make	1
out	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
among	1
others	1
awaiting	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
reception	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
Countess	1
Helene,	1
he	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
overcome	1
by	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
confusion	1
and	1
hopelessness	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
apt	1
to	1
succumb.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
now	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
all	1
was	1
in	1
confusion	1
and	1
crumbling	1
to	1
pieces,	1
that	1
nobody	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong,	1
the	1
future	1
held	1
nothing,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
position.	1
Smiling	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
muttering	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
first	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
an	1
attitude	1
of	1
despair,	1
then	1
rose,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
and	1
peeped	1
through	1
the	1
crack,	1
returned	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book.	1
His	1
major-domo	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
and	1
that	1
someone	1
from	1
Bazdeev's	1
widow	1
had	1
called	1
to	1
ask	1
Pierre	1
to	1
take	1
charge	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
books,	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
leaving	1
for	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
in	1
a	1
minute;	1
wait...	1
or	1
no!	1
No,	1
of	1
course...	1
go	1
and	1
say	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
directly,"	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
to	1
the	1
major-domo.	1
	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Pierre	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
hat	1
which	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
study	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
He	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
this	1
passage	1
to	1
the	1
stairs	1
and,	1
frowning	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
forehead	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
went	1
down	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
landing.	1
The	1
hall	1
porter	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
From	1
the	1
landing	1
where	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
second	1
staircase	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
entrance.	1
He	1
went	1
down	1
that	1
staircase	1
and	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
seen	1
him.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
carriages	1
waiting,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Pierre	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
the	1
coachmen	1
and	1
the	1
yard	1
porter	1
noticed	1
him	1
and	1
raised	1
their	1
caps	1
to	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
looked	1
at	1
he	1
behaved	1
like	1
an	1
ostrich	1
which	1
hides	1
its	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
bush	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen:	1
he	1
hung	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
quickening	1
his	1
pace	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
affairs	1
awaiting	1
Pierre	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
sorting	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Bazdeev's	1
books	1
and	1
papers	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
necessary.	1
	1
He	1
hired	1
the	1
first	1
cab	1
he	1
met	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Patriarch's	1
Ponds,	1
where	1
the	1
widow	1
Bazdeev's	1
house	1
was.	1
	1
Continually	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
loaded	1
carts	1
that	1
were	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
balancing	1
his	1
bulky	1
body	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
slip	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ramshackle	1
old	1
vehicle,	1
Pierre,	1
experiencing	1
the	1
joyful	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
escaping	1
from	1
school,	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
his	1
driver.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
arms	1
were	1
being	1
distributed	1
today	1
at	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
and	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
everyone	1
would	1
be	1
sent	1
out	1
beyond	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
gates	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
battle	1
would	1
be	1
fought	1
there.	1
	1
Having	1
reached	1
the	1
Patriarch's	1
Ponds	1
Pierre	1
found	1
the	1
Bazdeevs'	1
house,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
past.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
Gerasim,	1
that	1
sallow	1
beardless	1
old	1
man	1
Pierre	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
Torzhok	1
five	1
years	1
before	1
with	1
Joseph	1
Bazdeev,	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
knock.	1
	1
"At	1
home?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Owing	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
Sophia	1
Danilovna	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
Torzhok	1
estate	1
with	1
the	1
children,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
look	1
through	1
the	1
books,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
step	1
in.	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
my	1
late	1
master--may	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
be	1
his--has	1
remained	1
here,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
weak	1
state	1
as	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
servant.	1
	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
that	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
Joseph	1
Bazdeev's	1
half-insane	1
brother	1
and	1
a	1
hard	1
drinker.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
know.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
in..."	1
said	1
Pierre	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
A	1
tall,	1
bald-headed	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
nose,	1
wearing	1
a	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
with	1
galoshes	1
on	1
his	1
bare	1
feet,	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Pierre	1
he	1
muttered	1
something	1
angrily	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
man	1
but	1
has	1
now	1
grown	1
quite	1
feeble,	1
as	1
your	1
honor	1
sees,"	1
said	1
Gerasim.	1
"Will	1
you	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
study?"	1
Pierre	1
nodded.	1
"As	1
it	1
was	1
sealed	1
up	1
so	1
it	1
has	1
remained,	1
but	1
Sophia	1
Danilovna	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
if	1
anyone	1
should	1
come	1
from	1
you	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
books."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
into	1
that	1
gloomy	1
study	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
with	1
such	1
trepidation	1
in	1
his	1
benefactor's	1
lifetime.	1
The	1
room,	1
dusty	1
and	1
untouched	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Bazdeev	1
was	1
now	1
even	1
gloomier.	1
	1
Gerasim	1
opened	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
shutters	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
on	1
tiptoe.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
study,	1
approached	1
the	1
cupboard	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
manuscripts	1
were	1
kept,	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important,	1
the	1
holy	1
of	1
holies	1
of	1
the	1
order.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
authentic	1
Scotch	1
Acts	1
with	1
Bazdeev's	1
notes	1
and	1
explanations.	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
dusty	1
writing	1
table,	1
and,	1
having	1
laid	1
the	1
manuscripts	1
before	1
him,	1
opened	1
them	1
out,	1
closed	1
them,	1
finally	1
pushed	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
resting	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
sank	1
into	1
meditation.	1
	1
Gerasim	1
looked	1
cautiously	1
into	1
the	1
study	1
several	1
times	1
and	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
always	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
attitude.	1
	1
More	1
than	1
two	1
hours	1
passed	1
and	1
Gerasim	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
slight	1
noise	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
attract	1
his	1
attention,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
cabman	1
to	1
be	1
discharged,	1
your	1
honor?"	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
rousing	1
himself	1
and	1
rising	1
hurriedly.	1
"Look	1
here,"	1
he	1
added,	1
taking	1
Gerasim	1
by	1
a	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
moist,	1
shining,	1
and	1
ecstatic	1
eyes,	1
"I	1
say,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
battle	1
tomorrow?"	1
	1
"We	1
heard	1
so,"	1
replied	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
anyone	1
who	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
ask	1
you."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
Gerasim.	1
"Will	1
you	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
eat?"	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
want	1
something	1
else.	1
I	1
want	1
peasant	1
clothes	1
and	1
a	1
pistol,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
unexpectedly	1
blushing.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Gerasim	1
after	1
thinking	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
Pierre	1
spent	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
benefactor's	1
study,	1
and	1
Gerasim	1
heard	1
him	1
pacing	1
restlessly	1
from	1
one	1
corner	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
himself.	1
And	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
Gerasim,	1
being	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
time	1
had	1
seen	1
many	1
strange	1
things,	1
accepted	1
Pierre's	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
residence	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
surprise,	1
and	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
to	1
wait	1
on.	1
That	1
same	1
evening--	1
without	1
even	1
asking	1
himself	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
wanted	1
for--he	1
procured	1
a	1
coachman's	1
coat	1
and	1
cap	1
for	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
the	1
pistol	1
next	1
day.	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
came	1
twice	1
that	1
evening	1
shuffling	1
along	1
in	1
his	1
galoshes	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
ingratiatingly	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
toward	1
him	1
he	1
wrapped	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
shamefaced	1
and	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
hurried	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
when	1
Pierre	1
(wearing	1
the	1
coachman's	1
coat	1
which	1
Gerasim	1
had	1
procured	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
disinfected	1
by	1
steam)	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
to	1
buy	1
the	1
pistol	1
at	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
market	1
that	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
order	1
to	1
retreat	1
through	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road	1
was	1
issued	1
at	1
night	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
troops	1
started	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
they	1
marched	1
slowly	1
and	1
steadily	1
without	1
hurry.	1
At	1
daybreak,	1
however,	1
those	1
nearing	1
the	1
town	1
at	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
bridge	1
saw	1
ahead	1
of	1
them	1
masses	1
of	1
soldiers	1
crowding	1
and	1
hurrying	1
across	1
the	1
bridge,	1
ascending	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
and	1
blocking	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
alleys,	1
while	1
endless	1
masses	1
of	1
troops	1
were	1
bearing	1
down	1
on	1
them	1
from	1
behind,	1
and	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
hurry	1
and	1
alarm	1
overcame	1
them.	1
They	1
all	1
rushed	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
bridge,	1
onto	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
fords	1
and	1
the	1
boats.	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
had	1
driven	1
round	1
by	1
side	1
streets	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
	1
By	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September,	1
only	1
the	1
rear	1
guard	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
suburb,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
ample	1
room.	1
The	1
main	1
army	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Moscow	1
or	1
beyond	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
very	1
time,	1
at	1
ten	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September,	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
standing	1
among	1
his	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
panorama	1
spread	1
out	1
before	1
him.	1
From	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
of	1
August	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September,	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
to	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
into	1
Moscow,	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
agitating,	1
memorable	1
week,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
autumn	1
weather	1
that	1
always	1
comes	1
as	1
a	1
surprise,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
hangs	1
low	1
and	1
gives	1
more	1
heat	1
than	1
in	1
spring,	1
when	1
everything	1
shines	1
so	1
brightly	1
in	1
the	1
rare	1
clear	1
atmosphere	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
smart,	1
when	1
the	1
lungs	1
are	1
strengthened	1
and	1
refreshed	1
by	1
inhaling	1
the	1
aromatic	1
autumn	1
air,	1
when	1
even	1
the	1
nights	1
are	1
warm,	1
and	1
when	1
in	1
those	1
dark	1
warm	1
nights,	1
golden	1
stars	1
startle	1
and	1
delight	1
us	1
continually	1
by	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1
sky.	1
	1
At	1
ten	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September	1
this	1
weather	1
still	1
held.	1
	1
The	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
magical.	1
Moscow	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
lay	1
spaciously	1
spread	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
river,	1
her	1
gardens,	1
and	1
her	1
churches,	1
and	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
living	1
her	1
usual	1
life,	1
her	1
cupolas	1
glittering	1
like	1
stars	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight.	1
	1
The	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
city	1
with	1
its	1
peculiar	1
architecture,	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before,	1
filled	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
the	1
rather	1
envious	1
and	1
uneasy	1
curiosity	1
men	1
feel	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
an	1
alien	1
form	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
has	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them.	1
This	1
city	1
was	1
evidently	1
living	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
force	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
life.	1
By	1
the	1
indefinite	1
signs	1
which,	1
even	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
distinguish	1
a	1
living	1
body	1
from	1
a	1
dead	1
one,	1
Napoleon	1
from	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
perceived	1
the	1
throb	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
felt,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
breathing	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
beautiful	1
body.	1
	1
Every	1
Russian	1
looking	1
at	1
Moscow	1
feels	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mother;	1
every	1
foreigner	1
who	1
sees	1
her,	1
even	1
if	1
ignorant	1
of	1
her	1
significance	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
city,	1
must	1
feel	1
her	1
feminine	1
character,	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
felt	1
it.	1
	1
"Cette	1
ville	1
asiatique	1
aux	1
innombrables	1
eglises,	1
Moscou	1
la	1
sainte.	1
La	1
voila	1
done	1
enfin,	1
cette	1
fameuse	1
ville!	1
Il	1
etait	1
temps,"	1
*	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
dismounting	1
he	1
ordered	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
be	1
spread	1
out	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
summoned	1
Lelorgne	1
d'Ideville,	1
the	1
interpreter.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"That	1
Asiatic	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
churches,	1
holy	1
Moscow!	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
then	1
at	1
last,	1
that	1
famous	1
city.	1
It	1
was	1
high	1
time."	1
	1
"A	1
town	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
maid	1
who	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
honor,"	1
thought	1
he	1
(he	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
to	1
Tuchkov	1
at	1
Smolensk).	1
From	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
Oriental	1
beauty	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
before.	1
It	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
long-felt	1
wish,	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
unattainable,	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
been	1
realized.	1
In	1
the	1
clear	1
morning	1
light	1
he	1
gazed	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
plan,	1
considering	1
its	1
details,	1
and	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
possessing	1
it	1
agitated	1
and	1
awed	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
otherwise?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Here	1
is	1
this	1
capital	1
at	1
my	1
feet.	1
Where	1
is	1
Alexander	1
now,	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
he	1
thinking?	1
A	1
strange,	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
majestic	1
city;	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
majestic	1
moment!	1
In	1
what	1
light	1
must	1
I	1
appear	1
to	1
them!"	1
thought	1
he,	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
troops.	1
"Here	1
she	1
is,	1
the	1
reward	1
for	1
all	1
those	1
fainthearted	1
men,"	1
he	1
reflected,	1
glancing	1
at	1
those	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
troops	1
who	1
were	1
approaching	1
and	1
forming	1
up.	1
"One	1
word	1
from	1
me,	1
one	1
movement	1
of	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
that	1
ancient	1
capital	1
of	1
the	1
Tsars	1
would	1
perish.	1
But	1
my	1
clemency	1
is	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
descend	1
upon	1
the	1
vanquished.	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
magnanimous	1
and	1
truly	1
great.	1
But	1
no,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
Moscow,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
thought.	1
"Yet	1
here	1
she	1
is	1
lying	1
at	1
my	1
feet,	1
with	1
her	1
golden	1
domes	1
and	1
crosses	1
scintillating	1
and	1
twinkling	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine.	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
spare	1
her.	1
On	1
the	1
ancient	1
monuments	1
of	1
barbarism	1
and	1
despotism	1
I	1
will	1
inscribe	1
great	1
words	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
mercy....	1
It	1
is	1
just	1
this	1
which	1
Alexander	1
will	1
feel	1
most	1
painfully,	1
I	1
know	1
him."	1
(It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
import	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
personal	1
struggle	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
Alexander.)	1
"From	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
Kremlin--yes,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
yes--I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
just	1
laws;	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
them	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
true	1
civilization,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
generations	1
of	1
boyars	1
remember	1
their	1
conqueror	1
with	1
love.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
the	1
deputation	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
do	1
not,	1
desire	1
war,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
waged	1
war	1
only	1
against	1
the	1
false	1
policy	1
of	1
their	1
court;	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
Alexander	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
Moscow	1
I	1
will	1
accept	1
terms	1
of	1
peace	1
worthy	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
utilize	1
the	1
fortunes	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
humiliate	1
an	1
honored	1
monarch.	1
'Boyars,'	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
them,	1
'I	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
war,	1
I	1
desire	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
welfare	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
subjects.'	1
However,	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
presence	1
will	1
inspire	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
do:	1
clearly,	1
impressively,	1
and	1
majestically.	1
But	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
Moscow?	1
Yes,	1
there	1
she	1
lies."	1
	1
"Qu'on	1
m'amene	1
les	1
boyars,"	1
*	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
suite.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Bring	1
the	1
boyars	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
A	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
brilliant	1
suite	1
galloped	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
boyars.	1
	1
Two	1
hours	1
passed.	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
lunched	1
and	1
was	1
again	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
awaiting	1
the	1
deputation.	1
His	1
speech	1
to	1
the	1
boyars	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
definite	1
shape	1
in	1
his	1
imagination.	1
That	1
speech	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
greatness	1
as	1
Napoleon	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
magnanimity	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
adopt	1
toward	1
Moscow.	1
In	1
his	1
imagination	1
he	1
appointed	1
days	1
for	1
assemblies	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
Tsars,	1
at	1
which	1
Russian	1
notables	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
would	1
mingle.	1
He	1
mentally	1
appointed	1
a	1
governor,	1
one	1
who	1
would	1
win	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Having	1
learned	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
charitable	1
institutions	1
in	1
Moscow	1
he	1
mentally	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shower	1
favors	1
on	1
them	1
all.	1
He	1
thought	1
that,	1
as	1
in	1
Africa	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
burnoose	1
and	1
sit	1
in	1
a	1
mosque,	1
so	1
in	1
Moscow	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
beneficent	1
like	1
the	1
Tsars.	1
And	1
in	1
order	1
finally	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Russians--and	1
being	1
like	1
all	1
Frenchmen	1
unable	1
to	1
imagine	1
anything	1
sentimental	1
without	1
a	1
reference	1
to	1
ma	1
chere,	1
ma	1
tendre,	1
ma	1
pauvre	1
mere	1
*	1
--he	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
place	1
an	1
inscription	1
on	1
all	1
these	1
establishments	1
in	1
large	1
letters:	1
"This	1
establishment	1
is	1
dedicated	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
mother."	1
Or	1
no,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
simply:	1
Maison	1
de	1
ma	1
Mere,	1
*(2)	1
he	1
concluded.	1
"But	1
am	1
I	1
really	1
in	1
Moscow?	1
Yes,	1
here	1
it	1
lies	1
before	1
me,	1
but	1
why	1
is	1
the	1
deputation	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
appearing?"	1
he	1
wondered.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"My	1
dear,	1
my	1
tender,	1
my	1
poor	1
mother."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"House	1
of	1
my	1
Mother."	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
an	1
agitated	1
consultation	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
whispers	1
among	1
his	1
generals	1
and	1
marshals	1
at	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
his	1
suite.	1
Those	1
sent	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
deputation	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
empty,	1
that	1
everyone	1
had	1
left	1
it.	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
conferring	1
together	1
were	1
pale	1
and	1
perturbed.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
alarmed	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
by	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
(grave	1
as	1
that	1
fact	1
seemed),	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
Emperor--without	1
putting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
terrible	1
position	1
of	1
appearing	1
ridiculous--that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
awaiting	1
the	1
boyars	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
vain:	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
drunken	1
mobs	1
left	1
in	1
Moscow	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
else.	1
Some	1
said	1
that	1
a	1
deputation	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
must	1
be	1
scraped	1
together,	1
others	1
disputed	1
that	1
opinion	1
and	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
should	1
first	1
be	1
carefully	1
and	1
skillfully	1
prepared,	1
and	1
then	1
told	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
"He	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
said	1
some	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
suite.	1
"But,	1
gentlemen..."	1
	1
The	1
position	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
awkward	1
because	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
meditating	1
upon	1
his	1
magnanimous	1
plans,	1
was	1
pacing	1
patiently	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
outspread	1
map,	1
occasionally	1
glancing	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
lifted	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
and	1
proud	1
smile.	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
impossible..."	1
declared	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
shrugging	1
their	1
shoulders	1
but	1
not	1
venturing	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
implied	1
word--le	1
ridicule...	1
	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
tired	1
of	1
futile	1
expectation,	1
his	1
actor's	1
instinct	1
suggesting	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
sublime	1
moment	1
having	1
been	1
too	1
long	1
drawn	1
out	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
lose	1
its	1
sublimity,	1
gave	1
a	1
sign	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
A	1
single	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
signaling	1
gun	1
followed,	1
and	1
the	1
troops,	1
who	1
were	1
already	1
spread	1
out	1
on	1
different	1
sides	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
through	1
Tver,	1
Kaluga,	1
and	1
Dorogomilov	1
gates.	1
Faster	1
and	1
faster,	1
vying	1
with	1
one	1
another,	1
they	1
moved	1
at	1
the	1
double	1
or	1
at	1
a	1
trot,	1
vanishing	1
amid	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
dust	1
they	1
raised	1
and	1
making	1
the	1
air	1
ring	1
with	1
a	1
deafening	1
roar	1
of	1
mingling	1
shouts.	1
	1
Drawn	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
troops	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
gate,	1
but	1
there	1
again	1
stopped	1
and,	1
dismounting	1
from	1
his	1
horse,	1
paced	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
Kammer-Kollezski	1
rampart,	1
awaiting	1
the	1
deputation.	1

CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Moscow	1
was	1
empty.	1
There	1
were	1
still	1
people	1
in	1
it,	1
perhaps	1
a	1
fiftieth	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
former	1
inhabitants	1
had	1
remained,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
empty.	1
It	1
was	1
empty	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
a	1
dying	1
queenless	1
hive	1
is	1
empty.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
queenless	1
hive	1
no	1
life	1
is	1
left	1
though	1
to	1
a	1
superficial	1
glance	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
much	1
alive	1
as	1
other	1
hives.	1
	1
The	1
bees	1
circle	1
round	1
a	1
queenless	1
hive	1
in	1
the	1
hot	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
midday	1
sun	1
as	1
gaily	1
as	1
around	1
the	1
living	1
hives;	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
it	1
smells	1
of	1
honey	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
bees	1
fly	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
But	1
one	1
has	1
only	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
hive	1
to	1
realize	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
life	1
in	1
it.	1
The	1
bees	1
do	1
not	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
the	1
smell	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
that	1
meet	1
the	1
beekeeper	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
same.	1
To	1
the	1
beekeeper's	1
tap	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
hive,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
instant	1
unanimous	1
humming	1
of	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
bees	1
with	1
their	1
abdomens	1
threateningly	1
compressed,	1
and	1
producing	1
by	1
the	1
rapid	1
vibration	1
of	1
their	1
wings	1
an	1
aerial	1
living	1
sound,	1
the	1
only	1
reply	1
is	1
a	1
disconnected	1
buzzing	1
from	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
deserted	1
hive.	1
From	1
the	1
alighting	1
board,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
spirituous	1
fragrant	1
smell	1
of	1
honey	1
and	1
venom,	1
and	1
the	1
warm	1
whiffs	1
of	1
crowded	1
life,	1
comes	1
an	1
odor	1
of	1
emptiness	1
and	1
decay	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
honey.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
sentinels	1
sounding	1
the	1
alarm	1
with	1
their	1
abdomens	1
raised,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
hive.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
measured	1
quiet	1
sound	1
of	1
throbbing	1
activity,	1
like	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
boiling	1
water,	1
but	1
diverse	1
discordant	1
sounds	1
of	1
disorder.	1
In	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
long	1
black	1
robber	1
bees	1
smeared	1
with	1
honey	1
fly	1
timidly	1
and	1
shiftily.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
sting,	1
but	1
crawl	1
away	1
from	1
danger.	1
Formerly	1
only	1
bees	1
laden	1
with	1
honey	1
flew	1
into	1
the	1
hive,	1
and	1
they	1
flew	1
out	1
empty;	1
now	1
they	1
fly	1
out	1
laden.	1
The	1
beekeeper	1
opens	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
and	1
peers	1
in.	1
Instead	1
of	1
black,	1
glossy	1
bees--tamed	1
by	1
toil,	1
clinging	1
to	1
one	1
another's	1
legs	1
and	1
drawing	1
out	1
the	1
wax,	1
with	1
a	1
ceaseless	1
hum	1
of	1
labor--that	1
used	1
to	1
hang	1
in	1
long	1
clusters	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
hive,	1
drowsy	1
shriveled	1
bees	1
crawl	1
about	1
separately	1
in	1
various	1
directions	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
hive.	1
Instead	1
of	1
a	1
neatly	1
glued	1
floor,	1
swept	1
by	1
the	1
bees	1
with	1
the	1
fanning	1
of	1
their	1
wings,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
floor	1
littered	1
with	1
bits	1
of	1
wax,	1
excrement,	1
dying	1
bees	1
scarcely	1
moving	1
their	1
legs,	1
and	1
dead	1
ones	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
cleared	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
beekeeper	1
opens	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
and	1
examines	1
the	1
super.	1
Instead	1
of	1
serried	1
rows	1
of	1
bees	1
sealing	1
up	1
every	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
combs	1
and	1
keeping	1
the	1
brood	1
warm,	1
he	1
sees	1
the	1
skillful	1
complex	1
structures	1
of	1
the	1
combs,	1
but	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
their	1
former	1
state	1
of	1
purity.	1
All	1
is	1
neglected	1
and	1
foul.	1
Black	1
robber	1
bees	1
are	1
swiftly	1
and	1
stealthily	1
prowling	1
about	1
the	1
combs,	1
and	1
the	1
short	1
home	1
bees,	1
shriveled	1
and	1
listless	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
old,	1
creep	1
slowly	1
about	1
without	1
trying	1
to	1
hinder	1
the	1
robbers,	1
having	1
lost	1
all	1
motive	1
and	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
life.	1
Drones,	1
bumblebees,	1
wasps,	1
and	1
butterflies	1
knock	1
awkwardly	1
against	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
in	1
their	1
flight.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
among	1
the	1
cells	1
containing	1
dead	1
brood	1
and	1
honey	1
an	1
angry	1
buzzing	1
can	1
sometimes	1
be	1
heard.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
bees,	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
and	1
custom	1
cleaning	1
out	1
the	1
brood	1
cells,	1
with	1
efforts	1
beyond	1
their	1
strength	1
laboriously	1
drag	1
away	1
a	1
dead	1
bee	1
or	1
bumblebee	1
without	1
knowing	1
why	1
they	1
do	1
it.	1
In	1
another	1
corner	1
two	1
old	1
bees	1
are	1
languidly	1
fighting,	1
or	1
cleaning	1
themselves,	1
or	1
feeding	1
one	1
another,	1
without	1
themselves	1
knowing	1
whether	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
friendly	1
or	1
hostile	1
intent.	1
In	1
a	1
third	1
place	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
bees,	1
crushing	1
one	1
another,	1
attack	1
some	1
victim	1
and	1
fight	1
and	1
smother	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
victim,	1
enfeebled	1
or	1
killed,	1
drops	1
from	1
above	1
slowly	1
and	1
lightly	1
as	1
a	1
feather,	1
among	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
corpses.	1
The	1
keeper	1
opens	1
the	1
two	1
center	1
partitions	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
brood	1
cells.	1
In	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
close	1
dark	1
circles	1
formed	1
by	1
thousands	1
of	1
bees	1
sitting	1
back	1
to	1
back	1
and	1
guarding	1
the	1
high	1
mystery	1
of	1
generation,	1
he	1
sees	1
hundreds	1
of	1
dull,	1
listless,	1
and	1
sleepy	1
shells	1
of	1
bees.	1
They	1
have	1
almost	1
all	1
died	1
unawares,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
they	1
had	1
guarded	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
now	1
no	1
more.	1
They	1
reek	1
of	1
decay	1
and	1
death.	1
Only	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
still	1
move,	1
rise,	1
and	1
feebly	1
fly	1
to	1
settle	1
on	1
the	1
enemy's	1
hand,	1
lacking	1
the	1
spirit	1
to	1
die	1
stinging	1
him;	1
the	1
rest	1
are	1
dead	1
and	1
fall	1
as	1
lightly	1
as	1
fish	1
scales.	1
The	1
beekeeper	1
closes	1
the	1
hive,	1
chalks	1
a	1
mark	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
time	1
tears	1
out	1
its	1
contents	1
and	1
burns	1
it	1
clean.	1
	1
So	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Moscow	1
was	1
empty	1
when	1
Napoleon,	1
weary,	1
uneasy,	1
and	1
morose,	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Kammer-Kollezski	1
rampart,	1
awaiting	1
what	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
a	1
necessary,	1
if	1
but	1
formal,	1
observance	1
of	1
the	1
proprieties--a	1
deputation.	1
	1
In	1
various	1
corners	1
of	1
Moscow	1
there	1
still	1
remained	1
a	1
few	1
people	1
aimlessly	1
moving	1
about,	1
following	1
their	1
old	1
habits	1
and	1
hardly	1
aware	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing.	1
	1
When	1
with	1
due	1
circumspection	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
empty,	1
he	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
his	1
informant,	1
turned	1
away,	1
and	1
silently	1
continued	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro.	1
	1
"My	1
carriage!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
beside	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
on	1
duty	1
and	1
drove	1
into	1
the	1
suburb.	1
"Moscow	1
deserted!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"What	1
an	1
incredible	1
event!"	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
drive	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
but	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
an	1
inn	1
in	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
suburb.	1
	1
The	1
coup	1

not	1
come	1
off.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
troops	1
were	1
passing	1
through	1
Moscow	1
from	1
two	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night	1
till	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
and	1
bore	1
away	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
wounded	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
who	1
were	1
leaving.	1
	1
The	1
greatest	1
crush	1
during	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
Stone,	1
Moskva,	1
and	1
Yauza	1
bridges.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
troops,	1
dividing	1
into	1
two	1
parts	1
when	1
passing	1
around	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
were	1
thronging	1
the	1
Moskva	1
and	1
the	1
Stone	1
bridges,	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
soldiers,	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
stoppage	1
and	1
congestion,	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
bridges	1
and	1
slipped	1
stealthily	1
and	1
silently	1
past	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Vasili	1
the	1
Beatified	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
Borovitski	1
gate,	1
back	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
the	1
Red	1
Square	1
where	1
some	1
instinct	1
told	1
them	1
they	1
could	1
easily	1
take	1
things	1
not	1
belonging	1
to	1
them.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
seen	1
at	1
cheap	1
sales	1
filled	1
all	1
the	1
passages	1
and	1
alleys	1
of	1
the	1
Bazaar.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
dealers	1
with	1
voices	1
of	1
ingratiating	1
affability	1
inviting	1
customers	1
to	1
enter;	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
hawkers,	1
nor	1
the	1
usual	1
motley	1
crowd	1
of	1
female	1
purchasers--but	1
only	1
soldiers,	1
in	1
uniforms	1
and	1
overcoats	1
though	1
without	1
muskets,	1
entering	1
the	1
Bazaar	1
empty-handed	1
and	1
silently	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
out	1
through	1
its	1
passages	1
with	1
bundles.	1
Tradesmen	1
and	1
their	1
assistants	1
(of	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
few)	1
moved	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers	1
quite	1
bewildered.	1
They	1
unlocked	1
their	1
shops	1
and	1
locked	1
them	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
themselves	1
carried	1
goods	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
their	1
assistants.	1
On	1
the	1
square	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Bazaar	1
were	1
drummers	1
beating	1
the	1
muster	1
call.	1
But	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
drums	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
the	1
looting	1
soldiers	1
run	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
drum	1
as	1
formerly,	1
but	1
made	1
them,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
run	1
farther	1
away.	1
Among	1
the	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
shops	1
and	1
passages	1
some	1
men	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
gray	1
coats,	1
with	1
closely	1
shaven	1
heads.	1
Two	1
officers,	1
one	1
with	1
a	1
scarf	1
over	1
his	1
uniform	1
and	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
lean,	1
dark-gray	1
horse,	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
an	1
overcoat	1
and	1
on	1
foot,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Ilyinka	1
Street,	1
talking.	1
A	1
third	1
officer	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
"The	1
general	1
orders	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
out	1
at	1
once,	1
without	1
fail.	1
This	1
is	1
outrageous!	1
Half	1
the	1
men	1
have	1
dispersed."	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?...	1
Where?..."	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
three	1
infantrymen	1
without	1
muskets	1
who,	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
their	1
overcoats,	1
were	1
slipping	1
past	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
Bazaar	1
passage.	1
"Stop,	1
you	1
rascals!"	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
stop	1
them?"	1
replied	1
another	1
officer.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
getting	1
them	1
together.	1
The	1
army	1
should	1
push	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
rest	1
bolt,	1
that's	1
all!"	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
one	1
push	1
on?	1
They	1
are	1
stuck	1
there,	1
wedged	1
on	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
don't	1
move.	1
Shouldn't	1
we	1
put	1
a	1
cordon	1
round	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
rest	1
from	1
running	1
away?"	1
	1
"Come,	1
go	1
in	1
there	1
and	1
drive	1
them	1
out!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
senior	1
officer.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
scarf	1
dismounted,	1
called	1
up	1
a	1
drummer,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
arcade.	1
Some	1
soldiers	1
started	1
running	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
group.	1
A	1
shopkeeper	1
with	1
red	1
pimples	1
on	1
his	1
cheeks	1
near	1
the	1
nose,	1
and	1
a	1
calm,	1
persistent,	1
calculating	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
plump	1
face,	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
ostentatiously	1
approached	1
the	1
officer,	1
swinging	1
his	1
arms.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
protect	1
us!	1
We	1
won't	1
grudge	1
trifles,	1
you	1
are	1
welcome	1
to	1
anything--we	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted!	1
Pray!...	1
I'll	1
fetch	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
cloth	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
honorable	1
gentleman,	1
or	1
even	1
two	1
pieces	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
For	1
we	1
feel	1
how	1
it	1
is;	1
but	1
what's	1
all	1
this--sheer	1
robbery!	1
If	1
you	1
please,	1
could	1
not	1
guards	1
be	1
placed	1
if	1
only	1
to	1
let	1
us	1
close	1
the	1
shop...."	1
	1
Several	1
shopkeepers	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
what	1
twaddle!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
thin,	1
stern-looking	1
man.	1
"When	1
one's	1
head	1
is	1
gone	1
one	1
doesn't	1
weep	1
for	1
one's	1
hair!	1
Take	1
what	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
like!"	1
And	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm	1
energetically	1
he	1
turned	1
sideways	1
to	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you,	1
Ivan	1
Sidorych,	1
to	1
talk,"	1
said	1
the	1
first	1
tradesman	1
angrily.	1
"Please	1
step	1
inside,	1
your	1
honor!"	1
	1
"Talk	1
indeed!"	1
cried	1
the	1
thin	1
one.	1
"In	1
my	1
three	1
shops	1
here	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles'	1
worth	1
of	1
goods.	1
Can	1
they	1
be	1
saved	1
when	1
the	1
army	1
has	1
gone?	1
Eh,	1
what	1
people!	1
'Against	1
God's	1
might	1
our	1
hands	1
can't	1
fight.'"	1
	1
"Come	1
inside,	1
your	1
honor!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
tradesman,	1
bowing.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
stood	1
perplexed	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
showed	1
indecision.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
my	1
business!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
strode	1
on	1
quickly	1
down	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
passages.	1
	1
From	1
one	1
open	1
shop	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
blows	1
and	1
vituperation,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
officer	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
gray	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
shaven	1
head	1
was	1
flung	1
out	1
violently.	1
	1
This	1
man,	1
bent	1
double,	1
rushed	1
past	1
the	1
tradesman	1
and	1
the	1
officer.	1
The	1
officer	1
pounced	1
on	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
shops,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
fearful	1
screams	1
reached	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
huge	1
crowd	1
on	1
the	1
Moskva	1
bridge	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
square.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
but	1
his	1
comrade	1
was	1
already	1
galloping	1
off	1
past	1
Vasili	1
the	1
Beatified	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
screams	1
came.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
mounted	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
after	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
bridge	1
he	1
saw	1
two	1
unlimbered	1
guns,	1
the	1
infantry	1
crossing	1
the	1
bridge,	1
several	1
overturned	1
carts,	1
and	1
frightened	1
and	1
laughing	1
faces	1
among	1
the	1
troops.	1
Beside	1
the	1
cannon	1
a	1
cart	1
was	1
standing	1
to	1
which	1
two	1
horses	1
were	1
harnessed.	1
Four	1
borzois	1
with	1
collars	1
were	1
pressing	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
wheels.	1
The	1
cart	1
was	1
loaded	1
high,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
top,	1
beside	1
a	1
child's	1
chair	1
with	1
its	1
legs	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
sat	1
a	1
peasant	1
woman	1
uttering	1
piercing	1
and	1
desperate	1
shrieks.	1
He	1
was	1
told	1
by	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers	1
that	1
the	1
screams	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
the	1
shrieks	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
were	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
General	1
Ermolov,	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
learning	1
that	1
soldiers	1
were	1
dispersing	1
among	1
the	1
shops	1
while	1
crowds	1
of	1
civilians	1
blocked	1
the	1
bridge,	1
had	1
ordered	1
two	1
guns	1
to	1
be	1
unlimbered	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
bridge.	1
The	1
crowd,	1
crushing	1
one	1
another,	1
upsetting	1
carts,	1
and	1
shouting	1
and	1
squeezing	1
desperately,	1
had	1
cleared	1
off	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
now	1
moving	1
forward.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
Meanwhile,	1
the	1
city	1
itself	1
was	1
deserted.	1
There	1
was	1
hardly	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
The	1
gates	1
and	1
shops	1
were	1
all	1
closed,	1
only	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
round	1
the	1
taverns	1
solitary	1
shouts	1
or	1
drunken	1
songs	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Nobody	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
footsteps	1
were	1
rarely	1
heard.	1
The	1
Povarskaya	1
was	1
quite	1
still	1
and	1
deserted.	1
The	1
huge	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
was	1
littered	1
with	1
wisps	1
of	1
hay	1
and	1
with	1
dung	1
from	1
the	1
horses,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
there.	1
In	1
the	1
great	1
drawing	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
with	1
all	1
it	1
contained,	1
were	1
two	1
people.	1
They	1
were	1
the	1
yard	1
porter	1
Ignat,	1
and	1
the	1
page	1
boy	1
Mishka,	1
Vasilich's	1
grandson	1
who	1
had	1
stayed	1
in	1
Moscow	1
with	1
his	1
grandfather.	1
Mishka	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
was	1
strumming	1
on	1
it	1
with	1
one	1
finger.	1
The	1
yard	1
porter,	1
his	1
arms	1
akimbo,	1
stood	1
smiling	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
before	1
the	1
large	1
mirror.	1
	1
"Isn't	1
it	1
fine,	1
eh,	1
Uncle	1
Ignat?"	1
said	1
the	1
boy,	1
suddenly	1
beginning	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
keyboard	1
with	1
both	1
hands.	1
	1
"Only	1
fancy!"	1
answered	1
Ignat,	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
broadening	1
grin	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
mirror.	1
	1
"Impudence!	1
Impudence!"	1
they	1
heard	1
behind	1
them	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
silently.	1
"How	1
he's	1
grinning,	1
the	1
fat	1
mug!	1
Is	1
that	1
what	1
you're	1
here	1
for?	1
Nothing's	1
cleared	1
away	1
down	1
there	1
and	1
Vasilich	1
is	1
worn	1
out.	1
Just	1
you	1
wait	1
a	1
bit!"	1
	1
Ignat	1
left	1
off	1
smiling,	1
adjusted	1
his	1
belt,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
meekly	1
downcast	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Aunt,	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
gently,"	1
said	1
the	1
boy.	1
	1
"I'll	1
give	1
you	1
something	1
gently,	1
you	1
monkey	1
you!"	1
cried	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna,	1
raising	1
her	1
arm	1
threateningly.	1
"Go	1
and	1
get	1
the	1
samovar	1
to	1
boil	1
for	1
your	1
grandfather."	1
	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
flicked	1
the	1
dust	1
off	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
closed	1
it,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
left	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
locked	1
its	1
main	1
door.	1
	1
Going	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
she	1
paused	1
to	1
consider	1
where	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
next-	1
-to	1
drink	1
tea	1
in	1
the	1
servants'	1
wing	1
with	1
Vasilich,	1
or	1
into	1
the	1
storeroom	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
what	1
still	1
lay	1
about.	1
	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
quick	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
quiet	1
street.	1
Someone	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
the	1
latch	1
rattled	1
as	1
someone	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
"Who	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
	1
"The	1
count--Count	1
Ilya	1
Andreevich	1
Rostov."	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
are	1
you?"	1
	1
"An	1
officer,	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
see	1
him,"	1
came	1
the	1
reply	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant,	1
well-bred	1
Russian	1
voice.	1
	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
opened	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
eighteen,	1
with	1
the	1
round	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
Rostov,	1
entered	1
the	1
yard.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
gone	1
away,	1
sir.	1
Went	1
away	1
yesterday	1
at	1
vespertime,"	1
said	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
cordially.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
officer	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
gateway,	1
as	1
if	1
hesitating	1
whether	1
to	1
enter	1
or	1
not,	1
clicked	1
his	1
tongue.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
how	1
annoying!"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
"I	1
should	1
have	1
come	1
yesterday....	1
Ah,	1
what	1
a	1
pity."	1
	1
Meanwhile,	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
was	1
attentively	1
and	1
sympathetically	1
examining	1
the	1
familiar	1
Rostov	1
features	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
face,	1
his	1
tattered	1
coat	1
and	1
trodden-down	1
boots.	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count	1
for?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh	1
well...	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
placed	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
gate	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
leave.	1
	1
He	1
again	1
paused	1
in	1
indecision.	1
	1
"You	1
see,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
said,	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
kinsman	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
me.	1
As	1
you	1
see"	1
(he	1
glanced	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
air	1
and	1
good-natured	1
smile	1
at	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
boots)	1
"my	1
things	1
are	1
worn	1
out	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
money,	1
so	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
count..."	1
	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
finish.	1
	1
"Just	1
wait	1
a	1
minute,	1
sir.	1
One	1
little	1
moment,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
officer	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
handle	1
she	1
turned	1
and,	1
hurrying	1
away	1
on	1
her	1
old	1
legs,	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
back	1
yard	1
to	1
the	1
servants'	1
quarters.	1
	1
While	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
was	1
running	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
the	1
officer	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
yard	1
gazing	1
at	1
his	1
worn-out	1
boots	1
with	1
lowered	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips.	1
"What	1
a	1
pity	1
I've	1
missed	1
Uncle!	1
What	1
a	1
nice	1
old	1
woman!	1
Where	1
has	1
she	1
run	1
off	1
to?	1
And	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
nearest	1
way	1
to	1
overtake	1
my	1
regiment,	1
which	1
must	1
by	1
now	1
be	1
getting	1
near	1
the	1
Rogozhski	1
gate?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
Just	1
then	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
appeared	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
yet	1
resolute	1
look,	1
carrying	1
a	1
rolled-up	1
check	1
kerchief	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
While	1
still	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
from	1
the	1
officer	1
she	1
unfolded	1
the	1
kerchief	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
a	1
white	1
twenty-	1
five-ruble	1
assignat	1
and	1
hastily	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"If	1
his	1
excellency	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
home,	1
as	1
a	1
kinsman	1
he	1
would	1
of	1
course...	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is..."	1
	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
grew	1
abashed	1
and	1
confused.	1
The	1
officer	1
did	1
not	1
decline,	1
but	1
took	1
the	1
note	1
quietly	1
and	1
thanked	1
her.	1
	1
"If	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
home..."	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
went	1
on	1
apologetically.	1
"Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
sir!	1
May	1
God	1
preserve	1
you!"	1
said	1
she,	1
bowing	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
Swaying	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
smiling	1
as	1
if	1
amused	1
at	1
himself,	1
the	1
officer	1
ran	1
almost	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
through	1
the	1
deserted	1
streets	1
toward	1
the	1
Yauza	1
bridge	1
to	1
overtake	1
his	1
regiment.	1
	1
But	1
Mavra	1
Kuzminichna	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
closed	1
gate	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
moist	1
eyes,	1
pensively	1
swaying	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
feeling	1
an	1
unexpected	1
flow	1
of	1
motherly	1
tenderness	1
and	1
pity	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
young	1
officer.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIII	1
	1
From	1
an	1
unfinished	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Varvarka,	1
the	1
ground	1
floor	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
dramshop,	1
came	1
drunken	1
shouts	1
and	1
songs.	1
On	1
benches	1
round	1
the	1
tables	1
in	1
a	1
dirty	1
little	1
room	1
sat	1
some	1
ten	1
factory	1
hands.	1
Tipsy	1
and	1
perspiring,	1
with	1
dim	1
eyes	1
and	1
wide-open	1
mouths,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
laboriously	1
singing	1
some	1
song	1
or	1
other.	1
They	1
were	1
singing	1
discordantly,	1
arduously,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
effort,	1
evidently	1
not	1
because	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
sing,	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
they	1
were	1
drunk	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
spree.	1
One,	1
a	1
tall,	1
fair-	1
haired	1
lad	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
blue	1
coat,	1
was	1
standing	1
over	1
the	1
others.	1
His	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
fine	1
straight	1
nose	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
handsome	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
his	1
thin,	1
compressed,	1
twitching	1
lips	1
and	1
dull,	1
gloomy,	1
fixed	1
eyes.	1
Evidently	1
possessed	1
by	1
some	1
idea,	1
he	1
stood	1
over	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
singing,	1
and	1
solemnly	1
and	1
jerkily	1
flourished	1
above	1
their	1
heads	1
his	1
white	1
arm	1
with	1
the	1
sleeve	1
turned	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
elbow,	1
trying	1
unnaturally	1
to	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
dirty	1
fingers.	1
The	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
kept	1
slipping	1
down	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
carefully	1
rolled	1
it	1
up	1
again	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
most	1
important	1
that	1
the	1
sinewy	1
white	1
arm	1
he	1
was	1
flourishing	1
should	1
be	1
bare.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
song	1
cries	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
fighting	1
and	1
blows	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
porch.	1
The	1
tall	1
lad	1
waved	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Stop	1
it!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
peremptorily.	1
"There's	1
a	1
fight,	1
lads!"	1
And,	1
still	1
rolling	1
up	1
his	1
sleeve,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
The	1
factory	1
hands	1
followed	1
him.	1
These	1
men,	1
who	1
under	1
the	1
leadership	1
of	1
the	1
tall	1
lad	1
were	1
drinking	1
in	1
the	1
dramshop	1
that	1
morning,	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
publican	1
some	1
skins	1
from	1
the	1
factory	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
had	1
had	1
drink	1
served	1
them.	1
The	1
blacksmiths	1
from	1
a	1
neighboring	1
smithy,	1
hearing	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
revelry	1
in	1
the	1
tavern	1
and	1
supposing	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
broken	1
into,	1
wished	1
to	1
force	1
their	1
way	1
in	1
too	1
and	1
a	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
had	1
resulted.	1
	1
The	1
publican	1
was	1
fighting	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
smiths	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
workmen	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
smith,	1
wrenching	1
himself	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
tavern	1
keeper,	1
fell	1
face	1
downward	1
on	1
the	1
pavement.	1
	1
Another	1
smith	1
tried	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
doorway,	1
pressing	1
against	1
the	1
publican	1
with	1
his	1
chest.	1
	1
The	1
lad	1
with	1
the	1
turned-up	1
sleeve	1
gave	1
the	1
smith	1
a	1
blow	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
cried	1
wildly:	1
"They're	1
fighting	1
us,	1
lads!"	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
first	1
smith	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
scratching	1
his	1
bruised	1
face	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
bleed,	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
tearful	1
voice:	1
"Police!	1
Murder!...	1
They've	1
killed	1
a	1
man,	1
lads!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
gracious	1
me,	1
a	1
man	1
beaten	1
to	1
death--killed!..."	1
screamed	1
a	1
woman	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
gate	1
close	1
by.	1
	1
A	1
crowd	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
smith.	1
	1
"Haven't	1
you	1
robbed	1
people	1
enough--taking	1
their	1
last	1
shirts?"	1
said	1
a	1
voice	1
addressing	1
the	1
publican.	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
killed	1
a	1
man	1
for,	1
you	1
thief?"	1
	1
The	1
tall	1
lad,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
porch,	1
turned	1
his	1
bleared	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
publican	1
to	1
the	1
smith	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
whom	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
fight	1
now.	1
	1
"Murderer!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
suddenly	1
to	1
the	1
publican.	1
"Bind	1
him,	1
lads!"	1
	1
"I	1
daresay	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
bind	1
me!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
publican,	1
pushing	1
away	1
the	1
men	1
advancing	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
snatching	1
his	1
cap	1
from	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
flung	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
As	1
if	1
this	1
action	1
had	1
some	1
mysterious	1
and	1
menacing	1
significance,	1
the	1
workmen	1
surrounding	1
the	1
publican	1
paused	1
in	1
indecision.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
the	1
law	1
very	1
well,	1
mates!	1
I'll	1
take	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
police.	1
You	1
think	1
I	1
won't	1
get	1
to	1
him?	1
Robbery	1
is	1
not	1
permitted	1
to	1
anybody	1
now	1
a	1
days!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
publican,	1
picking	1
up	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"Come	1
along	1
then!	1
Come	1
along	1
then!"	1
the	1
publican	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
young	1
fellow	1
repeated	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
they	1
moved	1
up	1
the	1
street	1
together.	1
	1
The	1
bloodstained	1
smith	1
went	1
beside	1
them.	1
The	1
factory	1
hands	1
and	1
others	1
followed	1
behind,	1
talking	1
and	1
shouting.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
Moroseyka,	1
opposite	1
a	1
large	1
house	1
with	1
closed	1
shutters	1
and	1
bearing	1
a	1
bootmaker's	1
signboard,	1
stood	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
thin,	1
worn-out,	1
gloomy-faced	1
bootmakers,	1
wearing	1
overalls	1
and	1
long	1
tattered	1
coats.	1
	1
"He	1
should	1
pay	1
folks	1
off	1
properly,"	1
a	1
thin	1
workingman,	1
with	1
frowning	1
brows	1
and	1
a	1
straggly	1
beard,	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"But	1
he's	1
sucked	1
our	1
blood	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
thinks	1
he's	1
quit	1
of	1
us.	1
He's	1
been	1
misleading	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
week	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
he's	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
this	1
pass	1
he's	1
made	1
off."	1
	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
man	1
the	1
workman	1
ceased	1
speaking,	1
and	1
with	1
eager	1
curiosity	1
all	1
the	1
bootmakers	1
joined	1
the	1
moving	1
crowd.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
folks	1
going?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
to	1
the	1
police,	1
of	1
course!"	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
beaten?"	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
think?	1
Look	1
what	1
folks	1
are	1
saying."	1
	1
Questions	1
and	1
answers	1
were	1
heard.	1
The	1
publican,	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
increased	1
crowd,	1
dropped	1
behind	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
tavern.	1
	1
The	1
tall	1
youth,	1
not	1
noticing	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
his	1
foe,	1
waved	1
his	1
bare	1
arm	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
incessantly,	1
attracting	1
general	1
attention	1
to	1
himself.	1
It	1
was	1
around	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
chiefly	1
crowded,	1
expecting	1
answers	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
occupied	1
all	1
their	1
minds.	1
	1
"He	1
must	1
keep	1
order,	1
keep	1
the	1
law,	1
that's	1
what	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
there	1
for.	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
right,	1
good	1
Christians?"	1
said	1
the	1
tall	1
youth,	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile.	1
"He	1
thinks	1
there's	1
no	1
government!	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
do	1
without	1
government?	1
Or	1
else	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
plenty	1
who'd	1
rob	1
us."	1
	1
"Why	1
talk	1
nonsense?"	1
rejoined	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
"Will	1
they	1
give	1
up	1
Moscow	1
like	1
this?	1
They	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
for	1
fun,	1
and	1
you	1
believed	1
it!	1
Aren't	1
there	1
plenty	1
of	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
march?	1
Let	1
him	1
in,	1
indeed!	1
That's	1
what	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
for.	1
You'd	1
better	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
people	1
are	1
saying,"	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
mob	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
tall	1
youth.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
China-Town	1
a	1
smaller	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
round	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
frieze	1
coat	1
who	1
held	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"An	1
ukase,	1
they	1
are	1
reading	1
an	1
ukase!	1
Reading	1
an	1
ukase!"	1
cried	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
reader.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
coat	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
broadsheet	1
of	1
August	1
31.	1
When	1
the	1
crowd	1
collected	1
round	1
him	1
he	1
seemed	1
confused,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
demand	1
of	1
the	1
tall	1
lad	1
who	1
had	1
pushed	1
his	1
way	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
tremulous	1
voice	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
sheet	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
"Early	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
Serene	1
Highness,"	1
he	1
read	1
("Sirin	1
Highness,"	1
said	1
the	1
tall	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
triumphant	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
a	1
frown	1
on	1
his	1
brow),	1
"to	1
consult	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
act,	1
and	1
to	1
aid	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
exterminate	1
these	1
scoundrels.	1
We	1
too	1
will	1
take	1
part..."	1
the	1
reader	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
then	1
paused	1
("Do	1
you	1
see,"	1
shouted	1
the	1
youth	1
victoriously,	1
"he's	1
going	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
for	1
you...."),	1
"in	1
destroying	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
send	1
these	1
visitors	1
to	1
the	1
devil.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
we'll	1
set	1
to	1
work.	1
We	1
will	1
do,	1
completely	1
do,	1
and	1
undo	1
these	1
scoundrels."	1
	1
The	1
last	1
words	1
were	1
read	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
complete	1
silence.	1
The	1
tall	1
lad	1
hung	1
his	1
head	1
gloomily.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
understood	1
the	1
last	1
part.	1
In	1
particular,	1
the	1
words	1
"I	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
dinner,"	1
evidently	1
displeased	1
both	1
reader	1
and	1
audience.	1
The	1
people's	1
minds	1
were	1
tuned	1
to	1
a	1
high	1
pitch	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
too	1
simple	1
and	1
needlessly	1
comprehensible--it	1
was	1
what	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
what	1
an	1
ukase	1
emanating	1
from	1
the	1
highest	1
authority	1
should	1
not	1
say.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
stood	1
despondent	1
and	1
silent.	1
The	1
tall	1
youth	1
moved	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
swayed	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
	1
"We	1
should	1
ask	1
him...	1
that's	1
he	1
himself?"...	1
"Yes,	1
ask	1
him	1
indeed!...	1
Why	1
not?	1
He'll	1
explain"...	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
saying,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
attention	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
police	1
superintendent's	1
trap	1
which	1
drove	1
into	1
the	1
square	1
attended	1
by	1
two	1
mounted	1
dragoons.	1
	1
The	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
that	1
morning	1
by	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
orders	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
barges	1
and	1
had	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
that	1
matter	1
acquired	1
a	1
large	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
on	1
seeing	1
a	1
crowd	1
bearing	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
told	1
his	1
coachman	1
to	1
stop.	1
	1
"What	1
people	1
are	1
these?"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
men,	1
who	1
were	1
moving	1
singly	1
and	1
timidly	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
trap.	1
	1
"What	1
people	1
are	1
these?"	1
he	1
shouted	1
again,	1
receiving	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor..."	1
replied	1
the	1
shopman	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
coat,	1
"your	1
honor,	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
proclamation	1
of	1
his	1
highest	1
excellency	1
the	1
count,	1
they	1
desire	1
to	1
serve,	1
not	1
sparing	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
riot,	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
highest	1
excellence	1
said..."	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
has	1
not	1
left,	1
he	1
is	1
here,	1
and	1
an	1
order	1
will	1
be	1
issued	1
concerning	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police.	1
"Go	1
on!"	1
he	1
ordered	1
his	1
coachman.	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
halted,	1
pressing	1
around	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
superintendent	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
departing	1
trap.	1
	1
The	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police	1
turned	1
round	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
look,	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
coachman,	1
and	1
his	1
horses	1
increased	1
their	1
speed.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
fraud,	1
lads!	1
Lead	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
him,	1
himself!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
tall	1
youth.	1
"Don't	1
let	1
him	1
go,	1
lads!	1
Let	1
him	1
answer	1
us!	1
Keep	1
him!"	1
shouted	1
different	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
dashed	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
trap.	1
	1
Following	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police	1
and	1
talking	1
loudly	1
the	1
crowd	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Lubyanka	1
Street.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
the	1
gentry	1
and	1
merchants	1
have	1
gone	1
away	1
and	1
left	1
us	1
to	1
perish.	1
Do	1
they	1
think	1
we're	1
dogs?"	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
heard	1
saying	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIV	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
after	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Kutuzov,	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
mortified	1
and	1
offended	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
invited	1
to	1
attend	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
because	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
offer	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
city;	1
amazed	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
novel	1
outlook	1
revealed	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
camp,	1
which	1
treated	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
the	1
capital	1
and	1
its	1
patriotic	1
fervor	1
as	1
not	1
merely	1
secondary	1
but	1
quite	1
irrelevant	1
and	1
unimportant	1
matters.	1
Distressed,	1
offended,	1
and	1
surprised	1
by	1
all	1
this,	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
After	1
supper	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
without	1
undressing,	1
and	1
was	1
awakened	1
soon	1
after	1
midnight	1
by	1
a	1
courier	1
bringing	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Kutuzov.	1
This	1
letter	1
requested	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
send	1
police	1
officers	1
to	1
guide	1
the	1
troops	1
through	1
the	1
town,	1
as	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
retreating	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road	1
beyond	1
Moscow.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
news	1
to	1
Rostopchin.	1
He	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
abandoned	1
not	1
merely	1
since	1
his	1
interview	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
with	1
Kutuzov	1
on	1
the	1
Poklonny	1
Hill	1
but	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
generals	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
after	1
that	1
battle	1
had	1
said	1
unanimously	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
another	1
battle,	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
the	1
government	1
property	1
had	1
been	1
removed	1
every	1
night,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
Rostopchin's	1
own	1
permission.	1
Yet	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
this	1
information	1
astonished	1
and	1
irritated	1
the	1
count,	1
coming	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
simple	1
note	1
with	1
an	1
order	1
from	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
received	1
at	1
night,	1
breaking	1
in	1
on	1
his	1
beauty	1
sleep.	1
	1
When	1
later	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
memoirs	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
explained	1
his	1
actions	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
actuated	1
by	1
two	1
important	1
considerations:	1
to	1
maintain	1
tranquillity	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
expedite	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants.	1
If	1
one	1
accepts	1
this	1
twofold	1
aim	1
all	1
Rostopchin's	1
actions	1
appear	1
irreproachable.	1
"Why	1
were	1
the	1
holy	1
relics,	1
the	1
arms,	1
ammunition,	1
gunpowder,	1
and	1
stores	1
of	1
corn	1
not	1
removed?	1
Why	1
were	1
thousands	1
of	1
inhabitants	1
deceived	1
into	1
believing	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
given	1
up--and	1
thereby	1
ruined?"	1
"To	1
preserve	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
the	1
city,"	1
explains	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
"Why	1
were	1
bundles	1
of	1
useless	1
papers	1
from	1
the	1
government	1
offices,	1
and	1
Leppich's	1
balloon	1
and	1
other	1
articles	1
removed?"	1
"To	1
leave	1
the	1
town	1
empty,"	1
explains	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
One	1
need	1
only	1
admit	1
that	1
public	1
tranquillity	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
and	1
any	1
action	1
finds	1
a	1
justification.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
terror	1
were	1
based	1
only	1
on	1
solicitude	1
for	1
public	1
tranquillity.	1
	1
On	1
what,	1
then,	1
was	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
fear	1
for	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
Moscow	1
based	1
in	1
1812?	1
What	1
reason	1
was	1
there	1
for	1
assuming	1
any	1
probability	1
of	1
an	1
uprising	1
in	1
the	1
city?	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
leaving	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
retreating	1
troops	1
were	1
filling	1
it.	1
Why	1
should	1
that	1
cause	1
the	1
masses	1
to	1
riot?	1
	1
Neither	1
in	1
Moscow	1
nor	1
anywhere	1
in	1
Russia	1
did	1
anything	1
resembling	1
an	1
insurrection	1
ever	1
occur	1
when	1
the	1
enemy	1
entered	1
a	1
town.	1
More	1
than	1
ten	1
thousand	1
people	1
were	1
still	1
in	1
Moscow	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
of	1
September,	1
and	1
except	1
for	1
a	1
mob	1
in	1
the	1
governor's	1
courtyard,	1
assembled	1
there	1
at	1
his	1
bidding,	1
nothing	1
happened.	1
It	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
even	1
less	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
a	1
disturbance	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
if	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
when	1
the	1
surrender	1
of	1
Moscow	1
became	1
certain	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
probable,	1
Rostopchin	1
instead	1
of	1
exciting	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
distributing	1
arms	1
and	1
broadsheets	1
had	1
taken	1
steps	1
to	1
remove	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
relics,	1
the	1
gunpowder,	1
munitions,	1
and	1
money,	1
and	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
population	1
plainly	1
that	1
the	1
town	1
would	1
be	1
abandoned.	1
	1
Rostopchin,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
patriotic	1
sentiments,	1
was	1
a	1
sanguine	1
and	1
impulsive	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
moved	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
administrative	1
circles	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
understanding	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
supposed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
guiding.	1
Ever	1
since	1
the	1
enemy's	1
entry	1
into	1
Smolensk	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
imagination	1
been	1
playing	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
director	1
of	1
the	1
popular	1
feeling	1
of	1
"the	1
heart	1
of	1
Russia."	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
(as	1
to	1
all	1
administrators)	1
that	1
he	1
controlled	1
the	1
external	1
actions	1
of	1
Moscow's	1
inhabitants,	1
but	1
he	1
also	1
thought	1
he	1
controlled	1
their	1
mental	1
attitude	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
his	1
broadsheets	1
and	1
posters,	1
written	1
in	1
a	1
coarse	1
tone	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
despise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
class	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
from	1
those	1
in	1
authority.	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
fine	1
role	1
of	1
leader	1
of	1
popular	1
feeling,	1
and	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
relinquishing	1
that	1
role	1
and	1
abandoning	1
Moscow	1
without	1
any	1
heroic	1
display	1
took	1
him	1
unawares	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
the	1
ground	1
slip	1
away	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
feet,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
positively	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
Though	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
coming,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
wholeheartedly	1
believe	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
abandoned,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
prepare	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
left	1
against	1
his	1
wishes.	1
If	1
the	1
government	1
offices	1
were	1
removed,	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
done	1
on	1
the	1
demand	1
of	1
officials	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
yielded	1
reluctantly.	1
He	1
was	1
absorbed	1
in	1
the	1
role	1
he	1
had	1
created	1
for	1
himself.	1
As	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
those	1
gifted	1
with	1
an	1
ardent	1
imagination,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
known	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
be	1
abandoned	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
only	1
with	1
his	1
intellect,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
adapt	1
himself	1
mentally	1
to	1
this	1
new	1
position	1
of	1
affairs.	1
	1
All	1
his	1
painstaking	1
and	1
energetic	1
activity	1
(in	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
was	1
useful	1
and	1
had	1
any	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
another	1
question)	1
had	1
been	1
simply	1
directed	1
toward	1
arousing	1
in	1
the	1
masses	1
his	1
own	1
feeling	1
of	1
patriotic	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
events	1
assumed	1
their	1
true	1
historical	1
character,	1
when	1
expressing	1
hatred	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
words	1
proved	1
insufficient,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
possible	1
to	1
express	1
that	1
hatred	1
by	1
fighting	1
a	1
battle,	1
when	1
self-	1
confidence	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
avail	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
question	1
before	1
Moscow,	1
when	1
the	1
whole	1
population	1
streamed	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow	1
as	1
one	1
man,	1
abandoning	1
their	1
belongings	1
and	1
proving	1
by	1
that	1
negative	1
action	1
all	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
their	1
national	1
feeling,	1
then	1
the	1
role	1
chosen	1
by	1
Rostopchin	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
senseless.	1
He	1
unexpectedly	1
felt	1
himself	1
ridiculous,	1
weak,	1
and	1
alone,	1
with	1
no	1
ground	1
to	1
stand	1
on.	1
	1
When,	1
awakened	1
from	1
his	1
sleep,	1
he	1
received	1
that	1
cold,	1
peremptory	1
note	1
from	1
Kutuzov,	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
more	1
irritated	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
blame.	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
specially	1
put	1
in	1
charge	1
of,	1
the	1
state	1
property	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
removed,	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it	1
away.	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it?	1
Who	1
has	1
let	1
things	1
come	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pass?"	1
he	1
ruminated.	1
"Not	1
I,	1
of	1
course.	1
I	1
had	1
everything	1
ready.	1
I	1
had	1
Moscow	1
firmly	1
in	1
hand.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
to!	1
Villains!	1
Traitors!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
without	1
clearly	1
defining	1
who	1
the	1
villains	1
and	1
traitors	1
were,	1
but	1
feeling	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
hate	1
those	1
traitors	1
whoever	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
false	1
and	1
ridiculous	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
night	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
issued	1
orders,	1
for	1
which	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
Those	1
about	1
him	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
the	1
count	1
so	1
morose	1
and	1
irritable.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
the	1
Director	1
of	1
the	1
Registrar's	1
Department	1
has	1
sent	1
for	1
instructions...	1
From	1
the	1
Consistory,	1
from	1
the	1
Senate,	1
from	1
the	1
University,	1
from	1
the	1
Foundling	1
Hospital,	1
the	1
Suffragan	1
has	1
sent...	1
asking	1
for	1
information....	1
What	1
are	1
your	1
orders	1
about	1
the	1
Fire	1
Brigade?	1
From	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
prison...	1
from	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
the	1
lunatic	1
asylum..."	1
All	1
night	1
long	1
such	1
announcements	1
were	1
continually	1
being	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
To	1
all	1
these	1
inquiries	1
he	1
gave	1
brief	1
and	1
angry	1
replies	1
indicating	1
that	1
orders	1
from	1
him	1
were	1
not	1
now	1
needed,	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
affair,	1
carefully	1
prepared	1
by	1
him,	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
ruined	1
by	1
somebody,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
somebody	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
might	1
happen.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
tell	1
that	1
blockhead,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
from	1
the	1
Registrar's	1
Department,	1
"that	1
he	1
should	1
remain	1
to	1
guard	1
his	1
documents.	1
Now	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
asking	1
silly	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
Fire	1
Brigade?	1
They	1
have	1
horses,	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
off	1
to	1
Vladimir,	1
and	1
not	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
French."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
the	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
has	1
come:	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
commands?"	1
	1
"My	1
commands?	1
Let	1
them	1
go	1
away,	1
that's	1
all....	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
lunatics	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
town.	1
When	1
lunatics	1
command	1
our	1
armies	1
God	1
evidently	1
means	1
these	1
other	1
madmen	1
to	1
be	1
free."	1
	1
In	1
reply	1
to	1
an	1
inquiry	1
about	1
the	1
convicts	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
shouted	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
governor:	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
two	1
battalions--which	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
got--for	1
a	1
convoy?	1
Release	1
them,	1
that's	1
all	1
about	1
it!"	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
political	1
prisoners,	1
Meshkov,	1
Vereshchagin..."	1
	1
"Vereshchagin!	1
Hasn't	1
he	1
been	1
hanged	1
yet?"	1
shouted	1
Rostopchin.	1
"Bring	1
him	1
to	1
me!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXV	1
	1
Toward	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
already	1
moving	1
through	1
Moscow,	1
nobody	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
instructions.	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
were	1
going	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord,	1
those	1
who	1
remained	1
behind	1
decided	1
for	1
themselves	1
what	1
they	1
must	1
do.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
ordered	1
his	1
carriage	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
drive	1
to	1
Sokolniki,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
with	1
folded	1
hands,	1
morose,	1
sallow,	1
and	1
taciturn.	1
	1
In	1
quiet	1
and	1
untroubled	1
times	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
every	1
administrator	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
by	1
his	1
efforts	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
population	1
under	1
his	1
rule	1
is	1
kept	1
going,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
indispensable	1
every	1
administrator	1
finds	1
the	1
chief	1
reward	1
of	1
his	1
labor	1
and	1
efforts.	1
While	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
history	1
remains	1
calm	1
the	1
ruler-administrator	1
in	1
his	1
frail	1
bark,	1
holding	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
boat	1
hook	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
himself	1
moving,	1
naturally	1
imagines	1
that	1
his	1
efforts	1
move	1
the	1
ship	1
he	1
is	1
holding	1
on	1
to.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
a	1
storm	1
arises	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
begins	1
to	1
heave	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
move,	1
such	1
a	1
delusion	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
possible.	1
The	1
ship	1
moves	1
independently	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
enormous	1
motion,	1
the	1
boat	1
hook	1
no	1
longer	1
reaches	1
the	1
moving	1
vessel,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
the	1
administrator,	1
instead	1
of	1
appearing	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
power,	1
becomes	1
an	1
insignificant,	1
useless,	1
feeble	1
man.	1
	1
Rostopchin	1
felt	1
this,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
which	1
exasperated	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police,	1
whom	1
the	1
crowd	1
had	1
stopped,	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
an	1
adjutant	1
who	1
informed	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
harnessed.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
pale,	1
and	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police,	1
after	1
reporting	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
executed	1
the	1
instructions	1
he	1
had	1
received,	1
informed	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
an	1
immense	1
crowd	1
had	1
collected	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
Without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
Rostopchin	1
rose	1
and	1
walked	1
hastily	1
to	1
his	1
light,	1
luxurious	1
drawing	1
room,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
balcony	1
door,	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
handle,	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
again,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
better	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd.	1
The	1
tall	1
lad	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
front,	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
saying	1
something	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
look.	1
The	1
blood-	1
stained	1
smith	1
stood	1
beside	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
face.	1
A	1
drone	1
of	1
voices	1
was	1
audible	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
window.	1
	1
"Is	1
my	1
carriage	1
ready?"	1
asked	1
Rostopchin,	1
stepping	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
"It	1
is,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
Rostopchin	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
balcony	1
door.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
want?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
police.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
they	1
say	1
they	1
have	1
got	1
ready,	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
orders,	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
they	1
shouted	1
something	1
about	1
treachery.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
turbulent	1
crowd,	1
your	1
excellency--I	1
hardly	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
it.	1
Your	1
excellency,	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
suggest..."	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
go.	1
I	1
don't	1
need	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
to	1
do!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostopchin	1
angrily.	1
	1
He	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
balcony	1
door	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
Russia!	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
me!"	1
thought	1
he,	1
full	1
of	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
fury	1
that	1
welled	1
up	1
within	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
someone	1
to	1
whom	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
might	1
be	1
attributed.	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
with	1
passionate	1
people,	1
he	1
was	1
mastered	1
by	1
anger	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
seeking	1
an	1
object	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
vent	1
it.	1
"Here	1
is	1
that	1
mob,	1
the	1
dregs	1
of	1
the	1
people,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
crowd:	1
"this	1
rabble	1
they	1
have	1
roused	1
by	1
their	1
folly!	1
They	1
want	1
a	1
victim,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
tall	1
lad	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm.	1
And	1
this	1
thought	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
himself	1
desired	1
a	1
victim,	1
something	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
vent	1
his	1
rage.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
carriage	1
ready?"	1
he	1
asked	1
again.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
What	1
are	1
your	1
orders	1
about	1
Vereshchagin?	1
He	1
is	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
porch,"	1
said	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostopchin,	1
as	1
if	1
struck	1
by	1
an	1
unexpected	1
recollection.	1
	1
And	1
rapidly	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
went	1
resolutely	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
balcony.	1
The	1
talking	1
instantly	1
ceased,	1
hats	1
and	1
caps	1
were	1
doffed,	1
and	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"Good	1
morning,	1
lads!"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
briskly	1
and	1
loudly.	1
"Thank	1
you	1
for	1
coming.	1
I'll	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
first	1
settle	1
with	1
the	1
villain.	1
We	1
must	1
punish	1
the	1
villain	1
who	1
has	1
caused	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
Wait	1
for	1
me!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
count	1
stepped	1
as	1
briskly	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
A	1
murmur	1
of	1
approbation	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
crowd.	1
"He'll	1
settle	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
villains,	1
you'll	1
see!	1
And	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
French...	1
He'll	1
show	1
you	1
what	1
law	1
is!"	1
the	1
mob	1
were	1
saying	1
as	1
if	1
reproving	1
one	1
another	1
for	1
their	1
lack	1
of	1
confidence.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
an	1
officer	1
came	1
hurriedly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
gave	1
an	1
order,	1
and	1
the	1
dragoons	1
formed	1
up	1
in	1
line.	1
The	1
crowd	1
moved	1
eagerly	1
from	1
the	1
balcony	1
toward	1
the	1
porch.	1
Rostopchin,	1
coming	1
out	1
there	1
with	1
quick	1
angry	1
steps,	1
looked	1
hastily	1
around	1
as	1
if	1
seeking	1
someone.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
coming	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
between	1
two	1
dragoons.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
thin	1
neck,	1
and	1
his	1
head,	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
half	1
shaved,	1
was	1
again	1
covered	1
by	1
short	1
hair.	1
This	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
threadbare	1
blue	1
cloth	1
coat	1
lined	1
with	1
fox	1
fur,	1
that	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
smart,	1
and	1
dirty	1
hempen	1
convict	1
trousers,	1
over	1
which	1
were	1
pulled	1
his	1
thin,	1
dirty,	1
trodden-down	1
boots.	1
On	1
his	1
thin,	1
weak	1
legs	1
were	1
heavy	1
chains	1
which	1
hampered	1
his	1
irresolute	1
movements.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Rostopchin,	1
hurriedly	1
turning	1
away	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
fur-lined	1
coat	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
step	1
of	1
the	1
porch.	1
"Put	1
him	1
there."	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
clattering	1
chains	1
stepped	1
clumsily	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
indicated,	1
holding	1
away	1
with	1
one	1
finger	1
the	1
coat	1
collar	1
which	1
chafed	1
his	1
neck,	1
turned	1
his	1
long	1
neck	1
twice	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
submissively	1
folded	1
before	1
him	1
his	1
thin	1
hands,	1
unused	1
to	1
work.	1
	1
For	1
several	1
seconds	1
while	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
taking	1
his	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
the	1
silence	1
continued.	1
Only	1
among	1
the	1
back	1
rows	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
pressing	1
toward	1
the	1
one	1
spot,	1
could	1
sighs,	1
groans,	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
feet	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
While	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
Rostopchin	1
stood	1
frowning	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"Lads!"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
metallic	1
ring	1
in	1
his	1
voice.	1
"This	1
man,	1
Vereshchagin,	1
is	1
the	1
scoundrel	1
by	1
whose	1
doing	1
Moscow	1
is	1
perishing."	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
fur-lined	1
coat,	1
stooping	1
a	1
little,	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
submissive	1
attitude,	1
his	1
fingers	1
clasped	1
before	1
him.	1
His	1
emaciated	1
young	1
face,	1
disfigured	1
by	1
the	1
half-shaven	1
head,	1
hung	1
down	1
hopelessly.	1
At	1
the	1
count's	1
first	1
words	1
he	1
raised	1
it	1
slowly	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
eye.	1
But	1
Rostopchin	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
A	1
vein	1
in	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
long	1
thin	1
neck	1
swelled	1
like	1
a	1
cord	1
and	1
went	1
blue	1
behind	1
the	1
ear,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
his	1
face	1
flushed.	1
	1
All	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
him.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
rendered	1
more	1
hopeful	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
he	1
read	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
there,	1
he	1
smiled	1
sadly	1
and	1
timidly,	1
and	1
lowering	1
his	1
head	1
shifted	1
his	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
step.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
betrayed	1
his	1
Tsar	1
and	1
his	1
country,	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
over	1
to	1
Bonaparte.	1
He	1
alone	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
has	1
disgraced	1
the	1
Russian	1
name,	1
he	1
has	1
caused	1
Moscow	1
to	1
perish,"	1
said	1
Rostopchin	1
in	1
a	1
sharp,	1
even	1
voice,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
he	1
glanced	1
down	1
at	1
Vereshchagin	1
who	1
continued	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
submissive	1
attitude.	1
As	1
if	1
inflamed	1
by	1
the	1
sight,	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
addressed	1
the	1
people,	1
almost	1
shouting:	1
	1
"Deal	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
fit!	1
I	1
hand	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
remained	1
silent	1
and	1
only	1
pressed	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
To	1
keep	1
one	1
another	1
back,	1
to	1
breathe	1
in	1
that	1
stifling	1
atmosphere,	1
to	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
stir,	1
and	1
to	1
await	1
something	1
unknown,	1
uncomprehended,	1
and	1
terrible,	1
was	1
becoming	1
unbearable.	1
Those	1
standing	1
in	1
front,	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
before	1
them,	1
all	1
stood	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
and	1
mouths,	1
straining	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
strength,	1
and	1
held	1
back	1
the	1
crowd	1
that	1
was	1
pushing	1
behind	1
them.	1
	1
"Beat	1
him!...	1
Let	1
the	1
traitor	1
perish	1
and	1
not	1
disgrace	1
the	1
Russian	1
name!"	1
shouted	1
Rostopchin.	1
"Cut	1
him	1
down.	1
I	1
command	1
it."	1
	1
Hearing	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
words	1
as	1
the	1
angry	1
tone	1
of	1
Rostopchin's	1
voice,	1
the	1
crowd	1
moaned	1
and	1
heaved	1
forward,	1
but	1
again	1
paused.	1
	1
"Count!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
timid	1
yet	1
theatrical	1
voice	1
of	1
Vereshchagin	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
momentary	1
silence	1
that	1
ensued,	1
"Count!	1
One	1
God	1
is	1
above	1
us	1
both...."	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
thick	1
vein	1
in	1
his	1
thin	1
neck	1
filled	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
the	1
color	1
rapidly	1
came	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
what	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Cut	1
him	1
down!	1
I	1
command	1
it..."	1
shouted	1
Rostopchin,	1
suddenly	1
growing	1
pale	1
like	1
Vereshchagin.	1
	1
"Draw	1
sabers!"	1
cried	1
the	1
dragoon	1
officer,	1
drawing	1
his	1
own.	1
	1
Another	1
still	1
stronger	1
wave	1
flowed	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
reaching	1
the	1
front	1
ranks	1
carried	1
it	1
swaying	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
porch.	1
The	1
tall	1
youth,	1
with	1
a	1
stony	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
rigid	1
and	1
uplifted	1
arm,	1
stood	1
beside	1
Vereshchagin.	1
	1
"Saber	1
him!"	1
the	1
dragoon	1
officer	1
almost	1
whispered.	1
	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
his	1
face	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
distorted	1
with	1
fury,	1
struck	1
Vereshchagin	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
blunt	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
saber.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
cried	1
Vereshchagin	1
in	1
meek	1
surprise,	1
looking	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
glance	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding	1
why	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
to	1
him.	1
A	1
similar	1
moan	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
horror	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
crowd.	1
"O	1
Lord!"	1
exclaimed	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
voice.	1
	1
But	1
after	1
the	1
exclamation	1
of	1
surprise	1
that	1
had	1
escaped	1
from	1
Vereshchagin	1
he	1
uttered	1
a	1
plaintive	1
cry	1
of	1
pain,	1
and	1
that	1
cry	1
was	1
fatal.	1
The	1
barrier	1
of	1
human	1
feeling,	1
strained	1
to	1
the	1
utmost,	1
that	1
had	1
held	1
the	1
crowd	1
in	1
check	1
suddenly	1
broke.	1
The	1
crime	1
had	1
begun	1
and	1
must	1
now	1
be	1
completed.	1
The	1
plaintive	1
moan	1
of	1
reproach	1
was	1
drowned	1
by	1
the	1
threatening	1
and	1
angry	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
Like	1
the	1
seventh	1
and	1
last	1
wave	1
that	1
shatters	1
a	1
ship,	1
that	1
last	1
irresistible	1
wave	1
burst	1
from	1
the	1
rear	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
front	1
ranks,	1
carrying	1
them	1
off	1
their	1
feet	1
and	1
engulfing	1
them	1
all.	1
The	1
dragoon	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
repeat	1
his	1
blow.	1
Vereshchagin	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
horror,	1
covering	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
crowd.	1
The	1
tall	1
youth,	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
stumbled,	1
seized	1
his	1
thin	1
neck	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
and,	1
yelling	1
wildly,	1
fell	1
with	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
pressing,	1
struggling	1
crowd.	1
	1
Some	1
beat	1
and	1
tore	1
at	1
Vereshchagin,	1
others	1
at	1
the	1
tall	1
youth.	1
And	1
the	1
screams	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
trampled	1
on	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
rescue	1
the	1
tall	1
lad	1
only	1
increased	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
crowd.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
the	1
dragoons	1
could	1
extricate	1
the	1
bleeding	1
youth,	1
beaten	1
almost	1
to	1
death.	1
And	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
despite	1
the	1
feverish	1
haste	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
mob	1
tried	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
begun,	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
hitting,	1
throttling,	1
and	1
tearing	1
at	1
Vereshchagin	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
for	1
the	1
crowd	1
pressed	1
from	1
all	1
sides,	1
swaying	1
as	1
one	1
mass	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
and	1
rendering	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
either	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
or	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
"Hit	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
ax,	1
eh!...	1
Crushed?...	1
Traitor,	1
he	1
sold	1
Christ....	1
Still	1
alive...	1
tenacious...	1
serves	1
him	1
right!	1
Torture	1
serves	1
a	1
thief	1
right.	1
Use	1
the	1
hatchet!...	1
What--still	1
alive?"	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
the	1
victim	1
ceased	1
to	1
struggle	1
and	1
his	1
cries	1
changed	1
to	1
a	1
long-	1
drawn,	1
measured	1
death	1
rattle	1
did	1
the	1
crowd	1
around	1
his	1
prostrate,	1
bleeding	1
corpse	1
begin	1
rapidly	1
to	1
change	1
places.	1
Each	1
one	1
came	1
up,	1
glanced	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
and	1
with	1
horror,	1
reproach,	1
and	1
astonishment	1
pushed	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord!	1
The	1
people	1
are	1
like	1
wild	1
beasts!	1
How	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
alive?"	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
saying.	1
"Quite	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
too...	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
merchant's	1
son.	1
What	1
men!...	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
he's	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
one....	1
How	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
one?...	1
O	1
Lord!	1
And	1
there's	1
another	1
has	1
been	1
beaten	1
too--they	1
say	1
he's	1
nearly	1
done	1
for....	1
Oh,	1
the	1
people...	1
Aren't	1
they	1
afraid	1
of	1
sinning?..."	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
mob	1
now,	1
looking	1
with	1
pained	1
distress	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
with	1
its	1
long,	1
thin,	1
half-severed	1
neck	1
and	1
its	1
livid	1
face	1
stained	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
dust.	1
	1
A	1
painstaking	1
police	1
officer,	1
considering	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
corpse	1
in	1
his	1
excellency's	1
courtyard	1
unseemly,	1
told	1
the	1
dragoons	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away.	1
Two	1
dragoons	1
took	1
it	1
by	1
its	1
distorted	1
legs	1
and	1
dragged	1
it	1
along	1
the	1
ground.	1
The	1
gory,	1
dust-stained,	1
half-shaven	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
neck	1
trailed	1
twisting	1
along	1
the	1
ground.	1
The	1
crowd	1
shrank	1
back	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Vereshchagin	1
fell	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
closed	1
in	1
with	1
savage	1
yells	1
and	1
swayed	1
about	1
him,	1
Rostopchin	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
pale	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
entrance	1
where	1
his	1
carriage	1
awaited	1
him,	1
went	1
with	1
hurried	1
steps	1
and	1
bent	1
head,	1
not	1
knowing	1
where	1
and	1
why,	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
rooms	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor.	1
The	1
count's	1
face	1
was	1
white	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
the	1
feverish	1
twitching	1
of	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw.	1
	1
"This	1
way,	1
your	1
excellency...	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?...	1
This	1
way,	1
please..."	1
said	1
a	1
trembling,	1
frightened	1
voice	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
reply	1
and,	1
turning	1
obediently,	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
indicated.	1
At	1
the	1
back	1
entrance	1
stood	1
his	1
caleche.	1
The	1
distant	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
yelling	1
crowd	1
was	1
audible	1
even	1
there.	1
He	1
hastily	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
drive	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
house	1
in	1
Sokolniki.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
Myasnitski	1
Street	1
and	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
hear	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
mob,	1
the	1
count	1
began	1
to	1
repent.	1
He	1
remembered	1
with	1
dissatisfaction	1
the	1
agitation	1
and	1
fear	1
he	1
had	1
betrayed	1
before	1
his	1
subordinates.	1
"The	1
mob	1
is	1
terrible--disgusting,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
French.	1
"They	1
are	1
like	1
wolves	1
whom	1
nothing	1
but	1
flesh	1
can	1
appease."	1
"Count!	1
One	1
God	1
is	1
above	1
us	1
both!"--Vereshchagin's	1
words	1
suddenly	1
recurred	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
shiver	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
back.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
momentary	1
feeling	1
and	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
smiled	1
disdainfully	1
at	1
himself.	1
"I	1
had	1
other	1
duties,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"The	1
people	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
appeased.	1
Many	1
other	1
victims	1
have	1
perished	1
and	1
are	1
perishing	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good"--and	1
he	1
began	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
social	1
duties	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
himself--not	1
himself	1
as	1
Theodore	1
Vasilyevich	1
Rostopchin	1
(he	1
fancied	1
that	1
Theodore	1
Vasilyevich	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
sacrificing	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good)	1
but	1
himself	1
as	1
governor,	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
authority	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar.	1
"Had	1
I	1
been	1
simply	1
Theodore	1
Vasilyevich	1
my	1
course	1
of	1
action	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
quite	1
different,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
safeguard	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
dignity	1
as	1
commander-in-chief."	1
	1
Lightly	1
swaying	1
on	1
the	1
flexible	1
springs	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
hearing	1
the	1
terrible	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
crowd,	1
Rostopchin	1
grew	1
physically	1
calm	1
and,	1
as	1
always	1
happens,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
became	1
physically	1
tranquil	1
his	1
mind	1
devised	1
reasons	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
mentally	1
tranquil	1
too.	1
The	1
thought	1
which	1
tranquillized	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
new	1
one.	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
and	1
men	1
have	1
killed	1
one	1
another	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
ever	1
committed	1
such	1
a	1
crime	1
against	1
his	1
fellow	1
man	1
without	1
comforting	1
himself	1
with	1
this	1
same	1
idea.	1
This	1
idea	1
is	1
le	1
bien	1
public,	1
the	1
hypothetical	1
welfare	1
of	1
other	1
people.	1
	1
To	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
swayed	1
by	1
passion	1
that	1
welfare	1
is	1
never	1
certain,	1
but	1
he	1
who	1
commits	1
such	1
a	1
crime	1
always	1
knows	1
just	1
where	1
that	1
welfare	1
lies.	1
And	1
Rostopchin	1
now	1
knew	1
it.	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
his	1
reason	1
not	1
reproach	1
him	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done,	1
but	1
he	1
even	1
found	1
cause	1
for	1
self-satisfaction	1
in	1
having	1
so	1
successfully	1
contrived	1
to	1
avail	1
himself	1
of	1
a	1
convenient	1
opportunity	1
to	1
punish	1
a	1
criminal	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
pacify	1
the	1
mob.	1
	1
"Vereshchagin	1
was	1
tried	1
and	1
condemned	1
to	1
death,"	1
thought	1
Rostopchin	1
(though	1
the	1
Senate	1
had	1
only	1
condemned	1
Vereshchagin	1
to	1
hard	1
labor),	1
"he	1
was	1
a	1
traitor	1
and	1
a	1
spy.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
unpunished	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
killed	1
two	1
birds	1
with	1
one	1
stone:	1
to	1
appease	1
the	1
mob	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
victim	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
punished	1
a	1
miscreant."	1
	1
Having	1
reached	1
his	1
country	1
house	1
and	1
begun	1
to	1
give	1
orders	1
about	1
domestic	1
arrangements,	1
the	1
count	1
grew	1
quite	1
tranquil.	1
	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
he	1
was	1
driving	1
with	1
his	1
fast	1
horses	1
across	1
the	1
Sokolniki	1
field,	1
no	1
longer	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
but	1
considering	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
come.	1
He	1
was	1
driving	1
to	1
the	1
Yauza	1
bridge	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was.	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
mentally	1
preparing	1
the	1
angry	1
and	1
stinging	1
reproaches	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
address	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
for	1
his	1
deception.	1
He	1
would	1
make	1
that	1
foxy	1
old	1
courtier	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
calamities	1
that	1
would	1
follow	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
Russia	1
(as	1
Rostopchin	1
regarded	1
it)	1
would	1
fall	1
upon	1
his	1
doting	1
old	1
head.	1
Planning	1
beforehand	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
Rostopchin	1
turned	1
angrily	1
in	1
his	1
caleche	1
and	1
gazed	1
sternly	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
	1
The	1
Sokolniki	1
field	1
was	1
deserted.	1
Only	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
almshouse	1
and	1
the	1
lunatic	1
asylum,	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
some	1
people	1
in	1
white	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
them	1
walking	1
singly	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
shouting	1
and	1
gesticulating.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
running	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
Count	1
Rostopchin's	1
carriage,	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
himself,	1
his	1
coachman,	1
and	1
his	1
dragoons	1
looked	1
with	1
vague	1
horror	1
and	1
curiosity	1
at	1
these	1
released	1
lunatics	1
and	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
one	1
running	1
toward	1
them.	1
	1
Swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
on	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
legs	1
in	1
his	1
fluttering	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
this	1
lunatic	1
was	1
running	1
impetuously,	1
his	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
on	1
Rostopchin,	1
shouting	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
and	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
stop.	1
The	1
lunatic's	1
solemn,	1
gloomy	1
face	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
yellow,	1
with	1
its	1
beard	1
growing	1
in	1
uneven	1
tufts.	1
His	1
black,	1
agate	1
pupils	1
with	1
saffron-	1
yellow	1
whites	1
moved	1
restlessly	1
near	1
the	1
lower	1
eyelids.	1
	1
"Stop!	1
Pull	1
up,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!"	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
piercing	1
voice,	1
and	1
again	1
shouted	1
something	1
breathlessly	1
with	1
emphatic	1
intonations	1
and	1
gestures.	1
	1
Coming	1
abreast	1
of	1
the	1
caleche	1
he	1
ran	1
beside	1
it.	1
	1
"Thrice	1
have	1
they	1
slain	1
me,	1
thrice	1
have	1
I	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
They	1
stoned	1
me,	1
crucified	1
me...	1
I	1
shall	1
rise...	1
shall	1
rise...	1
shall	1
rise.	1
They	1
have	1
torn	1
my	1
body.	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
will	1
be	1
overthrown...	1
Thrice	1
will	1
I	1
overthrow	1
it	1
and	1
thrice	1
re-establish	1
it!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
higher	1
and	1
higher.	1
	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
suddenly	1
grew	1
pale	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
the	1
crowd	1
closed	1
in	1
on	1
Vereshchagin.	1
He	1
turned	1
away.	1
"Go	1
fas...	1
faster!"	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
to	1
his	1
coachman.	1
The	1
caleche	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
horses	1
could	1
draw	1
it,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
still	1
heard	1
the	1
insane	1
despairing	1
screams	1
growing	1
fainter	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
astonished,	1
frightened,	1
bloodstained	1
face	1
of	1
"the	1
traitor"	1
in	1
the	1
fur-lined	1
coat.	1
	1
Recent	1
as	1
that	1
mental	1
picture	1
was,	1
Rostopchin	1
already	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
cut	1
deep	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
drawn	1
blood.	1
Even	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
clearly	1
that	1
the	1
gory	1
trace	1
of	1
that	1
recollection	1
would	1
not	1
pass	1
with	1
time,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
terrible	1
memory	1
would,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
dwell	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
ever	1
more	1
cruelly	1
and	1
painfully	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
seemed	1
still	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
words:	1
"Cut	1
him	1
down!	1
I	1
command	1
it...."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
I	1
utter	1
those	1
words?	1
It	1
was	1
by	1
some	1
accident	1
I	1
said	1
them....	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
them,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"And	1
then	1
nothing	1
would	1
have	1
happened."	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
frightened	1
and	1
then	1
infuriated	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
dragoon	1
who	1
dealt	1
the	1
blow,	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
silent,	1
timid	1
reproach	1
that	1
boy	1
in	1
the	1
fur-lined	1
coat	1
had	1
turned	1
upon	1
him.	1
"But	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sake.	1
I	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
act	1
that	1
way....	1
The	1
mob,	1
the	1
traitor...	1
the	1
public	1
welfare,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
Troops	1
were	1
still	1
crowding	1
at	1
the	1
Yauza	1
bridge.	1
It	1
was	1
hot.	1
Kutuzov,	1
dejected	1
and	1
frowning,	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
by	1
the	1
bridge	1
toying	1
with	1
his	1
whip	1
in	1
the	1
sand	1
when	1
a	1
caleche	1
dashed	1
up	1
noisily.	1
A	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
general's	1
uniform	1
with	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
French.	1
It	1
was	1
Count	1
Rostopchin.	1
He	1
told	1
Kutuzov	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
because	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
capital,	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
army	1
remained.	1
	1
"Things	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
if	1
your	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
abandon	1
Moscow	1
without	1
another	1
battle;	1
all	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
happened,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
at	1
Rostopchin	1
as	1
if,	1
not	1
grasping	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
read	1
something	1
peculiar	1
written	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
addressing	1
him.	1
Rostopchin	1
grew	1
confused	1
and	1
became	1
silent.	1
Kutuzov	1
slightly	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
penetrating	1
gaze	1
from	1
Rostopchin's	1
face	1
muttered	1
softly:	1
	1
"No!	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle!"	1
	1
Whether	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
something	1
entirely	1
different	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
those	1
words,	1
or	1
uttered	1
them	1
purposely,	1
knowing	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
meaningless,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
Rostopchin	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
hastily	1
left	1
him.	1
And	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
Governor	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
proud	1
Count	1
Rostopchin,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
Cossack	1
whip	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
where	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
shouts	1
to	1
drive	1
on	1
the	1
carts	1
that	1
blocked	1
the	1
way.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVI	1
	1
Toward	1
four	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
Murat's	1
troops	1
were	1
entering	1
Moscow.	1
In	1
front	1
rode	1
a	1
detachment	1
of	1
Wurttemberg	1
hussars	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
rode	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Naples	1
himself	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
numerous	1
suite.	1
	1
About	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
Arbat	1
Street,	1
near	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
the	1
Miraculous	1
Icon	1
of	1
St.	1
Nicholas,	1
Murat	1
halted	1
to	1
await	1
news	1
from	1
the	1
advanced	1
detachment	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
citadel,	1
le	1
Kremlin.	1
	1
Around	1
Murat	1
gathered	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
They	1
all	1
stared	1
in	1
timid	1
bewilderment	1
at	1
the	1
strange,	1
long-haired	1
commander	1
dressed	1
up	1
in	1
feathers	1
and	1
gold.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
their	1
Tsar	1
himself?	1
He's	1
not	1
bad!"	1
low	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
saying.	1
	1
An	1
interpreter	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
group.	1
	1
"Take	1
off	1
your	1
cap...	1
your	1
caps!"	1
These	1
words	1
went	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
The	1
interpreter	1
addressed	1
an	1
old	1
porter	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
to	1
the	1
Kremlin.	1
The	1
porter,	1
listening	1
in	1
perplexity	1
to	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
Polish	1
accent	1
and	1
not	1
realizing	1
that	1
the	1
interpreter	1
was	1
speaking	1
Russian,	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
slipped	1
behind	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
Murat	1
approached	1
the	1
interpreter	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
where	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
asked	1
and	1
several	1
voices	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
answering	1
the	1
interpreter.	1
A	1
French	1
officer,	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
advanced	1
detachment,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Murat	1
and	1
reported	1
that	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
citadel	1
had	1
been	1
barricaded	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
probably	1
an	1
ambuscade	1
there.	1
	1
"Good!"	1
said	1
Murat	1
and,	1
turning	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
his	1
suite,	1
ordered	1
four	1
light	1
guns	1
to	1
be	1
moved	1
forward	1
to	1
fire	1
at	1
the	1
gates.	1
	1
The	1
guns	1
emerged	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
from	1
the	1
column	1
following	1
Murat	1
and	1
advanced	1
up	1
the	1
Arbat.	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka	1
Street	1
they	1
halted	1
and	1
drew	1
in	1
the	1
Square.	1
Several	1
French	1
officers	1
superintended	1
the	1
placing	1
of	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
through	1
field	1
glasses.	1
	1
The	1
bells	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
were	1
ringing	1
for	1
vespers,	1
and	1
this	1
sound	1
troubled	1
the	1
French.	1
They	1
imagined	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
call	1
to	1
arms.	1
A	1
few	1
infantrymen	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
Kutafyev	1
Gate.	1
Beams	1
and	1
wooden	1
screens	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
there,	1
and	1
two	1
musket	1
shots	1
rang	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
gate	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
toward	1
it.	1
A	1
general	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
guns	1
shouted	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
command	1
to	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
ran	1
back	1
again	1
with	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
three	1
more	1
shots	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
One	1
shot	1
struck	1
a	1
French	1
soldier's	1
foot,	1
and	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
screens	1
came	1
the	1
strange	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
voices	1
shouting.	1
Instantly	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
cheerful	1
serenity	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
general,	1
officers,	1
and	1
men	1
changed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
determined	1
concentrated	1
readiness	1
for	1
strife	1
and	1
suffering.	1
To	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
marshal	1
to	1
the	1
least	1
soldier,	1
that	1
place	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka,	1
Mokhavaya,	1
or	1
Kutafyev	1
Street,	1
nor	1
the	1
Troitsa	1
Gate	1
(places	1
familiar	1
in	1
Moscow),	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
battlefield	1
which	1
would	1
probably	1
prove	1
sanguinary.	1
And	1
all	1
made	1
ready	1
for	1
that	1
battle.	1
The	1
cries	1
from	1
the	1
gates	1
ceased.	1
The	1
guns	1
were	1
advanced,	1
the	1
artillerymen	1
blew	1
the	1
ash	1
off	1
their	1
linstocks,	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
gave	1
the	1
word	1
"Fire!"	1
This	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
two	1
whistling	1
sounds	1
of	1
canister	1
shot,	1
one	1
after	1
another.	1
The	1
shot	1
rattled	1
against	1
the	1
stone	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
wooden	1
beams	1
and	1
screens,	1
and	1
two	1
wavering	1
clouds	1
of	1
smoke	1
rose	1
over	1
the	1
Square.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
instants	1
after	1
the	1
echo	1
of	1
the	1
reports	1
resounding	1
over	1
the	1
stone-	1
built	1
Kremlin	1
had	1
died	1
away	1
the	1
French	1
heard	1
a	1
strange	1
sound	1
above	1
their	1
head.	1
Thousands	1
of	1
crows	1
rose	1
above	1
the	1
walls	1
and	1
circled	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
cawing	1
and	1
noisily	1
flapping	1
their	1
wings.	1
Together	1
with	1
that	1
sound	1
came	1
a	1
solitary	1
human	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
gateway	1
and	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
appeared	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
bareheaded	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
peasant's	1
coat.	1
He	1
grasped	1
a	1
musket	1
and	1
took	1
aim	1
at	1
the	1
French.	1
"Fire!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
officer	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
a	1
musket	1
and	1
of	1
two	1
cannon	1
shots	1
were	1
heard	1
simultaneously.	1
The	1
gate	1
was	1
again	1
hidden	1
by	1
smoke.	1
	1
Nothing	1
more	1
stirred	1
behind	1
the	1
screens	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
infantry	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
advanced	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
In	1
the	1
gateway	1
lay	1
three	1
wounded	1
and	1
four	1
dead.	1
Two	1
men	1
in	1
peasant	1
coats	1
ran	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
toward	1
the	1
Znamenka.	1
	1
"Clear	1
that	1
away!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
beams	1
and	1
the	1
corpses,	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
after	1
dispatching	1
the	1
wounded,	1
threw	1
the	1
corpses	1
over	1
the	1
parapet.	1
	1
Who	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
nobody	1
knew.	1
"Clear	1
that	1
away!"	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
thrown	1
over	1
the	1
parapet	1
and	1
removed	1
later	1
on	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
stink.	1
Thiers	1
alone	1
dedicates	1
a	1
few	1
eloquent	1
lines	1
to	1
their	1
memory:	1
"These	1
wretches	1
had	1
occupied	1
the	1
sacred	1
citadel,	1
having	1
supplied	1
themselves	1
with	1
guns	1
from	1
the	1
arsenal,	1
and	1
fired"	1
(the	1
wretches)	1
"at	1
the	1
French.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
sabered	1
and	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
was	1
purged	1
of	1
their	1
presence."	1
	1
Murat	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
had	1
been	1
cleared.	1
The	1
French	1
entered	1
the	1
gates	1
and	1
began	1
pitching	1
their	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
Senate	1
Square.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
House	1
the	1
soldiers	1
threw	1
chairs	1
into	1
the	1
Square	1
for	1
fuel	1
and	1
kindled	1
fires	1
there.	1
	1
Other	1
detachments	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
and	1
encamped	1
along	1
the	1
Moroseyka,	1
the	1
Lubyanka,	1
and	1
Pokrovka	1
Streets.	1
Others	1
quartered	1
themselves	1
along	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka,	1
the	1
Nikolski,	1
and	1
the	1
Tverskoy	1
Streets.	1
No	1
masters	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
being	1
found	1
anywhere,	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
not	1
billeted	1
on	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
towns	1
but	1
lived	1
in	1
it	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
camp.	1
	1
Though	1
tattered,	1
hungry,	1
worn	1
out,	1
and	1
reduced	1
to	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
their	1
original	1
number,	1
the	1
French	1
entered	1
Moscow	1
in	1
good	1
marching	1
order.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
weary	1
and	1
famished,	1
but	1
still	1
a	1
fighting	1
and	1
menacing	1
army.	1
But	1
it	1
remained	1
an	1
army	1
only	1
until	1
its	1
soldiers	1
had	1
dispersed	1
into	1
their	1
different	1
lodgings.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
regiments	1
began	1
to	1
disperse	1
among	1
the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
deserted	1
houses,	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
lost	1
forever	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
being	1
something	1
nondescript,	1
neither	1
citizens	1
nor	1
soldiers	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
known	1
as	1
marauders.	1
When	1
five	1
weeks	1
later	1
these	1
same	1
men	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
they	1
no	1
longer	1
formed	1
an	1
army.	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
mob	1
of	1
marauders,	1
each	1
carrying	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
articles	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
valuable	1
or	1
useful.	1
The	1
aim	1
of	1
each	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
Moscow	1
was	1
no	1
longer,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been,	1
to	1
conquer,	1
but	1
merely	1
to	1
keep	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
acquired.	1
Like	1
a	1
monkey	1
which	1
puts	1
its	1
paw	1
into	1
the	1
narrow	1
neck	1
of	1
a	1
jug,	1
and	1
having	1
seized	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
nuts	1
will	1
not	1
open	1
its	1
fist	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
losing	1
what	1
it	1
holds,	1
and	1
therefore	1
perishes,	1
the	1
French	1
when	1
they	1
left	1
Moscow	1
had	1
inevitably	1
to	1
perish	1
because	1
they	1
carried	1
their	1
loot	1
with	1
them,	1
yet	1
to	1
abandon	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
stolen	1
was	1
as	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
monkey	1
to	1
open	1
its	1
paw	1
and	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
its	1
nuts.	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
after	1
each	1
regiment	1
had	1
entered	1
a	1
Moscow	1
district,	1
not	1
a	1
soldier	1
or	1
officer	1
was	1
left.	1
Men	1
in	1
military	1
uniforms	1
and	1
Hessian	1
boots	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
the	1
windows,	1
laughing	1
and	1
walking	1
through	1
the	1
rooms.	1
In	1
cellars	1
and	1
storerooms	1
similar	1
men	1
were	1
busy	1
among	1
the	1
provisions,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
yards	1
unlocking	1
or	1
breaking	1
open	1
coach	1
house	1
and	1
stable	1
doors,	1
lighting	1
fires	1
in	1
kitchens	1
and	1
kneading	1
and	1
baking	1
bread	1
with	1
rolled-up	1
sleeves,	1
and	1
cooking;	1
or	1
frightening,	1
amusing,	1
or	1
caressing	1
women	1
and	1
children.	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
such	1
men	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
shops	1
and	1
houses--but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
army.	1
	1
Order	1
after	1
order	1
was	1
issued	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
commanders	1
that	1
day	1
forbidding	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
disperse	1
about	1
the	1
town,	1
sternly	1
forbidding	1
any	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
or	1
any	1
looting,	1
and	1
announcing	1
a	1
roll	1
call	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
evening.	1
But	1
despite	1
all	1
these	1
measures	1
the	1
men,	1
who	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
constituted	1
an	1
army,	1
flowed	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
wealthy,	1
deserted	1
city	1
with	1
its	1
comforts	1
and	1
plentiful	1
supplies.	1
As	1
a	1
hungry	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
keeps	1
well	1
together	1
when	1
crossing	1
a	1
barren	1
field,	1
but	1
gets	1
out	1
of	1
hand	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
disperses	1
uncontrollably	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
reaches	1
rich	1
pastures,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
army	1
disperse	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
wealthy	1
city.	1
	1
No	1
residents	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers--like	1
water	1
percolating	1
through	1
sand--spread	1
irresistibly	1
through	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
from	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
first	1
marched.	1
The	1
cavalry,	1
on	1
entering	1
a	1
merchant's	1
house	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
and	1
finding	1
there	1
stabling	1
more	1
than	1
sufficient	1
for	1
their	1
horses,	1
went	1
on,	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
house	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
better.	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
appropriated	1
several	1
houses,	1
chalked	1
their	1
names	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
quarreled	1
and	1
even	1
fought	1
with	1
other	1
companies	1
for	1
them.	1
Before	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
secure	1
quarters	1
the	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
city	1
and,	1
hearing	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned,	1
rushed	1
to	1
places	1
where	1
valuables	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
taking.	1
The	1
officers	1
followed	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
were	1
involuntarily	1
drawn	1
into	1
doing	1
the	1
same.	1
In	1
Carriage	1
Row	1
carriages	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
shops,	1
and	1
generals	1
flocked	1
there	1
to	1
select	1
caleches	1
and	1
coaches	1
for	1
themselves.	1
The	1
few	1
inhabitants	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
invited	1
commanding	1
officers	1
to	1
their	1
houses,	1
hoping	1
thereby	1
to	1
secure	1
themselves	1
from	1
being	1
plundered.	1
There	1
were	1
masses	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
it.	1
All	1
around	1
the	1
quarters	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
other	1
regions	1
still	1
unexplored	1
and	1
unoccupied	1
where,	1
they	1
thought,	1
yet	1
greater	1
riches	1
might	1
be	1
found.	1
And	1
Moscow	1
engulfed	1
the	1
army	1
ever	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper.	1
When	1
water	1
is	1
spilled	1
on	1
dry	1
ground	1
both	1
the	1
dry	1
ground	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
disappear	1
and	1
mud	1
results;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
famished	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
rich	1
and	1
deserted	1
city	1
resulted	1
in	1
fires	1
and	1
looting	1
and	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
wealthy	1
city.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
attributed	1
the	1
Fire	1
of	1
Moscow	1
au	1
patriotisme	1
feroce	1
de	1
Rostopchine,	1
*	1
the	1
Russians	1
to	1
the	1
barbarity	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
In	1
reality,	1
however,	1
it	1
was	1
not,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be,	1
possible	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
by	1
making	1
any	1
individual,	1
or	1
any	1
group	1
of	1
people,	1
responsible	1
for	1
it.	1
Moscow	1
was	1
burned	1
because	1
it	1
found	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
any	1
town	1
built	1
of	1
wood	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
burn,	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
whether	1
it	1
had,	1
or	1
had	1
not,	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
inferior	1
fire	1
engines.	1
Deserted	1
Moscow	1
had	1
to	1
burn	1
as	1
inevitably	1
as	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
shavings	1
has	1
to	1
burn	1
on	1
which	1
sparks	1
continually	1
fall	1
for	1
several	1
days.	1
A	1
town	1
built	1
of	1
wood,	1
where	1
scarcely	1
a	1
day	1
passes	1
without	1
conflagrations	1
when	1
the	1
house	1
owners	1
are	1
in	1
residence	1
and	1
a	1
police	1
force	1
is	1
present,	1
cannot	1
help	1
burning	1
when	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
have	1
left	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
occupied	1
by	1
soldiers	1
who	1
smoke	1
pipes,	1
make	1
campfires	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
chairs	1
in	1
the	1
Senate	1
Square,	1
and	1
cook	1
themselves	1
meals	1
twice	1
a	1
day.	1
In	1
peacetime	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
billet	1
troops	1
in	1
the	1
villages	1
of	1
any	1
district	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
fires	1
in	1
that	1
district	1
immediately	1
increases.	1
How	1
much	1
then	1
must	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
fire	1
be	1
increased	1
in	1
an	1
abandoned,	1
wooden	1
town	1
where	1
foreign	1
troops	1
are	1
quartered.	1
"Le	1
patriotisme	1
feroce	1
de	1
Rostopchine"	1
and	1
the	1
barbarity	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
Moscow	1
was	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
pipes,	1
kitchens,	1
and	1
campfires,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
carelessness	1
of	1
enemy	1
soldiers	1
occupying	1
houses	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
own.	1
Even	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
arson	1
(which	1
is	1
very	1
doubtful,	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
houses--in	1
any	1
case	1
a	1
troublesome	1
and	1
dangerous	1
thing	1
to	1
do),	1
arson	1
cannot	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
cause,	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
without	1
any	1
incendiarism.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
Rostopchin's	1
ferocious	1
patriotism.	1
	1
However	1
tempting	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
blame	1
Rostopchin's	1
ferocity	1
and	1
for	1
Russians	1
to	1
blame	1
the	1
scoundrel	1
Bonaparte,	1
or	1
later	1
on	1
to	1
place	1
an	1
heroic	1
torch	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
people,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
such	1
direct	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
for	1
Moscow	1
had	1
to	1
burn	1
as	1
every	1
village,	1
factory,	1
or	1
house	1
must	1
burn	1
which	1
is	1
left	1
by	1
its	1
owners	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
strangers	1
are	1
allowed	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
cook	1
their	1
porridge.	1
Moscow	1
was	1
burned	1
by	1
its	1
inhabitants,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
but	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
abandoned	1
it	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
remained	1
in	1
it.	1
Moscow	1
when	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
did	1
not	1
remain	1
intact	1
like	1
Berlin,	1
Vienna,	1
and	1
other	1
towns,	1
simply	1
because	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
abandoned	1
it	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
welcome	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
salt,	1
nor	1
bring	1
them	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVII	1
	1
The	1
absorption	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
by	1
Moscow,	1
radiating	1
starwise	1
as	1
it	1
did,	1
only	1
reached	1
the	1
quarter	1
where	1
Pierre	1
was	1
staying	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
days	1
spent	1
in	1
solitude	1
and	1
unusual	1
circumstances,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
bordering	1
on	1
insanity.	1
He	1
was	1
completely	1
obsessed	1
by	1
one	1
persistent	1
thought.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
or	1
when	1
this	1
thought	1
had	1
taken	1
such	1
possession	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
remembered	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
understood	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
present,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
home	1
only	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
intricate	1
tangle	1
of	1
life's	1
demands	1
that	1
enmeshed	1
him,	1
and	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
condition	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
unravel.	1
He	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
house,	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
of	1
sorting	1
the	1
deceased's	1
books	1
and	1
papers,	1
only	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
rest	1
from	1
life's	1
turmoil,	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
eternal,	1
solemn,	1
and	1
calm	1
thoughts,	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
restless	1
confusion	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
being	1
drawn.	1
He	1
sought	1
a	1
quiet	1
refuge,	1
and	1
in	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
study	1
he	1
really	1
found	1
it.	1
When	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
dusty	1
writing	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
deathlike	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
study,	1
calm	1
and	1
significant	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
rose	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
in	1
his	1
imagination,	1
particularly	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
vague	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
insignificance	1
and	1
insincerity	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
truth,	1
simplicity,	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
mentally	1
classed	1
as	1
they.	1
When	1
Gerasim	1
roused	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
reverie	1
the	1
idea	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
popular	1
defense	1
of	1
Moscow	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
projected.	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
object	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
Gerasim	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
a	1
peasant's	1
coat	1
and	1
a	1
pistol,	1
confiding	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
intentions	1
of	1
remaining	1
in	1
Joseph	1
Alexeevich's	1
house	1
and	1
keeping	1
his	1
name	1
secret.	1
Then	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
spent	1
in	1
inaction	1
and	1
solitude	1
(he	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
fix	1
his	1
attention	1
on	1
the	1
masonic	1
manuscripts,	1
but	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
do	1
so)	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
cabalistic	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
Bonaparte's	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
vaguely	1
presented	1
itself.	1
But	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he,	1
L'russe	1
Besuhof,	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
limit	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Beast	1
was	1
as	1
yet	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fancies	1
that	1
often	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
left	1
no	1
trace	1
behind.	1
	1
When,	1
having	1
bought	1
the	1
coat	1
merely	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
taking	1
part	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
met	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
Natasha	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"Are	1
you	1
remaining	1
in	1
Moscow?...	1
How	1
splendid!"	1
the	1
thought	1
flashed	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
it	1
really	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
even	1
if	1
Moscow	1
were	1
taken,	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
remain	1
there	1
and	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
predestined	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
idea	1
of	1
not	1
sparing	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
lagging	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
behind	1
them,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Three	1
Hills	1
gate.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
convinced	1
that	1
Moscow	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
defended,	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
before	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
merely	1
a	1
possibility	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
and	1
inevitable.	1
He	1
must	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
concealing	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
must	1
meet	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
either	1
perish	1
or	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
all	1
Europe--which	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
solely	1
due	1
to	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
attempt	1
on	1
Bonaparte's	1
life	1
in	1
1809	1
by	1
a	1
German	1
student	1
in	1
Vienna,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
student	1
had	1
been	1
shot.	1
And	1
the	1
risk	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
expose	1
his	1
life	1
by	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
design	1
excited	1
him	1
still	1
more.	1
	1
Two	1
equally	1
strong	1
feelings	1
drew	1
Pierre	1
irresistibly	1
to	1
this	1
purpose.	1
The	1
first	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
suffering	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
calamity,	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Mozhaysk	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-fifth	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
now	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
home	1
and,	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
luxury	1
and	1
comfort	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
accustomed,	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
a	1
hard	1
sofa	1
without	1
undressing	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
same	1
food	1
as	1
Gerasim.	1
The	1
other	1
was	1
that	1
vague	1
and	1
quite	1
Russian	1
feeling	1
of	1
contempt	1
for	1
everything	1
conventional,	1
artificial,	1
and	1
human--for	1
everything	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
men	1
regard	1
as	1
the	1
greatest	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
first	1
experienced	1
this	1
strange	1
and	1
fascinating	1
feeling	1
at	1
the	1
Sloboda	1
Palace,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
wealth,	1
power,	1
and	1
life--all	1
that	1
men	1
so	1
painstakingly	1
acquire	1
and	1
guard--if	1
it	1
has	1
any	1
worth	1
has	1
so	1
only	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
joy	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
can	1
all	1
be	1
renounced.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
induces	1
a	1
volunteer	1
recruit	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
last	1
penny	1
on	1
drink,	1
and	1
a	1
drunken	1
man	1
to	1
smash	1
mirrors	1
or	1
glasses	1
for	1
no	1
apparent	1
reason	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
cost	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
possesses:	1
the	1
feeling	1
which	1
causes	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
perform	1
actions	1
which	1
from	1
an	1
ordinary	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
are	1
insane,	1
to	1
test,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
his	1
personal	1
power	1
and	1
strength,	1
affirming	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
higher,	1
nonhuman	1
criterion	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
Pierre	1
had	1
experienced	1
this	1
feeling	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
Sloboda	1
Palace	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
continuously	1
under	1
its	1
influence,	1
but	1
only	1
now	1
found	1
full	1
satisfaction	1
for	1
it.	1
Moreover,	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
was	1
supported	1
in	1
his	1
design	1
and	1
prevented	1
from	1
renouncing	1
it	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
done	1
in	1
that	1
direction.	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
now	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
like	1
everyone	1
else,	1
his	1
flight	1
from	1
home,	1
the	1
peasant	1
coat,	1
the	1
pistol,	1
and	1
his	1
announcement	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
would	1
all	1
become	1
not	1
merely	1
meaningless	1
but	1
contemptible	1
and	1
ridiculous,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
Pierre	1
was	1
very	1
sensitive.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
physical	1
condition,	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case,	1
corresponded	1
to	1
his	1
mental	1
state.	1
The	1
unaccustomed	1
coarse	1
food,	1
the	1
vodka	1
he	1
drank	1
during	1
those	1
days,	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
cigars,	1
his	1
dirty	1
unchanged	1
linen,	1
two	1
almost	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
passed	1
on	1
a	1
short	1
sofa	1
without	1
bedding--all	1
this	1
kept	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
bordering	1
on	1
insanity.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
two	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
already	1
entered	1
Moscow.	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
this,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
acting	1
he	1
only	1
thought	1
about	1
his	1
undertaking,	1
going	1
over	1
its	1
minutest	1
details	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
In	1
his	1
fancy	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
clearly	1
picture	1
to	1
himself	1
either	1
the	1
striking	1
of	1
the	1
blow	1
or	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
but	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
vividness	1
and	1
melancholy	1
enjoyment	1
imagined	1
his	1
own	1
destruction	1
and	1
heroic	1
endurance.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
alone,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
all,	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
it	1
or	1
perish!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
will	1
approach...	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly...	1
with	1
pistol	1
or	1
dagger?	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same!	1
'It	1
is	1
not	1
I	1
but	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Providence	1
that	1
punishes	1
thee,'	1
I	1
shall	1
say,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
imagining	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
when	1
killing	1
Napoleon.	1
"Well	1
then,	1
take	1
me	1
and	1
execute	1
me!"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
speaking	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
bowing	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
but	1
firm	1
expression.	1
	1
While	1
Pierre,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
the	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
appeared	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
always	1
so	1
timid	1
before	1
but	1
now	1
quite	1
transformed.	1
	1
His	1
dressing	1
gown	1
was	1
unfastened,	1
his	1
face	1
red	1
and	1
distorted.	1
He	1
was	1
obviously	1
drunk.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Pierre	1
he	1
grew	1
confused	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
noticing	1
embarrassment	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
immediately	1
grew	1
bold	1
and,	1
staggering	1
on	1
his	1
thin	1
legs,	1
advanced	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"They're	1
frightened,"	1
he	1
said	1
confidentially	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice.	1
"I	1
say	1
I	1
won't	1
surrender,	1
I	1
say...	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
right,	1
sir?"	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
seeing	1
the	1
pistol	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
seized	1
it	1
with	1
unexpected	1
rapidity	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor.	1
	1
Gerasim	1
and	1
the	1
porter,	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
stopped	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
pistol	1
from	1
him.	1
Pierre,	1
coming	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor,	1
looked	1
with	1
pity	1
and	1
repulsion	1
at	1
the	1
half-crazy	1
old	1
man.	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
frowning	1
with	1
exertion,	1
held	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
pistol	1
and	1
screamed	1
hoarsely,	1
evidently	1
with	1
some	1
heroic	1
fancy	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"To	1
arms!	1
Board	1
them!	1
No,	1
you	1
shan't	1
get	1
it,"	1
he	1
yelled.	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
do,	1
please,	1
that	1
will	1
do.	1
Have	1
the	1
goodness--please,	1
sir,	1
to	1
let	1
go!	1
Please,	1
sir..."	1
pleaded	1
Gerasim,	1
trying	1
carefully	1
to	1
steer	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
by	1
the	1
elbows	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?	1
Bonaparte!..."	1
shouted	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
right,	1
sir.	1
Come	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
please,	1
and	1
rest.	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
pistol."	1
	1
"Be	1
off,	1
thou	1
base	1
slave!	1
Touch	1
me	1
not!	1
See	1
this?"	1
shouted	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich,	1
brandishing	1
the	1
pistol.	1
"Board	1
them!"	1
	1
"Catch	1
hold!"	1
whispered	1
Gerasim	1
to	1
the	1
porter.	1
	1
They	1
seized	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
by	1
the	1
arms	1
and	1
dragged	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
The	1
vestibule	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
discordant	1
sounds	1
of	1
a	1
struggle	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
tipsy,	1
hoarse	1
voice.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
fresh	1
sound,	1
a	1
piercing	1
feminine	1
scream,	1
reverberated	1
from	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
the	1
cook	1
came	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
vestibule.	1
	1
"It's	1
them!	1
Gracious	1
heavens!	1
O	1
Lord,	1
four	1
of	1
them,	1
horsemen!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
	1
Gerasim	1
and	1
the	1
porter	1
let	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
go,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
now	1
silent	1
corridor	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
several	1
hands	1
knocking	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVIII	1
	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
decided	1
that	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
out	1
his	1
design	1
he	1
would	1
disclose	1
neither	1
his	1
identity	1
nor	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
French,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
half-open	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
corridor,	1
intending	1
to	1
conceal	1
himself	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
entered.	1
But	1
the	1
French	1
entered	1
and	1
still	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
retire--an	1
irresistible	1
curiosity	1
kept	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
of	1
them.	1
One	1
was	1
an	1
officer--a	1
tall,	1
soldierly,	1
handsome	1
man--the	1
other	1
evidently	1
a	1
private	1
or	1
an	1
orderly,	1
sunburned,	1
short,	1
and	1
thin,	1
with	1
sunken	1
cheeks	1
and	1
a	1
dull	1
expression.	1
The	1
officer	1
walked	1
in	1
front,	1
leaning	1
on	1
a	1
stick	1
and	1
slightly	1
limping.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
advanced	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
he	1
stopped,	1
having	1
apparently	1
decided	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
good	1
quarters,	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
of	1
command	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
horses.	1
Having	1
done	1
that,	1
the	1
officer,	1
lifting	1
his	1
elbow	1
with	1
a	1
smart	1
gesture,	1
stroked	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
lightly	1
touched	1
his	1
hat.	1
	1
"Bonjour,	1
la	1
compagnie!"	1
*	1
said	1
he	1
gaily,	1
smiling	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Good	1
day,	1
everybody!"	1
	1
No	1
one	1
gave	1
any	1
reply.	1
	1
"Vous	1
etes	1
le	1
bourgeois?"	1
*	1
the	1
officer	1
asked	1
Gerasim.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Are	1
you	1
the	1
master	1
here?"	1
	1
Gerasim	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
with	1
an	1
alarmed	1
and	1
inquiring	1
look.	1
	1
"Quartier,	1
quartier,	1
logement!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
condescending	1
and	1
good-natured	1
smile.	1
"Les	1
francais	1
sont	1
de	1
bons	1
enfants.	1
Que	1
diable!	1
Voyons!	1
Ne	1
nous	1
fachons	1
pas,	1
mon	1
vieux!"	1
*	1
added	1
he,	1
clapping	1
the	1
scared	1
and	1
silent	1
Gerasim	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
"Well,	1
does	1
no	1
one	1
speak	1
French	1
in	1
this	1
establishment?"	1
he	1
asked	1
again	1
in	1
French,	1
looking	1
around	1
and	1
meeting	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
Pierre	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Quarters,	1
quarters,	1
lodgings!	1
The	1
French	1
are	1
good	1
fellows.	1
What	1
the	1
devil!	1
There,	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
cross,	1
old	1
fellow!"	1
	1
Again	1
the	1
officer	1
turned	1
to	1
Gerasim	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"Master,	1
not	1
here--don't	1
understand...	1
me,	1
you..."	1
said	1
Gerasim,	1
trying	1
to	1
render	1
his	1
words	1
more	1
comprehensible	1
by	1
contorting	1
them.	1
	1
Still	1
smiling,	1
the	1
French	1
officer	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
Gerasim's	1
nose,	1
intimating	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
either,	1
and	1
moved,	1
limping,	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
standing.	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
conceal	1
himself,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
appearing	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
kitchen	1
door	1
with	1
the	1
pistol	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
With	1
a	1
madman's	1
cunning,	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
eyed	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
raised	1
his	1
pistol,	1
and	1
took	1
aim.	1
	1
"Board	1
them!"	1
yelled	1
the	1
tipsy	1
man,	1
trying	1
to	1
press	1
the	1
trigger.	1
Hearing	1
the	1
yell	1
the	1
officer	1
turned	1
round,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
drunkard.	1
Just	1
when	1
Pierre	1
snatched	1
at	1
and	1
struck	1
up	1
the	1
pistol	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
at	1
last	1
got	1
his	1
fingers	1
on	1
the	1
trigger,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deafening	1
report,	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
enveloped	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
turned	1
pale	1
and	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Forgetting	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
concealing	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
French,	1
Pierre,	1
snatching	1
away	1
the	1
pistol	1
and	1
throwing	1
it	1
down,	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
addressed	1
him	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
wounded?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
not,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
feeling	1
himself	1
over.	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
lucky	1
escape	1
this	1
time,"	1
he	1
added,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
damaged	1
plaster	1
of	1
the	1
wall.	1
"Who	1
is	1
that	1
man?"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
sternly	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
am	1
really	1
in	1
despair	1
at	1
what	1
has	1
occurred,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
rapidly,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
intended	1
to	1
play.	1
"He	1
is	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
madman	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing."	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
collar.	1
	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
parted	1
lips,	1
swaying,	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
"Brigand!	1
You	1
shall	1
pay	1
for	1
this,"	1
said	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
letting	1
go	1
of	1
him.	1
"We	1
French	1
are	1
merciful	1
after	1
victory,	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
pardon	1
traitors,"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
gloomy	1
dignity	1
and	1
a	1
fine	1
energetic	1
gesture.	1
	1
Pierre	1
continued,	1
in	1
French,	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
officer	1
not	1
to	1
hold	1
that	1
drunken	1
imbecile	1
to	1
account.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
gloomy	1
expression,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
His	1
handsome	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
melodramatically	1
gentle	1
expression	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
saved	1
my	1
life.	1
You	1
are	1
French,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
that	1
deduction	1
was	1
indubitable.	1
Only	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
could	1
perform	1
a	1
great	1
deed,	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
life--the	1
life	1
of	1
M.	1
Ramballe,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
13th	1
Light	1
Regiment--was	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
deed.	1
	1
But	1
however	1
indubitable	1
that	1
conclusion	1
and	1
the	1
officer's	1
conviction	1
based	1
upon	1
it,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
disillusion	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
Russian,"	1
he	1
said	1
quickly.	1
	1
"Tut,	1
tut,	1
tut!	1
Tell	1
that	1
to	1
others,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
waving	1
his	1
finger	1
before	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
smiling.	1
"You	1
shall	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
that	1
presently.	1
I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
compatriot.	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
man?"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
Pierre	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
Even	1
if	1
Pierre	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
having	1
once	1
received	1
that	1
loftiest	1
of	1
human	1
appellations	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
renounce	1
it,	1
said	1
the	1
officer's	1
look	1
and	1
tone.	1
In	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
last	1
question	1
Pierre	1
again	1
explained	1
who	1
Makar	1
Alexeevich	1
was	1
and	1
how	1
just	1
before	1
their	1
arrival	1
that	1
drunken	1
imbecile	1
had	1
seized	1
the	1
loaded	1
pistol	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
recover	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
officer	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
deed	1
go	1
unpunished.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
expanded	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
majestic	1
gesture	1
with	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
saved	1
my	1
life!	1
You	1
are	1
French.	1
You	1
ask	1
his	1
pardon?	1
I	1
grant	1
it	1
you.	1
Lead	1
that	1
man	1
away!"	1
said	1
he	1
quickly	1
and	1
energetically,	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
Pierre	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
promoted	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
for	1
saving	1
his	1
life,	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
hearing	1
the	1
shot,	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
asking	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
expressed	1
their	1
readiness	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
culprits,	1
but	1
the	1
officer	1
sternly	1
checked	1
them.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
wanted,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
went	1
out	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
orderly,	1
who	1
had	1
meanwhile	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
kitchen,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
officer.	1
	1
"Captain,	1
there	1
is	1
soup	1
and	1
a	1
leg	1
of	1
mutton	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Shall	1
I	1
serve	1
them	1
up?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
some	1
wine,"	1
answered	1
the	1
captain.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXIX	1
	1
When	1
the	1
French	1
officer	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
Pierre	1
the	1
latter	1
again	1
thought	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
French	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
the	1
officer	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
very	1
polite,	1
amiable,	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
genuinely	1
grateful	1
to	1
Pierre	1
for	1
saving	1
his	1
life	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
refuse,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
parlor--the	1
first	1
room	1
they	1
entered.	1
To	1
Pierre's	1
assurances	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
the	1
captain,	1
evidently	1
not	1
understanding	1
how	1
anyone	1
could	1
decline	1
so	1
flattering	1
an	1
appellation,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
Pierre	1
absolutely	1
insisted	1
on	1
passing	1
for	1
a	1
Russian	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
forever	1
bound	1
to	1
Pierre	1
by	1
gratitude	1
for	1
saving	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
Had	1
this	1
man	1
been	1
endowed	1
with	1
the	1
slightest	1
capacity	1
for	1
perceiving	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
had	1
he	1
at	1
all	1
understood	1
what	1
Pierre's	1
feelings	1
were,	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
left	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
man's	1
animated	1
obtuseness	1
to	1
everything	1
other	1
than	1
himself	1
disarmed	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"A	1
Frenchman	1
or	1
a	1
Russian	1
prince	1
incognito,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
fine	1
though	1
dirty	1
linen	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
finger.	1
"I	1
owe	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
friendship.	1
A	1
Frenchman	1
never	1
forgets	1
either	1
an	1
insult	1
or	1
a	1
service.	1
I	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
friendship.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
nature	1
and	1
nobility	1
(in	1
the	1
French	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word)	1
in	1
the	1
officer's	1
voice,	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
gestures,	1
that	1
Pierre,	1
unconsciously	1
smiling	1
in	1
response	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman's	1
smile,	1
pressed	1
the	1
hand	1
held	1
out	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Captain	1
Ramballe,	1
of	1
the	1
13th	1
Light	1
Regiment,	1
Chevalier	1
of	1
the	1
Legion	1
of	1
Honor	1
for	1
the	1
affair	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
of	1
September,"	1
he	1
introduced	1
himself,	1
a	1
self-satisfied	1
irrepressible	1
smile	1
puckering	1
his	1
lips	1
under	1
his	1
mustache.	1
"Will	1
you	1
now	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
conversing	1
so	1
pleasantly,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
ambulance	1
with	1
that	1
maniac's	1
bullet	1
in	1
my	1
body?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
his	1
name	1
and,	1
blushing,	1
began	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
invent	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
his	1
reason	1
for	1
concealing	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
hastily	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
please!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
understand	1
your	1
reasons.	1
You	1
are	1
an	1
officer...	1
a	1
superior	1
officer	1
perhaps.	1
You	1
have	1
borne	1
arms	1
against	1
us.	1
That's	1
not	1
my	1
business.	1
I	1
owe	1
you	1
my	1
life.	1
That	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
at	1
your	1
service.	1
You	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
gentry?"	1
he	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
inquiry	1
in	1
his	1
tone.	1
Pierre	1
bent	1
his	1
head.	1
"Your	1
baptismal	1
name,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
ask.	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
you	1
say....	1
That's	1
all	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know."	1
	1
When	1
the	1
mutton	1
and	1
an	1
omelet	1
had	1
been	1
served	1
and	1
a	1
samovar	1
and	1
vodka	1
brought,	1
with	1
some	1
wine	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
a	1
Russian	1
cellar	1
and	1
brought	1
with	1
them,	1
Ramballe	1
invited	1
Pierre	1
to	1
share	1
his	1
dinner,	1
and	1
himself	1
began	1
to	1
eat	1
greedily	1
and	1
quickly	1
like	1
a	1
healthy	1
and	1
hungry	1
man,	1
munching	1
his	1
food	1
rapidly	1
with	1
his	1
strong	1
teeth,	1
continually	1
smacking	1
his	1
lips,	1
and	1
repeating--"Excellent!	1
Delicious!"	1
His	1
face	1
grew	1
red	1
and	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
perspiration.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
hungry	1
and	1
shared	1
the	1
dinner	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
Morel,	1
the	1
orderly,	1
brought	1
some	1
hot	1
water	1
in	1
a	1
saucepan	1
and	1
placed	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
claret	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
also	1
brought	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
kvass,	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
kitchen	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
try.	1
That	1
beverage	1
was	1
already	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
a	1
special	1
name.	1
They	1
called	1
it	1
limonade	1
de	1
cochon	1
(pig's	1
lemonade),	1
and	1
Morel	1
spoke	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
limonade	1
de	1
cochon	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
captain	1
had	1
the	1
wine	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
while	1
passing	1
through	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
kvass	1
to	1
Morel	1
and	1
applied	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
bottle	1
of	1
Bordeaux.	1
He	1
wrapped	1
the	1
bottle	1
up	1
to	1
its	1
neck	1
in	1
a	1
table	1
napkin	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
wine	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
for	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
his	1
hunger	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
rendered	1
the	1
captain	1
still	1
more	1
lively	1
and	1
he	1
chatted	1
incessantly	1
all	1
through	1
dinner.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
I	1
owe	1
you	1
a	1
fine	1
votive	1
candle	1
for	1
saving	1
me	1
from	1
that	1
maniac....	1
You	1
see,	1
I	1
have	1
bullets	1
enough	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
already.	1
Here	1
is	1
one	1
I	1
got	1
at	1
Wagram"	1
(he	1
touched	1
his	1
side)	1
"and	1
a	1
second	1
at	1
Smolensk"--he	1
showed	1
a	1
scar	1
on	1
his	1
cheek--"and	1
this	1
leg	1
which	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
march,	1
I	1
got	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
battle	1
of	1
la	1
Moskowa.	1
Sacre	1
Dieu!	1
It	1
was	1
splendid!	1
That	1
deluge	1
of	1
fire	1
was	1
worth	1
seeing.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
tough	1
job	1
you	1
set	1
us	1
there,	1
my	1
word!	1
You	1
may	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
it!	1
And	1
on	1
my	1
honor,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
cough	1
I	1
caught	1
there,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
begin	1
again.	1
I	1
pity	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
there,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Bah,	1
really?	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better!	1
You	1
are	1
certainly	1
brave	1
foes.	1
The	1
great	1
redoubt	1
held	1
out	1
well,	1
by	1
my	1
pipe!"	1
continued	1
the	1
Frenchman.	1
"And	1
you	1
made	1
us	1
pay	1
dear	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
it	1
three	1
times--sure	1
as	1
I	1
sit	1
here.	1
Three	1
times	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
three	1
times	1
we	1
were	1
thrown	1
back	1
like	1
cardboard	1
figures.	1
Oh,	1
it	1
was	1
beautiful,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre!	1
Your	1
grenadiers	1
were	1
splendid,	1
by	1
heaven!	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
close	1
up	1
their	1
ranks	1
six	1
times	1
in	1
succession	1
and	1
march	1
as	1
if	1
on	1
parade.	1
Fine	1
fellows!	1
Our	1
King	1
of	1
Naples,	1
who	1
knows	1
what's	1
what,	1
cried	1
'Bravo!'	1
Ha,	1
ha!	1
So	1
you	1
are	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
soldiers!"	1
he	1
added,	1
smiling,	1
after	1
a	1
momentary	1
pause.	1
"So	1
much	1
the	1
better,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre!	1
Terrible	1
in	1
battle...	1
gallant...	1
with	1
the	1
fair"	1
(he	1
winked	1
and	1
smiled),	1
"that's	1
what	1
the	1
French	1
are,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
aren't	1
they?"	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
was	1
so	1
naively	1
and	1
good-humoredly	1
gay,	1
so	1
real,	1
and	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
himself	1
that	1
Pierre	1
almost	1
winked	1
back	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
merrily	1
at	1
him.	1
Probably	1
the	1
word	1
"gallant"	1
turned	1
the	1
captain's	1
thoughts	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"Apropos,	1
tell	1
me	1
please,	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
women	1
have	1
all	1
left	1
Moscow?	1
What	1
a	1
queer	1
idea!	1
What	1
had	1
they	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of?"	1
	1
"Would	1
not	1
the	1
French	1
ladies	1
leave	1
Paris	1
if	1
the	1
Russians	1
entered	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
emitted	1
a	1
merry,	1
sanguine	1
chuckle,	1
patting	1
Pierre	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
"What	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
say!"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
"Paris?...	1
But	1
Paris,	1
Paris..."	1
	1
"Paris--the	1
capital	1
of	1
the	1
world,"	1
Pierre	1
finished	1
his	1
remark	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
stopping	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
talk	1
and	1
gazing	1
intently	1
with	1
his	1
laughing,	1
kindly	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you	1
hadn't	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
were	1
Russian,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
wagered	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
Parisian!	1
You	1
have	1
that...	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what,	1
that..."	1
and	1
having	1
uttered	1
this	1
compliment,	1
he	1
again	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
Paris.	1
I	1
spent	1
years	1
there,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
one	1
sees	1
that	1
plainly.	1
Paris!...	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
doesn't	1
know	1
Paris	1
is	1
a	1
savage.	1
You	1
can	1
tell	1
a	1
Parisian	1
two	1
leagues	1
off.	1
Paris	1
is	1
Talma,	1
la	1
Duchenois,	1
Potier,	1
the	1
Sorbonne,	1
the	1
boulevards,"	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
his	1
conclusion	1
was	1
weaker	1
than	1
what	1
had	1
gone	1
before,	1
he	1
added	1
quickly:	1
"There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
Paris	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
Paris	1
and	1
have	1
remained	1
Russian.	1
Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
esteem	1
you	1
the	1
less	1
for	1
it."	1
	1
Under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
depressing	1
thoughts,	1
Pierre	1
involuntarily	1
enjoyed	1
talking	1
with	1
this	1
cheerful	1
and	1
good-natured	1
man.	1
	1
"To	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
ladies--I	1
hear	1
they	1
are	1
lovely.	1
What	1
a	1
wretched	1
idea	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
bury	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
steppes	1
when	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
is	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
What	1
a	1
chance	1
those	1
girls	1
have	1
missed!	1
Your	1
peasants,	1
now--	1
that's	1
another	1
thing;	1
but	1
you	1
civilized	1
people,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
us	1
better	1
than	1
that.	1
We	1
took	1
Vienna,	1
Berlin,	1
Madrid,	1
Naples,	1
Rome,	1
Warsaw,	1
all	1
the	1
world's	1
capitals....	1
We	1
are	1
feared,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
loved.	1
We	1
are	1
nice	1
to	1
know.	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
Emperor..."	1
he	1
began,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor,"	1
Pierre	1
repeated,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
suddenly	1
became	1
sad	1
and	1
embarrassed,	1
"is	1
the	1
Emperor...?"	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor?	1
He	1
is	1
generosity,	1
mercy,	1
justice,	1
order,	1
genius--that's	1
what	1
the	1
Emperor	1
is!	1
It	1
is	1
I,	1
Ramballe,	1
who	1
tell	1
you	1
so....	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
his	1
enemy	1
eight	1
years	1
ago.	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
an	1
emigrant	1
count....	1
But	1
that	1
man	1
has	1
vanquished	1
me.	1
He	1
has	1
taken	1
hold	1
of	1
me.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
grandeur	1
and	1
glory	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
covered	1
France.	1
When	1
I	1
understood	1
what	1
he	1
wanted--when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
laurels	1
for	1
us,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
myself:	1
'That	1
is	1
a	1
monarch,'	1
and	1
I	1
devoted	1
myself	1
to	1
him!	1
So	1
there!	1
Oh	1
yes,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
ages	1
past	1
or	1
future."	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
Pierre	1
stammered	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
look.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
guilty	1
face	1
and	1
smiled.	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
his	1
entry	1
tomorrow,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
and	1
continued	1
his	1
talk.	1
	1
Their	1
conversation	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
several	1
voices	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
by	1
Morel,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
some	1
Wurttemberg	1
hussars	1
had	1
come	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
their	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
where	1
the	1
captain's	1
horses	1
were.	1
This	1
difficulty	1
had	1
arisen	1
chiefly	1
because	1
the	1
hussars	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
had	1
their	1
senior	1
sergeant	1
called	1
in,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
stern	1
voice	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
what	1
regiment	1
he	1
belonged,	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
commanding	1
officer,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
right	1
he	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
claim	1
quarters	1
that	1
were	1
already	1
occupied.	1
The	1
German	1
who	1
knew	1
little	1
French,	1
answered	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
questions	1
by	1
giving	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
commanding	1
officer,	1
but	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
question	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
said,	1
introducing	1
broken	1
French	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
German,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
his	1
commander	1
had	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
occupy	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
one	1
after	1
another.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
knew	1
German,	1
translated	1
what	1
the	1
German	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
captain's	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
Wurttemberg	1
hussar	1
in	1
German.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
the	1
German	1
submitted	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
men	1
elsewhere.	1
The	1
captain	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
gave	1
some	1
orders	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
as	1
before,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
His	1
face	1
expressed	1
suffering.	1
He	1
really	1
was	1
suffering	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
When	1
the	1
captain	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
suddenly	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
realized	1
the	1
position	1
he	1
was	1
in.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
happy	1
conquerors	1
were	1
masters	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
were	1
patronizing	1
him.	1
Painful	1
as	1
that	1
was	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
tormented	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
moment.	1
He	1
was	1
tormented	1
by	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
weakness.	1
The	1
few	1
glasses	1
of	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
this	1
good-natured	1
man	1
had	1
destroyed	1
the	1
mood	1
of	1
concentrated	1
gloom	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
essential	1
for	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
design.	1
The	1
pistol,	1
dagger,	1
and	1
peasant	1
coat	1
were	1
ready.	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
town	1
next	1
day.	1
Pierre	1
still	1
considered	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
useful	1
and	1
worthy	1
action	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
evildoer,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
it.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
foreboding	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
intention.	1
He	1
struggled	1
against	1
the	1
confession	1
of	1
his	1
weakness	1
but	1
dimly	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
overcome	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
former	1
gloomy	1
frame	1
of	1
mind,	1
concerning	1
vengeance,	1
killing,	1
and	1
self-	1
sacrifice,	1
had	1
been	1
dispersed	1
like	1
dust	1
by	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
he	1
met.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
room,	1
limping	1
slightly	1
and	1
whistling	1
a	1
tune.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman's	1
chatter	1
which	1
had	1
previously	1
amused	1
Pierre	1
now	1
repelled	1
him.	1
The	1
tune	1
he	1
was	1
whistling,	1
his	1
gait,	1
and	1
the	1
gesture	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
twirled	1
his	1
mustache,	1
all	1
now	1
seemed	1
offensive.	1
"I	1
will	1
go	1
away	1
immediately.	1
I	1
won't	1
say	1
another	1
word	1
to	1
him,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
thought	1
this,	1
but	1
still	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
A	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
weakness	1
tied	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
spot;	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
The	1
captain,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
seemed	1
very	1
cheerful.	1
He	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
twice.	1
His	1
eyes	1
shone	1
and	1
his	1
mustache	1
twitched	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
smiling	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
some	1
amusing	1
thought.	1
	1
"The	1
colonel	1
of	1
those	1
Wurttembergers	1
is	1
delightful,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
said.	1
"He's	1
a	1
German,	1
but	1
a	1
nice	1
fellow	1
all	1
the	1
same....	1
But	1
he's	1
a	1
German."	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
facing	1
Pierre.	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
you	1
know	1
German,	1
then?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
German	1
for	1
'shelter'?"	1
	1
"Shelter?"	1
Pierre	1
repeated.	1
"The	1
German	1
for	1
shelter	1
is	1
Unterkunft."	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
it?"	1
the	1
captain	1
asked	1
quickly	1
and	1
doubtfully.	1
	1
"Unterkunft,"	1
Pierre	1
repeated.	1
	1
"Onterkoff,"	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
for	1
some	1
seconds	1
with	1
laughing	1
eyes.	1
"These	1
Germans	1
are	1
first-rate	1
fools,	1
don't	1
you	1
think	1
so,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre?"	1
he	1
concluded.	1
	1
"Well,	1
let's	1
have	1
another	1
bottle	1
of	1
this	1
Moscow	1
Bordeaux,	1
shall	1
we?	1
Morel	1
will	1
warm	1
us	1
up	1
another	1
little	1
bottle.	1
Morel!"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
gaily.	1
	1
Morel	1
brought	1
candles	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine.	1
The	1
captain	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
candlelight	1
and	1
was	1
evidently	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
troubled	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
companion's	1
face.	1
Ramballe,	1
with	1
genuine	1
distress	1
and	1
sympathy	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
we're	1
sad,"	1
said	1
he,	1
touching	1
Pierre's	1
hand.	1
"Have	1
I	1
upset	1
you?	1
No,	1
really,	1
have	1
you	1
anything	1
against	1
me?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
"Perhaps	1
it's	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
affairs?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
but	1
looked	1
cordially	1
into	1
the	1
Frenchman's	1
eyes	1
whose	1
expression	1
of	1
sympathy	1
was	1
pleasing	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Honestly,	1
without	1
speaking	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
owe	1
you,	1
I	1
feel	1
friendship	1
for	1
you.	1
Can	1
I	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
you?	1
Dispose	1
of	1
me.	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
life	1
and	1
death.	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
heart!"	1
said	1
he,	1
striking	1
his	1
chest.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
gazed	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
"shelter"	1
was	1
Unterkunft	1
in	1
German,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
suddenly	1
brightened.	1
	1
"Well,	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
I	1
drink	1
to	1
our	1
friendship!"	1
he	1
cried	1
gaily,	1
filling	1
two	1
glasses	1
with	1
wine.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
glasses	1
and	1
emptied	1
it.	1
Ramballe	1
emptied	1
his	1
too,	1
again	1
pressed	1
Pierre's	1
hand,	1
and	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
pensive	1
attitude.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,"	1
he	1
began,	1
"such	1
is	1
fortune's	1
caprice.	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
soldier	1
and	1
a	1
captain	1
of	1
dragoons	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
Bonaparte,	1
as	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
him?	1
Yet	1
here	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
Moscow	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
he	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
sad	1
and	1
measured	1
tones	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
intends	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
long	1
story,	1
"that	1
our	1
name	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
in	1
France."	1
	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
Frenchman's	1
easy	1
and	1
naive	1
frankness	1
the	1
captain	1
told	1
Pierre	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
ancestors,	1
his	1
childhood,	1
youth,	1
and	1
manhood,	1
and	1
all	1
about	1
his	1
relations	1
and	1
his	1
financial	1
and	1
family	1
affairs,	1
"ma	1
pauvre	1
mere"	1
playing	1
of	1
course	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
story.	1
	1
"But	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
life's	1
setting,	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
is	1
love--love!	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
right,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre?"	1
said	1
he,	1
growing	1
animated.	1
"Another	1
glass?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
again	1
emptied	1
his	1
glass	1
and	1
poured	1
himself	1
out	1
a	1
third.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
women,	1
women!"	1
and	1
the	1
captain,	1
looking	1
with	1
glistening	1
eyes	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
affairs.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
very	1
many	1
of	1
these,	1
as	1
one	1
could	1
easily	1
believe,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
officer's	1
handsome,	1
self-satisfied	1
face,	1
and	1
noting	1
the	1
eager	1
enthusiasm	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
women.	1
Though	1
all	1
Ramballe's	1
love	1
stories	1
had	1
the	1
sensual	1
character	1
which	1
Frenchmen	1
regard	1
as	1
the	1
special	1
charm	1
and	1
poetry	1
of	1
love,	1
yet	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
story	1
with	1
such	1
sincere	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
had	1
experienced	1
and	1
known	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
he	1
described	1
women	1
so	1
alluringly	1
that	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
curiosity.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
l'amour	1
which	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
was	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
low	1
and	1
simple	1
kind	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
once	1
felt	1
for	1
his	1
wife,	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
the	1
romantic	1
love	1
stimulated	1
by	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
experienced	1
for	1
Natasha.	1
(Ramballe	1
despised	1
both	1
these	1
kinds	1
of	1
love	1
equally:	1
the	1
one	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
"love	1
of	1
clodhoppers"	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
"love	1
of	1
simpletons.")	1
L'amour	1
which	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
worshiped	1
consisted	1
principally	1
in	1
the	1
unnaturalness	1
of	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
incongruities	1
giving	1
the	1
chief	1
charm	1
to	1
the	1
feeling.	1
	1
Thus	1
the	1
captain	1
touchingly	1
recounted	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
fascinating	1
marquise	1
of	1
thirty-five	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
charming,	1
innocent	1
child	1
of	1
seventeen,	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
bewitching	1
marquise.	1
The	1
conflict	1
of	1
magnanimity	1
between	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
daughter,	1
ending	1
in	1
the	1
mother's	1
sacrificing	1
herself	1
and	1
offering	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
marriage	1
to	1
her	1
lover,	1
even	1
now	1
agitated	1
the	1
captain,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
a	1
distant	1
past.	1
Then	1
he	1
recounted	1
an	1
episode	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
husband	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
lover,	1
and	1
he--the	1
lover--assumed	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
the	1
husband,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
several	1
droll	1
incidents	1
from	1
his	1
recollections	1
of	1
Germany,	1
where	1
"shelter"	1
is	1
called	1
Unterkunft	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
husbands	1
eat	1
sauerkraut	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
girls	1
are	1
"too	1
blonde."	1
	1
Finally,	1
the	1
latest	1
episode	1
in	1
Poland	1
still	1
fresh	1
in	1
the	1
captain's	1
memory,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
narrated	1
with	1
rapid	1
gestures	1
and	1
glowing	1
face,	1
was	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
saved	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
Pole	1
(in	1
general,	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
life	1
continually	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
captain's	1
stories)	1
and	1
the	1
Pole	1
had	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
enchanting	1
wife	1
(parisienne	1
de	1
coeur)	1
while	1
himself	1
entering	1
the	1
French	1
service.	1
The	1
captain	1
was	1
happy,	1
the	1
enchanting	1
Polish	1
lady	1
wished	1
to	1
elope	1
with	1
him,	1
but,	1
prompted	1
by	1
magnanimity,	1
the	1
captain	1
restored	1
the	1
wife	1
to	1
the	1
husband,	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so:	1
"I	1
have	1
saved	1
your	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
save	1
your	1
honor!"	1
Having	1
repeated	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
captain	1
wiped	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
shake,	1
as	1
if	1
driving	1
away	1
the	1
weakness	1
which	1
assailed	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
touching	1
recollection.	1
	1
Listening	1
to	1
the	1
captain's	1
tales,	1
Pierre--as	1
often	1
happens	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
wine--followed	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
told	1
him,	1
understood	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
followed	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
personal	1
memories	1
which,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why,	1
suddenly	1
arose	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
While	1
listening	1
to	1
these	1
love	1
stories	1
his	1
own	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
unexpectedly	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
going	1
over	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
that	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
he	1
mentally	1
compared	1
them	1
with	1
Ramballe's	1
tales.	1
Listening	1
to	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
struggle	1
between	1
love	1
and	1
duty,	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
every	1
minutest	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
last	1
meeting	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
at	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
water	1
tower.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
that	1
meeting	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
upon	1
him--he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
once	1
recalled	1
it.	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
that	1
meeting	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
it	1
something	1
very	1
important	1
and	1
poetic.	1
	1
"Peter	1
Kirilovich,	1
come	1
here!	1
We	1
have	1
recognized	1
you,"	1
he	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
uttered	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
before	1
him	1
her	1
eyes,	1
her	1
smile,	1
her	1
traveling	1
hood,	1
and	1
a	1
stray	1
lock	1
of	1
her	1
hair...	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
something	1
pathetic	1
and	1
touching	1
in	1
all	1
this.	1
	1
Having	1
finished	1
his	1
tale	1
about	1
the	1
enchanting	1
Polish	1
lady,	1
the	1
captain	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
experienced	1
a	1
similar	1
impulse	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
himself	1
for	1
love	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
envy	1
of	1
the	1
legitimate	1
husband.	1
	1
Challenged	1
by	1
this	1
question	1
Pierre	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
women	1
somewhat	1
differently.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
and	1
still	1
loved	1
only	1
one	1
woman,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
"Tiens!"	1
said	1
the	1
captain.	1
	1
Pierre	1
then	1
explained	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
this	1
woman	1
from	1
his	1
earliest	1
years,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
dared	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
young,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
without	1
a	1
name.	1
Afterwards	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
wealth	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
too	1
well,	1
placing	1
her	1
far	1
above	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
especially	1
therefore	1
above	1
himself.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
this	1
point,	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
the	1
captain	1
whether	1
he	1
understood	1
that.	1
	1
The	1
captain	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
signifying	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
it	1
he	1
begged	1
Pierre	1
to	1
continue.	1
	1
"Platonic	1
love,	1
clouds..."	1
he	1
muttered.	1
	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk,	1
or	1
an	1
impulse	1
of	1
frankness,	1
or	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
never	1
would,	1
know	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
played	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
his	1
story,	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
together,	1
something	1
loosened	1
Pierre's	1
tongue.	1
Speaking	1
thickly	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
faraway	1
look	1
in	1
his	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
life:	1
his	1
marriage,	1
Natasha's	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
best	1
friend,	1
her	1
betrayal	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
simple	1
relations	1
with	1
her.	1
Urged	1
on	1
by	1
Ramballe's	1
questions	1
he	1
also	1
told	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
concealed--his	1
own	1
position	1
and	1
even	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
More	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
story	1
the	1
captain	1
was	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Pierre	1
was	1
very	1
rich,	1
had	1
two	1
mansions	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
abandoned	1
everything	1
and	1
not	1
left	1
the	1
city,	1
but	1
remained	1
there	1
concealing	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
station.	1
	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
warm	1
and	1
light.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Pokrovka	1
a	1
fire	1
glowed--the	1
first	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
beginning	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
To	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
the	1
sickle	1
of	1
the	1
waning	1
moon	1
and	1
opposite	1
to	1
it	1
hung	1
that	1
bright	1
comet	1
which	1
was	1
connected	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
heart	1
with	1
his	1
love.	1
At	1
the	1
gate	1
stood	1
Gerasim,	1
the	1
cook,	1
and	1
two	1
Frenchmen.	1
Their	1
laughter	1
and	1
their	1
mutually	1
incomprehensible	1
remarks	1
in	1
two	1
languages	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
They	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
glow	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
terrible	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
small,	1
distant	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
immense	1
city.	1
	1
Gazing	1
at	1
the	1
high	1
starry	1
sky,	1
at	1
the	1
moon,	1
at	1
the	1
comet,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
glow	1
from	1
the	1
fire,	1
Pierre	1
experienced	1
a	1
joyful	1
emotion.	1
"There	1
now,	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
is,	1
what	1
more	1
does	1
one	1
need?"	1
thought	1
he.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
remembering	1
his	1
intention	1
he	1
grew	1
dizzy	1
and	1
felt	1
so	1
faint	1
that	1
he	1
leaned	1
against	1
the	1
fence	1
to	1
save	1
himself	1
from	1
falling.	1
	1
Without	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
friend,	1
Pierre	1
left	1
the	1
gate	1
with	1
unsteady	1
steps	1
and	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
immediately	1
fell	1
asleep.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXX	1
	1
The	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
fire	1
that	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
September	1
was	1
watched	1
from	1
the	1
various	1
roads	1
by	1
the	1
fugitive	1
Muscovites	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
retreating	1
troops,	1
with	1
many	1
different	1
feelings.	1
	1
The	1
Rostov	1
party	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
Mytishchi,	1
fourteen	1
miles	1
from	1
Moscow.	1
They	1
had	1
started	1
so	1
late	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
the	1
road	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
blocked	1
by	1
vehicles	1
and	1
troops,	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
for	1
which	1
servants	1
were	1
sent	1
back,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
spend	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
a	1
place	1
three	1
miles	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
they	1
woke	1
late	1
and	1
were	1
again	1
delayed	1
so	1
often	1
that	1
they	1
only	1
got	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Great	1
Mytishchi.	1
At	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
that	1
evening	1
the	1
Rostov	1
family	1
and	1
the	1
wounded	1
traveling	1
with	1
them	1
were	1
all	1
distributed	1
in	1
the	1
yards	1
and	1
huts	1
of	1
that	1
large	1
village.	1
The	1
Rostovs'	1
servants	1
and	1
coachmen	1
and	1
the	1
orderlies	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
officers,	1
after	1
attending	1
to	1
their	1
masters,	1
had	1
supper,	1
fed	1
the	1
horses,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porches.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
neighboring	1
hut	1
lay	1
Raevski's	1
adjutant	1
with	1
a	1
fractured	1
wrist.	1
The	1
awful	1
pain	1
he	1
suffered	1
made	1
him	1
moan	1
incessantly	1
and	1
piteously,	1
and	1
his	1
moaning	1
sounded	1
terrible	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
autumn	1
night.	1
He	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
first	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
yard	1
as	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
The	1
countess	1
said	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
close	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
moaning,	1
and	1
at	1
Mytishchi	1
she	1
moved	1
into	1
a	1
worse	1
hut	1
simply	1
to	1
be	1
farther	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wounded	1
man.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
noticed,	1
above	1
the	1
high	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
coach	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
porch,	1
the	1
small	1
glow	1
of	1
another	1
fire.	1
One	1
glow	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
visible	1
and	1
everybody	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Little	1
Mytishchi	1
burning--set	1
on	1
fire	1
by	1
Mamonov's	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
"But	1
look	1
here,	1
brothers,	1
there's	1
another	1
fire!"	1
remarked	1
an	1
orderly.	1
	1
All	1
turned	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
glow.	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
told	1
us	1
Little	1
Mytishchi	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
by	1
Mamonov's	1
Cossacks."	1
	1
"But	1
that's	1
not	1
Mytishchi,	1
it's	1
farther	1
away."	1
	1
"Look,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
Moscow!"	1
	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
gazers	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
its	1
steps.	1
	1
"It's	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
why,	1
Little	1
Mytishchi	1
is	1
over	1
there,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
right	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side."	1
	1
Several	1
men	1
joined	1
the	1
first	1
two.	1
	1
"See	1
how	1
it's	1
flaring,"	1
said	1
one.	1
"That's	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
Moscow:	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
Sushchevski	1
or	1
the	1
Rogozhski	1
quarter."	1
	1
No	1
one	1
replied	1
to	1
this	1
remark	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
they	1
all	1
gazed	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
spreading	1
flames	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
	1
Old	1
Daniel	1
Terentich,	1
the	1
count's	1
valet	1
(as	1
he	1
was	1
called),	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
group	1
and	1
shouted	1
at	1
Mishka.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
staring	1
at,	1
you	1
good-for-nothing?...	1
The	1
count	1
will	1
be	1
calling	1
and	1
there's	1
nobody	1
there;	1
go	1
and	1
gather	1
the	1
clothes	1
together."	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
water,"	1
said	1
Mishka.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Daniel	1
Terentich?	1
Doesn't	1
it	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
glow	1
were	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
remarked	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
footmen.	1
	1
Daniel	1
Terentich	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
and	1
again	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
silent.	1
The	1
glow	1
spread,	1
rising	1
and	1
falling,	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
still.	1
	1
"God	1
have	1
mercy....	1
It's	1
windy	1
and	1
dry..."	1
said	1
another	1
voice.	1
	1
"Just	1
look!	1
See	1
what	1
it's	1
doing	1
now.	1
O	1
Lord!	1
You	1
can	1
even	1
see	1
the	1
crows	1
flying.	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
sinners!"	1
	1
"They'll	1
put	1
it	1
out,	1
no	1
fear!"	1
	1
"Who's	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
out?"	1
Daniel	1
Terentich,	1
who	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
silent,	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
say.	1
His	1
voice	1
was	1
calm	1
and	1
deliberate.	1
"Moscow	1
it	1
is,	1
brothers,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Mother	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
white..."	1
his	1
voice	1
faltered,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
sob.	1
	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
only	1
waited	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
significance	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
glow	1
they	1
were	1
watching.	1
Sighs	1
were	1
heard,	1
words	1
of	1
prayer,	1
and	1
the	1
sobbing	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
old	1
valet.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXI	1
	1
The	1
valet,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
cottage,	1
informed	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
burning.	1
The	1
count	1
donned	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
look.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
undressed,	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
Only	1
Natasha	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Petya	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
with	1
the	1
family,	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
regiment	1
which	1
was	1
making	1
for	1
Troitsa.	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
on	1
hearing	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
on	1
fire,	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
Natasha,	1
pale,	1
with	1
a	1
fixed	1
look,	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
under	1
the	1
icons	1
just	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
arriving	1
and	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
words.	1
She	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
moaning	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant,	1
three	1
houses	1
off.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
terrible,"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
yard	1
chilled	1
and	1
frightened.	1
"I	1
believe	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Moscow	1
will	1
burn,	1
there's	1
an	1
awful	1
glow!	1
Natasha,	1
do	1
look!	1
You	1
can	1
see	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
window,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
cousin,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
distract	1
her	1
mind.	1
	1
But	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
again	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
stove.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
this	1
condition	1
of	1
stupor	1
since	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
Sonya,	1
to	1
the	1
surprise	1
and	1
annoyance	1
of	1
the	1
countess,	1
had	1
for	1
some	1
unaccountable	1
reason	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
tell	1
Natasha	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
wound	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
with	1
their	1
party.	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
seldom	1
been	1
so	1
angry	1
with	1
anyone	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
Sonya.	1
Sonya	1
had	1
cried	1
and	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
forgiven	1
and	1
now,	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
her	1
fault,	1
paid	1
unceasing	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
cousin.	1
	1
"Look,	1
Natasha,	1
how	1
dreadfully	1
it	1
is	1
burning!"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"What's	1
burning?"	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
Moscow."	1
	1
And	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
offend	1
Sonya	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
her,	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
looked	1
out	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
anything,	1
and	1
again	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
attitude.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
didn't	1
see	1
it!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
really	1
I	1
did,"	1
Natasha	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
pleaded	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
Both	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
Sonya	1
understood	1
that,	1
naturally,	1
neither	1
Moscow	1
nor	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
nor	1
anything	1
else	1
could	1
seem	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
returned	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
behind	1
the	1
partition.	1
The	1
countess	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
touched	1
her	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
Natasha	1
was	1
ill,	1
then	1
touched	1
her	1
forehead	1
with	1
her	1
lips	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
feel	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
feverish,	1
and	1
finally	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
cold.	1
You	1
are	1
trembling	1
all	1
over.	1
You'd	1
better	1
lie	1
down,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Lie	1
down?	1
All	1
right,	1
I	1
will.	1
I'll	1
lie	1
down	1
at	1
once,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
morning	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
seriously	1
wounded	1
and	1
was	1
traveling	1
with	1
their	1
party,	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
asked	1
many	1
questions:	1
Where	1
was	1
he	1
going?	1
How	1
was	1
he	1
wounded?	1
Was	1
it	1
serious?	1
And	1
could	1
she	1
see	1
him?	1
But	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
seriously	1
wounded	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
danger,	1
she	1
ceased	1
to	1
ask	1
questions	1
or	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
all,	1
evidently	1
disbelieving	1
what	1
they	1
told	1
her,	1
and	1
convinced	1
that	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
she	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
told	1
the	1
same.	1
All	1
the	1
way	1
she	1
had	1
sat	1
motionless	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
with	1
wide	1
open	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
in	1
them	1
which	1
the	1
countess	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
feared	1
so	1
much,	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
seated	1
herself	1
on	1
arriving.	1
She	1
was	1
planning	1
something	1
and	1
either	1
deciding	1
or	1
had	1
already	1
decided	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
mind.	1
The	1
countess	1
knew	1
this,	1
but	1
what	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
and	1
this	1
alarmed	1
and	1
tormented	1
her.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
undress,	1
darling;	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
my	1
bed."	1
	1
A	1
bed	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
on	1
a	1
bedstead	1
for	1
the	1
countess	1
only.	1
Madame	1
Schoss	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
were	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
some	1
hay	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
"No,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
will	1
lie	1
down	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
floor,"	1
Natasha	1
replied	1
irritably	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
opened	1
it.	1
Through	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
the	1
moans	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
more	1
distinctly.	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
head	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
damp	1
night	1
air,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
saw	1
her	1
slim	1
neck	1
shaking	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
throbbing	1
against	1
the	1
window	1
frame.	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
was	1
moaning.	1
She	1
knew	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
yard	1
as	1
themselves	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
across	1
the	1
passage;	1
but	1
this	1
dreadful	1
incessant	1
moaning	1
made	1
her	1
sob.	1
The	1
countess	1
exchanged	1
a	1
look	1
with	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Lie	1
down,	1
darling;	1
lie	1
down,	1
my	1
pet,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
softly	1
touching	1
Natasha's	1
shoulders.	1
"Come,	1
lie	1
down."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes...	1
I'll	1
lie	1
down	1
at	1
once,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
began	1
hurriedly	1
undressing,	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1
tapes	1
of	1
her	1
petticoat.	1
	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
thrown	1
off	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
dressing	1
jacket,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
foot	1
under	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
jerked	1
her	1
thin	1
and	1
rather	1
short	1
plait	1
of	1
hair	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
and	1
began	1
replaiting	1
it.	1
Her	1
long,	1
thin,	1
practiced	1
fingers	1
rapidly	1
unplaited,	1
replaited,	1
and	1
tied	1
up	1
her	1
plait.	1
Her	1
head	1
moved	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
from	1
habit,	1
but	1
her	1
eyes,	1
feverishly	1
wide,	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
before	1
her.	1
When	1
her	1
toilet	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
finished	1
she	1
sank	1
gently	1
onto	1
the	1
sheet	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
hay	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
nearest	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
you'd	1
better	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
middle,"	1
said	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"I'll	1
stay	1
here,"	1
muttered	1
Natasha.	1
"Do	1
lie	1
down,"	1
she	1
added	1
crossly,	1
and	1
buried	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
The	1
countess,	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
and	1
Sonya	1
undressed	1
hastily	1
and	1
lay	1
down.	1
The	1
small	1
lamp	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
icons	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
light	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
fire	1
at	1
Little	1
Mytishchi	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
away,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
people	1
shouting	1
at	1
a	1
tavern	1
Mamonov's	1
Cossacks	1
had	1
set	1
up	1
across	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
the	1
adjutant's	1
unceasing	1
moans	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Natasha	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
that	1
reached	1
her	1
from	1
inside	1
and	1
outside	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
First	1
she	1
heard	1
her	1
mother	1
praying	1
and	1
sighing	1
and	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
her	1
bed	1
under	1
her,	1
then	1
Madame	1
Schoss'	1
familiar	1
whistling	1
snore	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
gentle	1
breathing.	1
Then	1
the	1
countess	1
called	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
she's	1
asleep,	1
Mamma,"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
softly.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
the	1
countess	1
spoke	1
again	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
no	1
one	1
replied.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
that	1
Natasha	1
heard	1
her	1
mother's	1
even	1
breathing.	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
move,	1
though	1
her	1
little	1
bare	1
foot,	1
thrust	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
quilt,	1
was	1
growing	1
cold	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
floor.	1
	1
As	1
if	1
to	1
celebrate	1
a	1
victory	1
over	1
everybody,	1
a	1
cricket	1
chirped	1
in	1
a	1
crack	1
in	1
the	1
wall.	1
A	1
cock	1
crowed	1
far	1
off	1
and	1
another	1
replied	1
near	1
by.	1
The	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
tavern	1
had	1
died	1
down;	1
only	1
the	1
moaning	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant	1
was	1
heard.	1
Natasha	1
sat	1
up.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
are	1
you	1
asleep?	1
Mamma?"	1
she	1
whispered.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
replied.	1
Natasha	1
rose	1
slowly	1
and	1
carefully,	1
crossed	1
herself,	1
and	1
stepped	1
cautiously	1
on	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
dirty	1
floor	1
with	1
her	1
slim,	1
supple,	1
bare	1
feet.	1
The	1
boards	1
of	1
the	1
floor	1
creaked.	1
Stepping	1
cautiously	1
from	1
one	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
ran	1
like	1
a	1
kitten	1
the	1
few	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
grasped	1
the	1
cold	1
door	1
handle.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
something	1
heavy	1
was	1
beating	1
rhythmically	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
room:	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
own	1
heart,	1
sinking	1
with	1
alarm	1
and	1
terror	1
and	1
overflowing	1
with	1
love.	1
	1
She	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
stepped	1
across	1
the	1
threshold	1
and	1
onto	1
the	1
cold,	1
damp	1
earthen	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
passage.	1
The	1
cold	1
she	1
felt	1
refreshed	1
her.	1
With	1
her	1
bare	1
feet	1
she	1
touched	1
a	1
sleeping	1
man,	1
stepped	1
over	1
him,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
where	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lay.	1
It	1
was	1
dark	1
in	1
there.	1
In	1
the	1
farthest	1
corner,	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
beside	1
a	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
something	1
was	1
lying,	1
stood	1
a	1
tallow	1
candle	1
with	1
a	1
long,	1
thick,	1
and	1
smoldering	1
wick.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
morning	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
wound	1
and	1
his	1
presence	1
there,	1
Natasha	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
to,	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
meeting	1
would	1
be	1
painful,	1
but	1
felt	1
the	1
more	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary.	1
	1
All	1
day	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
only	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
that	1
night.	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
moment	1
had	1
come	1
she	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
dread	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
see.	1
How	1
was	1
he	1
maimed?	1
What	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
him?	1
Was	1
he	1
like	1
that	1
incessant	1
moaning	1
of	1
the	1
adjutant's?	1
Yes,	1
he	1
was	1
altogether	1
like	1
that.	1
In	1
her	1
imagination	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
terrible	1
moaning	1
personified.	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
an	1
indistinct	1
shape	1
in	1
the	1
corner,	1
and	1
mistook	1
his	1
knees	1
raised	1
under	1
the	1
quilt	1
for	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
she	1
imagined	1
a	1
horrible	1
body	1
there,	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
terror.	1
But	1
an	1
irresistible	1
impulse	1
drew	1
her	1
forward.	1
She	1
cautiously	1
took	1
one	1
step	1
and	1
then	1
another,	1
and	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
room	1
containing	1
baggage.	1
Another	1
man--Timokhin--was	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
on	1
the	1
benches	1
beneath	1
the	1
icons,	1
and	1
two	1
others--the	1
doctor	1
and	1
a	1
valet--lay	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
The	1
valet	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
whispered	1
something.	1
Timokhin,	1
kept	1
awake	1
by	1
the	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
wounded	1
leg,	1
gazed	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
at	1
this	1
strange	1
apparition	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
chemise,	1
dressing	1
jacket,	1
and	1
nightcap.	1
The	1
valet's	1
sleepy,	1
frightened	1
exclamation,	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want?	1
What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
made	1
Natasha	1
approach	1
more	1
swiftly	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
corner.	1
Horribly	1
unlike	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
that	1
body	1
looked,	1
she	1
must	1
see	1
him.	1
She	1
passed	1
the	1
valet,	1
the	1
snuff	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
candle	1
wick,	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
clearly	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
outside	1
the	1
quilt,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
ever,	1
but	1
the	1
feverish	1
color	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
his	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
rapturously	1
turned	1
toward	1
her,	1
and	1
especially	1
his	1
neck,	1
delicate	1
as	1
a	1
child's,	1
revealed	1
by	1
the	1
turn-down	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
shirt,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
innocent,	1
childlike	1
look,	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
on	1
him	1
before.	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
swift,	1
flexible,	1
youthful	1
movement	1
dropped	1
on	1
her	1
knees.	1
	1
He	1
smiled	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXII	1
	1
Seven	1
days	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
ambulance	1
station	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
His	1
feverish	1
state	1
and	1
the	1
inflammation	1
of	1
his	1
bowels,	1
which	1
were	1
injured,	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
doctor's	1
opinion	1
sure	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
off.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
ate	1
with	1
pleasure	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
with	1
some	1
tea,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
noticed	1
that	1
his	1
temperature	1
was	1
lower.	1
He	1
had	1
regained	1
consciousness	1
that	1
morning.	1
The	1
first	1
night	1
after	1
they	1
left	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
fairly	1
warm	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
caleche,	1
but	1
at	1
Mytishchi	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
himself	1
asked	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
and	1
given	1
some	1
tea.	1
The	1
pain	1
caused	1
by	1
his	1
removal	1
into	1
the	1
hut	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
groan	1
aloud	1
and	1
again	1
lose	1
consciousness.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
on	1
his	1
camp	1
bed	1
he	1
lay	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
motionless	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
he	1
opened	1
them	1
and	1
whispered	1
softly:	1
"And	1
the	1
tea?"	1
His	1
remembering	1
such	1
a	1
small	1
detail	1
of	1
everyday	1
life	1
astonished	1
the	1
doctor.	1
He	1
felt	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
pulse,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
and	1
dissatisfaction	1
found	1
it	1
had	1
improved.	1
He	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
if	1
his	1
patient	1
did	1
not	1
die	1
now,	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
so	1
a	1
little	1
later	1
with	1
greater	1
suffering.	1
Timokhin,	1
the	1
red-nosed	1
major	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
regiment,	1
had	1
joined	1
him	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
was	1
being	1
taken	1
along	1
with	1
him,	1
having	1
been	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
leg	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
They	1
were	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
doctor,	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
valet,	1
his	1
coachman,	1
and	1
two	1
orderlies.	1
	1
They	1
gave	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
some	1
tea.	1
He	1
drank	1
it	1
eagerly,	1
looking	1
with	1
feverish	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
remember	1
something.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
more.	1
Is	1
Timokhin	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
Timokhin	1
crept	1
along	1
the	1
bench	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
here,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"How's	1
your	1
wound?"	1
	1
"Mine,	1
sir?	1
All	1
right.	1
But	1
how	1
about	1
you?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again	1
pondered	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
something.	1
	1
"Couldn't	1
one	1
get	1
a	1
book?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"What	1
book?"	1
	1
"The	1
Gospels.	1
I	1
haven't	1
one."	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
promised	1
to	1
procure	1
it	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
feeling.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
answered	1
all	1
his	1
questions	1
reluctantly	1
but	1
reasonably,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
he	1
wanted	1
a	1
bolster	1
placed	1
under	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
pain.	1
The	1
doctor	1
and	1
valet	1
lifted	1
the	1
cloak	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
covered	1
and,	1
making	1
wry	1
faces	1
at	1
the	1
noisome	1
smell	1
of	1
mortifying	1
flesh	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
wound,	1
began	1
examining	1
that	1
dreadful	1
place.	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
displeased	1
about	1
something	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
dressings,	1
turning	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
over	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
groaned	1
again	1
and	1
grew	1
unconscious	1
and	1
delirious	1
from	1
the	1
agony.	1
He	1
kept	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
trouble	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
you?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
one.	1
Please	1
get	1
it	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
for	1
a	1
moment,"	1
he	1
pleaded	1
in	1
a	1
piteous	1
voice.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
"You	1
fellows	1
have	1
no	1
conscience,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
valet	1
who	1
was	1
pouring	1
water	1
over	1
his	1
hands.	1
"For	1
just	1
one	1
moment	1
I	1
didn't	1
look	1
after	1
you...	1
It's	1
such	1
pain,	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
I	1
wonder	1
how	1
he	1
can	1
bear	1
it."	1
	1
"By	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
I	1
thought	1
we	1
had	1
put	1
something	1
under	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
valet.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
understood	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
remembered	1
being	1
wounded	1
and	1
how	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
hut	1
after	1
his	1
caleche	1
had	1
stopped	1
at	1
Mytishchi.	1
After	1
growing	1
confused	1
from	1
pain	1
while	1
being	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
hut	1
he	1
again	1
regained	1
consciousness,	1
and	1
while	1
drinking	1
tea	1
once	1
more	1
recalled	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
vividly	1
remembered	1
the	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
ambulance	1
station	1
when,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
disliked,	1
those	1
new	1
thoughts	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
promised	1
him	1
happiness.	1
And	1
those	1
thoughts,	1
though	1
now	1
vague	1
and	1
indefinite,	1
again	1
possessed	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
a	1
new	1
source	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
happiness	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
Gospels.	1
That	1
was	1
why	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
uncomfortable	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
put	1
him	1
and	1
turned	1
him	1
over	1
again	1
confused	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
complete	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
Everybody	1
near	1
him	1
was	1
sleeping.	1
A	1
cricket	1
chirped	1
from	1
across	1
the	1
passage;	1
someone	1
was	1
shouting	1
and	1
singing	1
in	1
the	1
street;	1
cockroaches	1
rustled	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
on	1
the	1
icons,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
a	1
big	1
fly	1
flopped	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
around	1
the	1
candle	1
beside	1
him,	1
the	1
wick	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
charred	1
and	1
had	1
shaped	1
itself	1
like	1
a	1
mushroom.	1
	1
His	1
mind	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
state.	1
A	1
healthy	1
man	1
usually	1
thinks	1
of,	1
feels,	1
and	1
remembers	1
innumerable	1
things	1
simultaneously,	1
but	1
has	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
will	1
to	1
select	1
one	1
sequence	1
of	1
thoughts	1
or	1
events	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
fix	1
his	1
whole	1
attention.	1
A	1
healthy	1
man	1
can	1
tear	1
himself	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
deepest	1
reflections	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
civil	1
word	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
comes	1
in	1
and	1
can	1
then	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
mind	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
state	1
in	1
that	1
respect.	1
All	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
were	1
more	1
active	1
and	1
clearer	1
than	1
ever,	1
but	1
they	1
acted	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
will.	1
Most	1
diverse	1
thoughts	1
and	1
images	1
occupied	1
him	1
simultaneously.	1
At	1
times	1
his	1
brain	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
a	1
vigor,	1
clearness,	1
and	1
depth	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
reached	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
health,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
its	1
work	1
it	1
would	1
turn	1
to	1
some	1
unexpected	1
idea	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
turn	1
it	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
new	1
happiness	1
was	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
which	1
man	1
cannot	1
be	1
deprived,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
semidarkness	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
hut,	1
gazing	1
fixedly	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
feverish	1
wide	1
open	1
eyes.	1
"A	1
happiness	1
lying	1
beyond	1
material	1
forces,	1
outside	1
the	1
material	1
influences	1
that	1
act	1
on	1
man--a	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
alone,	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
loving.	1
Every	1
man	1
can	1
understand	1
it,	1
but	1
to	1
conceive	1
it	1
and	1
enjoin	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
only	1
for	1
God.	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
God	1
enjoin	1
that	1
law?	1
And	1
why	1
was	1
the	1
Son...?"	1
	1
And	1
suddenly	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
these	1
thoughts	1
broke	1
off,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
heard	1
(without	1
knowing	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
delusion	1
or	1
reality)	1
a	1
soft	1
whispering	1
voice	1
incessantly	1
and	1
rhythmically	1
repeating	1
"piti-piti-	1
piti,"	1
and	1
then	1
"titi,"	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
"piti-piti-piti,"	1
and	1
"ti-ti"	1
once	1
more.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
above	1
his	1
face,	1
above	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
of	1
it,	1
some	1
strange	1
airy	1
structure	1
was	1
being	1
erected	1
out	1
of	1
slender	1
needles	1
or	1
splinters,	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
this	1
whispered	1
music.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
balance	1
carefully	1
(though	1
it	1
was	1
difficult)	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
airy	1
structure	1
should	1
not	1
collapse;	1
but	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
kept	1
collapsing	1
and	1
again	1
slowly	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
whispered	1
rhythmic	1
music--"it	1
stretches,	1
stretches,	1
spreading	1
out	1
and	1
stretching,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
himself.	1
While	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
whispering	1
and	1
feeling	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
this	1
drawing	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
this	1
edifice	1
of	1
needles,	1
he	1
also	1
saw	1
by	1
glimpses	1
a	1
red	1
halo	1
round	1
the	1
candle,	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
the	1
cockroaches	1
and	1
the	1
buzzing	1
of	1
the	1
fly	1
that	1
flopped	1
against	1
his	1
pillow	1
and	1
his	1
face.	1
Each	1
time	1
the	1
fly	1
touched	1
his	1
face	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
burning	1
sensation	1
and	1
yet	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
structure,	1
though	1
it	1
knocked	1
against	1
the	1
very	1
region	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
rising.	1
But	1
besides	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
else	1
of	1
importance.	1
It	1
was	1
something	1
white	1
by	1
the	1
door--the	1
statue	1
of	1
a	1
sphinx,	1
which	1
also	1
oppressed	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
that's	1
my	1
shirt	1
on	1
the	1
table,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"and	1
that's	1
my	1
legs,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
always	1
stretching	1
and	1
drawing	1
itself	1
out,	1
and	1
'piti-piti-piti'	1
and	1
'ti-ti'	1
and	1
'piti-piti-piti'...?	1
That's	1
enough,	1
please	1
leave	1
off!"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
painfully	1
entreated	1
someone.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
again	1
swam	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
with	1
peculiar	1
clearness	1
and	1
force.	1
	1
"Yes--love,"	1
he	1
thought	1
again	1
quite	1
clearly.	1
"But	1
not	1
love	1
which	1
loves	1
for	1
something,	1
for	1
some	1
quality,	1
for	1
some	1
purpose,	1
or	1
for	1
some	1
reason,	1
but	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
I--while	1
dying--first	1
experienced	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
my	1
enemy	1
and	1
yet	1
loved	1
him.	1
I	1
experienced	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
an	1
object.	1
Now	1
again	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
bliss.	1
To	1
love	1
one's	1
neighbors,	1
to	1
love	1
one's	1
enemies,	1
to	1
love	1
everything,	1
to	1
love	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
His	1
manifestations.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
love	1
someone	1
dear	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
human	1
love,	1
but	1
an	1
enemy	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
loved	1
by	1
divine	1
love.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
experienced	1
such	1
joy	1
when	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
loved	1
that	1
man.	1
What	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
him?	1
Is	1
he	1
alive?...	1
	1
"When	1
loving	1
with	1
human	1
love	1
one	1
may	1
pass	1
from	1
love	1
to	1
hatred,	1
but	1
divine	1
love	1
cannot	1
change.	1
No,	1
neither	1
death	1
nor	1
anything	1
else	1
can	1
destroy	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
soul.	1
Yet	1
how	1
many	1
people	1
have	1
I	1
hated	1
in	1
my	1
life?	1
And	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
I	1
loved	1
and	1
hated	1
none	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
her."	1
And	1
he	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
Natasha,	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
with	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
charms	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
delight,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
picturing	1
to	1
himself	1
her	1
soul.	1
And	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
feelings,	1
her	1
sufferings,	1
shame,	1
and	1
remorse.	1
He	1
now	1
understood	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
all	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
his	1
rejection	1
of	1
her,	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
his	1
rupture	1
with	1
her.	1
"If	1
only	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
once	1
more!	1
Just	1
once,	1
looking	1
into	1
those	1
eyes	1
to	1
say..."	1
	1
"Piti-piti-piti	1
and	1
ti-ti	1
and	1
piti-piti-piti	1
boom!"	1
flopped	1
the	1
fly...	1
And	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
suddenly	1
carried	1
into	1
another	1
world,	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
reality	1
and	1
delirium	1
in	1
which	1
something	1
particular	1
was	1
happening.	1
In	1
that	1
world	1
some	1
structure	1
was	1
still	1
being	1
erected	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
fall,	1
something	1
was	1
still	1
stretching	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
candle	1
with	1
its	1
red	1
halo	1
was	1
still	1
burning,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
shirtlike	1
sphinx	1
lay	1
near	1
the	1
door;	1
but	1
besides	1
all	1
this	1
something	1
creaked,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
fresh	1
air,	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
white	1
sphinx	1
appeared,	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
And	1
that	1
sphinx	1
had	1
the	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
shining	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
Natasha	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
thinking.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
oppressive	1
this	1
continual	1
delirium	1
is,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
trying	1
to	1
drive	1
that	1
face	1
from	1
his	1
imagination.	1
But	1
the	1
face	1
remained	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
reality	1
and	1
drew	1
nearer.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
wished	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
that	1
former	1
world	1
of	1
pure	1
thought,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not,	1
and	1
delirium	1
drew	1
him	1
back	1
into	1
its	1
domain.	1
The	1
soft	1
whispering	1
voice	1
continued	1
its	1
rhythmic	1
murmur,	1
something	1
oppressed	1
him	1
and	1
stretched	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
face	1
was	1
before	1
him.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
collected	1
all	1
his	1
strength	1
in	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
senses,	1
he	1
moved	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
ringing	1
in	1
his	1
ears,	1
a	1
dimness	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
plunged	1
into	1
water	1
he	1
lost	1
consciousness.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
Natasha,	1
that	1
same	1
living	1
Natasha	1
whom	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
he	1
most	1
longed	1
to	1
love	1
with	1
this	1
new	1
pure	1
divine	1
love	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
him,	1
was	1
kneeling	1
before	1
him.	1
He	1
realized	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
living	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
but	1
quietly	1
happy.	1
Natasha,	1
motionless	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
(she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
stir),	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
riveted	1
on	1
him,	1
was	1
restraining	1
her	1
sobs.	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
rigid.	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
something	1
quivered.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sighed	1
with	1
relief,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"You?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"How	1
fortunate!"	1
	1
With	1
a	1
rapid	1
but	1
careful	1
movement	1
Natasha	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
and,	1
taking	1
his	1
hand	1
carefully,	1
bent	1
her	1
face	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
began	1
kissing	1
it,	1
just	1
touching	1
it	1
lightly	1
with	1
her	1
lips.	1
	1
"Forgive	1
me!"	1
she	1
whispered,	1
raising	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
him.	1
"Forgive	1
me!"	1
	1
"I	1
love	1
you,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Forgive...!"	1
	1
"Forgive	1
what?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
ha-ve	1
do-ne!"	1
faltered	1
Natasha	1
in	1
a	1
scarcely	1
audible,	1
broken	1
whisper,	1
and	1
began	1
kissing	1
his	1
hand	1
more	1
rapidly,	1
just	1
touching	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
lips.	1
	1
"I	1
love	1
you	1
more,	1
better	1
than	1
before,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
lifting	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
Those	1
eyes,	1
filled	1
with	1
happy	1
tears,	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
timidly,	1
compassionately,	1
and	1
with	1
joyous	1
love.	1
Natasha's	1
thin	1
pale	1
face,	1
with	1
its	1
swollen	1
lips,	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
plain--it	1
was	1
dreadful.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that,	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
shining	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
beautiful.	1
They	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
behind	1
them.	1
	1
Peter	1
the	1
valet,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
wide	1
awake,	1
had	1
roused	1
the	1
doctor.	1
Timokhin,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
slept	1
at	1
all	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
leg,	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
watching	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
carefully	1
covering	1
his	1
bare	1
body	1
with	1
the	1
sheet	1
as	1
he	1
huddled	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
bench.	1
	1
"What's	1
this?"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
bed.	1
"Please	1
go	1
away,	1
madam!"	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
maid	1
sent	1
by	1
the	1
countess,	1
who	1
had	1
noticed	1
her	1
daughter's	1
absence,	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Like	1
a	1
somnambulist	1
aroused	1
from	1
her	1
sleep	1
Natasha	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and,	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
hut,	1
fell	1
sobbing	1
on	1
her	1
bed.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
time,	1
during	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
journey,	1
at	1
every	1
halting	1
place	1
and	1
wherever	1
they	1
spent	1
a	1
night,	1
Natasha	1
never	1
left	1
the	1
wounded	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
from	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
either	1
such	1
firmness	1
or	1
such	1
skill	1
in	1
nursing	1
a	1
wounded	1
man.	1
	1
Dreadful	1
as	1
the	1
countess	1
imagined	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
should	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
die	1
in	1
her	1
daughter's	1
arms	1
during	1
the	1
journey--as,	1
judging	1
by	1
what	1
the	1
doctor	1
said,	1
it	1
seemed	1
might	1
easily	1
happen--she	1
could	1
not	1
oppose	1
Natasha.	1
Though	1
with	1
the	1
intimacy	1
now	1
established	1
between	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
and	1
Natasha	1
the	1
thought	1
occurred	1
that	1
should	1
he	1
recover	1
their	1
former	1
engagement	1
would	1
be	1
renewed,	1
no	1
one--least	1
of	1
all	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew--spoke	1
of	1
this:	1
the	1
unsettled	1
question	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death,	1
which	1
hung	1
not	1
only	1
over	1
Bolkonski	1
but	1
over	1
all	1
Russia,	1
shut	1
out	1
all	1
other	1
considerations.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXIII	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
of	1
September	1
Pierre	1
awoke	1
late.	1
His	1
head	1
was	1
aching,	1
the	1
clothes	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
slept	1
without	1
undressing	1
felt	1
uncomfortable	1
on	1
his	1
body,	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
had	1
a	1
dim	1
consciousness	1
of	1
something	1
shameful	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
That	1
something	1
shameful	1
was	1
his	1
yesterday's	1
conversation	1
with	1
Captain	1
Ramballe.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
eleven	1
by	1
the	1
clock,	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
peculiarly	1
dark	1
out	1
of	1
doors.	1
Pierre	1
rose,	1
rubbed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
pistol	1
with	1
an	1
engraved	1
stock	1
which	1
Gerasim	1
had	1
replaced	1
on	1
the	1
writing	1
table,	1
he	1
remembered	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
very	1
day.	1
	1
"Am	1
I	1
not	1
too	1
late?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"No,	1
probably	1
he	1
won't	1
make	1
his	1
entry	1
into	1
Moscow	1
before	1
noon."	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
hastened	1
to	1
act.	1
	1
After	1
arranging	1
his	1
clothes,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
pistol	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
out.	1
But	1
it	1
then	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
certainly	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
the	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
through	1
the	1
streets.	1
It	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
hide	1
such	1
a	1
big	1
pistol	1
even	1
under	1
his	1
wide	1
coat.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
it	1
unnoticed	1
in	1
his	1
belt	1
or	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
discharged,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
reload	1
it.	1
"No	1
matter,	1
dagger	1
will	1
do,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
though	1
when	1
planning	1
his	1
design	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
mistake	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
student	1
in	1
1809	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
kill	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
a	1
dagger.	1
But	1
as	1
his	1
chief	1
aim	1
consisted	1
not	1
in	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
design,	1
but	1
in	1
proving	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
abandon	1
his	1
intention	1
and	1
was	1
doing	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
achieve	1
it,	1
Pierre	1
hastily	1
took	1
the	1
blunt	1
jagged	1
dagger	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
sheath	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
at	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
market	1
with	1
the	1
pistol,	1
and	1
hid	1
it	1
under	1
his	1
waistcoat.	1
	1
Having	1
tied	1
a	1
girdle	1
over	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
pulled	1
his	1
cap	1
low	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
Pierre	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
corridor,	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
making	1
a	1
noise	1
or	1
meeting	1
the	1
captain,	1
and	1
passed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
The	1
conflagration,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
indifference	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
had	1
greatly	1
increased	1
during	1
the	1
night.	1
Moscow	1
was	1
on	1
fire	1
in	1
several	1
places.	1
The	1
buildings	1
in	1
Carriage	1
Row,	1
across	1
the	1
river,	1
in	1
the	1
Bazaar	1
and	1
the	1
Povarskoy,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
barges	1
on	1
the	1
Moskva	1
River	1
and	1
the	1
timber	1
yards	1
by	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
Bridge,	1
were	1
all	1
ablaze.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
way	1
led	1
through	1
side	1
streets	1
to	1
the	1
Povarskoy	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
St.	1
Nicholas	1
on	1
the	1
Arbat,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
before	1
decided	1
that	1
the	1
deed	1
should	1
be	1
done.	1
The	1
gates	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
were	1
locked	1
and	1
the	1
shutters	1
up.	1
The	1
streets	1
and	1
lanes	1
were	1
deserted.	1
The	1
air	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
smoke	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
burning.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
met	1
Russians	1
with	1
anxious	1
and	1
timid	1
faces,	1
and	1
Frenchmen	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
Both	1
the	1
Russians	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
surprise.	1
Besides	1
his	1
height	1
and	1
stoutness,	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
morose	1
look	1
of	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
figure,	1
the	1
Russians	1
stared	1
at	1
Pierre	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
to	1
what	1
class	1
he	1
could	1
belong.	1
The	1
French	1
followed	1
him	1
with	1
astonishment	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
chiefly	1
because	1
Pierre,	1
unlike	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
Russians	1
who	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
curiosity,	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
them.	1
At	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
one	1
house	1
three	1
Frenchmen,	1
who	1
were	1
explaining	1
something	1
to	1
some	1
Russians	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them,	1
stopped	1
Pierre	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
French.	1
	1
Pierre	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
went	1
on.	1
In	1
another	1
side	1
street	1
a	1
sentinel	1
standing	1
beside	1
a	1
green	1
caisson	1
shouted	1
at	1
him,	1
but	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
shout	1
was	1
threateningly	1
repeated	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
click	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
musket	1
as	1
he	1
raised	1
it	1
did	1
Pierre	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
street.	1
He	1
heard	1
nothing	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
around	1
him.	1
He	1
carried	1
his	1
resolution	1
within	1
himself	1
in	1
terror	1
and	1
haste,	1
like	1
something	1
dreadful	1
and	1
alien	1
to	1
him,	1
for,	1
after	1
the	1
previous	1
night's	1
experience,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
losing	1
it.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
destined	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
mood	1
safely	1
to	1
his	1
destination.	1
And	1
even	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
hindered	1
by	1
anything	1
on	1
the	1
way,	1
his	1
intention	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
carried	1
out,	1
for	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
Arbat	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
hours	1
previously	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
Dorogomilov	1
suburb	1
to	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
gloomy	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
a	1
royal	1
study	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
giving	1
detailed	1
and	1
exact	1
orders	1
as	1
to	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
immediately	1
to	1
extinguish	1
the	1
fire,	1
to	1
prevent	1
looting,	1
and	1
to	1
reassure	1
the	1
inhabitants.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
this;	1
he	1
was	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
tortured--as	1
those	1
are	1
who	1
obstinately	1
undertake	1
a	1
task	1
that	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
difficulty	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
incompatibility	1
with	1
their	1
natures--by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
weakening	1
at	1
the	1
decisive	1
moment	1
and	1
so	1
losing	1
his	1
self-esteem.	1
	1
Though	1
he	1
heard	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
around	1
him	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
way	1
by	1
instinct	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
wrong	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
streets	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
Povarskoy.	1
	1
As	1
Pierre	1
approached	1
that	1
street	1
the	1
smoke	1
became	1
denser	1
and	1
denser--he	1
even	1
felt	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
Occasionally	1
curly	1
tongues	1
of	1
flame	1
rose	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
houses.	1
He	1
met	1
more	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
excited.	1
But	1
Pierre,	1
though	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
unusual	1
was	1
happening	1
around	1
him,	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
fire.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
along	1
a	1
foot	1
path	1
across	1
a	1
wide-	1
open	1
space	1
adjoining	1
the	1
Povarskoy	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
gardens	1
of	1
Prince	1
Gruzinski's	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
the	1
desperate	1
weeping	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
close	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
stopped	1
as	1
if	1
awakening	1
from	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
lifted	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
path,	1
on	1
the	1
dusty	1
dry	1
grass,	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
household	1
goods	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
heap:	1
featherbeds,	1
a	1
samovar,	1
icons,	1
and	1
trunks.	1
On	1
the	1
ground,	1
beside	1
the	1
trunks,	1
sat	1
a	1
thin	1
woman	1
no	1
longer	1
young,	1
with	1
long,	1
prominent	1
upper	1
teeth,	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
black	1
cloak	1
and	1
cap.	1
This	1
woman,	1
swaying	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
and	1
muttering	1
something,	1
was	1
choking	1
with	1
sobs.	1
Two	1
girls	1
of	1
about	1
ten	1
and	1
twelve,	1
dressed	1
in	1
dirty	1
short	1
frocks	1
and	1
cloaks,	1
were	1
staring	1
at	1
their	1
mother	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
stupefaction	1
on	1
their	1
pale	1
frightened	1
faces.	1
The	1
youngest	1
child,	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
about	1
seven,	1
who	1
wore	1
an	1
overcoat	1
and	1
an	1
immense	1
cap	1
evidently	1
not	1
his	1
own,	1
was	1
crying	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
nurse's	1
arms.	1
A	1
dirty,	1
barefooted	1
maid	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
trunk,	1
and,	1
having	1
undone	1
her	1
pale-colored	1
plait,	1
was	1
pulling	1
it	1
straight	1
and	1
sniffing	1
at	1
her	1
singed	1
hair.	1
The	1
woman's	1
husband,	1
a	1
short,	1
round-	1
shouldered	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
undress	1
uniform	1
of	1
a	1
civilian	1
official,	1
with	1
sausage-shaped	1
whiskers	1
and	1
showing	1
under	1
his	1
square-set	1
cap	1
the	1
hair	1
smoothly	1
brushed	1
forward	1
over	1
his	1
temples,	1
with	1
expressionless	1
face	1
was	1
moving	1
the	1
trunks,	1
which	1
were	1
placed	1
one	1
on	1
another,	1
and	1
was	1
dragging	1
some	1
garments	1
from	1
under	1
them.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
Pierre,	1
the	1
woman	1
almost	1
threw	1
herself	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
"Dear	1
people,	1
good	1
Christians,	1
save	1
me,	1
help	1
me,	1
dear	1
friends...	1
help	1
us,	1
somebody,"	1
she	1
muttered	1
between	1
her	1
sobs.	1
"My	1
girl...	1
My	1
daughter!	1
My	1
youngest	1
daughter	1
is	1
left	1
behind.	1
She's	1
burned!	1
Ooh!	1
Was	1
it	1
for	1
this	1
I	1
nursed	1
you....	1
Ooh!"	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Mary	1
Nikolievna!"	1
said	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
evidently	1
only	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
stranger.	1
"Sister	1
must	1
have	1
taken	1
her,	1
or	1
else	1
where	1
can	1
she	1
be?"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Monster!	1
Villain!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
woman	1
angrily,	1
suddenly	1
ceasing	1
to	1
weep.	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
heart,	1
you	1
don't	1
feel	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
child!	1
Another	1
man	1
would	1
have	1
rescued	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
fire.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
monster	1
and	1
neither	1
a	1
man	1
nor	1
a	1
father!	1
You,	1
honored	1
sir,	1
are	1
a	1
noble	1
man,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
addressing	1
Pierre	1
rapidly	1
between	1
her	1
sobs.	1
"The	1
fire	1
broke	1
out	1
alongside,	1
and	1
blew	1
our	1
way,	1
the	1
maid	1
called	1
out	1
'Fire!'	1
and	1
we	1
rushed	1
to	1
collect	1
our	1
things.	1
We	1
ran	1
out	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
were....	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
away....	1
The	1
icons,	1
and	1
my	1
dowry	1
bed,	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
lost.	1
We	1
seized	1
the	1
children.	1
But	1
not	1
Katie!	1
Ooh!	1
O	1
Lord!..."	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
sob.	1
"My	1
child,	1
my	1
dear	1
one!	1
Burned,	1
burned!"	1
	1
"But	1
where	1
was	1
she	1
left?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
animated	1
face	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
might	1
help	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
dear	1
sir!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
legs.	1
"My	1
benefactor,	1
set	1
my	1
heart	1
at	1
ease....	1
Aniska,	1
go,	1
you	1
horrid	1
girl,	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
way!"	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
angrily	1
opening	1
her	1
mouth	1
and	1
still	1
farther	1
exposing	1
her	1
long	1
teeth.	1
	1
"Show	1
me	1
the	1
way,	1
show	1
me,	1
I...	1
I'll	1
do	1
it,"	1
gasped	1
Pierre	1
rapidly.	1
	1
The	1
dirty	1
maidservant	1
stepped	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
trunk,	1
put	1
up	1
her	1
plait,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
her	1
short,	1
bare	1
feet	1
along	1
the	1
path.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
life	1
after	1
a	1
heavy	1
swoon.	1
He	1
held	1
his	1
head	1
higher,	1
his	1
eyes	1
shone	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
with	1
swift	1
steps	1
he	1
followed	1
the	1
maid,	1
overtook	1
her,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
Povarskoy.	1
The	1
whole	1
street	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
clouds	1
of	1
black	1
smoke.	1
Tongues	1
of	1
flame	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
broke	1
through	1
that	1
cloud.	1
A	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
people	1
crowded	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
conflagration.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
stood	1
a	1
French	1
general	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
those	1
around	1
him.	1
Pierre,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
maid,	1
was	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
general	1
stood,	1
but	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"On	1
ne	1
passe	1
pas!"	1
*	1
cried	1
a	1
voice.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"You	1
can't	1
pass!"	1
	1
"This	1
way,	1
uncle,"	1
cried	1
the	1
girl.	1
"We'll	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
side	1
street,	1
by	1
the	1
Nikulins'!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
back,	1
giving	1
a	1
spring	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
her.	1
She	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
street,	1
turned	1
down	1
a	1
side	1
street	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and,	1
passing	1
three	1
houses,	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
yard	1
on	1
the	1
right.	1
	1
"It's	1
here,	1
close	1
by,"	1
said	1
she	1
and,	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
yard,	1
opened	1
a	1
gate	1
in	1
a	1
wooden	1
fence	1
and,	1
stopping,	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
small	1
wooden	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
was	1
burning	1
brightly	1
and	1
fiercely.	1
One	1
of	1
its	1
sides	1
had	1
fallen	1
in,	1
another	1
was	1
on	1
fire,	1
and	1
bright	1
flames	1
issued	1
from	1
the	1
openings	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
roof.	1
	1
As	1
Pierre	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
fence	1
gate,	1
he	1
was	1
enveloped	1
by	1
hot	1
air	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Which	1
is	1
it?	1
Which	1
is	1
your	1
house?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Ooh!"	1
wailed	1
the	1
girl,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
wing.	1
"That's	1
it,	1
that	1
was	1
our	1
lodging.	1
You've	1
burned	1
to	1
death,	1
our	1
treasure,	1
Katie,	1
my	1
precious	1
little	1
missy!	1
Ooh!"	1
lamented	1
Aniska,	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
must	1
give	1
expression	1
to	1
her	1
feelings.	1
	1
Pierre	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
wing,	1
but	1
the	1
heat	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
passed	1
round	1
in	1
a	1
curve	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
large	1
house	1
that	1
was	1
as	1
yet	1
burning	1
only	1
at	1
one	1
end,	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
roof,	1
and	1
around	1
which	1
swarmed	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
Frenchmen.	1
At	1
first	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
what	1
these	1
men,	1
who	1
were	1
dragging	1
something	1
out,	1
were	1
about;	1
but	1
seeing	1
before	1
him	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
hitting	1
a	1
peasant	1
with	1
a	1
blunt	1
saber	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
fox-fur	1
coat,	1
he	1
vaguely	1
understood	1
that	1
looting	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
there,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
that	1
idea.	1
	1
The	1
sounds	1
of	1
crackling	1
and	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
falling	1
walls	1
and	1
ceilings,	1
the	1
whistle	1
and	1
hiss	1
of	1
the	1
flames,	1
the	1
excited	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
swaying	1
smoke,	1
now	1
gathering	1
into	1
thick	1
black	1
clouds	1
and	1
now	1
soaring	1
up	1
with	1
glittering	1
sparks,	1
with	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
dense	1
sheaves	1
of	1
flame	1
(now	1
red	1
and	1
now	1
like	1
golden	1
fish	1
scales	1
creeping	1
along	1
the	1
walls),	1
and	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
rapidity	1
of	1
motion,	1
produced	1
on	1
Pierre	1
the	1
usual	1
animating	1
effects	1
of	1
a	1
conflagration.	1
It	1
had	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
strong	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
because	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
suddenly	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
ideas	1
that	1
had	1
weighed	1
him	1
down.	1
He	1
felt	1
young,	1
bright,	1
adroit,	1
and	1
resolute.	1
He	1
ran	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lodge	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
dash	1
into	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
standing,	1
when	1
just	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
heard	1
several	1
voices	1
shouting	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
cracking	1
sound	1
and	1
the	1
ring	1
of	1
something	1
heavy	1
falling	1
close	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
saw	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
house	1
some	1
Frenchmen	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
thrown	1
out	1
the	1
drawer	1
of	1
a	1
chest,	1
filled	1
with	1
metal	1
articles.	1
Other	1
French	1
soldiers	1
standing	1
below	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
drawer.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
this	1
fellow	1
want?"	1
shouted	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
referring	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"There's	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
that	1
house.	1
Haven't	1
you	1
seen	1
a	1
child?"	1
cried	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"What's	1
he	1
talking	1
about?	1
Get	1
along!"	1
said	1
several	1
voices,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
evidently	1
afraid	1
that	1
Pierre	1
might	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
them	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
plate	1
and	1
bronzes	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
drawer,	1
moved	1
threateningly	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"A	1
child?"	1
shouted	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
from	1
above.	1
"I	1
did	1
hear	1
something	1
squealing	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
Perhaps	1
it's	1
his	1
brat	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
is	1
looking	1
for.	1
After	1
all,	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
human,	1
you	1
know...."	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
it?	1
Where?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"There!	1
There!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit--I'm	1
coming	1
down."	1
	1
And	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
later	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
a	1
black-eyed	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
spot	1
on	1
his	1
cheek,	1
in	1
shirt	1
sleeves,	1
really	1
did	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
window	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor,	1
and	1
clapping	1
Pierre	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
ran	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
garden.	1
	1
"Hurry	1
up,	1
you	1
others!"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
comrades.	1
"It's	1
getting	1
hot."	1
	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
gravel	1
path	1
behind	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
pulled	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
round,	1
graveled	1
space	1
where	1
a	1
three-	1
year-old	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
pink	1
dress	1
was	1
lying	1
under	1
a	1
seat.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
your	1
child!	1
Oh,	1
a	1
girl,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better!"	1
said	1
the	1
Frenchman.	1
"Good-bye,	1
Fatty.	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
human,	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
mortal	1
you	1
know!"	1
and	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
the	1
spot	1
on	1
his	1
cheek	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
comrades.	1
	1
Breathless	1
with	1
joy,	1
Pierre	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
But	1
seeing	1
a	1
stranger	1
the	1
sickly,	1
scrofulous-looking	1
child,	1
unattractively	1
like	1
her	1
mother,	1
began	1
to	1
yell	1
and	1
run	1
away.	1
Pierre,	1
however,	1
seized	1
her	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
She	1
screamed	1
desperately	1
and	1
angrily	1
and	1
tried	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
to	1
pull	1
Pierre's	1
hands	1
away	1
and	1
to	1
bite	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
slobbering	1
mouth.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
repulsion	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
when	1
touching	1
some	1
nasty	1
little	1
animal.	1
But	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
not	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
child	1
down	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
house.	1
It	1
was	1
now,	1
however,	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
had	1
come;	1
the	1
maid,	1
Aniska,	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
pity	1
and	1
disgust	1
pressed	1
the	1
wet,	1
painfully	1
sobbing	1
child	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
tenderly	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
garden	1
seeking	1
another	1
way	1
out.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXIV	1
	1
Having	1
run	1
through	1
different	1
yards	1
and	1
side	1
streets,	1
Pierre	1
got	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
burden	1
to	1
the	1
Gruzinski	1
garden	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
Povarskoy.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
recognize	1
the	1
place	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
child,	1
so	1
crowded	1
was	1
it	1
now	1
with	1
people	1
and	1
goods	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
dragged	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
houses.	1
Besides	1
Russian	1
families	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
refuge	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
their	1
belongings,	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
French	1
soldiers	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
clothing.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
them.	1
He	1
hurried	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
that	1
civil	1
servant	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
daughter	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
save	1
someone	1
else.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
quickly.	1
Glowing	1
with	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
from	1
running,	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
more	1
strongly	1
than	1
ever	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
youth,	1
animation,	1
and	1
determination	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
child.	1
She	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
quiet	1
and,	1
clinging	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
coat,	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
gazing	1
about	1
her	1
like	1
some	1
little	1
wild	1
animal.	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
occasionally	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile.	1
He	1
fancied	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
pathetically	1
innocent	1
in	1
that	1
frightened,	1
sickly	1
little	1
face.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
civil	1
servant	1
or	1
his	1
wife	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them.	1
He	1
walked	1
among	1
the	1
crowd	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps,	1
scanning	1
the	1
various	1
faces	1
he	1
met.	1
Involuntarily	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
Georgian	1
or	1
Armenian	1
family	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
old	1
man	1
of	1
Oriental	1
type,	1
wearing	1
a	1
new,	1
cloth-	1
covered,	1
sheepskin	1
coat	1
and	1
new	1
boots,	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
of	1
similar	1
type,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
woman.	1
That	1
very	1
young	1
woman	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
Oriental	1
beauty,	1
with	1
her	1
sharply	1
outlined,	1
arched,	1
black	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
the	1
extraordinarily	1
soft,	1
bright	1
color	1
of	1
her	1
long,	1
beautiful,	1
expressionless	1
face.	1
Amid	1
the	1
scattered	1
property	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
space,	1
she,	1
in	1
her	1
rich	1
satin	1
cloak	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
lilac	1
shawl	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
suggested	1
a	1
delicate	1
exotic	1
plant	1
thrown	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
snow.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
some	1
bundles	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
and	1
looked	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
long	1
lashes	1
with	1
motionless,	1
large,	1
almond-shaped	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
before	1
her.	1
Evidently	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
fearful	1
because	1
of	1
it.	1
Her	1
face	1
struck	1
Pierre	1
and,	1
hurrying	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
fence,	1
he	1
turned	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
fence,	1
still	1
without	1
finding	1
those	1
he	1
sought,	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
With	1
the	1
child	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
his	1
figure	1
was	1
now	1
more	1
conspicuous	1
than	1
before,	1
and	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
Russians,	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
gathered	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
lost	1
anyone,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?	1
You're	1
of	1
the	1
gentry	1
yourself,	1
aren't	1
you?	1
Whose	1
child	1
is	1
it?"	1
they	1
asked	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
coat	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
there	1
with	1
her	1
other	1
children,	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
anyone	1
knew	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
gone.	1
	1
"Why,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
Anferovs,"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
deacon,	1
addressing	1
a	1
pockmarked	1
peasant	1
woman.	1
"Lord	1
have	1
mercy,	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy!"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
his	1
customary	1
bass.	1
	1
"The	1
Anferovs?	1
No,"	1
said	1
the	1
woman.	1
"They	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
That	1
must	1
be	1
either	1
Mary	1
Nikolievna's	1
or	1
the	1
Ivanovs'!"	1
	1
"He	1
says	1
'a	1
woman,'	1
and	1
Mary	1
Nikolievna	1
is	1
a	1
lady,"	1
remarked	1
a	1
house	1
serf.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
her?	1
She's	1
thin,	1
with	1
long	1
teeth,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"That's	1
Mary	1
Nikolievna!	1
They	1
went	1
inside	1
the	1
garden	1
when	1
these	1
wolves	1
swooped	1
down,"	1
said	1
the	1
woman,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord,	1
have	1
mercy!"	1
added	1
the	1
deacon.	1
	1
"Go	1
over	1
that	1
way,	1
they're	1
there.	1
It's	1
she!	1
She	1
kept	1
on	1
lamenting	1
and	1
crying,"	1
continued	1
the	1
woman.	1
"It's	1
she.	1
Here,	1
this	1
way!"	1
	1
But	1
Pierre	1
was	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
woman.	1
He	1
had	1
for	1
some	1
seconds	1
been	1
intently	1
watching	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
away.	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Armenian	1
family	1
and	1
at	1
two	1
French	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
them.	1
One	1
of	1
these,	1
a	1
nimble	1
little	1
man,	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
blue	1
coat	1
tied	1
round	1
the	1
waist	1
with	1
a	1
rope.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
nightcap	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
bare.	1
The	1
other,	1
whose	1
appearance	1
particularly	1
struck	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
lank,	1
round-shouldered,	1
fair-haired	1
man,	1
slow	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
idiotic	1
expression	1
of	1
face.	1
He	1
wore	1
a	1
woman's	1
loose	1
gown	1
of	1
frieze,	1
blue	1
trousers,	1
and	1
large	1
torn	1
Hessian	1
boots.	1
The	1
little	1
barefooted	1
Frenchman	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
coat	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Armenians	1
and,	1
saying	1
something,	1
immediately	1
seized	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
by	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
pulling	1
off	1
his	1
boots.	1
The	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
gown	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Armenian	1
girl	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
her,	1
motionless	1
and	1
silent.	1
	1
"Here,	1
take	1
the	1
child!"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
peremptorily	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
handing	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
to	1
her.	1
"Give	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
them,	1
give	1
her	1
back!"	1
he	1
almost	1
shouted,	1
putting	1
the	1
child,	1
who	1
began	1
screaming,	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
again	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
the	1
Armenian	1
family.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
already	1
sitting	1
barefoot.	1
The	1
little	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
secured	1
his	1
second	1
boot	1
and	1
was	1
slapping	1
one	1
boot	1
against	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
broken	1
by	1
sobs,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
caught	1
but	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
this,	1
his	1
whole	1
attention	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
gown	1
who	1
meanwhile,	1
swaying	1
slowly	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
had	1
drawn	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
pockets	1
had	1
seized	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
neck.	1
	1
The	1
beautiful	1
Armenian	1
still	1
sat	1
motionless	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
attitude,	1
with	1
her	1
long	1
lashes	1
drooping	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
or	1
feel	1
what	1
the	1
soldier	1
was	1
doing	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
While	1
Pierre	1
was	1
running	1
the	1
few	1
steps	1
that	1
separated	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
the	1
tall	1
marauder	1
in	1
the	1
frieze	1
gown	1
was	1
already	1
tearing	1
from	1
her	1
neck	1
the	1
necklace	1
the	1
young	1
Armenian	1
was	1
wearing,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
woman,	1
clutching	1
at	1
her	1
neck,	1
screamed	1
piercingly.	1
	1
"Let	1
that	1
woman	1
alone!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre	1
hoarsely	1
in	1
a	1
furious	1
voice,	1
seizing	1
the	1
soldier	1
by	1
his	1
round	1
shoulders	1
and	1
throwing	1
him	1
aside.	1
	1
The	1
soldier	1
fell,	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
ran	1
away.	1
But	1
his	1
comrade,	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
boots	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword,	1
moved	1
threateningly	1
toward	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Voyons,	1
Pas	1
de	1
betises!"	1
*	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Look	1
here,	1
no	1
nonsense!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
transport	1
of	1
rage	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
nothing	1
and	1
his	1
strength	1
increased	1
tenfold.	1
He	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
barefooted	1
Frenchman	1
and,	1
before	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
draw	1
his	1
sword,	1
knocked	1
him	1
off	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
hammered	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
fists.	1
Shouts	1
of	1
approval	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
crowd	1
around,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
mounted	1
patrol	1
of	1
French	1
uhlans	1
appeared	1
from	1
round	1
the	1
corner.	1
The	1
uhlans	1
came	1
up	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
surrounded	1
them.	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
happened	1
after	1
that.	1
He	1
only	1
remembered	1
beating	1
someone	1
and	1
being	1
beaten	1
and	1
finally	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
bound	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
French	1
soldiers	1
stood	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
were	1
searching	1
him.	1
	1
"Lieutenant,	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
dagger,"	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
Pierre	1
understood.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
a	1
weapon?"	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
barefooted	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
arrested	1
with	1
Pierre.	1
"All	1
right,	1
you	1
can	1
tell	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
court-martial."	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"Do	1
you	1
speak	1
French?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
bloodshot	1
eyes	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
His	1
face	1
probably	1
looked	1
very	1
terrible,	1
for	1
the	1
officer	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
and	1
four	1
more	1
uhlans	1
left	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
placed	1
themselves	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
speak	1
French?"	1
the	1
officer	1
asked	1
again,	1
keeping	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
Pierre.	1
"Call	1
the	1
interpreter."	1
	1
A	1
little	1
man	1
in	1
Russian	1
civilian	1
clothes	1
rode	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
ranks,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
clothes	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking	1
Pierre	1
at	1
once	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
French	1
salesman	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
shops.	1
	1
"He	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
common	1
man,"	1
said	1
the	1
interpreter,	1
after	1
a	1
searching	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
he	1
looks	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
an	1
incendiary,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
officer.	1
"And	1
ask	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
is,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
asked	1
the	1
interpreter	1
in	1
poor	1
Russian.	1
"You	1
must	1
answer	1
the	1
chief."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
who	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
prisoner--take	1
me!"	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
replied	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
ah!"	1
muttered	1
the	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
"Well	1
then,	1
march!"	1
	1
A	1
crowd	1
had	1
collected	1
round	1
the	1
uhlans.	1
Nearest	1
to	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
the	1
pockmarked	1
peasant	1
woman	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
patrol	1
started	1
she	1
moved	1
forward.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
they	1
taking	1
you	1
to,	1
you	1
poor	1
dear?"	1
said	1
she.	1
"And	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
if	1
she's	1
not	1
theirs?"	1
said	1
the	1
woman.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
that	1
woman	1
want?"	1
asked	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
intoxicated.	1
His	1
elation	1
increased	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
he	1
had	1
saved.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
she	1
want?"	1
he	1
murmured.	1
"She	1
is	1
bringing	1
me	1
my	1
daughter	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
saved	1
from	1
the	1
flames,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Good-bye!"	1
And	1
without	1
knowing	1
how	1
this	1
aimless	1
lie	1
had	1
escaped	1
him,	1
he	1
went	1
along	1
with	1
resolute	1
and	1
triumphant	1
steps	1
between	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
patrol	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
sent	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
various	1
streets	1
of	1
Moscow	1
by	1
Durosnel's	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
pillage,	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
incendiaries	1
who,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
opinion	1
which	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
originated	1
among	1
the	1
higher	1
French	1
officers,	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
conflagrations.	1
After	1
marching	1
through	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
streets	1
the	1
patrol	1
arrested	1
five	1
more	1
Russian	1
suspects:	1
a	1
small	1
shopkeeper,	1
two	1
seminary	1
students,	1
a	1
peasant,	1
and	1
a	1
house	1
serf,	1
besides	1
several	1
looters.	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
various	1
suspected	1
characters,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
considered	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
suspicious	1
of	1
all.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
brought	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Zubov	1
Rampart	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
guardhouse,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
placed	1
apart	1
under	1
strict	1
guard.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
a	1
complicated	1
struggle	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
with	1
greater	1
heat	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
circles,	1
between	1
the	1
parties	1
of	1
Rumyantsev,	1
the	1
French,	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna,	1
the	1
Tsarevich,	1
and	1
others,	1
drowned	1
as	1
usual	1
by	1
the	1
buzzing	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
drones.	1
But	1
the	1
calm,	1
luxurious	1
life	1
of	1
Petersburg,	1
concerned	1
only	1
about	1
phantoms	1
and	1
reflections	1
of	1
real	1
life,	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
its	1
old	1
way	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
hard,	1
except	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
effort,	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
danger	1
and	1
the	1
difficult	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people.	1
There	1
were	1
the	1
same	1
receptions	1
and	1
balls,	1
the	1
same	1
French	1
theater,	1
the	1
same	1
court	1
interests	1
and	1
service	1
interests	1
and	1
intrigues	1
as	1
usual.	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
highest	1
circles	1
were	1
attempts	1
made	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
mind	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
actual	1
position.	1
Stories	1
were	1
whispered	1
of	1
how	1
differently	1
the	1
two	1
Empresses	1
behaved	1
in	1
these	1
difficult	1
circumstances.	1
The	1
Empress	1
Marya,	1
concerned	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
charitable	1
and	1
educational	1
institutions	1
under	1
her	1
patronage,	1
had	1
given	1
directions	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
all	1
be	1
removed	1
to	1
Kazan,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
belonging	1
to	1
these	1
institutions	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
packed	1
up.	1
The	1
Empress	1
Elisabeth,	1
however,	1
when	1
asked	1
what	1
instructions	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
give--with	1
her	1
characteristic	1
Russian	1
patriotism	1
had	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
directions	1
about	1
state	1
institutions	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
personally	1
was	1
concerned	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
quit	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
At	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-sixth	1
of	1
August,	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
soiree,	1
the	1
chief	1
feature	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
His	1
Lordship	1
the	1
Bishop	1
when	1
sending	1
the	1
Emperor	1
an	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Venerable	1
Sergius.	1
It	1
was	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
ecclesiastical,	1
patriotic	1
eloquence.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
himself,	1
famed	1
for	1
his	1
elocution,	1
was	1
to	1
read	1
it.	1
(He	1
used	1
to	1
read	1
at	1
the	1
Empress'.)	1
The	1
art	1
of	1
his	1
reading	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
rolling	1
out	1
the	1
words,	1
quite	1
independently	1
of	1
their	1
meaning,	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
singsong	1
voice	1
alternating	1
between	1
a	1
despairing	1
wail	1
and	1
a	1
tender	1
murmur,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wail	1
fell	1
quite	1
at	1
random	1
on	1
one	1
word	1
and	1
the	1
murmur	1
on	1
another.	1
This	1
reading,	1
as	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
soirees,	1
had	1
a	1
political	1
significance.	1
That	1
evening	1
she	1
expected	1
several	1
important	1
personages	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
theater	1
and	1
aroused	1
to	1
a	1
patriotic	1
temper.	1
A	1
good	1
many	1
people	1
had	1
already	1
arrived,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
not	1
yet	1
seeing	1
all	1
those	1
whom	1
she	1
wanted	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room,	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
reading	1
begin	1
but	1
wound	1
up	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
conversation.	1
	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
was	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova.	1
She	1
had	1
fallen	1
ill	1
unexpectedly	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
previously,	1
had	1
missed	1
several	1
gatherings	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
usually	1
ornament,	1
and	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
receiving	1
no	1
one,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Petersburg	1
doctors	1
who	1
usually	1
attended	1
her	1
had	1
entrusted	1
herself	1
to	1
some	1
Italian	1
doctor	1
who	1
was	1
treating	1
her	1
in	1
some	1
new	1
and	1
unusual	1
way.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
the	1
enchanting	1
countess'	1
illness	1
arose	1
from	1
an	1
inconvenience	1
resulting	1
from	1
marrying	1
two	1
husbands	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Italian's	1
cure	1
consisted	1
in	1
removing	1
such	1
inconvenience;	1
but	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
presence	1
no	1
one	1
dared	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
or	1
even	1
appear	1
to	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
"They	1
say	1
the	1
poor	1
countess	1
is	1
very	1
ill.	1
The	1
doctor	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
angina	1
pectoris."	1
	1
"Angina?	1
Oh,	1
that's	1
a	1
terrible	1
illness!"	1
	1
"They	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
rivals	1
are	1
reconciled,	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
angina..."	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
angina	1
was	1
repeated	1
with	1
great	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
is	1
pathetic,	1
they	1
say.	1
He	1
cried	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
the	1
doctor	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
dangerous."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
terrible	1
loss,	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
enchanting	1
woman."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
countess?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
coming	1
up	1
just	1
then.	1
"I	1
sent	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
news,	1
and	1
hear	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
better.	1
Oh,	1
she	1
is	1
certainly	1
the	1
most	1
charming	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
enthusiasm.	1
"We	1
belong	1
to	1
different	1
camps,	1
but	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
prevent	1
my	1
esteeming	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
deserves.	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
unfortunate!"	1
added	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
Supposing	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
words	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
somewhat	1
lifting	1
the	1
veil	1
from	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
malady,	1
an	1
unwary	1
young	1
man	1
ventured	1
to	1
express	1
surprise	1
that	1
well	1
known	1
doctors	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
called	1
in	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
being	1
attended	1
by	1
a	1
charlatan	1
who	1
might	1
employ	1
dangerous	1
remedies.	1
	1
"Your	1
information	1
may	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
mine,"	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
suddenly	1
and	1
venomously	1
retorted	1
on	1
the	1
inexperienced	1
young	1
man,	1
"but	1
I	1
know	1
on	1
good	1
authority	1
that	1
this	1
doctor	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
learned	1
and	1
able	1
man.	1
He	1
is	1
private	1
physician	1
to	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Spain."	1
	1
And	1
having	1
thus	1
demolished	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
turned	1
to	1
another	1
group	1
where	1
Bilibin	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
Austrians:	1
having	1
wrinkled	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
preparing	1
to	1
smooth	1
it	1
out	1
again	1
and	1
utter	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
mots.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
delightful,"	1
he	1
said,	1
referring	1
to	1
a	1
diplomatic	1
note	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
Vienna	1
with	1
some	1
Austrian	1
banners	1
captured	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
by	1
Wittgenstein,	1
"the	1
hero	1
of	1
Petropol"	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
called	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
"What?	1
What's	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
securing	1
silence	1
for	1
the	1
mot,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
before.	1
	1
And	1
Bilibin	1
repeated	1
the	1
actual	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
dispatch,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
composed.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
returns	1
these	1
Austrian	1
banners,"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
"friendly	1
banners	1
gone	1
astray	1
and	1
found	1
on	1
a	1
wrong	1
path,"	1
and	1
his	1
brow	1
became	1
smooth	1
again.	1
	1
"Charming,	1
charming!"	1
observed	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"The	1
path	1
to	1
Warsaw,	1
perhaps,"	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
remarked	1
loudly	1
and	1
unexpectedly.	1
Everybody	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
understanding	1
what	1
he	1
meant.	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
himself	1
glanced	1
around	1
with	1
amused	1
surprise.	1
He	1
knew	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
what	1
his	1
words	1
meant.	1
During	1
his	1
diplomatic	1
career	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
noticed	1
that	1
such	1
utterances	1
were	1
received	1
as	1
very	1
witty,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
opportunity	1
he	1
uttered	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
that	1
entered	1
his	1
head.	1
"It	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
very	1
well,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"but	1
if	1
not,	1
they'll	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
matters."	1
And	1
really,	1
during	1
the	1
awkward	1
silence	1
that	1
ensued,	1
that	1
insufficiently	1
patriotic	1
person	1
entered	1
whom	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
convert,	1
and	1
she,	1
smiling	1
and	1
shaking	1
a	1
finger	1
at	1
Hippolyte,	1
invited	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
bringing	1
him	1
two	1
candles	1
and	1
the	1
manuscript	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
begin.	1
Everyone	1
became	1
silent.	1
	1
"Most	1
Gracious	1
Sovereign	1
and	1
Emperor!"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sternly	1
declaimed,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
audience	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
anyone	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
contrary.	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
anything.	1
"Moscow,	1
our	1
ancient	1
capital,	1
the	1
New	1
Jerusalem,	1
receives	1
her	1
Christ"--he	1
placed	1
a	1
sudden	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
her--"as	1
a	1
mother	1
receives	1
her	1
zealous	1
sons	1
into	1
her	1
arms,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
gathering	1
mists,	1
foreseeing	1
the	1
brilliant	1
glory	1
of	1
thy	1
rule,	1
sings	1
in	1
exultation,	1
'Hosanna,	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh!'"	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
pronounced	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
in	1
a	1
tearful	1
voice.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
attentively	1
examined	1
his	1
nails,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
appeared	1
intimidated,	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
blame.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
whispered	1
the	1
next	1
words	1
in	1
advance,	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
muttering	1
the	1
prayer	1
at	1
Communion:	1
"Let	1
the	1
bold	1
and	1
insolent	1
Goliath..."	1
she	1
whispered.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
continued.	1
	1
"Let	1
the	1
bold	1
and	1
insolent	1
Goliath	1
from	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
France	1
encompass	1
the	1
realms	1
of	1
Russia	1
with	1
death-bearing	1
terrors;	1
humble	1
Faith,	1
the	1
sling	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
David,	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
smite	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
bloodthirsty	1
pride.	1
This	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Venerable	1
Sergius,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
zealous	1
champion	1
of	1
old	1
of	1
our	1
country's	1
weal,	1
is	1
offered	1
to	1
Your	1
Imperial	1
Majesty.	1
I	1
grieve	1
that	1
my	1
waning	1
strength	1
prevents	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
most	1
gracious	1
presence.	1
I	1
raise	1
fervent	1
prayers	1
to	1
Heaven	1
that	1
the	1
Almighty	1
may	1
exalt	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
the	1
just,	1
and	1
mercifully	1
fulfill	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
Your	1
Majesty."	1
	1
"What	1
force!	1
What	1
a	1
style!"	1
was	1
uttered	1
in	1
approval	1
both	1
of	1
reader	1
and	1
of	1
author.	1
	1
Animated	1
by	1
that	1
address	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
guests	1
talked	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
fatherland	1
and	1
offered	1
various	1
conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
to	1
be	1
fought	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
see,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"that	1
tomorrow,	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
birthday,	1
we	1
shall	1
receive	1
news.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
favorable	1
presentiment!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
presentiment	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
fulfilled.	1
Next	1
day	1
during	1
the	1
service	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
church	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
birthday,	1
Prince	1
Volkonski	1
was	1
called	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
received	1
a	1
dispatch	1
from	1
Prince	1
Kutuzov.	1
It	1
was	1
Kutuzov's	1
report,	1
written	1
from	1
Tatarinova	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
Kutuzov	1
wrote	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
not	1
retreated	1
a	1
step,	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
losses	1
were	1
much	1
heavier	1
than	1
ours,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
writing	1
in	1
haste	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
before	1
collecting	1
full	1
information.	1
It	1
followed	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
victory.	1
And	1
at	1
once,	1
without	1
leaving	1
the	1
church,	1
thanks	1
were	1
rendered	1
to	1
the	1
Creator	1
for	1
His	1
help	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
victory.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
presentiment	1
was	1
justified,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
morning	1
a	1
joyously	1
festive	1
mood	1
reigned	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
Everyone	1
believed	1
the	1
victory	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
complete,	1
and	1
some	1
even	1
spoke	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
having	1
been	1
captured,	1
of	1
his	1
deposition,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
ruler	1
for	1
France.	1
	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
for	1
events	1
to	1
be	1
reflected	1
in	1
their	1
real	1
strength	1
and	1
completeness	1
amid	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
court	1
life	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action.	1
General	1
events	1
involuntarily	1
group	1
themselves	1
around	1
some	1
particular	1
incident.	1
So	1
now	1
the	1
courtiers'	1
pleasure	1
was	1
based	1
as	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
news	1
had	1
arrived	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
birthday	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
victory	1
itself.	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
successfully	1
arranged	1
surprise.	1
Mention	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
Kutuzov's	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
losses,	1
among	1
which	1
figured	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Tuchkov,	1
Bagration,	1
and	1
Kutaysov.	1
In	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
world	1
this	1
sad	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
again	1
involuntarily	1
centered	1
round	1
a	1
single	1
incident:	1
Kutaysov's	1
death.	1
Everybody	1
knew	1
him,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
liked	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
young	1
and	1
interesting.	1
That	1
day	1
everyone	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
wonderful	1
coincidence!	1
Just	1
during	1
the	1
service.	1
But	1
what	1
a	1
loss	1
Kutaysov	1
is!	1
How	1
sorry	1
I	1
am!"	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
about	1
Kutuzov?"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
now	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
prophet's	1
pride.	1
"I	1
always	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
capable	1
of	1
defeating	1
Napoleon."	1
	1
But	1
next	1
day	1
no	1
news	1
arrived	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
mood	1
grew	1
anxious.	1
The	1
courtiers	1
suffered	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
suffering	1
the	1
suspense	1
occasioned	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Fancy	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
position!"	1
said	1
they,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
extolling	1
Kutuzov	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
they	1
condemned	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
anxiety.	1
That	1
day	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
no	1
longer	1
boasted	1
of	1
his	1
protege	1
Kutuzov,	1
but	1
remained	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
mentioned.	1
Moreover,	1
toward	1
evening,	1
as	1
if	1
everything	1
conspired	1
to	1
make	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
anxious	1
and	1
uneasy,	1
a	1
terrible	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
was	1
added.	1
Countess	1
Helene	1
Bezukhova	1
had	1
suddenly	1
died	1
of	1
that	1
terrible	1
malady	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
agreeable	1
to	1
mention.	1
Officially,	1
at	1
large	1
gatherings,	1
everyone	1
said	1
that	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
had	1
died	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
attack	1
of	1
angina	1
pectoris,	1
but	1
in	1
intimate	1
circles	1
details	1
were	1
mentioned	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
private	1
physician	1
of	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Spain	1
had	1
prescribed	1
small	1
doses	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
drug	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
certain	1
effect;	1
but	1
Helene,	1
tortured	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
suspected	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
(that	1
wretched,	1
profligate	1
Pierre)	1
had	1
not	1
replied,	1
had	1
suddenly	1
taken	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
dose	1
of	1
the	1
drug,	1
and	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
agony	1
before	1
assistance	1
could	1
be	1
rendered	1
her.	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
had	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
Italian,	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
produced	1
such	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
deceased	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
immediately	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
drop.	1
	1
Talk	1
in	1
general	1
centered	1
round	1
three	1
melancholy	1
facts:	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
lack	1
of	1
news,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Kutaysov,	1
and	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Helene.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
Kutuzov's	1
report	1
a	1
country	1
gentleman	1
arrived	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
surrender	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
town.	1
This	1
was	1
terrible!	1
What	1
a	1
position	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
be	1
in!	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
a	1
traitor,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
during	1
the	1
visits	1
of	1
condolence	1
paid	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
his	1
daughter's	1
death	1
said	1
of	1
Kutuzov,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
praised	1
(it	1
was	1
excusable	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
grief	1
to	1
forget	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said),	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
expect	1
anything	1
else	1
from	1
a	1
blind	1
and	1
depraved	1
old	1
man.	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
Russia	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
entrusted	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man."	1
	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
this	1
news	1
remained	1
unofficial	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
doubt	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
following	1
communication	1
was	1
received	1
from	1
Count	1
Rostopchin:	1
	1
Prince	1
Kutuzov's	1
adjutant	1
has	1
brought	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
demands	1
police	1
officers	1
to	1
guide	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road.	1
He	1
writes	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
regretfully	1
abandoning	1
Moscow.	1
Sire!	1
Kutuzov's	1
action	1
decides	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
capital	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
empire!	1
Russia	1
will	1
shudder	1
to	1
learn	1
of	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
greatness	1
is	1
centered	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
lie	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
your	1
ancestors!	1
I	1
shall	1
follow	1
the	1
army.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
everything	1
removed,	1
and	1
it	1
only	1
remains	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
weep	1
over	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
my	1
fatherland.	1
	1
On	1
receiving	1
this	1
dispatch	1
the	1
Emperor	1
sent	1
Prince	1
Volkonski	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
the	1
following	1
rescript:	1
	1
Prince	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich!	1
Since	1
the	1
twenty-ninth	1
of	1
August	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
no	1
communication	1
from	1
you,	1
yet	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
I	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
via	1
Yaroslavl,	1
the	1
sad	1
news	1
that	1
you,	1
with	1
the	1
army,	1
have	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow.	1
You	1
can	1
yourself	1
imagine	1
the	1
effect	1
this	1
news	1
has	1
had	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
your	1
silence	1
increases	1
my	1
astonishment.	1
I	1
am	1
sending	1
this	1
by	1
Adjutant-General	1
Prince	1
Volkonski,	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
you	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
reasons	1
that	1
have	1
induced	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
this	1
melancholy	1
decision.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Nine	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
a	1
messenger	1
from	1
Kutuzov	1
reached	1
Petersburg	1
with	1
the	1
official	1
announcement	1
of	1
that	1
event.	1
This	1
messenger	1
was	1
Michaud,	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Russian,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
quoique	1
etranger,	1
russe	1
de	1
coeur	1
et	1
d'ame,	1
*	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Though	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
Russian	1
in	1
heart	1
and	1
soul.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
at	1
once	1
received	1
this	1
messenger	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
on	1
Stone	1
Island.	1
Michaud,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
Moscow	1
before	1
the	1
campaign	1
and	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Russian,	1
yet	1
felt	1
deeply	1
moved	1
(as	1
he	1
wrote)	1
when	1
he	1
appeared	1
before	1
notre	1
tres	1
gracieux	1
souverain	1
*	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
dont	1
les	1
flammes	1
eclairaient	1
sa	1
route.	1
*(2)	1
	1
	1
*	1
Our	1
most	1
gracious	1
sovereign.	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
Whose	1
flames	1
illumined	1
his	1
route.	1
	1
Though	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
M.	1
Michaud's	1
chagrin	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
caused	1
Russians	1
to	1
grieve,	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
sad	1
face	1
when	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
study	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
at	1
once	1
asked:	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
brought	1
me	1
sad	1
news,	1
Colonel?"	1
	1
"Very	1
sad,	1
sire,"	1
replied	1
Michaud,	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"The	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow."	1
	1
"Have	1
they	1
surrendered	1
my	1
ancient	1
capital	1
without	1
a	1
battle?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Emperor	1
quickly,	1
his	1
face	1
suddenly	1
flushing.	1
	1
Michaud	1
respectfully	1
delivered	1
the	1
message	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
before	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
remaining	1
choice	1
was	1
between	1
losing	1
the	1
army	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
losing	1
Moscow	1
alone,	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
had	1
to	1
choose	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
listened	1
in	1
silence,	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
Michaud.	1
	1
"Has	1
the	1
enemy	1
entered	1
the	1
city?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sire,	1
and	1
Moscow	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
ashes.	1
I	1
left	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
flames,"	1
replied	1
Michaud	1
in	1
a	1
decided	1
tone,	1
but	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
he	1
was	1
frightened	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
began	1
to	1
breathe	1
heavily	1
and	1
rapidly,	1
his	1
lower	1
lip	1
trembled,	1
and	1
tears	1
instantly	1
appeared	1
in	1
his	1
fine	1
blue	1
eyes.	1
	1
But	1
this	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
moment.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
frowned,	1
as	1
if	1
blaming	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
weakness,	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
head	1
addressed	1
Michaud	1
in	1
a	1
firm	1
voice:	1
	1
"I	1
see,	1
Colonel,	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
happening,	1
that	1
Providence	1
requires	1
great	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
us...	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
submit	1
myself	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
His	1
will;	1
but	1
tell	1
me,	1
Michaud,	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
leave	1
the	1
army	1
when	1
it	1
saw	1
my	1
ancient	1
capital	1
abandoned	1
without	1
a	1
battle?	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
notice	1
discouragement?..."	1
	1
Seeing	1
that	1
his	1
most	1
gracious	1
ruler	1
was	1
calm	1
once	1
more,	1
Michaud	1
also	1
grew	1
calm,	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
immediately	1
ready	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
direct	1
and	1
relevant	1
question	1
which	1
required	1
a	1
direct	1
answer.	1
	1
"Sire,	1
will	1
you	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
frankly	1
as	1
befits	1
a	1
loyal	1
soldier?"	1
he	1
asked	1
to	1
gain	1
time.	1
	1
"Colonel,	1
I	1
always	1
require	1
it,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
"Conceal	1
nothing	1
from	1
me,	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
absolutely	1
how	1
things	1
are."	1
	1
"Sire!"	1
said	1
Michaud	1
with	1
a	1
subtle,	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips,	1
having	1
now	1
prepared	1
a	1
well-phrased	1
reply,	1
"sire,	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
from	1
its	1
chiefs	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
soldier,	1
without	1
exception	1
in	1
desperate	1
and	1
agonized	1
terror..."	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
that?"	1
the	1
Emperor	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
frowning	1
sternly.	1
"Would	1
misfortune	1
make	1
my	1
Russians	1
lose	1
heart?...	1
Never!"	1
	1
Michaud	1
had	1
only	1
waited	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
phrase	1
he	1
had	1
prepared.	1
	1
"Sire,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
respectful	1
playfulness,	1
"they	1
are	1
only	1
afraid	1
lest	1
Your	1
Majesty,	1
in	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
should	1
allow	1
yourself	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
to	1
make	1
peace.	1
They	1
are	1
burning	1
for	1
the	1
combat,"	1
declared	1
this	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
nation,	1
"and	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
by	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
how	1
devoted	1
they	1
are...."	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
reassured,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
kindly	1
gleam	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
patted	1
Michaud	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
"You	1
set	1
me	1
at	1
ease,	1
Colonel."	1
	1
He	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
army,"	1
he	1
said,	1
drawing	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
full	1
height	1
and	1
addressing	1
Michaud	1
with	1
a	1
gracious	1
and	1
majestic	1
gesture,	1
"and	1
tell	1
our	1
brave	1
men	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
good	1
subjects	1
wherever	1
you	1
go	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
soldier	1
left	1
I	1
shall	1
put	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
nobility	1
and	1
my	1
good	1
peasants	1
and	1
so	1
use	1
the	1
last	1
resources	1
of	1
my	1
empire.	1
It	1
still	1
offers	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
my	1
enemies	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated;	1
"but	1
should	1
it	1
ever	1
be	1
ordained	1
by	1
Divine	1
Providence,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
raising	1
to	1
heaven	1
his	1
fine	1
eyes	1
shining	1
with	1
emotion,	1
"that	1
my	1
dynasty	1
should	1
cease	1
to	1
reign	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
my	1
ancestors,	1
then	1
after	1
exhausting	1
all	1
the	1
means	1
at	1
my	1
command,	1
I	1
shall	1
let	1
my	1
beard	1
grow	1
to	1
here"	1
(he	1
pointed	1
halfway	1
down	1
his	1
chest)	1
"and	1
go	1
and	1
eat	1
potatoes	1
with	1
the	1
meanest	1
of	1
my	1
peasants,	1
rather	1
than	1
sign	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
my	1
country	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
people	1
whose	1
sacrifices	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
appreciate."	1
	1
Having	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
agitated	1
voice	1
the	1
Emperor	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
away	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
hide	1
from	1
Michaud	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
study.	1
Having	1
stood	1
there	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
he	1
strode	1
back	1
to	1
Michaud	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
arm	1
below	1
the	1
elbow	1
with	1
a	1
vigorous	1
movement.	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
mild	1
and	1
handsome	1
face	1
was	1
flushed	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
with	1
resolution	1
and	1
anger.	1
	1
"Colonel	1
Michaud,	1
do	1
not	1
forget	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
here,	1
perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
recall	1
it	1
with	1
pleasure	1
someday...	1
Napoleon	1
or	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
touching	1
his	1
breast.	1
"We	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
both	1
reign	1
together.	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
to	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
deceive	1
me	1
any	1
more...."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
Emperor	1
paused,	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
firm	1
resolution	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes,	1
Michaud--quoique	1
etranger,	1
russe	1
de	1
coeur	1
et	1
d'ame--	1
at	1
that	1
solemn	1
moment	1
felt	1
himself	1
enraptured	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
(as	1
he	1
used	1
afterwards	1
to	1
say),	1
and	1
gave	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
feelings	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
whose	1
representative	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
to	1
be,	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
words:	1
	1
"Sire!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
is	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
signing	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
Europe!"	1
	1
With	1
an	1
inclination	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
the	1
Emperor	1
dismissed	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
for	1
us	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
living	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
when	1
half	1
Russia	1
had	1
been	1
conquered	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
fleeing	1
to	1
distant	1
provinces,	1
and	1
one	1
levy	1
after	1
another	1
was	1
being	1
raised	1
for	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
fatherland,	1
all	1
Russians	1
from	1
the	1
greatest	1
to	1
the	1
least	1
were	1
solely	1
engaged	1
in	1
sacrificing	1
themselves,	1
saving	1
their	1
fatherland,	1
or	1
weeping	1
over	1
its	1
downfall.	1
The	1
tales	1
and	1
descriptions	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
without	1
exception	1
speak	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
self-sacrifice,	1
patriotic	1
devotion,	1
despair,	1
grief,	1
and	1
the	1
heroism	1
of	1
the	1
Russians.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
so.	1
It	1
appears	1
so	1
to	1
us	1
because	1
we	1
see	1
only	1
the	1
general	1
historic	1
interest	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
personal	1
human	1
interests	1
that	1
people	1
had.	1
Yet	1
in	1
reality	1
those	1
personal	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
so	1
much	1
transcend	1
the	1
general	1
interests	1
that	1
they	1
always	1
prevent	1
the	1
public	1
interest	1
from	1
being	1
felt	1
or	1
even	1
noticed.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
progress	1
of	1
events	1
but	1
were	1
guided	1
only	1
by	1
their	1
private	1
interests,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
people	1
whose	1
activities	1
at	1
that	1
period	1
were	1
most	1
useful.	1
	1
Those	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
heroism	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
useless	1
members	1
of	1
society,	1
they	1
saw	1
everything	1
upside	1
down,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
did	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
good	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
useless	1
and	1
foolish--like	1
Pierre's	1
and	1
Mamonov's	1
regiments	1
which	1
looted	1
Russian	1
villages,	1
and	1
the	1
lint	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
prepared	1
and	1
that	1
never	1
reached	1
the	1
wounded,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Even	1
those,	1
fond	1
of	1
intellectual	1
talk	1
and	1
of	1
expressing	1
their	1
feelings,	1
who	1
discussed	1
Russia's	1
position	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
involuntarily	1
introduced	1
into	1
their	1
conversation	1
either	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
pretense	1
and	1
falsehood	1
or	1
useless	1
condemnation	1
and	1
anger	1
directed	1
against	1
people	1
accused	1
of	1
actions	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
guilty	1
of.	1
In	1
historic	1
events	1
the	1
rule	1
forbidding	1
us	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Tree	1
of	1
Knowledge	1
is	1
specially	1
applicable.	1
Only	1
unconscious	1
action	1
bears	1
fruit,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
plays	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
an	1
historic	1
event	1
never	1
understands	1
its	1
significance.	1
If	1
he	1
tries	1
to	1
realize	1
it	1
his	1
efforts	1
are	1
fruitless.	1
	1
The	1
more	1
closely	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
events	1
then	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
Russia	1
the	1
less	1
did	1
he	1
realize	1
their	1
significance.	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
provinces	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
ladies,	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
militia	1
uniforms,	1
wept	1
for	1
Russia	1
and	1
its	1
ancient	1
capital	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
retired	1
beyond	1
Moscow	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
talk	1
or	1
thought	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
its	1
burned	1
ruins	1
no	1
one	1
swore	1
to	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
the	1
French,	1
but	1
they	1
thought	1
about	1
their	1
next	1
pay,	1
their	1
next	1
quarters,	1
of	1
Matreshka	1
the	1
vivandiere,	1
and	1
like	1
matters.	1
	1
As	1
the	1
war	1
had	1
caught	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
took	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
prolonged	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
his	1
country,	1
but	1
did	1
so	1
casually,	1
without	1
any	1
aim	1
at	1
self-sacrifice,	1
and	1
he	1
therefore	1
looked	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
Russia	1
without	1
despair	1
and	1
without	1
dismally	1
racking	1
his	1
brains	1
over	1
it.	1
Had	1
he	1
been	1
asked	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
Russia,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
business	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it,	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
there	1
for	1
that	1
purpose,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
regiments	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
full	1
strength,	1
that	1
fighting	1
would	1
probably	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
yet,	1
and	1
that	1
things	1
being	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
likely	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
regiment	1
in	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
years'	1
time.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
sent	1
to	1
Voronezh	1
to	1
buy	1
remounts	1
for	1
his	1
division,	1
not	1
only	1
without	1
regret	1
at	1
being	1
prevented	1
from	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
coming	1
battle,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure--which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
conceal	1
and	1
which	1
his	1
comrades	1
fully	1
understood.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
Nicholas	1
received	1
the	1
necessary	1
money	1
and	1
warrants,	1
and	1
having	1
sent	1
some	1
hussars	1
on	1
in	1
advance,	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
with	1
post	1
horses	1
for	1
Voronezh.	1
	1
Only	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
experienced	1
it--that	1
is,	1
has	1
passed	1
some	1
months	1
continuously	1
in	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
campaigning	1
and	1
war--can	1
understand	1
the	1
delight	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
when	1
he	1
escaped	1
from	1
the	1
region	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
army's	1
foraging	1
operations,	1
provision	1
trains,	1
and	1
hospitals.	1
When--free	1
from	1
soldiers,	1
wagons,	1
and	1
the	1
filthy	1
traces	1
of	1
a	1
camp--he	1
saw	1
villages	1
with	1
peasants	1
and	1
peasant	1
women,	1
gentlemen's	1
country	1
houses,	1
fields	1
where	1
cattle	1
were	1
grazing,	1
posthouses	1
with	1
stationmasters	1
asleep	1
in	1
them,	1
he	1
rejoiced	1
as	1
though	1
seeing	1
all	1
this	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
What	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
specially	1
surprised	1
and	1
delighted	1
him	1
were	1
the	1
women,	1
young	1
and	1
healthy,	1
without	1
a	1
dozen	1
officers	1
making	1
up	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them;	1
women,	1
too,	1
who	1
were	1
pleased	1
and	1
flattered	1
that	1
a	1
passing	1
officer	1
should	1
joke	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
highest	1
spirits	1
Nicholas	1
arrived	1
at	1
night	1
at	1
a	1
hotel	1
in	1
Voronezh,	1
ordered	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
deprived	1
of	1
in	1
camp,	1
and	1
next	1
day,	1
very	1
clean-shaven	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
full-dress	1
uniform	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
worn	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
went	1
to	1
present	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
authorities.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
was	1
a	1
civilian	1
general,	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
military	1
designation	1
and	1
rank.	1
He	1
received	1
Nicholas	1
brusquely	1
(imagining	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
characteristically	1
military)	1
and	1
questioned	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
important	1
air,	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
the	1
general	1
progress	1
of	1
affairs	1
and	1
approving	1
and	1
disapproving	1
with	1
full	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
good	1
spirits	1
that	1
this	1
merely	1
amused	1
him.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
governor.	1
The	1
governor	1
was	1
a	1
brisk	1
little	1
man,	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
affable.	1
He	1
indicated	1
the	1
stud	1
farms	1
at	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
might	1
procure	1
horses,	1
recommended	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
horse	1
dealer	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
a	1
landowner	1
fourteen	1
miles	1
out	1
of	1
town	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
best	1
horses,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
in	1
every	1
way.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov's	1
son?	1
My	1
wife	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
your	1
mother's.	1
We	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
on	1
Thursdays--today	1
is	1
Thursday,	1
so	1
please	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
us	1
quite	1
informally,"	1
said	1
the	1
governor,	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
Immediately	1
on	1
leaving	1
the	1
governor's,	1
Nicholas	1
hired	1
post	1
horses	1
and,	1
taking	1
his	1
squadron	1
quartermaster	1
with	1
him,	1
drove	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
to	1
the	1
landowner,	1
fourteen	1
miles	1
away,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
stud.	1
Everything	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
pleasant	1
and	1
easy	1
during	1
that	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
and,	1
as	1
usually	1
happens	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
everything	1
went	1
well	1
and	1
easily.	1
	1
The	1
landowner	1
to	1
whom	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
was	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
an	1
old	1
cavalryman,	1
a	1
horse	1
fancier,	1
a	1
sportsman,	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
some	1
century-old	1
brandy	1
and	1
some	1
old	1
Hungarian	1
wine,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
snuggery	1
where	1
he	1
smoked,	1
and	1
who	1
owned	1
some	1
splendid	1
horses.	1
	1
In	1
very	1
few	1
words	1
Nicholas	1
bought	1
seventeen	1
picked	1
stallions	1
for	1
six	1
thousand	1
rubles--to	1
serve,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
samples	1
of	1
his	1
remounts.	1
After	1
dining	1
and	1
taking	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
Hungarian	1
wine,	1
Nicholas--	1
having	1
exchanged	1
kisses	1
with	1
the	1
landowner,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
friendliest	1
terms--galloped	1
back	1
over	1
abominable	1
roads,	1
in	1
the	1
brightest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind,	1
continually	1
urging	1
on	1
the	1
driver	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
governor's	1
party.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
changed,	1
poured	1
water	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
scented	1
himself,	1
Nicholas	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
governor's	1
rather	1
late,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
phrase	1
"better	1
late	1
than	1
never"	1
on	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
ball,	1
nor	1
had	1
dancing	1
been	1
announced,	1
but	1
everyone	1
knew	1
that	1
Catherine	1
Petrovna	1
would	1
play	1
valses	1
and	1
the	1
ecossaise	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
dancing,	1
and	1
so	1
everyone	1
had	1
come	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
ball.	1
	1
Provincial	1
life	1
in	1
1812	1
went	1
on	1
very	1
much	1
as	1
usual,	1
but	1
with	1
this	1
difference,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
livelier	1
in	1
the	1
towns	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
many	1
wealthy	1
families	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
everything	1
that	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
Russia	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
a	1
special	1
recklessness	1
was	1
noticeable,	1
an	1
"in	1
for	1
a	1
penny,	1
in	1
for	1
a	1
pound--who	1
cares?"	1
spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
inevitable	1
small	1
talk,	1
instead	1
of	1
turning	1
on	1
the	1
weather	1
and	1
mutual	1
acquaintances,	1
now	1
turned	1
on	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
The	1
society	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
governor's	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
Voronezh.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
ladies	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
Nicholas'	1
Moscow	1
acquaintances,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
men	1
who	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
vie	1
with	1
the	1
cavalier	1
of	1
St.	1
George,	1
the	1
hussar	1
remount	1
officer,	1
the	1
good-natured	1
and	1
well-bred	1
Count	1
Rostov.	1
Among	1
the	1
men	1
was	1
an	1
Italian	1
prisoner,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army;	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
that	1
prisoner	1
enhanced	1
his	1
own	1
importance	1
as	1
a	1
Russian	1
hero.	1
The	1
Italian	1
was,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
a	1
war	1
trophy.	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
this,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
everyone	1
regarded	1
the	1
Italian	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
light,	1
and	1
he	1
treated	1
him	1
cordially	1
though	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
restraint.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
entered	1
in	1
his	1
hussar	1
uniform,	1
diffusing	1
around	1
him	1
a	1
fragrance	1
of	1
perfume	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
had	1
uttered	1
the	1
words	1
"better	1
late	1
than	1
never"	1
and	1
heard	1
them	1
repeated	1
several	1
times	1
by	1
others,	1
people	1
clustered	1
around	1
him;	1
all	1
eyes	1
turned	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
proper	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
province--that	1
of	1
a	1
universal	1
favorite:	1
a	1
very	1
pleasant	1
position,	1
and	1
intoxicatingly	1
so	1
after	1
his	1
long	1
privations.	1
At	1
posting	1
stations,	1
at	1
inns,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
landowner's	1
snuggery,	1
maidservants	1
had	1
been	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
notice,	1
and	1
here	1
too	1
at	1
the	1
governor's	1
party	1
there	1
were	1
(as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Nicholas)	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
number	1
of	1
pretty	1
young	1
women,	1
married	1
and	1
unmarried,	1
impatiently	1
awaiting	1
his	1
notice.	1
The	1
women	1
and	1
girls	1
flirted	1
with	1
him	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day,	1
the	1
people	1
concerned	1
themselves	1
to	1
get	1
this	1
fine	1
young	1
daredevil	1
of	1
an	1
hussar	1
married	1
and	1
settled	1
down.	1
Among	1
these	1
was	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
herself,	1
who	1
welcomed	1
Rostov	1
as	1
a	1
near	1
relative	1
and	1
called	1
him	1
"Nicholas."	1
	1
Catherine	1
Petrovna	1
did	1
actually	1
play	1
valses	1
and	1
the	1
ecossaise,	1
and	1
dancing	1
began	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
still	1
further	1
captivated	1
the	1
provincial	1
society	1
by	1
his	1
agility.	1
His	1
particularly	1
free	1
manner	1
of	1
dancing	1
even	1
surprised	1
them	1
all.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
himself	1
rather	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
danced	1
that	1
evening.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
danced	1
like	1
that	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
would	1
even	1
have	1
considered	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
manner	1
improper	1
and	1
in	1
bad	1
form,	1
but	1
here	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
astonish	1
them	1
all	1
by	1
something	1
unusual,	1
something	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
accept	1
as	1
the	1
regular	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
capital	1
though	1
new	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
provinces.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
evening	1
Nicholas	1
paid	1
attention	1
to	1
a	1
blue-eyed,	1
plump	1
and	1
pleasing	1
little	1
blonde,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
provincial	1
officials.	1
With	1
the	1
naive	1
conviction	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
mood	1
that	1
other	1
men's	1
wives	1
were	1
created	1
for	1
them,	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
lady's	1
side	1
and	1
treated	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
and	1
conspiratorial	1
style,	1
as	1
if,	1
without	1
speaking	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
knew	1
how	1
capitally	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
would	1
get	1
on	1
together.	1
The	1
husband,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
share	1
that	1
conviction	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
behave	1
morosely	1
with	1
Rostov.	1
But	1
the	1
latter's	1
good-natured	1
naivete	1
was	1
so	1
boundless	1
that	1
sometimes	1
even	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
yielded	1
to	1
Nicholas'	1
good	1
humor.	1
Toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
however,	1
as	1
the	1
wife's	1
face	1
grew	1
more	1
flushed	1
and	1
animated,	1
the	1
husband's	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
melancholy	1
and	1
solemn,	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
a	1
given	1
amount	1
of	1
animation	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
wife's	1
share	1
increased	1
the	1
husband's	1
diminished.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Nicholas	1
sat	1
leaning	1
slightly	1
forward	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
bending	1
closely	1
over	1
the	1
blonde	1
lady	1
and	1
paying	1
her	1
mythological	1
compliments	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
never	1
left	1
his	1
face.	1
Jauntily	1
shifting	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
their	1
tight	1
riding	1
breeches,	1
diffusing	1
an	1
odor	1
of	1
perfume,	1
and	1
admiring	1
his	1
partner,	1
himself,	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
outlines	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
their	1
well-fitting	1
Hessian	1
boots,	1
Nicholas	1
told	1
the	1
blonde	1
lady	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
lady	1
here	1
in	1
Voronezh.	1
	1
"Which	1
lady?"	1
	1
"A	1
charming	1
lady,	1
a	1
divine	1
one.	1
Her	1
eyes"	1
(Nicholas	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
partner)	1
"are	1
blue,	1
her	1
mouth	1
coral	1
and	1
ivory;	1
her	1
figure"	1
(he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
shoulders)	1
"like	1
Diana's...."	1
	1
The	1
husband	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
sullenly	1
asked	1
his	1
wife	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
about.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Nikita	1
Ivanych!"	1
cried	1
Nicholas,	1
rising	1
politely,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
Nikita	1
Ivanych	1
to	1
share	1
his	1
joke,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
elope	1
with	1
a	1
blonde	1
lady.	1
	1
The	1
husband	1
smiled	1
gloomily,	1
the	1
wife	1
gaily.	1
The	1
governor's	1
good-natured	1
wife	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
disapproval.	1
	1
"Anna	1
Ignatyevna	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
Nicholas,"	1
said	1
she,	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
name	1
so	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
at	1
once	1
understood	1
that	1
Anna	1
Ignatyevna	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
person.	1
"Come,	1
Nicholas!	1
You	1
know	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
call	1
you	1
so?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
Aunt.	1
Who	1
is	1
she?"	1
	1
"Anna	1
Ignatyevna	1
Malvintseva.	1
She	1
has	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
niece	1
how	1
you	1
rescued	1
her...	1
Can	1
you	1
guess?"	1
	1
"I	1
rescued	1
such	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
them!"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Her	1
niece,	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya.	1
She	1
is	1
here	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
with	1
her	1
aunt.	1
Oho!	1
How	1
you	1
blush.	1
Why,	1
are...?"	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
bit!	1
Please	1
don't,	1
Aunt!"	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
very	1
well!...	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
fellow	1
you	1
are!"	1
	1
The	1
governor's	1
wife	1
led	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
tall	1
and	1
very	1
stout	1
old	1
lady	1
with	1
a	1
blue	1
headdress,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
her	1
game	1
of	1
cards	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
personages	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
This	1
was	1
Malvintseva,	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
aunt	1
on	1
her	1
mother's	1
side,	1
a	1
rich,	1
childless	1
widow	1
who	1
always	1
lived	1
in	1
Voronezh.	1
When	1
Rostov	1
approached	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
settling	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
game.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and,	1
screwing	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
sternly,	1
continued	1
to	1
upbraid	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
won	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
"Very	1
pleased,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
she	1
then	1
said,	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
"Pray	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
me."	1
	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
about	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
late	1
father,	1
whom	1
Malvintseva	1
had	1
evidently	1
not	1
liked,	1
and	1
having	1
asked	1
what	1
Nicholas	1
knew	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
also	1
was	1
evidently	1
no	1
favorite	1
of	1
hers,	1
the	1
important	1
old	1
lady	1
dismissed	1
Nicholas	1
after	1
repeating	1
her	1
invitation	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
blushed	1
again	1
as	1
he	1
bowed.	1
At	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
shyness	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
fear,	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
parted	1
from	1
Malvintseva	1
Nicholas	1
wished	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
dancing,	1
but	1
the	1
governor's	1
little	1
wife	1
placed	1
her	1
plump	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
sleeve	1
and,	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
him,	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
sitting	1
room,	1
from	1
which	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
there	1
immediately	1
withdrew	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
way.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
began	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
kind	1
little	1
face,	1
"that	1
really	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
match	1
for	1
you:	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
me	1
to	1
arrange	1
it?"	1
	1
"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
Aunt?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
princess.	1
Catherine	1
Petrovna	1
speaks	1
of	1
Lily,	1
but	1
I	1
say,	1
no--the	1
princess!	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
it?	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
mother	1
will	1
be	1
grateful	1
to	1
me.	1
What	1
a	1
charming	1
girl	1
she	1
is,	1
really!	1
And	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
so	1
plain,	1
either."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas	1
as	1
if	1
offended	1
at	1
the	1
idea.	1
"As	1
befits	1
a	1
soldier,	1
Aunt,	1
I	1
don't	1
force	1
myself	1
on	1
anyone	1
or	1
refuse	1
anything,"	1
he	1
said	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
remember,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
joke!"	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
not!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
said	1
as	1
if	1
talking	1
to	1
herself.	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
among	1
other	1
things	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
attentive	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
blonde.	1
One	1
is	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
husband,	1
really...."	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
we	1
are	1
good	1
friends	1
with	1
him,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
in	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
heart;	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
enter	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
a	1
pastime	1
so	1
pleasant	1
to	1
himself	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
pleasant	1
to	1
someone	1
else.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
nonsense	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife!"	1
thought	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly	1
at	1
supper.	1
"She	1
will	1
really	1
begin	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
match...	1
and	1
Sonya...?"	1
And	1
on	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife,	1
when	1
she	1
again	1
smilingly	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Well	1
then,	1
remember!"	1
he	1
drew	1
her	1
aside.	1
	1
"But	1
see	1
here,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
Aunt..."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
my	1
dear?	1
Come,	1
let's	1
sit	1
down	1
here,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
a	1
desire	1
and	1
need	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
most	1
intimate	1
thoughts	1
(which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
told	1
to	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
sister,	1
or	1
his	1
friend)	1
to	1
this	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
stranger.	1
When	1
he	1
afterwards	1
recalled	1
that	1
impulse	1
to	1
unsolicited	1
and	1
inexplicable	1
frankness	1
which	1
had	1
very	1
important	1
results	1
for	1
him,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him--as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
everyone	1
in	1
such	1
cases--that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
some	1
silly	1
whim	1
that	1
seized	1
him:	1
yet	1
that	1
burst	1
of	1
frankness,	1
together	1
with	1
other	1
trifling	1
events,	1
had	1
immense	1
consequences	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
family.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
Aunt,	1
Mamma	1
has	1
long	1
wanted	1
me	1
to	1
marry	1
an	1
heiress,	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
idea	1
of	1
marrying	1
for	1
money	1
is	1
repugnant	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
I	1
understand,"	1
said	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife.	1
	1
"But	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya--that's	1
another	1
matter.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
I	1
like	1
her	1
very	1
much,	1
I	1
feel	1
drawn	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
then,	1
after	1
I	1
met	1
her	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances--so	1
strangely,	1
the	1
idea	1
often	1
occurred	1
to	1
me:	1
'This	1
is	1
fate.'	1
Especially	1
if	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
Mamma	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
before,	1
somehow	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
happened	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
meet.	1
And	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
sister	1
Natasha	1
was	1
engaged	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
marrying	1
her.	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
happen	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
meet	1
her	1
just	1
when	1
Natasha's	1
engagement	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
off...	1
and	1
then	1
everything...	1
So	1
you	1
see...	1
I	1
never	1
told	1
this	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
never	1
will,	1
only	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
governor's	1
wife	1
pressed	1
his	1
elbow	1
gratefully.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
Sonya,	1
my	1
cousin?	1
I	1
love	1
her,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
marry	1
her,	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
so....	1
So	1
you	1
see	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
about-"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
incoherently	1
and	1
blushing.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
boy,	1
what	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it!	1
You	1
know	1
Sonya	1
has	1
nothing	1
and	1
you	1
yourself	1
say	1
your	1
Papa's	1
affairs	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
way.	1
And	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
mother?	1
It	1
would	1
kill	1
her,	1
that's	1
one	1
thing.	1
And	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
Sonya--if	1
she's	1
a	1
girl	1
with	1
a	1
heart?	1
Your	1
mother	1
in	1
despair,	1
and	1
you	1
all	1
ruined....	1
No,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
and	1
Sonya	1
ought	1
to	1
understand	1
that."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
remained	1
silent.	1
It	1
comforted	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
these	1
arguments.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same,	1
Aunt,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,"	1
he	1
rejoined	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause.	1
"Besides,	1
would	1
the	1
princess	1
have	1
me?	1
And	1
besides,	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
mourning.	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
think	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
don't	1
suppose	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
you	1
married	1
at	1
once?	1
There	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
right	1
way	1
of	1
doing	1
things,"	1
replied	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
matchmaker	1
you	1
are,	1
Aunt..."	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
kissing	1
her	1
plump	1
little	1
hand.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
Moscow	1
after	1
her	1
meeting	1
with	1
Rostov,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
found	1
her	1
nephew	1
there	1
with	1
his	1
tutor,	1
and	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
giving	1
her	1
instructions	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
her	1
Aunt	1
Malvintseva	1
at	1
Voronezh.	1
That	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
temptation	1
which	1
had	1
tormented	1
her	1
during	1
her	1
father's	1
illness,	1
since	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
especially	1
since	1
her	1
meeting	1
with	1
Rostov	1
was	1
smothered	1
by	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
journey,	1
anxiety	1
about	1
her	1
brother,	1
settling	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
house,	1
meeting	1
new	1
people,	1
and	1
attending	1
to	1
her	1
nephew's	1
education.	1
She	1
was	1
sad.	1
Now,	1
after	1
a	1
month	1
passed	1
in	1
quiet	1
surroundings,	1
she	1
felt	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
deeply	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
which	1
was	1
associated	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
with	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
Russia.	1
She	1
was	1
agitated	1
and	1
incessantly	1
tortured	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
dangers	1
to	1
which	1
her	1
brother,	1
the	1
only	1
intimate	1
person	1
now	1
remaining	1
to	1
her,	1
was	1
exposed.	1
She	1
was	1
worried	1
too	1
about	1
her	1
nephew's	1
education	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
herself	1
incompetent,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
she	1
felt	1
at	1
peace--a	1
peace	1
arising	1
from	1
consciousness	1
of	1
having	1
stifled	1
those	1
personal	1
dreams	1
and	1
hopes	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
awakening	1
within	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
related	1
to	1
her	1
meeting	1
with	1
Rostov.	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
her	1
party	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
Malvintseva	1
and,	1
after	1
discussing	1
her	1
plan	1
with	1
the	1
aunt,	1
remarked	1
that	1
though	1
under	1
present	1
circumstances	1
a	1
formal	1
betrothal	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of,	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
together	1
and	1
could	1
get	1
to	1
know	1
one	1
another.	1
Malvintseva	1
expressed	1
approval,	1
and	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
Rostov	1
in	1
Mary's	1
presence,	1
praising	1
him	1
and	1
telling	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
blushed	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
name	1
was	1
mentioned.	1
But	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
experienced	1
a	1
painful	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
joyful	1
feeling--her	1
mental	1
tranquillity	1
was	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
desires,	1
doubts,	1
self-reproach,	1
and	1
hopes	1
reawoke.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
two	1
days	1
that	1
elapsed	1
before	1
Rostov	1
called,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
continually	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
behave	1
to	1
him.	1
First	1
she	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
aunt--that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
proper	1
for	1
her,	1
in	1
her	1
deep	1
mourning,	1
to	1
receive	1
visitors;	1
then	1
she	1
thought	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
rude	1
after	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
her;	1
then	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
aunt	1
and	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
had	1
intentions	1
concerning	1
herself	1
and	1
Rostov--their	1
looks	1
and	1
words	1
at	1
times	1
seemed	1
to	1
confirm	1
this	1
supposition--then	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1
that	1
only	1
she,	1
with	1
her	1
sinful	1
nature,	1
could	1
think	1
this	1
of	1
them:	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
situated	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
while	1
still	1
wearing	1
deep	1
mourning,	1
such	1
matchmaking	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
memory.	1
Assuming	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
imagined	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
these	1
words	1
sometimes	1
seemed	1
undeservedly	1
cold	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
mean	1
too	1
much.	1
More	1
than	1
anything	1
she	1
feared	1
lest	1
the	1
confusion	1
she	1
felt	1
might	1
overwhelm	1
her	1
and	1
betray	1
her	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
on	1
Sunday	1
after	1
church	1
the	1
footman	1
announced	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
that	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
had	1
called,	1
the	1
princess	1
showed	1
no	1
confusion,	1
only	1
a	1
slight	1
blush	1
suffused	1
her	1
cheeks	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
radiant	1
light.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
met	1
him,	1
Aunt?"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
calm	1
voice,	1
unable	1
herself	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
outwardly	1
so	1
calm	1
and	1
natural.	1
	1
When	1
Rostov	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
the	1
princess	1
dropped	1
her	1
eyes	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
visitor	1
time	1
to	1
greet	1
her	1
aunt,	1
and	1
then	1
just	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
met	1
his	1
look	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes.	1
With	1
a	1
movement	1
full	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
grace	1
she	1
half	1
rose	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure,	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
slender,	1
delicate	1
hand	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
new	1
deep	1
womanly	1
notes	1
vibrated.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
looked	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
bewildered	1
surprise.	1
Herself	1
a	1
consummate	1
coquette,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
maneuvered	1
better	1
on	1
meeting	1
a	1
man	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
attract.	1
	1
"Either	1
black	1
is	1
particularly	1
becoming	1
to	1
her	1
or	1
she	1
really	1
has	1
greatly	1
improved	1
without	1
my	1
having	1
noticed	1
it.	1
And	1
above	1
all,	1
what	1
tact	1
and	1
grace!"	1
thought	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
Had	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
been	1
capable	1
of	1
reflection	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
surprised	1
than	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
at	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
herself.	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
recognized	1
that	1
dear,	1
loved	1
face,	1
a	1
new	1
life	1
force	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
compelled	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
act	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
will.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
Rostov	1
entered,	1
her	1
face	1
became	1
suddenly	1
transformed.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
light	1
had	1
been	1
kindled	1
in	1
a	1
carved	1
and	1
painted	1
lantern	1
and	1
the	1
intricate,	1
skillful,	1
artistic	1
work	1
on	1
its	1
sides,	1
that	1
previously	1
seemed	1
dark,	1
coarse,	1
and	1
meaningless,	1
was	1
suddenly	1
shown	1
up	1
in	1
unexpected	1
and	1
striking	1
beauty.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
all	1
that	1
pure,	1
spiritual,	1
inward	1
travail	1
through	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
surface.	1
All	1
her	1
inward	1
labor,	1
her	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
herself,	1
her	1
sufferings,	1
her	1
strivings	1
after	1
goodness,	1
her	1
meekness,	1
love,	1
and	1
self-sacrifice--all	1
this	1
now	1
shone	1
in	1
those	1
radiant	1
eyes,	1
in	1
her	1
delicate	1
smile,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
trait	1
of	1
her	1
gentle	1
face.	1
	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
clearly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
whole	1
life.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
being	1
before	1
him	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
from,	1
and	1
better	1
than,	1
anyone	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
before,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
better	1
than	1
himself.	1
	1
Their	1
conversation	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
unimportant.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
war,	1
and	1
like	1
everyone	1
else	1
unconsciously	1
exaggerated	1
their	1
sorrow	1
about	1
it;	1
they	1
spoke	1
of	1
their	1
last	1
meeting--Nicholas	1
trying	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject--they	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
governor's	1
kind	1
wife,	1
of	1
Nicholas'	1
relations,	1
and	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary's.	1
	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
her	1
brother,	1
diverting	1
the	1
conversation	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
her	1
aunt	1
mentioned	1
Andrew.	1
Evidently	1
she	1
could	1
speak	1
of	1
Russia's	1
misfortunes	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
artificiality,	1
but	1
her	1
brother	1
was	1
too	1
near	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
she	1
neither	1
could	1
nor	1
would	1
speak	1
lightly	1
of	1
him.	1
Nicholas	1
noticed	1
this,	1
as	1
he	1
noticed	1
every	1
shade	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
character	1
with	1
an	1
observation	1
unusual	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
everything	1
confirmed	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
quite	1
unusual	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
being.	1
Nicholas	1
blushed	1
and	1
was	1
confused	1
when	1
people	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
princess	1
(as	1
she	1
did	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
mentioned)	1
and	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
her,	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
he	1
felt	1
quite	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
said	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
prepared,	1
but	1
what,	1
quite	1
appropriately,	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
moment.	1
	1
When	1
a	1
pause	1
occurred	1
during	1
his	1
short	1
visit,	1
Nicholas,	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
children,	1
turned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
little	1
son,	1
caressing	1
him	1
and	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
boy	1
on	1
his	1
knee,	1
played	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
With	1
a	1
softened,	1
happy,	1
timid	1
look	1
she	1
watched	1
the	1
boy	1
she	1
loved	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved.	1
Nicholas	1
also	1
noticed	1
that	1
look	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
understanding	1
it,	1
flushed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
boy	1
with	1
good	1
natured	1
playfulness.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
mourning	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
society,	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
the	1
proper	1
thing	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
again;	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
matchmaking,	1
passing	1
on	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
flattering	1
things	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
said	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
vice	1
versa,	1
and	1
insisting	1
on	1
his	1
declaring	1
himself	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
she	1
arranged	1
a	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
bishop's	1
house	1
before	1
Mass.	1
	1
Though	1
Rostov	1
told	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
declaration	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
As	1
at	1
Tilsit	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
what	1
everybody	1
considered	1
right	1
was	1
right,	1
so	1
now,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
but	1
sincere	1
struggle	1
between	1
his	1
effort	1
to	1
arrange	1
his	1
life	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
sense	1
of	1
justice,	1
and	1
in	1
obedient	1
submission	1
to	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
chose	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
yielded	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
he	1
felt	1
irresistibly	1
carrying	1
him	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
where.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
after	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Sonya	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
what	1
he	1
deemed	1
base	1
to	1
declare	1
his	1
feelings	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
And	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
act	1
basely.	1
But	1
he	1
also	1
knew	1
(or	1
rather	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart)	1
that	1
by	1
resigning	1
himself	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
circumstances	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
guiding	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
doing	1
nothing	1
wrong,	1
but	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
very	1
important--more	1
important	1
than	1
anything	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
After	1
meeting	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
though	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
went	1
on	1
externally	1
as	1
before,	1
all	1
his	1
former	1
amusements	1
lost	1
their	1
charm	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
often	1
thought	1
about	1
her.	1
But	1
he	1
never	1
thought	1
about	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
without	1
exception	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
society,	1
nor	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
rapturously,	1
thought	1
about	1
Sonya.	1
He	1
had	1
pictured	1
each	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
ladies	1
as	1
almost	1
all	1
honest-hearted	1
young	1
men	1
do,	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
a	1
possible	1
wife,	1
adapting	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
married	1
life:	1
a	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
his	1
wife	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table,	1
his	1
wife's	1
carriage,	1
little	1
ones,	1
Mamma	1
and	1
Papa,	1
their	1
relations	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
so	1
on--and	1
these	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
pleasure.	1
But	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
engaged,	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
picture	1
anything	1
of	1
future	1
married	1
life.	1
If	1
he	1
tried,	1
his	1
pictures	1
seemed	1
incongruous	1
and	1
false.	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
afraid.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
The	1
dreadful	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
of	1
our	1
losses	1
in	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded,	1
and	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
terrible	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Moscow	1
reached	1
Voronezh	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
September.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
having	1
learned	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
wound	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
Gazette	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
definite	1
news	1
of	1
him,	1
prepared	1
(so	1
Nicholas	1
heard,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
again	1
himself)	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
Rostov	1
was	1
not	1
seized	1
with	1
despair,	1
anger,	1
the	1
desire	1
for	1
vengeance,	1
or	1
any	1
feeling	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
but	1
everything	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
dull	1
and	1
tiresome,	1
and	1
he	1
experienced	1
an	1
indefinite	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
awkwardness.	1
The	1
conversations	1
he	1
heard	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
insincere;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
judge	1
all	1
these	1
affairs	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
would	1
everything	1
again	1
become	1
clear	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
finish	1
buying	1
the	1
horses,	1
and	1
often	1
became	1
unreasonably	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
servant	1
and	1
squadron	1
quartermaster.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
his	1
departure	1
a	1
special	1
thanksgiving,	1
at	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
present,	1
was	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
cathedral	1
for	1
the	1
Russian	1
victory.	1
He	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
governor	1
and	1
held	1
himself	1
with	1
military	1
decorum	1
through	1
the	1
service,	1
meditating	1
on	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
subjects.	1
When	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
beckoned	1
him	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
seen	1
the	1
princess?"	1
she	1
asked,	1
indicating	1
with	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
lady	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side,	1
beyond	1
the	1
choir.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
immediately	1
recognized	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
profile	1
he	1
saw	1
under	1
her	1
bonnet	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
solicitude,	1
timidity,	1
and	1
pity	1
that	1
immediately	1
overcame	1
him.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
evidently	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her	1
thoughts,	1
was	1
crossing	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
before	1
leaving	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
surprise.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
face	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
before,	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
general	1
expression	1
of	1
refined,	1
inner,	1
spiritual	1
labor,	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
differently	1
lit	1
up.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
pathetic	1
expression	1
of	1
sorrow,	1
prayer,	1
and	1
hope	1
in	1
it.	1
As	1
had	1
occurred	1
before	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
present,	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
prompted	1
by	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
and	1
not	1
asking	1
himself	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
proper	1
to	1
address	1
her	1
here	1
in	1
church,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
trouble	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
a	1
vivid	1
glow	1
kindled	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
lighting	1
up	1
both	1
her	1
sorrow	1
and	1
her	1
joy.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
Princess,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"It	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
your	1
brother,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Nikolievich,	1
were	1
not	1
living,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
once	1
announced	1
in	1
the	1
Gazette,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
colonel."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
not	1
grasping	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying,	1
but	1
cheered	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
regretful	1
sympathy	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
so	1
many	1
cases	1
of	1
a	1
splinter	1
wound"	1
(the	1
Gazette	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
shell)	1
"either	1
proving	1
fatal	1
at	1
once	1
or	1
being	1
very	1
slight,"	1
continued	1
Nicholas.	1
"We	1
must	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
dread..."	1
she	1
began	1
and,	1
prevented	1
by	1
agitation	1
from	1
finishing,	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
movement	1
as	1
graceful	1
as	1
everything	1
she	1
did	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
and,	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
gratefully,	1
went	1
out,	1
following	1
her	1
aunt.	1
	1
That	1
evening	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out,	1
but	1
stayed	1
at	1
home	1
to	1
settle	1
some	1
accounts	1
with	1
the	1
horse	1
dealers.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
that	1
business	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere	1
but	1
still	1
too	1
early	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
reflecting	1
on	1
his	1
life,	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
rarely	1
did.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
agreeable	1
impression	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
her	1
in	1
Smolensk	1
province.	1
His	1
having	1
encountered	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
exceptional	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
having	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
mentioned	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
match,	1
had	1
drawn	1
his	1
particular	1
attention	1
to	1
her.	1
When	1
he	1
met	1
her	1
again	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
made	1
on	1
him	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
pleasing	1
but	1
powerful.	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
peculiar	1
moral	1
beauty	1
he	1
observed	1
in	1
her	1
at	1
this	1
time.	1
He	1
was,	1
however,	1
preparing	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
entered	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thus	1
depriving	1
himself	1
of	1
chances	1
of	1
meeting	1
her.	1
But	1
that	1
day's	1
encounter	1
in	1
church	1
had,	1
he	1
felt,	1
sunk	1
deeper	1
than	1
was	1
desirable	1
for	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind.	1
That	1
pale,	1
sad,	1
refined	1
face,	1
that	1
radiant	1
look,	1
those	1
gentle	1
graceful	1
gestures,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
tender	1
sorrow	1
expressed	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
features	1
agitated	1
him	1
and	1
evoked	1
his	1
sympathy.	1
In	1
men	1
Rostov	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
higher	1
spiritual	1
life	1
(that	1
was	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
Prince	1
Andrew)	1
and	1
he	1
referred	1
to	1
it	1
contemptuously	1
as	1
philosophy	1
and	1
dreaminess,	1
but	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
very	1
sorrow	1
which	1
revealed	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
spiritual	1
world	1
foreign	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
an	1
irresistible	1
attraction.	1
	1
"She	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
wonderful	1
woman.	1
A	1
real	1
angel!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Why	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
free?	1
Why	1
was	1
I	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
with	1
Sonya?"	1
And	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
compared	1
the	1
two:	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
spirituality	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
other--a	1
spirituality	1
he	1
himself	1
lacked	1
and	1
therefore	1
valued	1
most	1
highly.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
picture	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
were	1
he	1
free.	1
How	1
he	1
would	1
propose	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
become	1
his	1
wife.	1
But	1
no,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
that.	1
He	1
felt	1
awed,	1
and	1
no	1
clear	1
picture	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
future	1
with	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
thought	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
picture	1
a	1
future	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
her	1
but	1
simply	1
loved	1
her.	1
	1
Reveries	1
about	1
Sonya	1
had	1
had	1
something	1
merry	1
and	1
playful	1
in	1
them,	1
but	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
always	1
difficult	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
frightening.	1
	1
"How	1
she	1
prayed!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
her	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
prayer.	1
Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
prayer	1
that	1
moves	1
mountains,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
her	1
prayer	1
will	1
be	1
answered.	1
Why	1
don't	1
I	1
pray	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
want?"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
thought.	1
"What	1
do	1
I	1
want?	1
To	1
be	1
free,	1
released	1
from	1
Sonya...	1
She	1
was	1
right,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
remembering	1
what	1
the	1
governor's	1
wife	1
had	1
said:	1
"Nothing	1
but	1
misfortune	1
can	1
come	1
of	1
marrying	1
Sonya.	1
Muddles,	1
grief	1
for	1
Mamma...	1
business	1
difficulties...	1
muddles,	1
terrible	1
muddles!	1
Besides,	1
I	1
don't	1
love	1
her--not	1
as	1
I	1
should.	1
O,	1
God!	1
release	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
dreadful,	1
inextricable	1
position!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
pray.	1
"Yes,	1
prayer	1
can	1
move	1
mountains,	1
but	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
faith	1
and	1
not	1
pray	1
as	1
Natasha	1
and	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
as	1
children,	1
that	1
the	1
snow	1
might	1
turn	1
into	1
sugar--	1
and	1
then	1
run	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
so.	1
No,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
praying	1
for	1
trifles	1
now,"	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
pipe	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
and	1
folding	1
his	1
hands	1
placed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
icon.	1
Softened	1
by	1
memories	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
pray	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
Tears	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
Lavrushka	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
some	1
papers.	1
	1
"Blockhead!	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
in	1
without	1
being	1
called?"	1
cried	1
Nicholas,	1
quickly	1
changing	1
his	1
attitude.	1
	1
"From	1
the	1
governor,"	1
said	1
Lavrushka	1
in	1
a	1
sleepy	1
voice.	1
"A	1
courier	1
has	1
arrived	1
and	1
there's	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
right,	1
thanks.	1
You	1
can	1
go!"	1
	1
Nicholas	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
letters,	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
Sonya.	1
He	1
recognized	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
handwriting	1
and	1
opened	1
Sonya's	1
first.	1
He	1
had	1
read	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
pale	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
opened	1
wide	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
joy.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
possible!"	1
he	1
cried	1
aloud.	1
	1
Unable	1
to	1
sit	1
still	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
holding	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
reading	1
it.	1
He	1
glanced	1
through	1
it,	1
then	1
read	1
it	1
again,	1
and	1
then	1
again,	1
and	1
standing	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
stretching	1
out	1
his	1
hands,	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
wide	1
open	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed.	1
What	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
praying	1
for	1
with	1
confidence	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
hear	1
him	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
astonished	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
unexpected,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
happened	1
so	1
quickly	1
proved	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
God	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
prayed,	1
but	1
by	1
some	1
ordinary	1
coincidence.	1
	1
This	1
unexpected	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Nicholas,	1
quite	1
voluntary	1
letter	1
from	1
Sonya	1
freed	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
knot	1
that	1
fettered	1
him	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
there	1
had	1
seemed	1
no	1
escape.	1
She	1
wrote	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
unfortunate	1
events--	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
Moscow	1
property--and	1
the	1
countess'	1
repeatedly	1
expressed	1
wish	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
should	1
marry	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
silence	1
and	1
coldness	1
of	1
late,	1
had	1
all	1
combined	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
decide	1
to	1
release	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
promise	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
completely	1
free.	1
	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
painful	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
sorrow	1
or	1
discord	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
(she	1
wrote),	1
and	1
my	1
love	1
has	1
no	1
aim	1
but	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
those	1
I	1
love;	1
so,	1
Nicholas,	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
consider	1
yourself	1
free,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
assured	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
everything,	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
love	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
does	1
	1
Your	1
Sonya	1
	1
Both	1
letters	1
were	1
written	1
from	1
Troitsa.	1
The	1
other,	1
from	1
the	1
countess,	1
described	1
their	1
last	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
their	1
departure,	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
property.	1
In	1
this	1
letter	1
the	1
countess	1
also	1
mentioned	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
wounded	1
traveling	1
with	1
them;	1
his	1
state	1
was	1
very	1
critical,	1
but	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
more	1
hope.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
nursing	1
him.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Nicholas	1
took	1
his	1
mother's	1
letter	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Neither	1
he	1
nor	1
she	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
what	1
"Natasha	1
nursing	1
him"	1
might	1
mean,	1
but	1
thanks	1
to	1
this	1
letter	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly	1
became	1
almost	1
as	1
intimate	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
relations.	1
	1
The	1
following	1
day	1
he	1
saw	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
off	1
on	1
her	1
journey	1
to	1
Yaroslavl,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
left	1
to	1
rejoin	1
his	1
regiment.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Sonya's	1
letter	1
written	1
from	1
Troitsa,	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
as	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
Nicholas'	1
prayer,	1
was	1
prompted	1
by	1
this:	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
getting	1
Nicholas	1
married	1
to	1
an	1
heiress	1
occupied	1
the	1
old	1
countess'	1
mind	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
obstacle	1
to	1
this	1
happening,	1
and	1
Sonya's	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
countess'	1
house	1
had	1
grown	1
harder	1
and	1
harder,	1
especially	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Nicholas	1
telling	1
of	1
his	1
meeting	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
Bogucharovo.	1
The	1
countess	1
let	1
no	1
occasion	1
slip	1
of	1
making	1
humiliating	1
or	1
cruel	1
allusions	1
to	1
Sonya.	1
	1
But	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
they	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
moved	1
and	1
excited	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
she	1
called	1
Sonya	1
to	1
her	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
reproaching	1
and	1
making	1
demands	1
on	1
her,	1
tearfully	1
implored	1
her	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
herself	1
and	1
repay	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
family	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
her	1
by	1
breaking	1
off	1
her	1
engagement	1
with	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
till	1
you	1
promise	1
me	1
this."	1
	1
Sonya	1
burst	1
into	1
hysterical	1
tears	1
and	1
replied	1
through	1
her	1
sobs	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
and	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
anything,	1
but	1
gave	1
no	1
actual	1
promise	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
decide	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
her.	1
She	1
must	1
sacrifice	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
family	1
that	1
had	1
reared	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
up.	1
To	1
sacrifice	1
herself	1
for	1
others	1
was	1
Sonya's	1
habit.	1
Her	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
only	1
by	1
sacrifice	1
could	1
she	1
show	1
her	1
worth,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
this	1
and	1
loved	1
doing	1
it.	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
acts	1
of	1
self-sacrifice	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
happily	1
conscious	1
that	1
they	1
raised	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
esteem	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
so	1
made	1
her	1
more	1
worthy	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
whom	1
she	1
loved	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
constituted	1
the	1
whole	1
reward	1
for	1
her	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
she	1
felt	1
bitterness	1
against	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
benefactors	1
only	1
to	1
torture	1
her	1
the	1
more	1
painfully;	1
she	1
felt	1
jealous	1
of	1
Natasha	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
experienced	1
anything	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
had	1
never	1
needed	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
herself,	1
but	1
made	1
others	1
sacrifice	1
themselves	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
beloved	1
by	1
everybody.	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
Sonya	1
felt	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
pure,	1
quiet	1
love	1
for	1
Nicholas	1
a	1
passionate	1
feeling	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
grow	1
up	1
which	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
principle,	1
virtue,	1
or	1
religion.	1
Under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
this	1
feeling	1
Sonya,	1
whose	1
life	1
of	1
dependence	1
had	1
taught	1
her	1
involuntarily	1
to	1
be	1
secretive,	1
having	1
answered	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
vague	1
general	1
terms,	1
avoided	1
talking	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
she	1
should	1
see	1
Nicholas,	1
not	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
at	1
that	1
meeting	1
to	1
bind	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
forever.	1
	1
The	1
bustle	1
and	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
last	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow	1
stifled	1
the	1
gloomy	1
thoughts	1
that	1
oppressed	1
Sonya.	1
She	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
escape	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
practical	1
activity.	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
presence	1
in	1
their	1
house,	1
despite	1
her	1
sincere	1
pity	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
Natasha,	1
she	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
joyful	1
and	1
superstitious	1
feeling	1
that	1
God	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
separated	1
from	1
Nicholas.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
Natasha	1
loved	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
him.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
being	1
thrown	1
together	1
again	1
under	1
such	1
terrible	1
circumstances	1
they	1
would	1
again	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
then	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
marry	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
within	1
the	1
prohibited	1
degrees	1
of	1
affinity.	1
Despite	1
all	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
during	1
those	1
last	1
days	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
journey,	1
this	1
feeling	1
that	1
Providence	1
was	1
intervening	1
in	1
her	1
personal	1
affairs	1
cheered	1
Sonya.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
Troitsa	1
monastery	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
first	1
broke	1
their	1
journey	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day.	1
	1
Three	1
large	1
rooms	1
were	1
assigned	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
monastery	1
hostelry,	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
The	1
wounded	1
man	1
was	1
much	1
better	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
sat	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
respectfully	1
conversing	1
with	1
the	1
prior,	1
who	1
was	1
calling	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
old	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
benefactors	1
of	1
the	1
monastery.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
there	1
too,	1
tormented	1
by	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
talking	1
about.	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
voices	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
That	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
Natasha	1
came	1
out,	1
looking	1
excited.	1
Not	1
noticing	1
the	1
monk,	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
greet	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
drawing	1
back	1
the	1
wide	1
sleeve	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
arm,	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Sonya	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
about?	1
Come	1
here!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Natasha	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
monk	1
for	1
his	1
blessing,	1
and	1
he	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
aid	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
His	1
saint.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
prior	1
withdrew,	1
Natasha	1
took	1
her	1
friend	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
unoccupied	1
room.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
will	1
he	1
live?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"Sonya,	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
how	1
unhappy!...	1
Sonya,	1
dovey,	1
everything	1
is	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be.	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
lives!	1
He	1
cannot...	1
because...	1
because...	1
of"	1
and	1
Natasha	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
"Yes!	1
I	1
knew	1
it!	1
Thank	1
God!"	1
murmured	1
Sonya.	1
"He	1
will	1
live."	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
agitated	1
than	1
her	1
friend	1
by	1
the	1
latter's	1
fear	1
and	1
grief	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
personal	1
feelings	1
which	1
she	1
shared	1
with	1
no	1
one.	1
Sobbing,	1
she	1
kissed	1
and	1
comforted	1
Natasha.	1
"If	1
only	1
he	1
lives!"	1
she	1
thought.	1
Having	1
wept,	1
talked,	1
and	1
wiped	1
away	1
their	1
tears,	1
the	1
two	1
friends	1
went	1
together	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
opened	1
it	1
cautiously	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
Sonya	1
standing	1
beside	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
half-open	1
door.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
lying	1
raised	1
high	1
on	1
three	1
pillows.	1
His	1
pale	1
face	1
was	1
calm,	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
regular	1
breathing.	1
	1
"O,	1
Natasha!"	1
Sonya	1
suddenly	1
almost	1
screamed,	1
catching	1
her	1
companion's	1
arm	1
and	1
stepping	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"What?	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"It's	1
that,	1
that..."	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
face	1
and	1
trembling	1
lips.	1
	1
Natasha	1
softly	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
Sonya	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
not	1
yet	1
understanding	1
what	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
telling	1
her.	1
	1
"You	1
remember,"	1
said	1
Sonya	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
and	1
frightened	1
expression.	1
"You	1
remember	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
for	1
you...	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
at	1
Christmas?	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
what	1
I	1
saw?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes!"	1
cried	1
Natasha	1
opening	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide,	1
and	1
vaguely	1
recalling	1
that	1
Sonya	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
something	1
about	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
lying	1
down.	1
	1
"You	1
remember?"	1
Sonya	1
went	1
on.	1
"I	1
saw	1
it	1
then	1
and	1
told	1
everybody,	1
you	1
and	1
Dunyasha.	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
lying	1
on	1
a	1
bed,"	1
said	1
she,	1
making	1
a	1
gesture	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
lifted	1
finger	1
at	1
each	1
detail,	1
"and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
was	1
covered	1
just	1
with	1
a	1
pink	1
quilt,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
folded,"	1
she	1
concluded,	1
convincing	1
herself	1
that	1
the	1
details	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
seen	1
were	1
exactly	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
mirror.	1
	1
She	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
seen	1
nothing	1
then	1
but	1
had	1
mentioned	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head,	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
invented	1
then	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
real	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
recollection.	1
She	1
not	1
only	1
remembered	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
then	1
said--that	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
smiled	1
and	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
something	1
red--but	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
then	1
seen	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
pink	1
quilt	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
it	1
really	1
was	1
pink!"	1
cried	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
now	1
thought	1
she	1
too	1
remembered	1
the	1
word	1
pink	1
being	1
used,	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
mysterious	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
prediction.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean?"	1
she	1
added	1
meditatively.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
so	1
strange,"	1
replied	1
Sonya,	1
clutching	1
at	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rang	1
and	1
Natasha	1
went	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
Sonya,	1
feeling	1
unusually	1
excited	1
and	1
touched,	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
thinking	1
about	1
the	1
strangeness	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
	1
They	1
had	1
an	1
opportunity	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
send	1
letters	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
writing	1
to	1
her	1
son.	1
	1
"Sonya!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
raising	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
her	1
letter	1
as	1
her	1
niece	1
passed,	1
"Sonya,	1
won't	1
you	1
write	1
to	1
Nicholas?"	1
She	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
soft,	1
tremulous	1
voice,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
weary	1
eyes	1
that	1
looked	1
over	1
her	1
spectacles	1
Sonya	1
read	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
countess	1
meant	1
to	1
convey	1
with	1
these	1
words.	1
Those	1
eyes	1
expressed	1
entreaty,	1
shame	1
at	1
having	1
to	1
ask,	1
fear	1
of	1
a	1
refusal,	1
and	1
readiness	1
for	1
relentless	1
hatred	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
such	1
refusal.	1
	1
Sonya	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
and,	1
kneeling	1
down,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
will	1
write,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
softened,	1
excited,	1
and	1
touched	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
that	1
day,	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
mysterious	1
fulfillment	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
seen	1
of	1
her	1
vision.	1
Now	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
renewal	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
relations	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
would	1
prevent	1
Nicholas	1
from	1
marrying	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
she	1
was	1
joyfully	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
return	1
of	1
that	1
self-sacrificing	1
spirit	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
loved	1
to	1
live.	1
So	1
with	1
a	1
joyful	1
consciousness	1
of	1
performing	1
a	1
magnanimous	1
deed--interrupted	1
several	1
times	1
by	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
dimmed	1
her	1
velvety	1
black	1
eyes--she	1
wrote	1
that	1
touching	1
letter	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
amazed	1
Nicholas.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
and	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
arrested	1
Pierre	1
treated	1
him	1
with	1
hostility	1
but	1
yet	1
with	1
respect,	1
in	1
the	1
guardhouse	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taken.	1
In	1
their	1
attitude	1
toward	1
him	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
felt	1
both	1
uncertainty	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
he	1
might	1
be--perhaps	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
person--and	1
hostility	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
their	1
recent	1
personal	1
conflict	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
guard	1
was	1
relieved	1
next	1
morning,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
new	1
guard--both	1
officers	1
and	1
men--he	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
interesting	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
his	1
captors;	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
the	1
guard	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
in	1
this	1
big,	1
stout	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
peasant	1
coat	1
the	1
vigorous	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
fought	1
so	1
desperately	1
with	1
the	1
marauder	1
and	1
the	1
convoy	1
and	1
had	1
uttered	1
those	1
solemn	1
words	1
about	1
saving	1
a	1
child;	1
they	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
only	1
No.	1
17	1
of	1
the	1
captured	1
Russians,	1
arrested	1
and	1
detained	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
by	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Higher	1
Command.	1
If	1
they	1
noticed	1
anything	1
remarkable	1
about	1
Pierre,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
his	1
unabashed,	1
meditative	1
concentration	1
and	1
thoughtfulness,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
spoke	1
French,	1
which	1
struck	1
them	1
as	1
surprisingly	1
good.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
arrested	1
suspects,	1
as	1
the	1
separate	1
room	1
he	1
had	1
occupied	1
was	1
required	1
by	1
an	1
officer.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
Russians	1
confined	1
with	1
Pierre	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
lowest	1
class	1
and,	1
recognizing	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
they	1
all	1
avoided	1
him,	1
more	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
French.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
sad	1
at	1
hearing	1
them	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
That	1
evening	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
prisoners	1
(he,	1
probably,	1
among	1
them)	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
for	1
incendiarism.	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
a	1
French	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
mustache	1
sat	1
with	1
two	1
colonels	1
and	1
other	1
Frenchmen	1
with	1
scarves	1
on	1
their	1
arms.	1
With	1
the	1
precision	1
and	1
definiteness	1
customary	1
in	1
addressing	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
preclude	1
human	1
frailty,	1
Pierre	1
like	1
the	1
others	1
was	1
questioned	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been,	1
with	1
what	1
object,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
These	1
questions,	1
like	1
questions	1
put	1
at	1
trials	1
generally,	1
left	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
aside,	1
shut	1
out	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
that	1
essence's	1
being	1
revealed,	1
and	1
were	1
designed	1
only	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
channel	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
judges	1
wished	1
the	1
answers	1
of	1
the	1
accused	1
to	1
flow	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
desired	1
result,	1
namely	1
a	1
conviction.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
fit	1
in	1
with	1
that	1
aim,	1
the	1
channel	1
was	1
removed	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
could	1
flow	1
to	1
waste.	1
Pierre	1
felt,	1
moreover,	1
what	1
the	1
accused	1
always	1
feel	1
at	1
their	1
trial,	1
perplexity	1
as	1
to	1
why	1
these	1
questions	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
out	1
of	1
condescension	1
or	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
civility	1
that	1
this	1
device	1
of	1
placing	1
a	1
channel	1
was	1
employed.	1
He	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
men's	1
power,	1
that	1
only	1
by	1
force	1
had	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
there,	1
that	1
force	1
alone	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
demand	1
answers	1
to	1
their	1
questions,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
that	1
assembly	1
was	1
to	1
inculpate	1
him.	1
And	1
so,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
wish	1
to	1
inculpate	1
him,	1
this	1
expedient	1
of	1
an	1
inquiry	1
and	1
trial	1
seemed	1
unnecessary.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
any	1
answer	1
would	1
lead	1
to	1
conviction.	1
When	1
asked	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
arrested,	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
tragic	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
restoring	1
to	1
its	1
parents	1
a	1
child	1
he	1
had	1
saved	1
from	1
the	1
flames.	1
Why	1
had	1
he	1
fought	1
the	1
marauder?	1
Pierre	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
"was	1
protecting	1
a	1
woman,"	1
and	1
that	1
"to	1
protect	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
being	1
insulted	1
was	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
every	1
man;	1
that..."	1
They	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
Why	1
was	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
house	1
where	1
witnesses	1
had	1
seen	1
him?	1
He	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Again	1
they	1
interrupted	1
him:	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
asked	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
but	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
found	1
near	1
the	1
fire?	1
Who	1
was	1
he?	1
they	1
asked,	1
repeating	1
their	1
first	1
question,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
declined	1
to	1
answer.	1
Again	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
it.	1
	1
"Put	1
that	1
down,	1
that's	1
bad...	1
very	1
bad,"	1
sternly	1
remarked	1
the	1
general	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
mustache	1
and	1
red	1
flushed	1
face.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
fires	1
broke	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
Zubovski	1
rampart.	1
	1
Pierre	1
and	1
thirteen	1
others	1
were	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
coach	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
merchant's	1
house	1
near	1
the	1
Crimean	1
bridge.	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
stifled	1
by	1
the	1
smoke	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
hang	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
city.	1
Fires	1
were	1
visible	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
realize	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fires	1
with	1
horror.	1
	1
He	1
passed	1
four	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
house	1
near	1
the	1
Crimean	1
bridge	1
and	1
during	1
that	1
time	1
learned,	1
from	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
confined	1
there	1
were	1
awaiting	1
a	1
decision	1
which	1
might	1
come	1
any	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
marshal.	1
What	1
marshal	1
this	1
was,	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
Evidently	1
for	1
them	1
"the	1
marshal"	1
represented	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
and	1
rather	1
mysterious	1
power.	1
	1
These	1
first	1
days,	1
before	1
the	1
eighth	1
of	1
September	1
when	1
the	1
prisoners	1
were	1
had	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
examination,	1
were	1
the	1
hardest	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
Pierre.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
On	1
the	1
eighth	1
of	1
September	1
an	1
officer--a	1
very	1
important	1
one	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
respect	1
the	1
guards	1
showed	1
him--entered	1
the	1
coach	1
house	1
where	1
the	1
prisoners	1
were.	1
This	1
officer,	1
probably	1
someone	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
was	1
holding	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
called	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
there,	1
naming	1
Pierre	1
as	1
"the	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
name."	1
Glancing	1
indolently	1
and	1
indifferently	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
he	1
ordered	1
the	1
officer	1
in	1
charge	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
decently	1
dressed	1
and	1
tidied	1
up	1
before	1
taking	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
marshal.	1
An	1
hour	1
later	1
a	1
squad	1
of	1
soldiers	1
arrived	1
and	1
Pierre	1
with	1
thirteen	1
others	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
Virgin's	1
Field.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
day,	1
sunny	1
after	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
unusually	1
pure.	1
The	1
smoke	1
did	1
not	1
hang	1
low	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
guardhouse	1
on	1
the	1
Zubovski	1
rampart,	1
but	1
rose	1
through	1
the	1
pure	1
air	1
in	1
columns.	1
No	1
flames	1
were	1
seen,	1
but	1
columns	1
of	1
smoke	1
rose	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
and	1
all	1
Moscow	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Pierre	1
could	1
see	1
was	1
one	1
vast	1
charred	1
ruin.	1
On	1
all	1
sides	1
there	1
were	1
waste	1
spaces	1
with	1
only	1
stoves	1
and	1
chimney	1
stacks	1
still	1
standing,	1
and	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
blackened	1
walls	1
of	1
some	1
brick	1
houses.	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
ruins	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
districts	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
well.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
churches	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
burned.	1
The	1
Kremlin,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
destroyed,	1
gleamed	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
with	1
its	1
towers	1
and	1
the	1
belfry	1
of	1
Ivan	1
the	1
Great.	1
The	1
domes	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Convent	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin	1
glittered	1
brightly	1
and	1
its	1
bells	1
were	1
ringing	1
particularly	1
clearly.	1
These	1
bells	1
reminded	1
Pierre	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Sunday	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
Nativity	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin.	1
But	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
celebrate	1
this	1
holiday:	1
everywhere	1
were	1
blackened	1
ruins,	1
and	1
the	1
few	1
Russians	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
were	1
tattered	1
and	1
frightened	1
people	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
nest	1
was	1
ruined	1
and	1
destroyed,	1
but	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
order	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed,	1
Pierre	1
unconsciously	1
felt	1
that	1
a	1
quite	1
different,	1
firm,	1
French	1
order	1
had	1
been	1
established	1
over	1
this	1
ruined	1
nest.	1
He	1
felt	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
looks	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who,	1
marching	1
in	1
regular	1
ranks	1
briskly	1
and	1
gaily,	1
were	1
escorting	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
criminals;	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
looks	1
of	1
an	1
important	1
French	1
official	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
and	1
pair	1
driven	1
by	1
a	1
soldier,	1
whom	1
they	1
met	1
on	1
the	1
way.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
merry	1
sounds	1
of	1
regimental	1
music	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
felt	1
and	1
realized	1
it	1
especially	1
from	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
prisoners	1
the	1
French	1
officer	1
had	1
read	1
out	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
that	1
morning.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
one	1
set	1
of	1
soldiers	1
and	1
led	1
first	1
to	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
another	1
place	1
with	1
dozens	1
of	1
other	1
men,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
forgotten	1
him,	1
or	1
confused	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
But	1
no:	1
the	1
answers	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
when	1
questioned	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
designation	1
as	1
"the	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
name,"	1
and	1
under	1
that	1
appellation,	1
which	1
to	1
Pierre	1
seemed	1
terrible,	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
leading	1
him	1
somewhere	1
with	1
unhesitating	1
assurance	1
on	1
their	1
faces	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
prisoners	1
were	1
exactly	1
the	1
ones	1
they	1
wanted	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
being	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
proper	1
place.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
insignificant	1
chip	1
fallen	1
among	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
a	1
machine	1
whose	1
action	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
working	1
well.	1
	1
He	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
prisoners	1
were	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin's	1
Field,	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
white	1
house	1
with	1
an	1
immense	1
garden	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
convent.	1
This	1
was	1
Prince	1
Shcherbitov's	1
house,	1
where	1
Pierre	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
in	1
other	1
days,	1
and	1
which,	1
as	1
he	1
learned	1
from	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
was	1
now	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
marshal,	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Eckmuhl	1
(Davout).	1
	1
They	1
were	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
one	1
by	1
one.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
the	1
sixth	1
to	1
enter.	1
He	1
was	1
conducted	1
through	1
a	1
glass	1
gallery,	1
an	1
anteroom,	1
and	1
a	1
hall,	1
which	1
were	1
familiar	1
to	1
him,	1
into	1
a	1
long	1
low	1
study	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
stood	1
an	1
adjutant.	1
	1
Davout,	1
spectacles	1
on	1
nose,	1
sat	1
bent	1
over	1
a	1
table	1
at	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
Davout,	1
evidently	1
consulting	1
a	1
paper	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him,	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
up.	1
Without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice:	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
silent	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
uttering	1
a	1
word.	1
To	1
him	1
Davout	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
French	1
general,	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
notorious	1
for	1
his	1
cruelty.	1
Looking	1
at	1
his	1
cold	1
face,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
like	1
a	1
stern	1
schoolmaster	1
who	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
wait	1
awhile	1
for	1
an	1
answer,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
every	1
instant	1
of	1
delay	1
might	1
cost	1
him	1
his	1
life;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
repeat	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
at	1
his	1
first	1
examination,	1
yet	1
to	1
disclose	1
his	1
rank	1
and	1
position	1
was	1
dangerous	1
and	1
embarrassing.	1
So	1
he	1
was	1
silent.	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
Davout	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
pushed	1
his	1
spectacles	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
forehead,	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
man,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
measured	1
tone,	1
evidently	1
calculated	1
to	1
frighten	1
Pierre.	1
	1
The	1
chill	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
running	1
down	1
Pierre's	1
back	1
now	1
seized	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
vise.	1
	1
"You	1
cannot	1
know	1
me,	1
General,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
you..."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
Russian	1
spy,"	1
Davout	1
interrupted,	1
addressing	1
another	1
general	1
who	1
was	1
present,	1
but	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
noticed.	1
	1
Davout	1
turned	1
away.	1
With	1
an	1
unexpected	1
reverberation	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
Pierre	1
rapidly	1
began:	1
	1
"No,	1
monseigneur,"	1
he	1
said,	1
suddenly	1
remembering	1
that	1
Davout	1
was	1
a	1
duke.	1
"No,	1
monseigneur,	1
you	1
cannot	1
have	1
known	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
militia	1
officer	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
quitted	1
Moscow."	1
	1
"Your	1
name?"	1
asked	1
Davout.	1
	1
"Bezukhov."	1
	1
"What	1
proof	1
have	1
I	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
lying?"	1
	1
"Monseigneur!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
pleading	1
voice.	1
	1
Davout	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
gazed	1
intently	1
at	1
him.	1
For	1
some	1
seconds	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
that	1
look	1
saved	1
Pierre.	1
Apart	1
from	1
conditions	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
law,	1
that	1
look	1
established	1
human	1
relations	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
men.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
things	1
passed	1
dimly	1
through	1
both	1
their	1
minds,	1
and	1
they	1
realized	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
children	1
of	1
humanity	1
and	1
were	1
brothers.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
glance,	1
when	1
Davout	1
had	1
only	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
the	1
papers	1
where	1
human	1
affairs	1
and	1
lives	1
were	1
indicated	1
by	1
numbers,	1
Pierre	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
circumstance,	1
and	1
Davout	1
could	1
have	1
shot	1
him	1
without	1
burdening	1
his	1
conscience	1
with	1
an	1
evil	1
deed,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
human	1
being.	1
He	1
reflected	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
telling	1
the	1
truth?"	1
said	1
Davout	1
coldly.	1
	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
Ramballe,	1
and	1
named	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
the	1
street	1
where	1
the	1
house	1
was.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
say,"	1
returned	1
Davout.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
trembling,	1
faltering	1
voice	1
Pierre	1
began	1
adducing	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
statements.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
adjutant	1
entered	1
and	1
reported	1
something	1
to	1
Davout.	1
	1
Davout	1
brightened	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
news	1
the	1
adjutant	1
brought,	1
and	1
began	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
uniform.	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
Pierre.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
adjutant	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
prisoner,	1
he	1
jerked	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
direction	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
and	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
away.	1
But	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know:	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
coach	1
house	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
execution	1
his	1
companions	1
had	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
crossed	1
the	1
Virgin's	1
Field.	1
	1
He	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
adjutant	1
was	1
putting	1
another	1
question	1
to	1
Davout.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
of	1
course!"	1
replied	1
Davout,	1
but	1
what	1
this	1
"yes"	1
meant,	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
afterwards	1
remember	1
how	1
he	1
went,	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
far,	1
or	1
in	1
which	1
direction.	1
His	1
faculties	1
were	1
quite	1
numbed,	1
he	1
was	1
stupefied,	1
and	1
noticing	1
nothing	1
around	1
him	1
went	1
on	1
moving	1
his	1
legs	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
did	1
till	1
they	1
all	1
stopped	1
and	1
he	1
stopped	1
too.	1
The	1
only	1
thought	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
was:	1
who	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
had	1
really	1
sentenced	1
him	1
to	1
death?	1
Not	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
commission	1
that	1
had	1
first	1
examined	1
him--not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
wished	1
to	1
or,	1
evidently,	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
Davout,	1
who	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
so	1
human	1
a	1
way.	1
In	1
another	1
moment	1
Davout	1
would	1
have	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
wrong,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
adjutant	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
The	1
adjutant,	1
also,	1
had	1
evidently	1
had	1
no	1
evil	1
intent	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
refrained	1
from	1
coming	1
in.	1
Then	1
who	1
was	1
executing	1
him,	1
killing	1
him,	1
depriving	1
him	1
of	1
life--him,	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
memories,	1
aspirations,	1
hopes,	1
and	1
thoughts?	1
Who	1
was	1
doing	1
this?	1
And	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
one.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
system--a	1
concurrence	1
of	1
circumstances.	1
	1
A	1
system	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
was	1
killing	1
him--Pierre--depriving	1
him	1
of	1
life,	1
of	1
everything,	1
annihilating	1
him.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
From	1
Prince	1
Shcherbatov's	1
house	1
the	1
prisoners	1
were	1
led	1
straight	1
down	1
the	1
Virgin's	1
Field,	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
nunnery,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
a	1
kitchen	1
garden	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
post	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
up.	1
Beyond	1
that	1
post	1
a	1
fresh	1
pit	1
had	1
been	1
dug	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
near	1
the	1
post	1
and	1
the	1
pit	1
a	1
large	1
crowd	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle.	1
The	1
crowd	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
Russians	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
on	1
duty--Germans,	1
Italians,	1
and	1
Frenchmen,	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
uniforms.	1
To	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
stood	1
rows	1
of	1
French	1
troops	1
in	1
blue	1
uniforms	1
with	1
red	1
epaulets	1
and	1
high	1
boots	1
and	1
shakos.	1
	1
The	1
prisoners	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
order,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
list	1
(Pierre	1
was	1
sixth),	1
and	1
were	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
post.	1
Several	1
drums	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
beat	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
sound	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
away.	1
He	1
lost	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
thinking	1
or	1
understanding.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
hear	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
wish--	1
that	1
the	1
frightful	1
thing	1
that	1
had	1
to	1
happen	1
should	1
happen	1
quickly.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
fellow	1
prisoners	1
and	1
scrutinized	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
first	1
were	1
convicts	1
with	1
shaven	1
heads.	1
One	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
thin,	1
the	1
other	1
dark,	1
shaggy,	1
and	1
sinewy,	1
with	1
a	1
flat	1
nose.	1
The	1
third	1
was	1
a	1
domestic	1
serf,	1
about	1
forty-five	1
years	1
old,	1
with	1
grizzled	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
plump,	1
well-nourished	1
body.	1
The	1
fourth	1
was	1
a	1
peasant,	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
broad,	1
light-brown	1
beard	1
and	1
black	1
eyes.	1
The	1
fifth	1
was	1
a	1
factory	1
hand,	1
a	1
thin,	1
sallow-faced	1
lad	1
of	1
eighteen	1
in	1
a	1
loose	1
coat.	1
	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
the	1
French	1
consulting	1
whether	1
to	1
shoot	1
them	1
separately	1
or	1
two	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
"In	1
couples,"	1
replied	1
the	1
officer	1
in	1
command	1
in	1
a	1
calm	1
voice.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
hurrying--not	1
as	1
men	1
hurry	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
they	1
understand,	1
but	1
as	1
people	1
hurry	1
to	1
finish	1
a	1
necessary	1
but	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
task.	1
	1
A	1
French	1
official	1
wearing	1
a	1
scarf	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
prisoners	1
and	1
read	1
out	1
the	1
sentence	1
in	1
Russian	1
and	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
Then	1
two	1
pairs	1
of	1
Frenchmen	1
approached	1
the	1
criminals	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
officer's	1
command	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
convicts	1
who	1
stood	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
row.	1
The	1
convicts	1
stopped	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
post	1
and,	1
while	1
sacks	1
were	1
being	1
brought,	1
looked	1
dumbly	1
around	1
as	1
a	1
wounded	1
beast	1
looks	1
at	1
an	1
approaching	1
huntsman.	1
One	1
crossed	1
himself	1
continually,	1
the	1
other	1
scratched	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
lips	1
resembling	1
a	1
smile.	1
With	1
hurried	1
hands	1
the	1
soldiers	1
blindfolded	1
them,	1
drawing	1
the	1
sacks	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
bound	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
post.	1
	1
Twelve	1
sharpshooters	1
with	1
muskets	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ranks	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
regular	1
tread	1
and	1
halted	1
eight	1
paces	1
from	1
the	1
post.	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
crackling,	1
rolling	1
noise	1
was	1
heard	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
louder	1
than	1
the	1
most	1
terrific	1
thunder,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round.	1
There	1
was	1
some	1
smoke,	1
and	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
were	1
doing	1
something	1
near	1
the	1
pit,	1
with	1
pale	1
faces	1
and	1
trembling	1
hands.	1
Two	1
more	1
prisoners	1
were	1
led	1
up.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
and	1
with	1
similar	1
looks,	1
these	1
two	1
glanced	1
vainly	1
at	1
the	1
onlookers	1
with	1
only	1
a	1
silent	1
appeal	1
for	1
protection	1
in	1
their	1
eyes,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
or	1
believe	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
to	1
them.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
because	1
they	1
alone	1
knew	1
what	1
their	1
life	1
meant	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
neither	1
understood	1
nor	1
believed	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
Again	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
look	1
and	1
again	1
turned	1
away;	1
but	1
again	1
the	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
frightful	1
explosion	1
struck	1
his	1
ear,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
smoke,	1
blood,	1
and	1
the	1
pale,	1
scared	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
who	1
were	1
again	1
doing	1
something	1
by	1
the	1
post,	1
their	1
trembling	1
hands	1
impeding	1
one	1
another.	1
Pierre,	1
breathing	1
heavily,	1
looked	1
around	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
what	1
it	1
meant.	1
The	1
same	1
question	1
was	1
expressed	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
looks	1
that	1
met	1
his.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
without	1
exception,	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
same	1
dismay,	1
horror,	1
and	1
conflict	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
heart.	1
"But	1
who,	1
after	1
all,	1
is	1
doing	1
this?	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
suffering	1
as	1
I	1
am.	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
it?	1
Who?"	1
flashed	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
through	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"Sharpshooters	1
of	1
the	1
86th,	1
forward!"	1
shouted	1
someone.	1
The	1
fifth	1
prisoner,	1
the	1
one	1
next	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
led	1
away--alone.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
saved,	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
there	1
only	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
execution.	1
With	1
ever-growing	1
horror,	1
and	1
no	1
sense	1
of	1
joy	1
or	1
relief,	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place.	1
The	1
fifth	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
factory	1
lad	1
in	1
the	1
loose	1
cloak.	1
The	1
moment	1
they	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
sprang	1
aside	1
in	1
terror	1
and	1
clutched	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
(Pierre	1
shuddered	1
and	1
shook	1
himself	1
free.)	1
The	1
lad	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
walk.	1
They	1
dragged	1
him	1
along,	1
holding	1
him	1
up	1
under	1
the	1
arms,	1
and	1
he	1
screamed.	1
When	1
they	1
got	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
he	1
grew	1
quiet,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
suddenly	1
understood	1
something.	1
Whether	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
screaming	1
was	1
useless	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
incredible	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
kill	1
him,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
post,	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
blindfolded	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
wounded	1
animal	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
and	1
close	1
his	1
eyes.	1
His	1
curiosity	1
and	1
agitation,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd,	1
reached	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch	1
at	1
this	1
fifth	1
murder.	1
Like	1
the	1
others	1
this	1
fifth	1
man	1
seemed	1
calm;	1
he	1
wrapped	1
his	1
loose	1
cloak	1
closer	1
and	1
rubbed	1
one	1
bare	1
foot	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
blindfold	1
him	1
he	1
himself	1
adjusted	1
the	1
knot	1
which	1
hurt	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head;	1
then	1
when	1
they	1
propped	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
post,	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
and,	1
not	1
being	1
comfortable	1
in	1
that	1
position,	1
straightened	1
himself,	1
adjusted	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
leaned	1
back	1
again	1
more	1
comfortably.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
miss	1
his	1
slightest	1
movement.	1
	1
Probably	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
was	1
given	1
and	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
eight	1
muskets;	1
but	1
try	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
afterwards	1
remember	1
having	1
heard	1
the	1
slightest	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
shots.	1
He	1
only	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
workman	1
suddenly	1
sank	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
cords	1
that	1
held	1
him,	1
how	1
blood	1
showed	1
itself	1
in	1
two	1
places,	1
how	1
the	1
ropes	1
slackened	1
under	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
hanging	1
body,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
workman	1
sat	1
down,	1
his	1
head	1
hanging	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
one	1
leg	1
bent	1
under	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
post.	1
No	1
one	1
hindered	1
him.	1
Pale,	1
frightened	1
people	1
were	1
doing	1
something	1
around	1
the	1
workman.	1
The	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
a	1
thick	1
mustache	1
trembled	1
as	1
he	1
untied	1
the	1
ropes.	1
The	1
body	1
collapsed.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
dragged	1
it	1
awkwardly	1
from	1
the	1
post	1
and	1
began	1
pushing	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
plainly	1
and	1
certainly	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
criminals	1
who	1
must	1
hide	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
their	1
guilt	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
pit	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
factory	1
lad	1
was	1
lying	1
with	1
his	1
knees	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
one	1
shoulder	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
other.	1
That	1
shoulder	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
rhythmically	1
and	1
convulsively,	1
but	1
spadefuls	1
of	1
earth	1
were	1
already	1
being	1
thrown	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
body.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
evidently	1
suffering,	1
shouted	1
gruffly	1
and	1
angrily	1
at	1
Pierre	1
to	1
go	1
back.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
remained	1
near	1
the	1
post,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
drove	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
pit	1
had	1
been	1
filled	1
up	1
a	1
command	1
was	1
given.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
taken	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
troops	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
made	1
a	1
half	1
turn	1
and	1
went	1
past	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
measured	1
pace.	1
The	1
twenty-four	1
sharpshooters	1
with	1
discharged	1
muskets,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
circle,	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
places	1
as	1
the	1
companies	1
passed	1
by.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
now	1
with	1
dazed	1
eyes	1
at	1
these	1
sharpshooters	1
who	1
ran	1
in	1
couples	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
circle.	1
All	1
but	1
one	1
rejoined	1
their	1
companies.	1
This	1
one,	1
a	1
young	1
soldier,	1
his	1
face	1
deadly	1
pale,	1
his	1
shako	1
pushed	1
back,	1
and	1
his	1
musket	1
resting	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
still	1
stood	1
near	1
the	1
pit	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
fired.	1
He	1
swayed	1
like	1
a	1
drunken	1
man,	1
taking	1
some	1
steps	1
forward	1
and	1
back	1
to	1
save	1
himself	1
from	1
falling.	1
An	1
old,	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
elbow	1
dragged	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
company.	1
The	1
crowd	1
of	1
Russians	1
and	1
Frenchmen	1
began	1
to	1
disperse.	1
They	1
all	1
went	1
away	1
silently	1
and	1
with	1
drooping	1
heads.	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
start	1
fires,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchmen.	1
	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
speaker	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
relief	1
after	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
Without	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
hopeless	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
After	1
the	1
execution	1
Pierre	1
was	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
placed	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
small,	1
ruined,	1
and	1
befouled	1
church.	1
	1
Toward	1
evening	1
a	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
entered	1
with	1
two	1
soldiers	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
pardoned	1
and	1
would	1
now	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
barracks	1
for	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war.	1
Without	1
understanding	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Pierre	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
They	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
sheds	1
built	1
of	1
charred	1
planks,	1
beams,	1
and	1
battens,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
darkness	1
some	1
twenty	1
different	1
men	1
surrounded	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
without	1
understanding	1
who	1
they	1
were,	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
there,	1
or	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
heard	1
what	1
they	1
said,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
kind	1
of	1
deduction	1
from	1
or	1
application	1
of	1
them.	1
He	1
replied	1
to	1
questions	1
they	1
put	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
who	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
replies,	1
nor	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
understand	1
them.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
their	1
faces	1
and	1
figures,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
equally	1
meaningless.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
had	1
witnessed	1
those	1
terrible	1
murders	1
committed	1
by	1
men	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
commit	1
them,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
mainspring	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
on	1
which	1
everything	1
depended	1
and	1
which	1
made	1
everything	1
appear	1
alive,	1
had	1
suddenly	1
been	1
wrenched	1
out	1
and	1
everything	1
had	1
collapsed	1
into	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
meaningless	1
rubbish.	1
Though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
it	1
to	1
himself,	1
his	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
ordering	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
in	1
humanity,	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
soul,	1
and	1
in	1
God,	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
He	1
had	1
experienced	1
this	1
before,	1
but	1
never	1
so	1
strongly	1
as	1
now.	1
When	1
similar	1
doubts	1
had	1
assailed	1
him	1
before,	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
wrongdoing,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
that	1
relief	1
from	1
his	1
despair	1
and	1
from	1
those	1
doubts	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
within	1
himself.	1
But	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
universe	1
had	1
crumbled	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
only	1
meaningless	1
ruins	1
remained,	1
and	1
this	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
regain	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
Around	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
men	1
were	1
standing	1
and	1
evidently	1
something	1
about	1
him	1
interested	1
them	1
greatly.	1
They	1
were	1
telling	1
him	1
something	1
and	1
asking	1
him	1
something.	1
Then	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
somewhere,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
among	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
laughing	1
and	1
talking	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
mates...	1
that	1
very	1
prince	1
who..."	1
some	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
was	1
saying,	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
who.	1
	1
Sitting	1
silent	1
and	1
motionless	1
on	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
straw	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
Pierre	1
sometimes	1
opened	1
and	1
sometimes	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
closed	1
them	1
he	1
saw	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
dreadful	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
factory	1
lad--	1
especially	1
dreadful	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
simplicity--and	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
murderers,	1
even	1
more	1
dreadful	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
disquiet.	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
again	1
and	1
stared	1
vacantly	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
Beside	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
stooping	1
position	1
sat	1
a	1
small	1
man	1
of	1
whose	1
presence	1
he	1
was	1
first	1
made	1
aware	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
smell	1
of	1
perspiration	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
him	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
moved.	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
though	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
continually	1
glanced	1
at	1
him.	1
On	1
growing	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
darkness	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
leg	1
bands,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
aroused	1
Pierre's	1
interest.	1
	1
Having	1
unwound	1
the	1
string	1
that	1
tied	1
the	1
band	1
on	1
one	1
leg,	1
he	1
carefully	1
coiled	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
immediately	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
leg,	1
glancing	1
up	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
While	1
one	1
hand	1
hung	1
up	1
the	1
first	1
string	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
already	1
unwinding	1
the	1
band	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
leg.	1
In	1
this	1
way,	1
having	1
carefully	1
removed	1
the	1
leg	1
bands	1
by	1
deft	1
circular	1
motions	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
following	1
one	1
another	1
uninterruptedly,	1
the	1
man	1
hung	1
the	1
leg	1
bands	1
up	1
on	1
some	1
pegs	1
fixed	1
above	1
his	1
head.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
knife,	1
cut	1
something,	1
closed	1
the	1
knife,	1
placed	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
bed,	1
and,	1
seating	1
himself	1
comfortably,	1
clasped	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
lifted	1
knees	1
and	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
something	1
pleasant,	1
comforting,	1
and	1
well-rounded	1
in	1
these	1
deft	1
movements,	1
in	1
the	1
man's	1
well-ordered	1
arrangements	1
in	1
his	1
corner,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
very	1
smell,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
"You've	1
seen	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
trouble,	1
sir,	1
eh?"	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
suddenly	1
said.	1
	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
kindliness	1
and	1
simplicity	1
in	1
his	1
singsong	1
voice	1
that	1
Pierre	1
tried	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
his	1
jaw	1
trembled	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
tears	1
rising	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
The	1
little	1
fellow,	1
giving	1
Pierre	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
betray	1
his	1
confusion,	1
instantly	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pleasant	1
tones:	1
	1
"Eh,	1
lad,	1
don't	1
fret!"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
singsong	1
caressing	1
voice	1
old	1
Russian	1
peasant	1
women	1
employ.	1
"Don't	1
fret,	1
friend--'suffer	1
an	1
hour,	1
live	1
for	1
an	1
age!'	1
that's	1
how	1
it	1
is,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
And	1
here	1
we	1
live,	1
thank	1
heaven,	1
without	1
offense.	1
Among	1
these	1
folk,	1
too,	1
there	1
are	1
good	1
men	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
bad,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
still	1
speaking,	1
he	1
turned	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
movement,	1
got	1
up,	1
coughed,	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
you	1
rascal!"	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
voice	1
saying	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1
"So	1
you've	1
come,	1
you	1
rascal?	1
She	1
remembers...	1
Now,	1
now,	1
that'll	1
do!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
soldier,	1
pushing	1
away	1
a	1
little	1
dog	1
that	1
was	1
jumping	1
up	1
at	1
him,	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
In	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
rag.	1
	1
"Here,	1
eat	1
a	1
bit,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he,	1
resuming	1
his	1
former	1
respectful	1
tone	1
as	1
he	1
unwrapped	1
and	1
offered	1
Pierre	1
some	1
baked	1
potatoes.	1
"We	1
had	1
soup	1
for	1
dinner	1
and	1
the	1
potatoes	1
are	1
grand!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
eaten	1
all	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
potatoes	1
seemed	1
extremely	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
thanked	1
the	1
soldier	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
"Well,	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
right?"	1
said	1
the	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"You	1
should	1
do	1
like	1
this."	1
	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
potato,	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
clasp	1
knife,	1
cut	1
the	1
potato	1
into	1
two	1
equal	1
halves	1
on	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
sprinkled	1
some	1
salt	1
on	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
rag,	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"The	1
potatoes	1
are	1
grand!"	1
he	1
said	1
once	1
more.	1
"Eat	1
some	1
like	1
that!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
eaten	1
anything	1
that	1
tasted	1
better.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I'm	1
all	1
right,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
shoot	1
those	1
poor	1
fellows?	1
The	1
last	1
one	1
was	1
hardly	1
twenty."	1
	1
"Tss,	1
tt...!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
man.	1
"Ah,	1
what	1
a	1
sin...	1
what	1
a	1
sin!"	1
he	1
added	1
quickly,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
always	1
waiting	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
flew	1
out	1
involuntarily	1
he	1
went	1
on:	1
"How	1
was	1
it,	1
sir,	1
that	1
you	1
stayed	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
	1
"I	1
didn't	1
think	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
so	1
soon.	1
I	1
stayed	1
accidentally,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
they	1
arrest	1
you,	1
dear	1
lad?	1
At	1
your	1
house?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
arrested	1
me	1
there,	1
and	1
tried	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
incendiary."	1
	1
"Where	1
there's	1
law	1
there's	1
injustice,"	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
man.	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long?"	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
as	1
he	1
munched	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
potato.	1
	1
"I?	1
It	1
was	1
last	1
Sunday	1
they	1
took	1
me,	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hospital	1
in	1
Moscow."	1
	1
"Why,	1
are	1
you	1
a	1
soldier	1
then?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
are	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
Apsheron	1
regiment.	1
I	1
was	1
dying	1
of	1
fever.	1
We	1
weren't	1
told	1
anything.	1
There	1
were	1
some	1
twenty	1
of	1
us	1
lying	1
there.	1
We	1
had	1
no	1
idea,	1
never	1
guessed	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
sad	1
here?"	1
Pierre	1
inquired.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
one	1
help	1
it,	1
lad?	1
My	1
name	1
is	1
Platon,	1
and	1
the	1
surname	1
is	1
Karataev,"	1
he	1
added,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
easier	1
for	1
Pierre	1
to	1
address	1
him.	1
"They	1
call	1
me	1
'little	1
falcon'	1
in	1
the	1
regiment.	1
How	1
is	1
one	1
to	1
help	1
feeling	1
sad?	1
Moscow--she's	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
cities.	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
see	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
not	1
feel	1
sad?	1
But	1
'the	1
maggot	1
gnaws	1
the	1
cabbage,	1
yet	1
dies	1
first';	1
that's	1
what	1
the	1
old	1
folks	1
used	1
to	1
tell	1
us,"	1
he	1
added	1
rapidly.	1
	1
"What?	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
say?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Who?	1
I?"	1
said	1
Karataev.	1
"I	1
say	1
things	1
happen	1
not	1
as	1
we	1
plan	1
but	1
as	1
God	1
judges,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
thinking	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
repeating	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
and	1
immediately	1
continued:	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
you,	1
have	1
you	1
a	1
family	1
estate,	1
sir?	1
And	1
a	1
house?	1
So	1
you	1
have	1
abundance,	1
then?	1
And	1
a	1
housewife?	1
And	1
your	1
old	1
parents,	1
are	1
they	1
still	1
living?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
And	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
dark	1
for	1
Pierre	1
to	1
see,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
a	1
suppressed	1
smile	1
of	1
kindliness	1
puckered	1
the	1
soldier's	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
these	1
questions.	1
He	1
seemed	1
grieved	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
no	1
parents,	1
especially	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
mother.	1
	1
"A	1
wife	1
for	1
counsel,	1
a	1
mother-in-law	1
for	1
welcome,	1
but	1
there's	1
none	1
as	1
dear	1
as	1
one's	1
own	1
mother!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Well,	1
and	1
have	1
you	1
little	1
ones?"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
asking.	1
	1
Again	1
Pierre's	1
negative	1
answer	1
seemed	1
to	1
distress	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
add:	1
	1
"Never	1
mind!	1
You're	1
young	1
folks	1
yet,	1
and	1
please	1
God	1
may	1
still	1
have	1
some.	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
harmony...."	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
now,"	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
rejoined	1
Karataev,	1
"never	1
decline	1
a	1
prison	1
or	1
a	1
beggar's	1
sack!"	1
	1
He	1
seated	1
himself	1
more	1
comfortably	1
and	1
coughed,	1
evidently	1
preparing	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
long	1
story.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
living	1
at	1
home,"	1
he	1
began.	1
"We	1
had	1
a	1
well-to-do	1
homestead,	1
plenty	1
of	1
land,	1
we	1
peasants	1
lived	1
well	1
and	1
our	1
house	1
was	1
one	1
to	1
thank	1
God	1
for.	1
When	1
Father	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
out	1
mowing	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
of	1
us.	1
We	1
lived	1
well.	1
We	1
were	1
real	1
peasants.	1
It	1
so	1
happened..."	1
	1
And	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
told	1
a	1
long	1
story	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
someone's	1
copse	1
to	1
take	1
wood,	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
keeper,	1
had	1
been	1
tried,	1
flogged,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
soldier.	1
	1
"Well,	1
lad,"	1
and	1
a	1
smile	1
changed	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
"we	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune	1
but	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
a	1
blessing!	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
my	1
sin,	1
my	1
brother	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
a	1
soldier.	1
But	1
he,	1
my	1
younger	1
brother,	1
had	1
five	1
little	1
ones,	1
while	1
I,	1
you	1
see,	1
only	1
left	1
a	1
wife	1
behind.	1
We	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
girl,	1
but	1
God	1
took	1
her	1
before	1
I	1
went	1
as	1
a	1
soldier.	1
I	1
come	1
home	1
on	1
leave	1
and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
it	1
was,	1
I	1
look	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
living	1
better	1
than	1
before.	1
The	1
yard	1
full	1
of	1
cattle,	1
the	1
women	1
at	1
home,	1
two	1
brothers	1
away	1
earning	1
wages,	1
and	1
only	1
Michael	1
the	1
youngest,	1
at	1
home.	1
Father,	1
he	1
says,	1
'All	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me:	1
it	1
hurts	1
the	1
same	1
whichever	1
finger	1
gets	1
bitten.	1
But	1
if	1
Platon	1
hadn't	1
been	1
shaved	1
for	1
a	1
soldier,	1
Michael	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
go.'	1
called	1
us	1
all	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
will	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
placed	1
us	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
icons.	1
'Michael,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'come	1
here	1
and	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
feet;	1
and	1
you,	1
young	1
woman,	1
you	1
bow	1
down	1
too;	1
and	1
you,	1
grandchildren,	1
also	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
him!	1
Do	1
you	1
understand?'	1
he	1
says.	1
That's	1
how	1
it	1
is,	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
Fate	1
looks	1
for	1
a	1
head.	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
always	1
judging,	1
'that's	1
not	1
well--that's	1
not	1
right!'	1
Our	1
luck	1
is	1
like	1
water	1
in	1
a	1
dragnet:	1
you	1
pull	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
bulges,	1
but	1
when	1
you've	1
drawn	1
it	1
out	1
it's	1
empty!	1
That's	1
how	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
And	1
Platon	1
shifted	1
his	1
seat	1
on	1
the	1
straw.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
he	1
rose.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
sleepy,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
began	1
rapidly	1
crossing	1
himself	1
and	1
repeating:	1
	1
"Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
holy	1
Saint	1
Nicholas,	1
Frola	1
and	1
Lavra!	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
holy	1
Saint	1
Nicholas,	1
Frola	1
and	1
Lavra!	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
save	1
us!"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
then	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
got	1
up,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
his	1
heap	1
of	1
straw.	1
"That's	1
the	1
way.	1
Lay	1
me	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
stone,	1
O	1
God,	1
and	1
raise	1
me	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
loaf,"	1
he	1
muttered	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
down,	1
pulling	1
his	1
coat	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
"What	1
prayer	1
was	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
saying?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Eh?"	1
murmured	1
Platon,	1
who	1
had	1
almost	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
"What	1
was	1
I	1
saying?	1
I	1
was	1
praying.	1
Don't	1
you	1
pray?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
do,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"But	1
what	1
was	1
that	1
you	1
said:	1
Frola	1
and	1
Lavra?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course,"	1
replied	1
Platon	1
quickly,	1
"the	1
horses'	1
saints.	1
One	1
must	1
pity	1
the	1
animals	1
too.	1
Eh,	1
the	1
rascal!	1
Now	1
you've	1
curled	1
up	1
and	1
got	1
warm,	1
you	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
bitch!"	1
said	1
Karataev,	1
touching	1
the	1
dog	1
that	1
lay	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
again	1
turning	1
over	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
immediately.	1
	1
Sounds	1
of	1
crying	1
and	1
screaming	1
came	1
from	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
outside,	1
and	1
flames	1
were	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
cracks	1
of	1
the	1
shed,	1
but	1
inside	1
it	1
was	1
quiet	1
and	1
dark.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
sleep,	1
but	1
lay	1
with	1
eyes	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
regular	1
snoring	1
of	1
Platon	1
who	1
lay	1
beside	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
shattered	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
stirring	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
beauty	1
and	1
on	1
new	1
and	1
unshakable	1
foundations.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
Twenty-three	1
soldiers,	1
three	1
officers,	1
and	1
two	1
officials	1
were	1
confined	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
in	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
remained	1
for	1
four	1
weeks.	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
them	1
afterwards	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
misty	1
figures	1
to	1
him	1
except	1
Platon	1
Karataev,	1
who	1
always	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
a	1
most	1
vivid	1
and	1
precious	1
memory	1
and	1
the	1
personification	1
of	1
everything	1
Russian,	1
kindly,	1
and	1
round.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
his	1
neighbor	1
next	1
morning	1
at	1
dawn	1
the	1
first	1
impression	1
of	1
him,	1
as	1
of	1
something	1
round,	1
was	1
fully	1
confirmed:	1
Platon's	1
whole	1
figure--in	1
a	1
French	1
overcoat	1
girdled	1
with	1
a	1
cord,	1
a	1
soldier's	1
cap,	1
and	1
bast	1
shoes--was	1
round.	1
His	1
head	1
was	1
quite	1
round,	1
his	1
back,	1
chest,	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
even	1
his	1
arms,	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
as	1
if	1
ever	1
ready	1
to	1
embrace	1
something,	1
were	1
rounded,	1
his	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
and	1
his	1
large,	1
gentle	1
brown	1
eyes	1
were	1
also	1
round.	1
	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
fifty,	1
judging	1
by	1
his	1
stories	1
of	1
campaigns	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in,	1
told	1
as	1
by	1
an	1
old	1
soldier.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
his	1
age	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
unable	1
to	1
determine	1
it.	1
But	1
his	1
brilliantly	1
white,	1
strong	1
teeth	1
which	1
showed	1
in	1
two	1
unbroken	1
semicircles	1
when	1
he	1
laughed--as	1
he	1
often	1
did--were	1
all	1
sound	1
and	1
good,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
gray	1
hair	1
in	1
his	1
beard	1
or	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
gave	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
suppleness	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
firmness	1
and	1
endurance.	1
	1
His	1
face,	1
despite	1
its	1
fine,	1
rounded	1
wrinkles,	1
had	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
innocence	1
and	1
youth,	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
pleasant	1
and	1
musical.	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
was	1
its	1
directness	1
and	1
appositeness.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
considered	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
or	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
consequently	1
the	1
rapidity	1
and	1
justice	1
of	1
his	1
intonation	1
had	1
an	1
irresistible	1
persuasiveness.	1
	1
His	1
physical	1
strength	1
and	1
agility	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
imprisonment	1
were	1
such	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
fatigue	1
and	1
sickness	1
meant.	1
Every	1
night	1
before	1
lying	1
down,	1
he	1
said:	1
"Lord,	1
lay	1
me	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
stone	1
and	1
raise	1
me	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
loaf!"	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
on	1
getting	1
up,	1
he	1
said:	1
"I	1
lay	1
down	1
and	1
curled	1
up,	1
I	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
shake	1
myself."	1
And	1
indeed	1
he	1
only	1
had	1
to	1
lie	1
down,	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep	1
like	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
he	1
only	1
had	1
to	1
shake	1
himself,	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
without	1
a	1
moment's	1
delay	1
for	1
some	1
work,	1
just	1
as	1
children	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
play	1
directly	1
they	1
awake.	1
He	1
could	1
do	1
everything,	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
not	1
badly.	1
He	1
baked,	1
cooked,	1
sewed,	1
planed,	1
and	1
mended	1
boots.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
busy,	1
and	1
only	1
at	1
night	1
allowed	1
himself	1
conversation--of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
fond--and	1
songs.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
sing	1
like	1
a	1
trained	1
singer	1
who	1
knows	1
he	1
is	1
listened	1
to,	1
but	1
like	1
the	1
birds,	1
evidently	1
giving	1
vent	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
one	1
stretches	1
oneself	1
or	1
walks	1
about	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
stiffness,	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
were	1
always	1
high-pitched,	1
mournful,	1
delicate,	1
and	1
almost	1
feminine,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
was	1
very	1
serious.	1
	1
Having	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
and	1
allowed	1
his	1
beard	1
to	1
grow,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
thrown	1
off	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
upon	1
him--everything	1
military	1
and	1
alien	1
to	1
himself--and	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
peasant	1
habits.	1
	1
"A	1
soldier	1
on	1
leave--a	1
shirt	1
outside	1
breeches,"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
talking	1
about	1
his	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
soldier,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
complain,	1
and	1
often	1
mentioned	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
flogged	1
once	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
service.	1
When	1
he	1
related	1
anything	1
it	1
was	1
generally	1
some	1
old	1
and	1
evidently	1
precious	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
"Christian"	1
life,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
peasant	1
existence.	1
The	1
proverbs,	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
talk	1
was	1
full,	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
not	1
the	1
coarse	1
and	1
indecent	1
saws	1
soldiers	1
employ,	1
but	1
those	1
folk	1
sayings	1
which	1
taken	1
without	1
a	1
context	1
seem	1
so	1
insignificant,	1
but	1
when	1
used	1
appositely	1
suddenly	1
acquire	1
a	1
significance	1
of	1
profound	1
wisdom.	1
	1
He	1
would	1
often	1
say	1
the	1
exact	1
opposite	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
on	1
a	1
previous	1
occasion,	1
yet	1
both	1
would	1
be	1
right.	1
He	1
liked	1
to	1
talk	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
well,	1
adorning	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
terms	1
of	1
endearment	1
and	1
with	1
folk	1
sayings	1
which	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
invented	1
himself,	1
but	1
the	1
chief	1
charm	1
of	1
his	1
talk	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
commonest	1
events--sometimes	1
just	1
such	1
as	1
Pierre	1
had	1
witnessed	1
without	1
taking	1
notice	1
of	1
them--assumed	1
in	1
Karataev's	1
a	1
character	1
of	1
solemn	1
fitness.	1
He	1
liked	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
folk	1
tales	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
used	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
an	1
evening	1
(they	1
were	1
always	1
the	1
same),	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
liked	1
to	1
hear	1
stories	1
of	1
real	1
life.	1
He	1
would	1
smile	1
joyfully	1
when	1
listening	1
to	1
such	1
stories,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
putting	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
asking	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
moral	1
beauty	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
clear	1
to	1
himself.	1
Karataev	1
had	1
no	1
attachments,	1
friendships,	1
or	1
love,	1
as	1
Pierre	1
understood	1
them,	1
but	1
loved	1
and	1
lived	1
affectionately	1
with	1
everything	1
life	1
brought	1
him	1
in	1
contact	1
with,	1
particularly	1
with	1
man--not	1
any	1
particular	1
man,	1
but	1
those	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be.	1
He	1
loved	1
his	1
dog,	1
his	1
comrades,	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
neighbor,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Karataev's	1
affectionate	1
tenderness	1
for	1
him	1
(by	1
which	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
gave	1
Pierre's	1
spiritual	1
life	1
its	1
due)	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
grieved	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
parting	1
from	1
him.	1
And	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
toward	1
Karataev.	1
	1
To	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
prisoners	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
seemed	1
a	1
most	1
ordinary	1
soldier.	1
They	1
called	1
him	1
"little	1
falcon"	1
or	1
"Platosha,"	1
chaffed	1
him	1
good-naturedly,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
on	1
errands.	1
But	1
to	1
Pierre	1
he	1
always	1
remained	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seemed	1
that	1
first	1
night:	1
an	1
unfathomable,	1
rounded,	1
eternal	1
personification	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
simplicity	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
knew	1
nothing	1
by	1
heart	1
except	1
his	1
prayers.	1
When	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
he	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
conclude.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
Pierre,	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
would	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
repeat	1
them,	1
but	1
Platon	1
could	1
never	1
recall	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
a	1
moment	1
before,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
repeat	1
to	1
Pierre	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
song:	1
native	1
and	1
birch	1
tree	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
sick	1
occurred	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
when	1
spoken	1
and	1
not	1
sung,	1
no	1
meaning	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
could	1
not,	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
words	1
apart	1
from	1
their	1
context.	1
Every	1
word	1
and	1
action	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
an	1
activity	1
unknown	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
life.	1
But	1
his	1
life,	1
as	1
he	1
regarded	1
it,	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
as	1
a	1
separate	1
thing.	1
It	1
had	1
meaning	1
only	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
conscious.	1
His	1
words	1
and	1
actions	1
flowed	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
evenly,	1
inevitably,	1
and	1
spontaneously	1
as	1
fragrance	1
exhales	1
from	1
a	1
flower.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
value	1
or	1
significance	1
of	1
any	1
word	1
or	1
deed	1
taken	1
separately.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
heard	1
from	1
Nicholas	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
at	1
Yaroslavl	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
prepared	1
to	1
go	1
there,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
aunt's	1
efforts	1
to	1
dissuade	1
her--and	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
go	1
herself	1
but	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
nephew	1
with	1
her.	1
Whether	1
it	1
were	1
difficult	1
or	1
easy,	1
possible	1
or	1
impossible,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know:	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
duty,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
herself,	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
her	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
perhaps	1
dying,	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
possible	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
prepared	1
to	1
set	1
off.	1
That	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
himself,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
attributed	1
to	1
his	1
being	1
too	1
weak	1
to	1
write	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
considering	1
the	1
long	1
journey	1
too	1
hard	1
and	1
too	1
dangerous	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
start.	1
Her	1
equipages	1
were	1
the	1
huge	1
family	1
coach	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
traveled	1
to	1
Voronezh,	1
a	1
semiopen	1
trap,	1
and	1
a	1
baggage	1
cart.	1
With	1
her	1
traveled	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
tutor,	1
her	1
old	1
nurse,	1
three	1
maids,	1
Tikhon,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
footman	1
and	1
courier	1
her	1
aunt	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
accompany	1
her.	1
	1
The	1
usual	1
route	1
through	1
Moscow	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
of,	1
and	1
the	1
roundabout	1
way	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
through	1
Lipetsk,	1
Ryazan,	1
Vladimir,	1
and	1
Shuya	1
was	1
very	1
long	1
and,	1
as	1
post	1
horses	1
were	1
not	1
everywhere	1
obtainable,	1
very	1
difficult,	1
and	1
near	1
Ryazan	1
where	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
shown	1
themselves	1
was	1
even	1
dangerous.	1
	1
During	1
this	1
difficult	1
journey	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
Dessalles,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
servants	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
her	1
energy	1
and	1
firmness	1
of	1
spirit.	1
She	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
later	1
and	1
rose	1
earlier	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
no	1
difficulties	1
daunted	1
her.	1
Thanks	1
to	1
her	1
activity	1
and	1
energy,	1
which	1
infected	1
her	1
fellow	1
travelers,	1
they	1
approached	1
Yaroslavl	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
week.	1
	1
The	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
stay	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
Her	1
love	1
for	1
Rostov	1
no	1
longer	1
tormented	1
or	1
agitated	1
her.	1
It	1
filled	1
her	1
whole	1
soul,	1
had	1
become	1
an	1
integral	1
part	1
of	1
herself,	1
and	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
struggled	1
against	1
it.	1
Latterly	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
and	1
was	1
beloved,	1
though	1
she	1
never	1
said	1
this	1
definitely	1
to	1
herself	1
in	1
words.	1
She	1
had	1
become	1
convinced	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
her	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
Nicholas,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
Not	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
had	1
Nicholas	1
alluded	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
relations	1
with	1
Natasha	1
might,	1
if	1
he	1
recovered,	1
be	1
renewed,	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
saw	1
by	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
this.	1
	1
Yet	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that,	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
her--considerate,	1
delicate,	1
and	1
loving--not	1
only	1
remained	1
unchanged,	1
but	1
it	1
sometimes	1
seemed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
glad	1
that	1
the	1
family	1
connection	1
between	1
them	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
friendship	1
more	1
freely.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
only	1
time	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
beloved,	1
and	1
was	1
happy	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
But	1
this	1
happiness	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
spiritual	1
nature	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
her	1
feeling	1
grief	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
with	1
full	1
force;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
that	1
spiritual	1
tranquility	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
made	1
it	1
the	1
more	1
possible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
full	1
play	1
to	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
brother.	1
That	1
feeling	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
leaving	1
Voronezh	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
off,	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
careworn,	1
despairing	1
face,	1
felt	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
fall	1
ill	1
on	1
the	1
journey.	1
But	1
the	1
very	1
difficulties	1
and	1
preoccupations	1
of	1
the	1
journey,	1
which	1
she	1
took	1
so	1
actively	1
in	1
hand,	1
saved	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
from	1
her	1
grief	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
strength.	1
	1
As	1
always	1
happens	1
when	1
traveling,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
itself,	1
forgetting	1
its	1
object.	1
But	1
as	1
she	1
approached	1
Yaroslavl	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
await	1
her	1
there--not	1
after	1
many	1
days,	1
but	1
that	1
very	1
evening--again	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
agitation	1
increased	1
to	1
its	1
utmost	1
limit.	1
	1
The	1
courier	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
on	1
in	1
advance	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
staying	1
in	1
Yaroslavl,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
condition	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was,	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
big	1
coach	1
just	1
entering	1
the	1
town	1
gates	1
was	1
appalled	1
by	1
the	1
terrible	1
pallor	1
of	1
the	1
princess'	1
face	1
that	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
everything,	1
your	1
excellency:	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
are	1
staying	1
at	1
the	1
merchant	1
Bronnikov's	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
Square	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
here,	1
right	1
above	1
the	1
Volga,"	1
said	1
the	1
courier.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
frightened	1
inquiry,	1
not	1
understanding	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
chiefly	1
wanted	1
to	1
know:	1
how	1
was	1
her	1
brother?	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
put	1
that	1
question	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
the	1
prince?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"His	1
excellency	1
is	1
staying	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
them."	1
	1
"Then	1
he	1
is	1
alive,"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice:	1
"How	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"The	1
servants	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
the	1
same."	1
	1
What	1
"still	1
the	1
same"	1
might	1
mean	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
ask,	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
unnoticed	1
glance	1
at	1
little	1
seven-year-old	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
looking	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
town,	1
she	1
bowed	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
raise	1
it	1
again	1
till	1
the	1
heavy	1
coach,	1
rumbling,	1
shaking	1
and	1
swaying,	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop.	1
The	1
carriage	1
steps	1
clattered	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
let	1
down.	1
	1
The	1
carriage	1
door	1
was	1
opened.	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
there	1
was	1
water--a	1
great	1
river--and	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
a	1
porch.	1
There	1
were	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
entrance:	1
servants,	1
and	1
a	1
rosy	1
girl	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
plait	1
of	1
black	1
hair,	1
smiling	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
an	1
unpleasantly	1
affected	1
way.	1
(This	1
was	1
Sonya.)	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
steps.	1
"This	1
way,	1
this	1
way!"	1
said	1
the	1
girl,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
artificial	1
smile,	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
facing	1
an	1
elderly	1
woman	1
of	1
Oriental	1
type,	1
who	1
came	1
rapidly	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
emotion.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
countess.	1
She	1
embraced	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
"Mon	1
enfant!"	1
she	1
muttered,	1
"je	1
vous	1
aime	1
et	1
vous	1
connais	1
depuis	1
longtemps."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"My	1
child!	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
a	1
long	1
time."	1
	1
	1
Despite	1
her	1
excitement,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
realized	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
her.	1
Hardly	1
knowing	1
how	1
she	1
did	1
it,	1
she	1
contrived	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
few	1
polite	1
phrases	1
in	1
French	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
addressed	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
asked:	1
"How	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"The	1
doctor	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
danger,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
and	1
her	1
gesture	1
conveyed	1
a	1
contradiction	1
of	1
her	1
words.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
him--can	1
I?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"One	1
moment,	1
Princess,	1
one	1
moment,	1
my	1
dear!	1
Is	1
this	1
his	1
son?"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
turning	1
to	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
who	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
with	1
Dessalles.	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
room	1
for	1
everybody,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
big	1
house.	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
lovely	1
boy!"	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
took	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
Sonya	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
The	1
countess	1
caressed	1
the	1
boy,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
welcomed	1
the	1
princess.	1
He	1
had	1
changed	1
very	1
much	1
since	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
last	1
seen	1
him.	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
brisk,	1
cheerful,	1
self-assured	1
old	1
man;	1
now	1
he	1
seemed	1
a	1
pitiful,	1
bewildered	1
person.	1
While	1
talking	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
continually	1
looked	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
everyone	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
right	1
thing.	1
After	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
property,	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
accustomed	1
groove	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
significance	1
and	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
life.	1
	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
one	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
brother	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
her	1
vexation	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
all	1
she	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
entertain	1
her	1
and	1
pretending	1
to	1
admire	1
her	1
nephew,	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
her	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
submitting,	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
to	1
this	1
new	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
entered.	1
She	1
knew	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
necessary,	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
vexed	1
with	1
these	1
people.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
niece,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
introducing	1
Sonya--"You	1
don't	1
know	1
her,	1
Princess?"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
turned	1
to	1
Sonya	1
and,	1
trying	1
to	1
stifle	1
the	1
hostile	1
feeling	1
that	1
arose	1
in	1
her	1
toward	1
the	1
girl,	1
she	1
kissed	1
her.	1
But	1
she	1
felt	1
oppressed	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
mood	1
of	1
everyone	1
around	1
her	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
heart.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
she	1
asked	1
again,	1
addressing	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
downstairs.	1
Natasha	1
is	1
with	1
him,"	1
answered	1
Sonya,	1
flushing.	1
"We	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
ask.	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
tired,	1
Princess."	1
	1
Tears	1
of	1
vexation	1
showed	1
themselves	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
eyes.	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
countess	1
again	1
how	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him,	1
when	1
light,	1
impetuous,	1
and	1
seemingly	1
buoyant	1
steps	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
saw	1
Natasha	1
coming	1
in,	1
almost	1
running--	1
that	1
Natasha	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
liked	1
so	1
little	1
at	1
their	1
meeting	1
in	1
Moscow	1
long	1
since.	1
	1
But	1
hardly	1
had	1
the	1
princess	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
before	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
comrade	1
in	1
her	1
grief,	1
and	1
consequently	1
a	1
friend.	1
She	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
embraced	1
her,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Natasha,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
bed,	1
heard	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
arrival,	1
she	1
softly	1
left	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
those	1
swift	1
steps	1
that	1
had	1
sounded	1
buoyant	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
agitated	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room--that	1
of	1
love--boundless	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved;	1
and	1
of	1
pity,	1
suffering	1
for	1
others,	1
and	1
passionate	1
desire	1
to	1
give	1
herself	1
entirely	1
to	1
helping	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
Natasha's	1
heart	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
herself	1
or	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
relations	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
with	1
her	1
acute	1
sensibility,	1
understood	1
all	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
at	1
Natasha's	1
face,	1
and	1
wept	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder	1
with	1
sorrowful	1
pleasure.	1
	1
"Come,	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
Mary,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
leading	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
room.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
raised	1
her	1
head,	1
dried	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
from	1
her	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
learn	1
everything.	1
	1
"How..."	1
she	1
began	1
her	1
question	1
but	1
stopped	1
short.	1
	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
ask,	1
or	1
to	1
answer,	1
in	1
words.	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
all	1
more	1
clearly	1
and	1
profoundly.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
her,	1
but	1
seemed	1
afraid	1
and	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
to	1
say	1
all	1
she	1
knew	1
or	1
not;	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
before	1
those	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
which	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
which	1
she	1
saw.	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
Natasha's	1
lips	1
twitched,	1
ugly	1
wrinkles	1
gathered	1
round	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
covering	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
understood.	1
	1
But	1
she	1
still	1
hoped,	1
and	1
asked,	1
in	1
words	1
she	1
herself	1
did	1
not	1
trust:	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
is	1
his	1
wound?	1
What	1
is	1
his	1
general	1
condition?"	1
	1
"You,	1
you...	1
will	1
see,"	1
was	1
all	1
Natasha	1
could	1
say.	1
	1
They	1
sat	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
downstairs	1
near	1
his	1
room	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
off	1
crying	1
and	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
calm	1
faces.	1
	1
"How	1
has	1
his	1
whole	1
illness	1
gone?	1
Is	1
it	1
long	1
since	1
he	1
grew	1
worse?	1
When	1
did	1
this	1
happen?"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
inquired.	1
	1
Natasha	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
at	1
first	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
danger	1
from	1
his	1
feverish	1
condition	1
and	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
suffered,	1
but	1
at	1
Troitsa	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
afraid	1
of	1
gangrene.	1
That	1
danger	1
had	1
also	1
passed.	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
Yaroslavl	1
the	1
wound	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
fester	1
(Natasha	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
festering)	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
festering	1
might	1
take	1
a	1
normal	1
course.	1
Then	1
fever	1
set	1
in,	1
but	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
fever	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
serious.	1
	1
"But	1
two	1
days	1
ago	1
this	1
suddenly	1
happened,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
struggling	1
with	1
her	1
sobs.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
why,	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
like."	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
weaker?	1
Thinner?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
that,	1
but	1
worse.	1
You	1
will	1
see.	1
O,	1
Mary,	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
good,	1
he	1
cannot,	1
cannot	1
live,	1
because..."	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
opened	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
familiar	1
movement	1
and	1
let	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
her,	1
the	1
princess	1
felt	1
the	1
sobs	1
in	1
her	1
throat.	1
Hard	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
prepare	1
herself,	1
and	1
now	1
tried	1
to	1
remain	1
tranquil,	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
tears.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
understood	1
what	1
Natasha	1
had	1
meant	1
by	1
the	1
words:	1
"two	1
days	1
ago	1
this	1
suddenly	1
happened."	1
She	1
understood	1
those	1
words	1
to	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
suddenly	1
softened	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
softening	1
and	1
gentleness	1
were	1
signs	1
of	1
approaching	1
death.	1
As	1
she	1
stepped	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
already	1
saw	1
in	1
imagination	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
remembered	1
it	1
in	1
childhood,	1
a	1
gentle,	1
mild,	1
sympathetic	1
face	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
rarely	1
shown,	1
and	1
which	1
therefore	1
affected	1
her	1
very	1
strongly.	1
She	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
speak	1
soft,	1
tender	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
such	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
uttered	1
before	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
and	1
would	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
Yet	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
in.	1
The	1
sobs	1
rose	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
in	1
her	1
throat	1
as	1
she	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
clearly	1
distinguished	1
his	1
form	1
and	1
her	1
shortsighted	1
eyes	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
his	1
features,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
met	1
his	1
gaze.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
squirrel-fur	1
dressing	1
gown	1
on	1
a	1
divan,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
pillows.	1
He	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
pale.	1
In	1
one	1
thin,	1
translucently	1
white	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
handkerchief,	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
stroked	1
the	1
delicate	1
mustache	1
he	1
had	1
grown,	1
moving	1
his	1
fingers	1
slowly.	1
His	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
at	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
entered.	1
	1
On	1
seeing	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
meeting	1
his	1
eyes	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
pace	1
suddenly	1
slackened,	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
tears	1
dry	1
up	1
and	1
her	1
sobs	1
ceased.	1
She	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
guilty	1
and	1
grew	1
timid	1
on	1
catching	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
eyes.	1
	1
"But	1
in	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
blame?"	1
she	1
asked	1
herself.	1
And	1
his	1
cold,	1
stern	1
look	1
replied:	1
"Because	1
you	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
while	1
I..."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
deep	1
gaze	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
look	1
not	1
outwards	1
but	1
inwards	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
almost	1
hostile	1
expression	1
as	1
he	1
slowly	1
regarded	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
Natasha.	1
	1
He	1
kissed	1
his	1
sister,	1
holding	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
as	1
was	1
their	1
wont.	1
	1
"How	1
are	1
you,	1
Mary?	1
How	1
did	1
you	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
here?"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
calm	1
and	1
aloof	1
as	1
his	1
look.	1
	1
Had	1
he	1
screamed	1
in	1
agony,	1
that	1
scream	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
struck	1
such	1
horror	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
heart	1
as	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
brought	1
little	1
Nicholas?"	1
he	1
asked	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
slow,	1
quiet	1
manner	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
obvious	1
effort	1
to	1
remember.	1
	1
"How	1
are	1
you	1
now?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
herself	1
surprised	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"That,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
doctor,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
and	1
again	1
making	1
an	1
evident	1
effort	1
to	1
be	1
affectionate,	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only	1
(his	1
words	1
clearly	1
did	1
not	1
correspond	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts):	1
	1
"Merci,	1
chere	1
amie,	1
d'etre	1
venue."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Thank	1
you	1
for	1
coming,	1
my	1
dear."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
pressure	1
made	1
him	1
wince	1
just	1
perceptibly.	1
He	1
was	1
silent,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
She	1
now	1
understood	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
two	1
days	1
before.	1
In	1
his	1
words,	1
his	1
tone,	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
that	1
calm,	1
almost	1
antagonistic	1
look	1
could	1
be	1
felt	1
an	1
estrangement	1
from	1
everything	1
belonging	1
to	1
this	1
world,	1
terrible	1
in	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
alive.	1
Evidently	1
only	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
did	1
he	1
understand	1
anything	1
living;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
failed	1
to	1
understand,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
lacked	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
understood	1
something	1
else--something	1
the	1
living	1
did	1
not	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
understand--and	1
which	1
wholly	1
occupied	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"There,	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
strangely	1
fate	1
has	1
brought	1
us	1
together,"	1
said	1
he,	1
breaking	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
"She	1
looks	1
after	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
time."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
heard	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
such	1
a	1
thing.	1
He,	1
the	1
sensitive,	1
tender	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
say	1
that,	1
before	1
her	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
who	1
loved	1
him?	1
Had	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
live	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
that	1
offensively	1
cold	1
tone.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dying,	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
pity	1
her	1
and	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
speak	1
like	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
presence?	1
The	1
only	1
explanation	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
indifferent,	1
because	1
something	1
else,	1
much	1
more	1
important,	1
had	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
disconnected	1
and	1
continually	1
broke	1
off.	1
	1
"Mary	1
came	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
Ryazan,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
that	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
sister	1
Mary,	1
and	1
only	1
after	1
calling	1
her	1
so	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
did	1
Natasha	1
notice	1
it	1
herself.	1
	1
"Really?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"They	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
all	1
Moscow	1
has	1
been	1
burned	1
down,	1
and	1
that..."	1
	1
Natasha	1
stopped.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
talk.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
listen,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
say	1
it's	1
burned,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"It's	1
a	1
great	1
pity,"	1
and	1
he	1
gazed	1
straight	1
before	1
him,	1
absently	1
stroking	1
his	1
mustache	1
with	1
his	1
fingers.	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
have	1
met	1
Count	1
Nicholas,	1
Mary?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
suddenly	1
said,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
speak	1
pleasantly	1
to	1
them.	1
"He	1
wrote	1
here	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
great	1
liking	1
to	1
you,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
simply	1
and	1
calmly,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
complex	1
significance	1
his	1
words	1
had	1
for	1
living	1
people.	1
"If	1
you	1
liked	1
him	1
too,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
married,"	1
he	1
added	1
rather	1
more	1
quickly,	1
as	1
if	1
pleased	1
at	1
having	1
found	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
seeking.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
heard	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
for	1
her,	1
except	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
how	1
far	1
away	1
he	1
now	1
was	1
from	1
everything	1
living.	1
	1
"Why	1
talk	1
of	1
me?"	1
she	1
said	1
quietly	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
felt	1
her	1
glance,	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
All	1
three	1
were	1
again	1
silent.	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
would	1
you	1
like..."	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
suddenly	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice,	1
"would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
little	1
Nicholas?	1
He	1
is	1
always	1
talking	1
about	1
you!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
just	1
perceptibly	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
knew	1
his	1
face	1
so	1
well,	1
saw	1
with	1
horror	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
smile	1
with	1
pleasure	1
or	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
but	1
with	1
quiet,	1
gentle	1
irony	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
she	1
was	1
trying	1
what	1
she	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
means	1
of	1
arousing	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Is	1
he	1
quite	1
well?"	1
	1
When	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
room	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
cry,	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
crying.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
kissed	1
him	1
and	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
When	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
led	1
away,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
again	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
tears	1
any	1
longer	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
attentively.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
about	1
Nicholas?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
nodded	1
her	1
head,	1
weeping.	1
	1
"Mary,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Gosp..."	1
but	1
he	1
broke	1
off.	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
say?"	1
	1
"Nothing.	1
You	1
mustn't	1
cry	1
here,"	1
he	1
said,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
cold	1
expression.	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
began	1
to	1
cry,	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
crying	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
without	1
a	1
father.	1
With	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
things	1
from	1
their	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
must	1
seem	1
sad!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"But	1
how	1
simple	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
"The	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
sow	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
reap,	1
yet	1
your	1
Father	1
feedeth	1
them,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary;	1
"but	1
no,	1
they	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
their	1
own	1
way,	1
they	1
won't	1
understand!	1
They	1
can't	1
understand	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
feelings	1
they	1
prize	1
so--all	1
our	1
feelings,	1
all	1
those	1
ideas	1
that	1
seem	1
so	1
important	1
to	1
us,	1
are	1
unnecessary.	1
We	1
cannot	1
understand	1
one	1
another,"	1
and	1
he	1
remained	1
silent.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
little	1
son	1
was	1
seven.	1
He	1
could	1
scarcely	1
read,	1
and	1
knew	1
nothing.	1
After	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
lived	1
through	1
many	1
things,	1
gaining	1
knowledge,	1
observation,	1
and	1
experience,	1
but	1
had	1
he	1
possessed	1
all	1
the	1
faculties	1
he	1
afterwards	1
acquired,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
better	1
or	1
more	1
profound	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
between	1
his	1
father,	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
then.	1
He	1
understood	1
it	1
completely,	1
and,	1
leaving	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
crying,	1
went	1
silently	1
up	1
to	1
Natasha	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
looked	1
shyly	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
beautiful,	1
thoughtful	1
eyes,	1
then	1
his	1
uplifted,	1
rosy	1
upper	1
lip	1
trembled	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
her	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
avoided	1
Dessalles	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
who	1
caressed	1
him	1
and	1
either	1
sat	1
alone	1
or	1
came	1
timidly	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
or	1
to	1
Natasha	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
seemed	1
even	1
fonder	1
than	1
of	1
his	1
aunt,	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
them	1
quietly	1
and	1
shyly.	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
left	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
she	1
fully	1
understood	1
what	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
had	1
told	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
any	1
more	1
to	1
Natasha	1
of	1
hopes	1
of	1
saving	1
his	1
life.	1
She	1
took	1
turns	1
with	1
her	1
beside	1
his	1
sofa,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
cry	1
any	1
more,	1
but	1
prayed	1
continually,	1
turning	1
in	1
soul	1
to	1
that	1
Eternal	1
and	1
Unfathomable,	1
whose	1
presence	1
above	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
evident.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
know	1
he	1
would	1
die,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dying	1
and	1
was	1
already	1
half	1
dead.	1
He	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
an	1
aloofness	1
from	1
everything	1
earthly	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
joyous	1
lightness	1
of	1
existence.	1
Without	1
haste	1
or	1
agitation	1
he	1
awaited	1
what	1
was	1
coming.	1
That	1
inexorable,	1
eternal,	1
distant,	1
and	1
unknown	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
continually	1
all	1
his	1
life--was	1
now	1
near	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
lightness	1
he	1
experienced,	1
almost	1
comprehensible	1
and	1
palpable...	1
	1
	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
feared	1
the	1
end.	1
He	1
had	1
twice	1
experienced	1
that	1
terribly	1
tormenting	1
fear	1
of	1
death--the	1
end--but	1
now	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
understood	1
that	1
fear.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
felt	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
shell	1
spun	1
like	1
a	1
top	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fallow	1
field,	1
the	1
bushes,	1
and	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
death.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
after	1
being	1
wounded	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
eternal,	1
unfettered	1
love	1
had	1
instantly	1
unfolded	1
itself	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
as	1
if	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
bondage	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
restrained	1
it,	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
feared	1
death	1
and	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
hours	1
of	1
solitude,	1
suffering,	1
and	1
partial	1
delirium	1
he	1
spent	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
wounded,	1
the	1
more	1
deeply	1
he	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
new	1
principle	1
of	1
eternal	1
love	1
revealed	1
to	1
him,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
detached	1
himself	1
from	1
earthly	1
life.	1
To	1
love	1
everything	1
and	1
everybody	1
and	1
always	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
oneself	1
for	1
love	1
meant	1
not	1
to	1
love	1
anyone,	1
not	1
to	1
live	1
this	1
earthly	1
life.	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
imbued	1
he	1
became	1
with	1
that	1
principle	1
of	1
love,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
renounced	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
completely	1
he	1
destroyed	1
that	1
dreadful	1
barrier	1
which--in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
such	1
love--	1
stands	1
between	1
life	1
and	1
death.	1
When	1
during	1
those	1
first	1
days	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
die,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself:	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it?	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better!"	1
	1
But	1
after	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
Mytishchi	1
when,	1
half	1
delirious,	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
longed	1
appear	1
before	1
him	1
and,	1
having	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
had	1
shed	1
gentle,	1
happy	1
tears,	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
particular	1
woman	1
again	1
crept	1
unobserved	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
life.	1
And	1
joyful	1
and	1
agitating	1
thoughts	1
began	1
to	1
occupy	1
his	1
mind.	1
Recalling	1
the	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
ambulance	1
station	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Kuragin,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
regain	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
then	1
had,	1
but	1
was	1
tormented	1
by	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
Kuragin	1
was	1
alive.	1
And	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
inquire.	1
	1
His	1
illness	1
pursued	1
its	1
normal	1
physical	1
course,	1
but	1
what	1
Natasha	1
referred	1
to	1
when	1
she	1
said:	1
"This	1
suddenly	1
happened,"	1
had	1
occurred	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
arrived.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
spiritual	1
struggle	1
between	1
life	1
and	1
death,	1
in	1
which	1
death	1
gained	1
the	1
victory.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
unexpected	1
realization	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
valued	1
life	1
as	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
a	1
last,	1
though	1
ultimately	1
vanquished,	1
attack	1
of	1
terror	1
before	1
the	1
unknown.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evening.	1
As	1
usual	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
was	1
slightly	1
feverish,	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
preternaturally	1
clear.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
doze.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
happiness	1
seized	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
she	1
has	1
come!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was:	1
in	1
Sonya's	1
place	1
sat	1
Natasha	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
in	1
noiselessly.	1
	1
Since	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
looking	1
after	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
experienced	1
this	1
physical	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
nearness.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
placed	1
sideways,	1
screening	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
candle	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
knitting	1
a	1
stocking.	1
She	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
knit	1
stockings	1
since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
casually	1
mentioned	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
nursed	1
the	1
sick	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
old	1
nurses	1
who	1
knit	1
stockings,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
soothing	1
in	1
the	1
knitting	1
of	1
stockings.	1
The	1
needles	1
clicked	1
lightly	1
in	1
her	1
slender,	1
rapidly	1
moving	1
hands,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
clearly	1
see	1
the	1
thoughtful	1
profile	1
of	1
her	1
drooping	1
face.	1
She	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
ball	1
rolled	1
off	1
her	1
knees.	1
She	1
started,	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
screening	1
the	1
candle	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
stooped	1
carefully	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
and	1
exact	1
movement,	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
ball,	1
and	1
regained	1
her	1
former	1
position.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
without	1
moving	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
draw	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
after	1
stooping,	1
but	1
refrained	1
from	1
doing	1
so	1
and	1
breathed	1
cautiously.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
Troitsa	1
monastery	1
they	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
lived	1
he	1
would	1
always	1
thank	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
wound	1
which	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
together	1
again,	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
future.	1
	1
"Can	1
it	1
or	1
can	1
it	1
not	1
be?"	1
he	1
now	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
click	1
of	1
the	1
steel	1
needles.	1
"Can	1
fate	1
have	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
strangely	1
only	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die?...	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
only	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
falsity?	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
I	1
love	1
her?"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
groaned,	1
from	1
a	1
habit	1
acquired	1
during	1
his	1
sufferings.	1
	1
On	1
hearing	1
that	1
sound	1
Natasha	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
stocking,	1
leaned	1
nearer	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
suddenly,	1
noticing	1
his	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
stepped	1
lightly	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
asleep?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
you	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
I	1
felt	1
you	1
come	1
in.	1
No	1
one	1
else	1
gives	1
me	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
soft	1
tranquillity	1
that	1
you	1
do...	1
that	1
light.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
weep	1
for	1
joy."	1
	1
Natasha	1
drew	1
closer	1
to	1
him.	1
Her	1
face	1
shone	1
with	1
rapturous	1
joy.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
too	1
much!	1
More	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
	1
"And	1
I!"--She	1
turned	1
away	1
for	1
an	1
instant.	1
"Why	1
too	1
much?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Why	1
too	1
much?...	1
Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
in	1
your	1
soul,	1
your	1
whole	1
soul--shall	1
I	1
live?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
of	1
it,	1
sure!"	1
Natasha	1
almost	1
shouted,	1
taking	1
hold	1
of	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
passionate	1
movement.	1
	1
He	1
remained	1
silent	1
awhile.	1
	1
"How	1
good	1
it	1
would	1
be!"	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
kissed	1
it.	1
	1
Natasha	1
felt	1
happy	1
and	1
agitated,	1
but	1
at	1
once	1
remembered	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
quiet.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
slept,"	1
she	1
said,	1
repressing	1
her	1
joy.	1
"Try	1
to	1
sleep...	1
please!"	1
	1
He	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
released	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
candle	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
position.	1
Twice	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
met	1
his	1
beaming	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
set	1
herself	1
a	1
task	1
on	1
her	1
stocking	1
and	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
finished.	1
	1
Soon	1
he	1
really	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
long	1
and	1
suddenly	1
awoke	1
with	1
a	1
start	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
perspiration.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
now	1
always	1
occupied	1
his	1
mind--about	1
life	1
and	1
death,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
about	1
death.	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
nearer	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
"Love?	1
What	1
is	1
love?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
"Love	1
hinders	1
death.	1
Love	1
is	1
life.	1
All,	1
everything	1
that	1
I	1
understand,	1
I	1
understand	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
love.	1
Everything	1
is,	1
everything	1
exists,	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
love.	1
Everything	1
is	1
united	1
by	1
it	1
alone.	1
Love	1
is	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
die	1
means	1
that	1
I,	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
love,	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
eternal	1
source."	1
These	1
thoughts	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
comforting.	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
thoughts.	1
Something	1
was	1
lacking	1
in	1
them,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
clear,	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
one-sidedly	1
personal	1
and	1
brain-spun.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
former	1
agitation	1
and	1
obscurity.	1
He	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
He	1
dreamed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
in,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
unwounded.	1
Many	1
various,	1
indifferent,	1
and	1
insignificant	1
people	1
appeared	1
before	1
him.	1
He	1
talked	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
discussed	1
something	1
trivial.	1
They	1
were	1
preparing	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
somewhere.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
dimly	1
realized	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
trivial	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
important	1
cares,	1
but	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
speak,	1
surprising	1
them	1
by	1
empty	1
witticisms.	1
Gradually,	1
unnoticed,	1
all	1
these	1
persons	1
began	1
to	1
disappear	1
and	1
a	1
single	1
question,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
closed	1
door,	1
superseded	1
all	1
else.	1
He	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
bolt	1
and	1
lock	1
it.	1
Everything	1
depended	1
on	1
whether	1
he	1
was,	1
or	1
was	1
not,	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
lock	1
it.	1
He	1
went,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
hurry,	1
but	1
his	1
legs	1
refused	1
to	1
move	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
lock	1
the	1
door	1
though	1
he	1
painfully	1
strained	1
all	1
his	1
powers.	1
He	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
an	1
agonizing	1
fear.	1
And	1
that	1
fear	1
was	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
death.	1
It	1
stood	1
behind	1
the	1
door.	1
But	1
just	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
clumsily	1
creeping	1
toward	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
dreadful	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
was	1
already	1
pressing	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
forcing	1
its	1
way	1
in.	1
Something	1
not	1
human--death--was	1
breaking	1
in	1
through	1
that	1
door,	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
out.	1
He	1
seized	1
the	1
door,	1
making	1
a	1
final	1
effort	1
to	1
hold	1
it	1
back--to	1
lock	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible--but	1
his	1
efforts	1
were	1
weak	1
and	1
clumsy	1
and	1
the	1
door,	1
pushed	1
from	1
behind	1
by	1
that	1
terror,	1
opened	1
and	1
closed	1
again.	1
	1
Once	1
again	1
it	1
pushed	1
from	1
outside.	1
His	1
last	1
superhuman	1
efforts	1
were	1
vain	1
and	1
both	1
halves	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
noiselessly	1
opened.	1
It	1
entered,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
death,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
died.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
died,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
died,	1
having	1
made	1
an	1
effort,	1
he	1
awoke.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
death!	1
I	1
died--and	1
woke	1
up.	1
Yes,	1
death	1
is	1
an	1
awakening!"	1
And	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
grew	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
the	1
veil	1
that	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
concealed	1
the	1
unknown	1
was	1
lifted	1
from	1
his	1
spiritual	1
vision.	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
powers	1
till	1
then	1
confined	1
within	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
liberated,	1
and	1
that	1
strange	1
lightness	1
did	1
not	1
again	1
leave	1
him.	1
	1
When,	1
waking	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
perspiration,	1
he	1
moved	1
on	1
the	1
divan,	1
Natasha	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
strangely,	1
not	1
understanding.	1
	1
That	1
was	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
arrival.	1
From	1
that	1
day,	1
as	1
the	1
doctor	1
expressed	1
it,	1
the	1
wasting	1
fever	1
assumed	1
a	1
malignant	1
character,	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
Natasha,	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
terrible	1
moral	1
symptoms	1
which	1
to	1
her	1
were	1
more	1
convincing.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
day	1
an	1
awakening	1
from	1
life	1
came	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
awakening	1
from	1
sleep.	1
And	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
life	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
slower	1
than	1
an	1
awakening	1
from	1
sleep	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
terrible	1
or	1
violent	1
in	1
this	1
comparatively	1
slow	1
awakening.	1
	1
His	1
last	1
days	1
and	1
hours	1
passed	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
and	1
simple	1
way.	1
Both	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
him,	1
felt	1
this.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
weep	1
or	1
shudder	1
and	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
they	1
themselves	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
attending	1
on	1
him	1
(he	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there,	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them)	1
but	1
on	1
what	1
reminded	1
them	1
most	1
closely	1
of	1
him--his	1
body.	1
Both	1
felt	1
this	1
so	1
strongly	1
that	1
the	1
outward	1
and	1
terrible	1
side	1
of	1
death	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
foment	1
their	1
grief.	1
Neither	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
nor	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
did	1
they	1
weep,	1
nor	1
did	1
they	1
ever	1
talk	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
about	1
him.	1
They	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
express	1
in	1
words	1
what	1
they	1
understood.	1
	1
They	1
both	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sinking	1
slowly	1
and	1
quietly,	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper,	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
right.	1
	1
He	1
confessed,	1
and	1
received	1
communion:	1
everyone	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
him.	1
When	1
they	1
brought	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
the	1
boy's	1
and	1
turned	1
away,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
hard	1
and	1
sad	1
(Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
understood	1
that)	1
but	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
required	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
bless	1
the	1
boy,	1
he	1
did	1
what	1
was	1
demanded	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
else	1
he	1
should	1
do.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
last	1
convulsions	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
the	1
spirit	1
was	1
leaving,	1
occurred,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
present.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
over?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
when	1
his	1
body	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
lain	1
motionless,	1
growing	1
cold	1
before	1
them.	1
Natasha	1
went	1
up,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
close	1
them.	1
She	1
closed	1
them	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
kiss	1
them,	1
but	1
clung	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
reminded	1
her	1
most	1
nearly	1
of	1
him--his	1
body.	1
	1
"Where	1
has	1
he	1
gone?	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
now?..."	1
	1
When	1
the	1
body,	1
washed	1
and	1
dressed,	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
on	1
a	1
table,	1
everyone	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
wept.	1
	1
Little	1
Nicholas	1
cried	1
because	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
rent	1
by	1
painful	1
perplexity.	1
The	1
countess	1
and	1
Sonya	1
cried	1
from	1
pity	1
for	1
Natasha	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
more.	1
The	1
old	1
count	1
cried	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
before	1
long,	1
he,	1
too,	1
must	1
take	1
the	1
same	1
terrible	1
step.	1
	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
also	1
wept	1
now,	1
but	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
personal	1
grief;	1
they	1
wept	1
with	1
a	1
reverent	1
and	1
softening	1
emotion	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
at	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
simple	1
and	1
solemn	1
mystery	1
of	1
death	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
accomplished	1
in	1
their	1
presence.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Man's	1
mind	1
cannot	1
grasp	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
their	1
completeness,	1
but	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
find	1
those	1
causes	1
is	1
implanted	1
in	1
man's	1
soul.	1
And	1
without	1
considering	1
the	1
multiplicity	1
and	1
complexity	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
taken	1
separately	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
cause,	1
he	1
snatches	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
approximation	1
to	1
a	1
cause	1
that	1
seems	1
to	1
him	1
intelligible	1
and	1
says:	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
cause!"	1
In	1
historical	1
events	1
(where	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
observation)	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
most	1
primitive	1
approximation	1
to	1
present	1
itself	1
was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
and,	1
after	1
that,	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
prominent	1
position--the	1
heroes	1
of	1
history.	1
But	1
we	1
need	1
only	1
penetrate	1
to	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
any	1
historic	1
event--which	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
mass	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it--to	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
historic	1
hero	1
does	1
not	1
control	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
but	1
is	1
itself	1
continually	1
controlled.	1
It	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference	1
whether	1
we	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
historical	1
events	1
this	1
way	1
or	1
that;	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
West	1
moved	1
on	1
the	1
East	1
because	1
Napoleon	1
wished	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
this	1
happened	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
happen,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
between	1
those	1
who	1
declared	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
stationary	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
planets	1
moved	1
round	1
it	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
admitted	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
upheld	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
knew	1
there	1
were	1
laws	1
directing	1
its	1
movement	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
planets.	1
There	1
is,	1
and	1
can	1
be,	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
an	1
historical	1
event	1
except	1
the	1
one	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
causes.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
laws	1
directing	1
events,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
laws	1
are	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
conscious	1
of	1
others	1
we	1
cannot	1
comprehend.	1
The	1
discovery	1
of	1
these	1
laws	1
is	1
only	1
possible	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
quite	1
abandoned	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
cause	1
in	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
man,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
planets	1
was	1
possible	1
only	1
when	1
men	1
abandoned	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
fixity	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
The	1
historians	1
consider	1
that,	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
Moscow	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
its	1
destruction	1
by	1
fire,	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
episode	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
of	1
1812	1
was	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
from	1
the	1
Ryazana	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Tarutino	1
camp--the	1
so-called	1
flank	1
march	1
across	1
the	1
Krasnaya	1
Pakhra	1
River.	1
They	1
ascribe	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
that	1
achievement	1
of	1
genius	1
to	1
different	1
men	1
and	1
dispute	1
as	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
honor	1
is	1
due.	1
Even	1
foreign	1
historians,	1
including	1
the	1
French,	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
when	1
they	1
speak	1
of	1
that	1
flank	1
march.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
understand	1
why	1
military	1
writers,	1
and	1
following	1
them	1
others,	1
consider	1
this	1
flank	1
march	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
profound	1
conception	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
man	1
who	1
saved	1
Russia	1
and	1
destroyed	1
Napoleon.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
understand	1
where	1
the	1
profundity	1
and	1
genius	1
of	1
this	1
movement	1
lay,	1
for	1
not	1
much	1
mental	1
effort	1
was	1
needed	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
position	1
for	1
an	1
army	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
being	1
attacked	1
is	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
most	1
provisions;	1
and	1
even	1
a	1
dull	1
boy	1
of	1
thirteen	1
could	1
have	1
guessed	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
position	1
for	1
an	1
army	1
after	1
its	1
retreat	1
from	1
Moscow	1
in	1
1812	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
So	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
understand	1
by	1
what	1
reasoning	1
the	1
historians	1
reach	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
this	1
maneuver	1
was	1
a	1
profound	1
one.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
understand	1
just	1
why	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
maneuver	1
was	1
calculated	1
to	1
save	1
Russia	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
French;	1
for	1
this	1
flank	1
march,	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
preceded,	1
accompanied,	1
or	1
followed	1
by	1
other	1
circumstances,	1
might	1
have	1
proved	1
ruinous	1
to	1
the	1
Russians	1
and	1
salutary	1
for	1
the	1
French.	1
If	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
really	1
began	1
to	1
improve	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
that	1
march,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
follow	1
that	1
the	1
march	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
That	1
flank	1
march	1
might	1
not	1
only	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
advantage	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
but	1
might	1
in	1
other	1
circumstances	1
have	1
led	1
to	1
its	1
destruction.	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
Moscow	1
not	1
burned	1
down?	1
If	1
Murat	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Russians?	1
If	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
not	1
remained	1
inactive?	1
If	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
at	1
Krasnaya	1
Pakhra	1
had	1
given	1
battle	1
as	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
Barclay	1
advised?	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
the	1
French	1
attacked	1
the	1
Russians	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
marching	1
beyond	1
the	1
Pakhra?	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
if	1
on	1
approaching	1
Tarutino,	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
Russians	1
with	1
but	1
a	1
tenth	1
of	1
the	1
energy	1
he	1
had	1
shown	1
when	1
he	1
attacked	1
them	1
at	1
Smolensk?	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
the	1
French	1
moved	1
on	1
Petersburg?...	1
In	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
eventualities	1
the	1
flank	1
march	1
that	1
brought	1
salvation	1
might	1
have	1
proved	1
disastrous.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
and	1
most	1
incomprehensible	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
people	1
studying	1
history	1
deliberately	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
that	1
this	1
flank	1
march	1
cannot	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
man,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
ever	1
foresaw	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
reality,	1
like	1
the	1
retreat	1
from	1
Fili,	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suggest	1
itself	1
to	1
anyone	1
in	1
its	1
entirety,	1
but	1
resulted--moment	1
by	1
moment,	1
step	1
by	1
step,	1
event	1
by	1
event--from	1
an	1
endless	1
number	1
of	1
most	1
diverse	1
circumstances	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
seen	1
in	1
its	1
entirety	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
accomplished	1
and	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
past.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
council	1
at	1
Fili	1
the	1
prevailing	1
thought	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
naturally	1
suggesting	1
itself,	1
namely,	1
a	1
direct	1
retreat	1
by	1
the	1
Nizhni	1
road.	1
In	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
voted	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
retreat,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
well-known	1
conversation	1
after	1
the	1
council,	1
between	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
and	1
Lanskoy,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
commissariat	1
department.	1
Lanskoy	1
informed	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
supplies	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
stored	1
along	1
the	1
Oka	1
in	1
the	1
Tula	1
and	1
Ryazan	1
provinces,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
retreated	1
on	1
Nizhni	1
the	1
army	1
would	1
be	1
separated	1
from	1
its	1
supplies	1
by	1
the	1
broad	1
river	1
Oka,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
crossed	1
early	1
in	1
winter.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
indication	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
deviating	1
from	1
what	1
had	1
previously	1
seemed	1
the	1
most	1
natural	1
course--a	1
direct	1
retreat	1
on	1
Nizhni-Novgorod.	1
The	1
army	1
turned	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
south,	1
along	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
its	1
supplies.	1
Subsequently	1
the	1
inactivity	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
(who	1
even	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army),	1
concern	1
for	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
arsenal	1
at	1
Tula,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
its	1
supplies	1
caused	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
turn	1
still	1
further	1
south	1
to	1
the	1
Tula	1
road.	1
Having	1
crossed	1
over,	1
by	1
a	1
forced	1
march,	1
to	1
the	1
Tula	1
road	1
beyond	1
the	1
Pakhra,	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
intended	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Podolsk	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
Tarutino	1
position;	1
but	1
innumerable	1
circumstances	1
and	1
the	1
reappearance	1
of	1
French	1
troops	1
who	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
lost	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
Russians,	1
and	1
projects	1
of	1
giving	1
battle,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
provisions	1
in	1
Kaluga	1
province,	1
obliged	1
our	1
army	1
to	1
turn	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
to	1
cross	1
from	1
the	1
Tula	1
to	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Tarutino,	1
which	1
was	1
between	1
the	1
roads	1
along	1
which	1
those	1
supplies	1
lay.	1
Just	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
precisely	1
when,	1
or	1
by	1
whom,	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
move	1
to	1
Tarutino.	1
Only	1
when	1
the	1
army	1
had	1
got	1
there,	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
innumerable	1
and	1
varying	1
forces,	1
did	1
people	1
begin	1
to	1
assure	1
themselves	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
desired	1
this	1
movement	1
and	1
long	1
ago	1
foreseen	1
its	1
result.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
The	1
famous	1
flank	1
movement	1
merely	1
consisted	1
in	1
this:	1
after	1
the	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
ceased,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
continually	1
retreating	1
straight	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
invaders,	1
deviated	1
from	1
that	1
direct	1
course	1
and,	1
not	1
finding	1
itself	1
pursued,	1
was	1
naturally	1
drawn	1
toward	1
the	1
district	1
where	1
supplies	1
were	1
abundant.	1
	1
If	1
instead	1
of	1
imagining	1
to	1
ourselves	1
commanders	1
of	1
genius	1
leading	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
we	1
picture	1
that	1
army	1
without	1
any	1
leaders,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
anything	1
but	1
make	1
a	1
return	1
movement	1
toward	1
Moscow,	1
describing	1
an	1
arc	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
where	1
most	1
provisions	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
richest.	1
	1
That	1
movement	1
from	1
the	1
Nizhni	1
to	1
the	1
Ryazan,	1
Tula,	1
and	1
Kaluga	1
roads	1
was	1
so	1
natural	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
Russian	1
marauders	1
moved	1
in	1
that	1
direction,	1
and	1
demands	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
for	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
army	1
that	1
way.	1
At	1
Tarutino	1
Kutuzov	1
received	1
what	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
reprimand	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor	1
for	1
having	1
moved	1
his	1
army	1
along	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
road,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
letter	1
indicated	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
very	1
position	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
occupied	1
near	1
Kaluga.	1
	1
Having	1
rolled	1
like	1
a	1
ball	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
impetus	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army--when	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
that	1
impetus	1
was	1
exhausted	1
and	1
no	1
fresh	1
push	1
was	1
received--	1
assumed	1
the	1
position	1
natural	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
merit	1
lay,	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
strategic	1
maneuver	1
of	1
genius,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
understood	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened.	1
He	1
alone	1
then	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army's	1
inactivity,	1
he	1
alone	1
continued	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
victory,	1
he	1
alone--who	1
as	1
commander-in-chief	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
eager	1
to	1
attack--employed	1
his	1
whole	1
strength	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
from	1
useless	1
engagements.	1
	1
The	1
beast	1
wounded	1
at	1
Borodino	1
was	1
lying	1
where	1
the	1
fleeing	1
hunter	1
had	1
left	1
him;	1
but	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
alive,	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
strong	1
and	1
merely	1
lying	1
low,	1
the	1
hunter	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
moan.	1
	1
The	1
moan	1
of	1
that	1
wounded	1
beast	1
(the	1
French	1
army)	1
which	1
betrayed	1
its	1
calamitous	1
condition	1
was	1
the	1
sending	1
of	1
Lauriston	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
camp	1
with	1
overtures	1
for	1
peace.	1
	1
Napoleon,	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
assurance	1
that	1
whatever	1
entered	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
right,	1
wrote	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
that	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
meaningless.	1
	1
MONSIEUR	1
LE	1
PRINCE	1
KOUTOUZOV:	1
I	1
am	1
sending	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
adjutants-general	1
to	1
discuss	1
several	1
interesting	1
questions	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
Highness	1
to	1
credit	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
to	1
you,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
expresses	1
the	1
sentiment	1
of	1
esteem	1
and	1
special	1
regard	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
entertained	1
for	1
your	1
person.	1
This	1
letter	1
having	1
no	1
other	1
object,	1
I	1
pray	1
God,	1
monsieur	1
le	1
Prince	1
Koutouzov,	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
in	1
His	1
holy	1
and	1
gracious	1
protection!	1
	1
NAPOLEON	1
MOSCOW,	1

	1
Kutuzov	1
replied:	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
cursed	1
by	1
posterity	1
were	1
I	1
looked	1
on	1
as	1
the	1
initiator	1
of	1
a	1
settlement	1
of	1
any	1
sort.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
present	1
spirit	1
of	1
my	1
nation."	1
But	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
exert	1
all	1
his	1
powers	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
troops	1
from	1
attacking.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
month	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
were	1
pillaging	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
were	1
quietly	1
encamped	1
at	1
Tarutino,	1
a	1
change	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
relative	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
armies--both	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
number--as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
superiority	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
side.	1
Though	1
the	1
condition	1
and	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
were	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
Russians,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
that	1
change	1
occurred	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
attacking	1
at	1
once	1
showed	1
itself	1
by	1
countless	1
signs.	1
These	1
signs	1
were:	1
Lauriston's	1
mission;	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
provisions	1
at	1
Tarutino;	1
the	1
reports	1
coming	1
in	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
inactivity	1
and	1
disorder	1
of	1
the	1
French;	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
recruits	1
to	1
our	1
regiments;	1
the	1
fine	1
weather;	1
the	1
long	1
rest	1
the	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
had	1
enjoyed,	1
and	1
the	1
impatience	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
assembled	1
for,	1
which	1
usually	1
shows	1
itself	1
in	1
an	1
army	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
resting;	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
so	1
long	1
lost	1
sight	1
of,	1
was	1
doing;	1
the	1
boldness	1
with	1
which	1
our	1
outposts	1
now	1
scouted	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
stationed	1
at	1
Tarutino;	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
easy	1
successes	1
gained	1
by	1
peasants	1
and	1
guerrilla	1
troops	1
over	1
the	1
French,	1
the	1
envy	1
aroused	1
by	1
this;	1
the	1
desire	1
for	1
revenge	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
every	1
Russian	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
(above	1
all)	1
a	1
dim	1
consciousness	1
in	1
every	1
soldier's	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
relative	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
had	1
changed	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
advantage	1
was	1
now	1
on	1
our	1
side.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
substantial	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
relative	1
strength,	1
and	1
an	1
advance	1
had	1
become	1
inevitable.	1
And	1
at	1
once,	1
as	1
a	1
clock	1
begins	1
to	1
strike	1
and	1
chime	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
minute	1
hand	1
has	1
completed	1
a	1
full	1
circle,	1
this	1
change	1
was	1
shown	1
by	1
an	1
increased	1
activity,	1
whirring,	1
and	1
chiming	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
spheres.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
commanded	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
his	1
staff,	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
from	1
Petersburg.	1
Before	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
a	1
detailed	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
up	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
for	1
his	1
guidance.	1
Though	1
this	1
plan	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
our	1
hands,	1
it	1
was	1
approved	1
by	1
the	1
staff	1
and	1
accepted	1
as	1
a	1
basis	1
for	1
action.	1
Kutuzov	1
only	1
replied	1
that	1
movements	1
arranged	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
were	1
always	1
difficult	1
to	1
execute.	1
So	1
fresh	1
instructions	1
were	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
difficulties	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
encountered,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
fresh	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
watch	1
Kutuzov's	1
actions	1
and	1
report	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
Besides	1
this,	1
the	1
whole	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
now	1
reorganized.	1
The	1
posts	1
left	1
vacant	1
by	1
Bagration,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
and	1
by	1
Barclay,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
in	1
dudgeon,	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
filled.	1
Very	1
serious	1
consideration	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
put	1
A	1
in	1
B's	1
place	1
and	1
B	1
in	1
D's,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
put	1
D	1
in	1
A's	1
place,	1
and	1
so	1
on--as	1
if	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
A's	1
or	1
B's	1
satisfaction	1
depended	1
on	1
this.	1
	1
As	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
hostility	1
between	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
Bennigsen,	1
his	1
Chief	1
of	1
Staff,	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
confidential	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
these	1
transfers,	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
complicated	1
play	1
of	1
parties	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
among	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
A	1
was	1
undermining	1
B,	1
D	1
was	1
undermining	1
C,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
in	1
all	1
possible	1
combinations	1
and	1
permutations.	1
In	1
all	1
these	1
plottings	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
intrigue	1
was	1
generally	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
war,	1
which	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
believed	1
they	1
were	1
directing;	1
but	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
went	1
on	1
independently	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
go:	1
that	1
is,	1
never	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
people	1
devised,	1
but	1
flowing	1
always	1
from	1
the	1
essential	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
masses.	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spheres	1
did	1
all	1
these	1
schemes,	1
crossings,	1
and	1
interminglings	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
true	1
reflection	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
to	1
happen.	1
	1
Prince	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich!	1
(wrote	1
the	1
Emperor	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
October	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
that	1
reached	1
Kutuzov	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
at	1
Tarutino)	1
Since	1
September	1
2	1
Moscow	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Your	1
last	1
reports	1
were	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
twentieth,	1
and	1
during	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
not	1
only	1
has	1
no	1
action	1
been	1
taken	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
capital,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
last	1
report	1
you	1
have	1
even	1
retreated	1
farther.	1
Serpukhov	1
is	1
already	1
occupied	1
by	1
an	1
enemy	1
detachment	1
and	1
Tula	1
with	1
its	1
famous	1
arsenal	1
so	1
indispensable	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
is	1
in	1
danger.	1
From	1
General	1
Wintzingerode's	1
reports,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
an	1
enemy	1
corps	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
is	1
moving	1
on	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
road.	1
Another	1
corps	1
of	1
several	1
thousand	1
men	1
is	1
moving	1
on	1
Dmitrov.	1
A	1
third	1
has	1
advanced	1
along	1
the	1
Vladimir	1
road,	1
and	1
a	1
fourth,	1
rather	1
considerable	1
detachment	1
is	1
stationed	1
between	1
Ruza	1
and	1
Mozhaysk.	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
as	1
late	1
as	1
the	1
twenty-fifth.	1
In	1
view	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
information,	1
when	1
the	1
enemy	1
has	1
scattered	1
his	1
forces	1
in	1
large	1
detachments,	1
and	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
Guards	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
enemy's	1
forces	1
confronting	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
considerable	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
allow	1
of	1
your	1
taking	1
the	1
offensive?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
is	1
probably	1
pursuing	1
you	1
with	1
detachments,	1
or	1
at	1
most	1
with	1
an	1
army	1
corps	1
much	1
weaker	1
than	1
the	1
army	1
entrusted	1
to	1
you.	1
It	1
would	1
seem	1
that,	1
availing	1
yourself	1
of	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
you	1
might	1
advantageously	1
attack	1
a	1
weaker	1
one	1
and	1
annihilate	1
him,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
retreat,	1
retaining	1
in	1
our	1
hands	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
provinces	1
now	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
thereby	1
averting	1
danger	1
from	1
Tula	1
and	1
other	1
towns	1
in	1
the	1
interior.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
responsible	1
if	1
the	1
enemy	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
direct	1
a	1
force	1
of	1
any	1
size	1
against	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
threaten	1
this	1
capital	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
retain	1
many	1
troops;	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
entrusted	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
acting	1
with	1
resolution	1
and	1
energy,	1
you	1
have	1
ample	1
means	1
to	1
avert	1
this	1
fresh	1
calamity.	1
Remember	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
still	1
to	1
answer	1
to	1
our	1
offended	1
country	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
You	1
have	1
experienced	1
my	1
readiness	1
to	1
reward	1
you.	1
That	1
readiness	1
will	1
not	1
weaken	1
in	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
and	1
Russia	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
expect	1
from	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
zeal,	1
firmness,	1
and	1
success	1
which	1
your	1
intellect,	1
military	1
talent,	1
and	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
you	1
command	1
justify	1
us	1
in	1
expecting.	1
	1
But	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
this	1
letter,	1
which	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
real	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
itself	1
felt	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
was	1
dispatched,	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
found	1
himself	1
unable	1
any	1
longer	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
commanded	1
from	1
attacking	1
and	1
a	1
battle	1
had	1
taken	1
place.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
October	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
Shapovalov,	1
who	1
was	1
out	1
scouting,	1
killed	1
one	1
hare	1
and	1
wounded	1
another.	1
Following	1
the	1
wounded	1
hare	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
far	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
Murat's	1
army,	1
encamped	1
there	1
without	1
any	1
precautions.	1
The	1
Cossack	1
laughingly	1
told	1
his	1
comrades	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
almost	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
A	1
cornet,	1
hearing	1
the	1
story,	1
informed	1
his	1
commander.	1
	1
The	1
Cossack	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
and	1
questioned.	1
The	1
Cossack	1
officers	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
this	1
chance	1
to	1
capture	1
some	1
horses,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
superior	1
officers,	1
who	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
higher	1
authorities,	1
reported	1
the	1
incident	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
on	1
the	1
staff.	1
The	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
exceedingly	1
strained.	1
Ermolov	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
Bennigsen	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
previously	1
and	1
had	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
influence	1
with	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
to	1
induce	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
offensive.	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
asking	1
for.	1
I	1
need	1
only	1
advise	1
anything	1
and	1
his	1
Highness	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
opposite,"	1
replied	1
Bennigsen.	1
	1
The	1
Cossack's	1
report,	1
confirmed	1
by	1
horse	1
patrols	1
who	1
were	1
sent	1
out,	1
was	1
the	1
final	1
proof	1
that	1
events	1
had	1
matured.	1
The	1
tightly	1
coiled	1
spring	1
was	1
released,	1
the	1
clock	1
began	1
to	1
whirr	1
and	1
the	1
chimes	1
to	1
play.	1
Despite	1
all	1
his	1
supposed	1
power,	1
his	1
intellect,	1
his	1
experience,	1
and	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
men,	1
Kutuzov--having	1
taken	1
into	1
consideration	1
the	1
Cossack's	1
report,	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Bennigsen	1
who	1
sent	1
personal	1
reports	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
the	1
wishes	1
he	1
supposed	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
hold,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
generals	1
expressed	1
the	1
same	1
wish--could	1
no	1
longer	1
check	1
the	1
inevitable	1
movement,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
useless	1
and	1
harmful--gave	1
his	1
approval,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
the	1
accomplished	1
fact.	1

	1
Bennigsen's	1
note	1
and	1
the	1
Cossack's	1
information	1
that	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
unguarded	1
were	1
merely	1
final	1
indications	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
order	1
an	1
attack,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
fifth	1
of	1
October.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
of	1
October	1
Kutuzov	1
signed	1
the	1
dispositions.	1
Toll	1

them	1
to	1
Ermolov,	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
further	1
arrangements.	1
	1
"All	1
right--all	1
right.	1
I	1
haven't	1
time	1
just	1
now,"	1
replied	1
Ermolov,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
hut.	1
	1
The	1
dispositions	1
drawn	1
up	1
by	1
Toll	1
were	1
very	1
good.	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
Austerlitz	1
dispositions,	1
it	1
was	1
written--though	1
not	1
in	1
German	1
this	1
time:	1
	1
"The	1
First	1
Column	1
will	1
march	1
here	1
and	1
here,"	1
"the	1
Second	1
Column	1
will	1
march	1
there	1
and	1
there,"	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
and	1
on	1
paper,	1
all	1
these	1
columns	1
arrived	1
at	1
their	1
places	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Everything	1
had	1
been	1
admirably	1
thought	1
out	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
dispositions,	1
and	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case,	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
column	1
reached	1
its	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
necessary	1
number	1
of	1
copies	1
of	1
the	1
dispositions	1
had	1
been	1
prepared,	1
an	1
officer	1
was	1
summoned	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
Ermolov	1
to	1
deal	1
with.	1
A	1
young	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
Kutuzov's	1
orderly,	1
pleased	1
at	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
mission	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
went	1
to	1
Ermolov's	1
quarters.	1
	1
"Gone	1
away,"	1
said	1
Ermolov's	1
orderly.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
with	1
whom	1
Ermolov	1
was	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
"No,	1
and	1
the	1
general's	1
out	1
too."	1
	1
The	1
officer,	1
mounting	1
his	1
horse,	1
rode	1
off	1
to	1
someone	1
else.	1
	1
"No,	1
he's	1
gone	1
out."	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
they	1
don't	1
make	1
me	1
responsible	1
for	1
this	1
delay!	1
What	1
a	1
nuisance	1
it	1
is!"	1
thought	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
round	1
the	1
whole	1
camp.	1
One	1
man	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Ermolov	1
ride	1
past	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
generals,	1
others	1
said	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
returned	1
home.	1
The	1
officer	1
searched	1
till	1
six	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
without	1
even	1
stopping	1
to	1
eat.	1
Ermolov	1
was	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
The	1
officer	1
snatched	1
a	1
little	1
food	1
at	1
a	1
comrade's,	1
and	1
rode	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
vanguard	1
to	1
find	1
Miloradovich.	1
Miloradovich	1
too	1
was	1
away,	1
but	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
ball	1
at	1
General	1
Kikin's	1
and	1
that	1
Ermolov	1
was	1
probably	1
there	1
too.	1
	1
"But	1
where	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
there,	1
over	1
at	1
Echkino,"	1
said	1
a	1
Cossack	1
officer,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
country	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
far	1
distance.	1
	1
"What,	1
outside	1
our	1
line?"	1
	1
"They've	1
put	1
two	1
regiments	1
as	1
outposts,	1
and	1
they're	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
spree	1
there,	1
it's	1
awful!	1
Two	1
bands	1
and	1
three	1
sets	1
of	1
singers!"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
rode	1
out	1
beyond	1
our	1
lines	1
to	1
Echkino.	1
While	1
still	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
he	1
heard	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
the	1
merry	1
sounds	1
of	1
a	1
soldier's	1
dance	1
song	1
proceeding	1
from	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
meadows...	1
in	1
the	1
meadows!"	1
he	1
heard,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
whistling	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
torban,	1
drowned	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
by	1
shouts.	1
These	1
sounds	1
made	1
his	1
spirits	1
rise,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
blamed	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
executed	1
sooner	1
the	1
important	1
order	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
past	1
eight	1
o'clock.	1
He	1
dismounted	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
country	1
house	1
which	1
had	1
remained	1
intact	1
between	1
the	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
forces.	1
In	1
the	1
refreshment	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
hall,	1
footmen	1
were	1
bustling	1
about	1
with	1
wine	1
and	1
viands.	1
Groups	1
of	1
singers	1
stood	1
outside	1
the	1
windows.	1
The	1
officer	1
was	1
admitted	1
and	1
immediately	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
generals	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
together,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
Ermolov's	1
big	1
imposing	1
figure.	1
They	1
all	1
had	1
their	1
coats	1
unbuttoned	1
and	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle	1
with	1
flushed	1
and	1
animated	1
faces,	1
laughing	1
loudly.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
short	1
handsome	1
general	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face	1
was	1
dancing	1
the	1
trepak	1
with	1
much	1
spirit	1
and	1
agility.	1
	1
"Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!	1
Bravo,	1
Nicholas	1
Ivanych!	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
felt	1
that	1
by	1
arriving	1
with	1
important	1
orders	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
doubly	1
to	1
blame,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
preferred	1
to	1
wait;	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
espied	1
him	1
and,	1
hearing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
about,	1
informed	1
Ermolov.	1
	1
Ermolov	1
came	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and,	1
hearing	1
what	1
the	1
officer	1
had	1
to	1
say,	1
took	1
the	1
papers	1
from	1
him	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
just	1
by	1
chance?"	1
said	1
a	1
comrade,	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
that	1
evening,	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
referring	1
to	1
Ermolov.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
trick.	1
It	1
was	1
done	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
get	1
Konovnitsyn	1
into	1
trouble.	1
You'll	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
mess	1
there'll	1
be	1
tomorrow."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
decrepit	1
Kutuzov,	1
having	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
early,	1
said	1
his	1
prayers,	1
dressed,	1
and,	1
with	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
consciousness	1
of	1
having	1
to	1
direct	1
a	1
battle	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of,	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
caleche	1
and	1
drove	1
from	1
Letashovka	1
(a	1
village	1
three	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
miles	1
from	1
Tarutino)	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
attacking	1
columns	1
were	1
to	1
meet.	1
He	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
caleche,	1
dozing	1
and	1
waking	1
up	1
by	1
turns,	1
and	1
listening	1
for	1
any	1
sound	1
of	1
firing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
as	1
an	1
indication	1
that	1
the	1
action	1
had	1
begun.	1
But	1
all	1
was	1
still	1
quiet.	1
A	1
damp	1
dull	1
autumn	1
morning	1
was	1
just	1
dawning.	1
On	1
approaching	1
Tarutino	1
Kutuzov	1
noticed	1
cavalrymen	1
leading	1
their	1
horses	1
to	1
water	1
across	1
the	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
driving.	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
searchingly,	1
stopped	1
his	1
carriage,	1
and	1
inquired	1
what	1
regiment	1
they	1
belonged	1
to.	1
They	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
column	1
that	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
far	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
in	1
ambush	1
long	1
before	1
then.	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
mistake,"	1
thought	1
the	1
old	1
commander-in-chief.	1
But	1
a	1
little	1
further	1
on	1
he	1
saw	1
infantry	1
regiments	1
with	1
their	1
arms	1
piled	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
only	1
partly	1
dressed,	1
eating	1
their	1
rye	1
porridge	1
and	1
carrying	1
fuel.	1
He	1
sent	1
for	1
an	1
officer.	1
The	1
officer	1
reported	1
that	1
no	1
order	1
to	1
advance	1
had	1
been	1
received.	1
	1
"How!	1
Not	1
rec..."	1
Kutuzov	1
began,	1
but	1
checked	1
himself	1
immediately	1
and	1
sent	1
for	1
a	1
senior	1
officer.	1
Getting	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
caleche,	1
he	1
waited	1
with	1
drooping	1
head	1
and	1
breathing	1
heavily,	1
pacing	1
silently	1
up	1
and	1
down.	1
When	1
Eykhen,	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
staff	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
summoned,	1
appeared,	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
purple	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
not	1
because	1
that	1
officer	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
mistake,	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
sufficient	1
importance	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
vent	1
his	1
wrath	1
on.	1
Trembling	1
and	1
panting	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
fell	1
into	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
fury	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
sometimes	1
used	1
to	1
roll	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
Eykhen,	1
threatening	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
shouting	1
and	1
loading	1
him	1
with	1
gross	1
abuse.	1
Another	1
man,	1
Captain	1
Brozin,	1
who	1
happened	1
to	1
turn	1
up	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
blame,	1
suffered	1
the	1
same	1
fate.	1
	1
"What	1
sort	1
of	1
another	1
blackguard	1
are	1
you?	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
shot!	1
Scoundrels!"	1
yelled	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice,	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
reeling.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
suffering	1
physically.	1
He,	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
a	1
Serene	1
Highness	1
who	1
everybody	1
said	1
possessed	1
powers	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
man	1
had	1
ever	1
had	1
in	1
Russia,	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
this	1
position--made	1
the	1
laughingstock	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army!	1
"I	1
needn't	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
pray	1
about	1
today,	1
or	1
have	1
kept	1
awake	1
thinking	1
everything	1
over	1
all	1
night,"	1
thought	1
he	1
to	1
himself.	1
"When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
chit	1
of	1
an	1
officer	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
mock	1
me	1
so...	1
and	1
now!"	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
physical	1
suffering	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
corporal	1
punishment,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
avoid	1
expressing	1
it	1
by	1
cries	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
distress.	1
But	1
his	1
strength	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
fail	1
him,	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
him,	1
conscious	1
of	1
having	1
said	1
much	1
that	1
was	1
amiss,	1
he	1
again	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
caleche	1
and	1
drove	1
back	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
His	1
wrath,	1
once	1
expended,	1
did	1
not	1
return,	1
and	1
blinking	1
feebly	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
excuses	1
and	1
self-justifications	1
(Ermolov	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
till	1
the	1
next	1
day)	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
insistence	1
of	1
Bennigsen,	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
and	1
Toll	1
that	1
the	1
movement	1
that	1
had	1
miscarried	1
should	1
be	1
executed	1
next	1
day.	1
And	1
once	1
more	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
to	1
consent.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
troops	1
assembled	1
in	1
their	1
appointed	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
advanced	1
during	1
the	1
night.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
autumn	1
night	1
with	1
dark	1
purple	1
clouds,	1
but	1
no	1
rain.	1
The	1
ground	1
was	1
damp	1
but	1
not	1
muddy,	1
and	1
the	1
troops	1
advanced	1
noiselessly,	1
only	1
occasionally	1
a	1
jingling	1
of	1
the	1
artillery	1
could	1
be	1
faintly	1
heard.	1
The	1
men	1
were	1
forbidden	1
to	1
talk	1
out	1
loud,	1
to	1
smoke	1
their	1
pipes,	1
or	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
light,	1
and	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
prevent	1
their	1
horses	1
neighing.	1
The	1
secrecy	1
of	1
the	1
undertaking	1
heightened	1
its	1
charm	1
and	1
they	1
marched	1
gaily.	1
Some	1
columns,	1
supposing	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
their	1
destination,	1
halted,	1
piled	1
arms,	1
and	1
settled	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
cold	1
ground,	1
but	1
the	1
majority	1
marched	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
arrived	1
at	1
places	1
where	1
they	1
evidently	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been.	1
	1
Only	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
Cossacks	1
(the	1
least	1
important	1
detachment	1
of	1
all)	1
got	1
to	1
his	1
appointed	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time.	1
This	1
detachment	1
halted	1
at	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
a	1
forest,	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
leading	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Stromilova	1
to	1
Dmitrovsk.	1
	1
Toward	1
dawn,	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
dozed	1
off,	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
a	1
deserter	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
being	1
brought	1
to	1
him.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
Polish	1
sergeant	1
of	1
Poniatowski's	1
corps,	1
who	1
explained	1
in	1
Polish	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
slighted	1
in	1
the	1
service:	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
an	1
officer,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
braver	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
pay	1
them	1
out.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
Murat	1
was	1
spending	1
the	1
night	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
where	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
men	1
he	1
would	1
capture	1
him	1
alive.	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov	1
consulted	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers.	1
	1
The	1
offer	1
was	1
too	1
tempting	1
to	1
be	1
refused.	1
Everyone	1
volunteered	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
everybody	1
advised	1
making	1
the	1
attempt.	1
After	1
much	1
disputing	1
and	1
arguing,	1
Major-General	1
Grekov	1
with	1
two	1
Cossack	1
regiments	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
Polish	1
sergeant.	1
	1
"Now,	1
remember,"	1
said	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov	1
to	1
the	1
sergeant	1
at	1
parting,	1
"if	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
lying	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
hanged	1
like	1
a	1
dog;	1
but	1
if	1
it's	1
true	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
hundred	1
gold	1
pieces!"	1
	1
Without	1
replying,	1
the	1
sergeant,	1
with	1
a	1
resolute	1
air,	1
mounted	1
and	1
rode	1
away	1
with	1
Grekov	1
whose	1
men	1
had	1
quickly	1
assembled.	1
They	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov,	1
having	1
seen	1
Grekov	1
off,	1
returned,	1
shivering	1
from	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
dawn	1
and	1
excited	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
undertaken	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
responsibility,	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
enemy	1
camp,	1
now	1
just	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
deceptive	1
light	1
of	1
dawn	1
and	1
the	1
dying	1
campfires.	1
Our	1
columns	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
appear	1
on	1
an	1
open	1
declivity	1
to	1
his	1
right.	1
He	1
looked	1
in	1
that	1
direction,	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
columns	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
visible	1
quite	1
far	1
off,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
French	1
camp,	1
and	1
his	1
keen-sighted	1
adjutant	1
confirmed	1
this.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
too	1
late,"	1
said	1
Count	1
Orlov,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
when	1
someone	1
we	1
have	1
trusted	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
it	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
quite	1
clear	1
and	1
obvious	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
sergeant	1
was	1
an	1
impostor,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lied,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
attack	1
would	1
be	1
ruined	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
those	1
two	1
regiments,	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
lead	1
away	1
heaven	1
only	1
knew	1
where.	1
How	1
could	1
one	1
capture	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
from	1
among	1
such	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
troops!	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
rascal	1
was	1
lying,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"They	1
can	1
still	1
be	1
called	1
back,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
suite,	1
who	1
like	1
Count	1
Orlov	1
felt	1
distrustful	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
enemy's	1
camp.	1
	1
"Eh?	1
Really...	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
Should	1
we	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
on	1
or	1
not?"	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
have	1
them	1
fetched	1
back?"	1
	1
"Fetch	1
them	1
back,	1
fetch	1
them	1
back!"	1
said	1
Count	1
Orlov	1
with	1
sudden	1
determination,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
"It	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
late.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
light."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
after	1
Grekov.	1
When	1
Grekov	1
returned,	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov,	1
excited	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
abandoned	1
attempt	1
and	1
by	1
vainly	1
awaiting	1
the	1
infantry	1
columns	1
that	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
appear,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
proximity	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
resolved	1
to	1
advance.	1
All	1
his	1
men	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
excitement.	1
	1
"Mount!"	1
he	1
commanded	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
The	1
men	1
took	1
their	1
places	1
and	1
crossed	1
themselves....	1
"Forward,	1
with	1
God's	1
aid!"	1
	1
"Hurrah-ah-ah!"	1
reverberated	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
the	1
Cossack	1
companies,	1
trailing	1
their	1
lances	1
and	1
advancing	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
as	1
if	1
poured	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
sack,	1
dashed	1
gaily	1
across	1
the	1
brook	1
toward	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
One	1
desperate,	1
frightened	1
yell	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
French	1
soldier	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
Cossacks,	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
camp,	1
undressed	1
and	1
only	1
just	1
waking	1
up,	1
ran	1
off	1
in	1
all	1
directions,	1
abandoning	1
cannons,	1
muskets,	1
and	1
horses.	1
	1
Had	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
pursued	1
the	1
French,	1
without	1
heeding	1
what	1
was	1
behind	1
and	1
around	1
them,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
captured	1
Murat	1
and	1
everything	1
there.	1
That	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
officers	1
desired.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
budge	1
when	1
once	1
they	1
had	1
got	1
booty	1
and	1
prisoners.	1
None	1
of	1
them	1
listened	1
to	1
orders.	1
Fifteen	1
hundred	1
prisoners	1
and	1
thirty-eight	1
guns	1
were	1
taken	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
besides	1
standards	1
and	1
(what	1
seemed	1
most	1
important	1
to	1
the	1
Cossacks)	1
horses,	1
saddles,	1
horsecloths,	1
and	1
the	1
like.	1
All	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
dealt	1
with,	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
guns	1
secured,	1
the	1
booty	1
divided--not	1
without	1
some	1
shouting	1
and	1
even	1
a	1
little	1
fighting	1
among	1
themselves--and	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
all	1
busied	1
themselves.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
not	1
being	1
farther	1
pursued,	1
began	1
to	1
recover	1
themselves:	1
they	1
formed	1
into	1
detachments	1
and	1
began	1
firing.	1
Orlov-Denisov,	1
still	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
columns	1
to	1
arrive,	1
advanced	1
no	1
further.	1
	1
Meantime,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
dispositions	1
which	1
said	1
that	1
"the	1
First	1
Column	1
will	1
march"	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
the	1
infantry	1
of	1
the	1
belated	1
columns,	1
commanded	1
by	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
directed	1
by	1
Toll,	1
had	1
started	1
in	1
due	1
order	1
and,	1
as	1
always	1
happens,	1
had	1
got	1
somewhere,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
their	1
appointed	1
places.	1
As	1
always	1
happens	1
the	1
men,	1
starting	1
cheerfully,	1
began	1
to	1
halt;	1
murmurs	1
were	1
heard,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
confusion,	1
and	1
finally	1
a	1
backward	1
movement.	1
Adjutants	1
and	1
generals	1
galloped	1
about,	1
shouted,	1
grew	1
angry,	1
quarreled,	1
said	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
quite	1
wrong	1
and	1
were	1
late,	1
gave	1
vent	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
abuse,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
gave	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
forward,	1
simply	1
to	1
get	1
somewhere.	1
"We	1
shall	1
get	1
somewhere	1
or	1
other!"	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
indeed	1
get	1
somewhere,	1
though	1
not	1
to	1
their	1
right	1
places;	1
a	1
few	1
eventually	1
even	1
got	1
to	1
their	1
right	1
place,	1
but	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
and	1
only	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
fired	1
at.	1
Toll,	1
who	1
in	1
this	1
battle	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
Weyrother	1
at	1
Austerlitz,	1
galloped	1
assiduously	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place,	1
finding	1
everything	1
upside	1
down	1
everywhere.	1
Thus	1
he	1
stumbled	1
on	1
Bagovut's	1
corps	1
in	1
a	1
wood	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
broad	1
daylight,	1
though	1
the	1
corps	1
should	1
long	1
before	1
have	1
joined	1
Orlov-Denisov.	1
Excited	1
and	1
vexed	1
by	1
the	1
failure	1
and	1
supposing	1
that	1
someone	1
must	1
be	1
responsible	1
for	1
it,	1
Toll	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
corps	1
and	1
began	1
upbraiding	1
him	1
severely,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
shot.	1
General	1
Bagovut,	1
a	1
fighting	1
old	1
soldier	1
of	1
placid	1
temperament,	1
being	1
also	1
upset	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
delay,	1
confusion,	1
and	1
cross-purposes,	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
rage	1
to	1
everybody's	1
surprise	1
and	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
character	1
and	1
said	1
disagreeable	1
things	1
to	1
Toll.	1
	1
"I	1
prefer	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
lessons	1
from	1
anyone,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
die	1
with	1
my	1
men	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
anybody,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
advanced	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
division.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
onto	1
a	1
field	1
under	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fire,	1
this	1
brave	1
general	1
went	1
straight	1
ahead,	1
leading	1
his	1
men	1
under	1
fire,	1
without	1
considering	1
in	1
his	1
agitation	1
whether	1
going	1
into	1
action	1
now,	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
division,	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
or	1
no.	1
Danger,	1
cannon	1
balls,	1
and	1
bullets	1
were	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
needed	1
in	1
his	1
angry	1
mood.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
bullets	1
killed	1
him,	1
and	1
other	1
bullets	1
killed	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
men.	1
And	1
his	1
division	1
remained	1
under	1
fire	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
quite	1
uselessly.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
another	1
column	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
attacked	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
the	1
front,	1
but	1
Kutuzov	1
accompanied	1
that	1
column.	1
He	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
confusion	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
this	1
battle	1
undertaken	1
against	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
held	1
the	1
troops	1
back.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
advance.	1
	1
He	1
rode	1
silently	1
on	1
his	1
small	1
gray	1
horse,	1
indolently	1
answering	1
suggestions	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
attack.	1
	1
"The	1
word	1
attack	1
is	1
always	1
on	1
your	1
tongue,	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
unable	1
to	1
execute	1
complicated	1
maneuvers,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Miloradovich	1
who	1
asked	1
permission	1
to	1
advance.	1
	1
"We	1
couldn't	1
take	1
Murat	1
prisoner	1
this	1
morning	1
or	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
time,	1
and	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
now!"	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
someone	1
else.	1
	1
When	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
rear--where	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
there	1
had	1
previously	1
been	1
nobody--there	1
were	1
now	1
two	1
battalions	1
of	1
Poles,	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
sidelong	1
glance	1
at	1
Ermolov	1
who	1
was	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
since	1
the	1
previous	1
day.	1
	1
"You	1
see!	1
They	1
are	1
asking	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
making	1
plans	1
of	1
all	1
kinds,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
one	1
gets	1
to	1
business	1
nothing	1
is	1
ready,	1
and	1
the	1
enemy,	1
forewarned,	1
takes	1
measures	1
accordingly."	1
	1
Ermolov	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
smiled	1
faintly	1
on	1
hearing	1
these	1
words.	1
He	1
understood	1
that	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
storm	1
had	1
blown	1
over,	1
and	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
would	1
content	1
himself	1
with	1
that	1
hint.	1
	1
"He's	1
having	1
a	1
little	1
fun	1
at	1
my	1
expense,"	1
said	1
Ermolov	1
softly,	1
nudging	1
with	1
his	1
knee	1
Raevski	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
this,	1
Ermolov	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
respectfully	1
remarked:	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
yet,	1
your	1
Highness--the	1
enemy	1
has	1
not	1
gone	1
away--if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
order	1
an	1
attack!	1
If	1
not,	1
the	1
Guards	1
will	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
see	1
a	1
little	1
smoke."	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Murat's	1
troops	1
were	1
in	1
retreat	1
he	1
ordered	1
an	1
advance,	1
though	1
at	1
every	1
hundred	1
paces	1
he	1
halted	1
for	1
three	1
quarters	1
of	1
an	1
hour.	1
	1
The	1
whole	1
battle	1
consisted	1
in	1
what	1
Orlov-Denisov's	1
Cossacks	1
had	1
done:	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
merely	1
lost	1
some	1
hundreds	1
of	1
men	1
uselessly.	1
	1
In	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
battle	1
Kutuzov	1
received	1
a	1
diamond	1
decoration,	1
and	1
Bennigsen	1
some	1
diamonds	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rubles,	1
others	1
also	1
received	1
pleasant	1
recognitions	1
corresponding	1
to	1
their	1
various	1
grades,	1
and	1
following	1
the	1
battle	1
fresh	1
changes	1
were	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
staff.	1
	1
"That's	1
how	1
everything	1
is	1
done	1
with	1
us,	1
all	1
topsy-turvy!"	1
said	1
the	1
Russian	1
officers	1
and	1
generals	1
after	1
the	1
Tarutino	1
battle,	1
letting	1
it	1
be	1
understood	1
that	1
some	1
fool	1
there	1
is	1
doing	1
things	1
all	1
wrong	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
ourselves	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
so,	1
just	1
as	1
people	1
speak	1
today.	1
But	1
people	1
who	1
talk	1
like	1
that	1
either	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
or	1
deliberately	1
deceive	1
themselves.	1
No	1
battle--Tarutino,	1
Borodino,	1
or	1
Austerlitz--takes	1
place	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
planned	1
it	1
anticipated.	1
That	1
is	1
an	1
essential	1
condition.	1
	1
A	1
countless	1
number	1
of	1
free	1
forces	1
(for	1
nowhere	1
is	1
man	1
freer	1
than	1
during	1
a	1
battle,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death)	1
influence	1
the	1
course	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
fight,	1
and	1
that	1
course	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
known	1
in	1
advance	1
and	1
never	1
coincides	1
with	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
force.	1
	1
If	1
many	1
simultaneously	1
and	1
variously	1
directed	1
forces	1
act	1
on	1
a	1
given	1
body,	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
its	1
motion	1
cannot	1
coincide	1
with	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
forces,	1
but	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
a	1
mean--what	1
in	1
mechanics	1
is	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
diagonal	1
of	1
a	1
parallelogram	1
of	1
forces.	1
	1
If	1
in	1
the	1
descriptions	1
given	1
by	1
historians,	1
especially	1
French	1
ones,	1
we	1
find	1
their	1
wars	1
and	1
battles	1
carried	1
out	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
previously	1
formed	1
plans,	1
the	1
only	1
conclusion	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
is	1
that	1
those	1
descriptions	1
are	1
false.	1
	1
The	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
attain	1
the	1
aim	1
Toll	1
had	1
in	1
view--to	1
lead	1
the	1
troops	1
into	1
action	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
prescribed	1
by	1
the	1
dispositions;	1
nor	1
that	1
which	1
Count	1
Orlov-Denisov	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
view--	1
to	1
take	1
Murat	1
prisoner;	1
nor	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
immediately	1
destroying	1
the	1
whole	1
corps,	1
which	1
Bennigsen	1
and	1
others	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
view;	1
nor	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
officer	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
action	1
to	1
distinguish	1
himself;	1
nor	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Cossack	1
who	1
wanted	1
more	1
booty	1
than	1
he	1
got,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
what	1
actually	1
resulted	1
and	1
what	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
desired--to	1
drive	1
the	1
French	1
out	1
of	1
Russia	1
and	1
destroy	1
their	1
army--it	1
is	1
quite	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino,	1
just	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
incongruities,	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
was	1
wanted	1
at	1
that	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
campaign.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
and	1
even	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
result	1
more	1
opportune	1
than	1
the	1
actual	1
outcome	1
of	1
this	1
battle.	1
With	1
a	1
minimum	1
of	1
effort	1
and	1
insignificant	1
losses,	1
despite	1
the	1
greatest	1
confusion,	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
were	1
attained:	1
the	1
transition	1
from	1
retreat	1
to	1
advance,	1
an	1
exposure	1
of	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
that	1
shock	1
which	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
had	1
only	1
awaited	1
to	1
begin	1
its	1
flight.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
Napoleon	1
enters	1
Moscow	1
after	1
the	1
brilliant	1
victory	1
de	1
la	1
Moskowa;	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
the	1
victory	1
for	1
the	1
battlefield	1
remains	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
The	1
Russians	1
retreat	1
and	1
abandon	1
their	1
ancient	1
capital.	1
Moscow,	1
abounding	1
in	1
provisions,	1
arms,	1
munitions,	1
and	1
incalculable	1
wealth,	1
is	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
hands.	1
The	1
Russian	1
army,	1
only	1
half	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
does	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
single	1
attempt	1
to	1
attack	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month.	1
Napoleon's	1
position	1
is	1
most	1
brilliant.	1
He	1
can	1
either	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
with	1
double	1
its	1
strength	1
and	1
destroy	1
it;	1
negotiate	1
an	1
advantageous	1
peace,	1
or	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
refusal	1
make	1
a	1
menacing	1
move	1
on	1
Petersburg,	1
or	1
even,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
reverse,	1
return	1
to	1
Smolensk	1
or	1
Vilna;	1
or	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow;	1
in	1
short,	1
no	1
special	1
genius	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
required	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
brilliant	1
position	1
the	1
French	1
held	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
For	1
that,	1
only	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
steps	1
were	1
necessary:	1
not	1
to	1
allow	1
the	1
troops	1
to	1
loot,	1
to	1
prepare	1
winter	1
clothing--of	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
sufficient	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
army--and	1
methodically	1
to	1
collect	1
the	1
provisions,	1
of	1
which	1
(according	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
historians)	1
there	1
were	1
enough	1
in	1
Moscow	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
for	1
six	1
months.	1
Yet	1
Napoleon,	1
that	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
geniuses,	1
who	1
the	1
historians	1
declare	1
had	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
took	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
steps.	1
	1
He	1
not	1
merely	1
did	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
used	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
select	1
the	1
most	1
foolish	1
and	1
ruinous	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
courses	1
open	1
to	1
him.	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
might	1
have	1
done:	1
wintering	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
advancing	1
on	1
Petersburg	1
or	1
on	1
Nizhni-Novgorod,	1
or	1
retiring	1
by	1
a	1
more	1
northerly	1
or	1
more	1
southerly	1
route	1
(say	1
by	1
the	1
road	1
Kutuzov	1
afterwards	1
took),	1
nothing	1
more	1
stupid	1
or	1
disastrous	1
can	1
be	1
imagined	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
actually	1
did.	1
He	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
till	1
October,	1
letting	1
the	1
troops	1
plunder	1
the	1
city;	1
then,	1
hesitating	1
whether	1
to	1
leave	1
a	1
garrison	1
behind	1
him,	1
he	1
quitted	1
Moscow,	1
approached	1
Kutuzov	1
without	1
joining	1
battle,	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
reached	1
Malo-Yaroslavets,	1
again	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
road	1
Kutuzov	1
took,	1
but	1
retiring	1
instead	1
to	1
Mozhaysk	1
along	1
the	1
devastated	1
Smolensk	1
road.	1
Nothing	1
more	1
stupid	1
than	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
devised,	1
or	1
more	1
disastrous	1
for	1
the	1
army,	1
as	1
the	1
sequel	1
showed.	1
Had	1
Napoleon's	1
aim	1
been	1
to	1
destroy	1
his	1
army,	1
the	1
most	1
skillful	1
strategist	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
devised	1
any	1
series	1
of	1
actions	1
that	1
would	1
so	1
completely	1
have	1
accomplished	1
that	1
purpose,	1
independently	1
of	1
anything	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
might	1
do.	1
	1
Napoleon,	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
genius,	1
did	1
this!	1
But	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
destroyed	1
his	1
army	1
because	1
he	1
wished	1
to,	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
stupid,	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
unjust	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
his	1
troops	1
to	1
Moscow	1
because	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
clever	1
and	1
a	1
genius.	1
	1
In	1
both	1
cases	1
his	1
personal	1
activity,	1
having	1
no	1
more	1
force	1
than	1
the	1
personal	1
activity	1
of	1
any	1
soldier,	1
merely	1
coincided	1
with	1
the	1
laws	1
that	1
guided	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
The	1
historians	1
quite	1
falsely	1
represent	1
Napoleon's	1
faculties	1
as	1
having	1
weakened	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
do	1
so	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
results	1
did	1
not	1
justify	1
his	1
actions.	1
He	1
employed	1
all	1
his	1
ability	1
and	1
strength	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
army,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
previously	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
subsequently	1
in	1
1813.	1
His	1
activity	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
astounding	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
Italy,	1
in	1
Austria,	1
and	1
in	1
Prussia.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
his	1
genius	1
was	1
genuine	1
in	1
Egypt--where	1
forty	1
centuries	1
looked	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
grandeur--for	1
his	1
great	1
exploits	1
there	1
are	1
all	1
told	1
us	1
by	1
Frenchmen.	1
We	1
cannot	1
accurately	1
estimate	1
his	1
genius	1
in	1
Austria	1
or	1
Prussia,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
draw	1
our	1
information	1
from	1
French	1
or	1
German	1
sources,	1
and	1
the	1
incomprehensible	1
surrender	1
of	1
whole	1
corps	1
without	1
fighting	1
and	1
of	1
fortresses	1
without	1
a	1
siege	1
must	1
incline	1
Germans	1
to	1
recognize	1
his	1
genius	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
Germany.	1
But	1
we,	1
thank	1
God,	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
recognize	1
his	1
genius	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
hide	1
our	1
shame.	1
We	1
have	1
paid	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
plainly	1
and	1
simply,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
abandon	1
that	1
right.	1
	1
His	1
activity	1
in	1
Moscow	1
was	1
as	1
amazing	1
and	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
genius	1
as	1
elsewhere.	1
Order	1
after	1
order	1
and	1
plan	1
after	1
plan	1
were	1
issued	1
by	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
entered	1
Moscow	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
left	1
it.	1
The	1
absence	1
of	1
citizens	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
deputation,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
did	1
not	1
disconcert	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
sight	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Russia,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
affairs	1
in	1
Paris,	1
or	1
of	1
diplomatic	1
considerations	1
concerning	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
anticipated	1
peace.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
military	1
matters,	1
Napoleon	1
immediately	1
on	1
his	1
entry	1
into	1
Moscow	1
gave	1
General	1
Sabastiani	1
strict	1
orders	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
sent	1
army	1
corps	1
out	1
along	1
the	1
different	1
roads,	1
and	1
charged	1
Murat	1
to	1
find	1
Kutuzov.	1
Then	1
he	1
gave	1
careful	1
directions	1
about	1
the	1
fortification	1
of	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
brilliant	1
plan	1
for	1
a	1
future	1
campaign	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
map	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
diplomatic	1
questions,	1
Napoleon	1
summoned	1
Captain	1
Yakovlev,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
robbed	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
rags	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
minutely	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
whole	1
policy	1
and	1
his	1
magnanimity,	1
and	1
having	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
inform	1
his	1
Friend	1
and	1
Brother	1
that	1
Rostopchin	1
had	1
managed	1
affairs	1
badly	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
dispatched	1
Yakovlev	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
Having	1
similarly	1
explained	1
his	1
views	1
and	1
his	1
magnanimity	1
to	1
Tutolmin,	1
he	1
dispatched	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
also	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
negotiate.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
legal	1
matters,	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
fires	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
find	1
and	1
execute	1
the	1
incendiaries.	1
And	1
the	1
scoundrel	1
Rostopchin	1
was	1
punished	1
by	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
burn	1
down	1
his	1
houses.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
administrative	1
matters,	1
Moscow	1
was	1
granted	1
a	1
constitution.	1
A	1
municipality	1
was	1
established	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
announcement	1
issued:	1
	1
INHABITANTS	1
OF	1
MOSCOW!	1
	1
Your	1
misfortunes	1
are	1
cruel,	1
but	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
King	1
desires	1
to	1
arrest	1
their	1
course.	1
Terrible	1
examples	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
how	1
he	1
punishes	1
disobedience	1
and	1
crime.	1
Strict	1
measures	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
disorder	1
and	1
to	1
re-establish	1
public	1
security.	1
A	1
paternal	1
administration,	1
chosen	1
from	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
will	1
form	1
your	1
municipality	1
or	1
city	1
government.	1
It	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
you,	1
of	1
your	1
needs,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
welfare.	1
Its	1
members	1
will	1
be	1
distinguished	1
by	1
a	1
red	1
ribbon	1
worn	1
across	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
the	1
mayor	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
will	1
wear	1
a	1
white	1
belt	1
as	1
well.	1
But	1
when	1
not	1
on	1
duty	1
they	1
will	1
only	1
wear	1
a	1
red	1
ribbon	1
round	1
the	1
left	1
arm.	1
	1
The	1
city	1
police	1
is	1
established	1
on	1
its	1
former	1
footing,	1
and	1
better	1
order	1
already	1
prevails	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
its	1
activity.	1
The	1
government	1
has	1
appointed	1
two	1
commissaries	1
general,	1
or	1
chiefs	1
of	1
police,	1
and	1
twenty	1
commissaries	1
or	1
captains	1
of	1
wards	1
have	1
been	1
appointed	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
wards	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
You	1
will	1
recognize	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
white	1
ribbon	1
they	1
will	1
wear	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
arm.	1
Several	1
churches	1
of	1
different	1
denominations	1
are	1
open,	1
and	1
divine	1
service	1
is	1
performed	1
in	1
them	1
unhindered.	1
Your	1
fellow	1
citizens	1
are	1
returning	1
every	1
day	1
to	1
their	1
homes	1
and	1
orders	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
find	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
help	1
and	1
protection	1
due	1
to	1
their	1
misfortunes.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
measures	1
the	1
government	1
has	1
adopted	1
to	1
re-	1
establish	1
order	1
and	1
relieve	1
your	1
condition.	1
But	1
to	1
achieve	1
this	1
aim	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
add	1
your	1
efforts	1
and	1
should,	1
if	1
possible,	1
forget	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
you	1
have	1
suffered,	1
should	1
entertain	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
less	1
cruel	1
fate,	1
should	1
be	1
certain	1
that	1
inevitable	1
and	1
ignominious	1
death	1
awaits	1
those	1
who	1
make	1
any	1
attempt	1
on	1
your	1
persons	1
or	1
on	1
what	1
remains	1
of	1
your	1
property,	1
and	1
finally	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
these	1
will	1
be	1
safeguarded,	1
since	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
and	1
most	1
just	1
of	1
monarchs.	1
Soldiers	1
and	1
citizens,	1
of	1
whatever	1
nation	1
you	1
may	1
be,	1
re-	1
establish	1
public	1
confidence,	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
a	1
state,	1
live	1
like	1
brothers,	1
render	1
mutual	1
aid	1
and	1
protection	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
unite	1
to	1
defeat	1
the	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
evil-minded,	1
obey	1
the	1
military	1
and	1
civil	1
authorities,	1
and	1
your	1
tears	1
will	1
soon	1
cease	1
to	1
flow!	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
supplies	1
for	1
the	1
army,	1
Napoleon	1
decreed	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
troops	1
in	1
turn	1
should	1
enter	1
Moscow	1
a	1
la	1
maraude	1
*	1
to	1
obtain	1
provisions	1
for	1
themselves,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
might	1
have	1
its	1
future	1
provided	1
for.	1
	1
	1
*	1
As	1
looters.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
religion,	1
Napoleon	1
ordered	1
the	1
priests	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
back	1
and	1
services	1
to	1
be	1
again	1
performed	1
in	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
commerce	1
and	1
to	1
provisioning	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
following	1
was	1
placarded	1
everywhere:	1
	1
PROCLAMATION!	1
	1
You,	1
peaceful	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
artisans	1
and	1
workmen	1
whom	1
misfortune	1
has	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
you	1
scattered	1
tillers	1
of	1
the	1
soil,	1
still	1
kept	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
by	1
groundless	1
fear,	1
listen!	1
Tranquillity	1
is	1
returning	1
to	1
this	1
capital	1
and	1
order	1
is	1
being	1
restored	1
in	1
it.	1
Your	1
fellow	1
countrymen	1
are	1
emerging	1
boldly	1
from	1
their	1
hiding	1
places	1
on	1
finding	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
respected.	1
Any	1
violence	1
to	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
their	1
property	1
is	1
promptly	1
punished.	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
King	1
protects	1
them,	1
and	1
considers	1
no	1
one	1
among	1
you	1
his	1
enemy	1
except	1
those	1
who	1
disobey	1
his	1
orders.	1
He	1
desires	1
to	1
end	1
your	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
restore	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
homes	1
and	1
families.	1
Respond,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
his	1
benevolent	1
intentions	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
without	1
fear.	1
Inhabitants,	1
return	1
with	1
confidence	1
to	1
your	1
abodes!	1
You	1
will	1
soon	1
find	1
means	1
of	1
satisfying	1
your	1
needs.	1
Craftsmen	1
and	1
industrious	1
artisans,	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
work,	1
your	1
houses,	1
your	1
shops,	1
where	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
guards	1
awaits	1
you!	1
You	1
shall	1
receive	1
proper	1
pay	1
for	1
your	1
work.	1
And	1
lastly	1
you	1
too,	1
peasants,	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
forests	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
hiding	1
in	1
terror,	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
huts	1
without	1
fear,	1
in	1
full	1
assurance	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
protection!	1
Markets	1
are	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
peasants	1
can	1
bring	1
their	1
surplus	1
supplies	1
and	1
the	1
products	1
of	1
the	1
soil.	1
The	1
government	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
following	1
steps	1
to	1
ensure	1
freedom	1
of	1
sale	1
for	1
them:	1
(1)	1
From	1
today,	1
peasants,	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
those	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
Moscow	1
may	1
without	1
any	1
danger	1
bring	1
their	1
supplies	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
to	1
two	1
appointed	1
markets,	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
Mokhovaya	1
Street	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
Provision	1
Market.	1
(2)	1
Such	1
supplies	1
will	1
be	1
bought	1
from	1
them	1
at	1
such	1
prices	1
as	1
seller	1
and	1
buyer	1
may	1
agree	1
on,	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
seller	1
is	1
unable	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
fair	1
price	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
free	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
goods	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
village	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
may	1
hinder	1
him	1
under	1
any	1
pretense.	1
(3)	1
Sunday	1
and	1
Wednesday	1
of	1
each	1
week	1
are	1
appointed	1
as	1
the	1
chief	1
market	1
days	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
end	1
a	1
sufficient	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
will	1
be	1
stationed	1
along	1
the	1
highroads	1
on	1
Tuesdays	1
and	1
Saturdays	1
at	1
such	1
distances	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
as	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
carts.	1
(4)	1
Similar	1
measures	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
that	1
peasants	1
with	1
their	1
carts	1
and	1
horses	1
may	1
meet	1
with	1
no	1
hindrance	1
on	1
their	1
return	1
journey.	1
(5)	1
Steps	1
will	1
immediately	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
re-establish	1
ordinary	1
trading.	1
	1
Inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
villages,	1
and	1
you,	1
workingmen	1
and	1
artisans,	1
to	1
whatever	1
nation	1
you	1
belong,	1
you	1
are	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
paternal	1
intentions	1
of	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
King	1
and	1
to	1
co-	1
operate	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare!	1
Lay	1
your	1
respect	1
and	1
confidence	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
unite	1
with	1
us!	1
	1
With	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
raising	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
reviews	1
were	1
constantly	1
held	1
and	1
rewards	1
distributed.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
rode	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
to	1
comfort	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
and,	1
despite	1
his	1
preoccupation	1
with	1
state	1
affairs,	1
himself	1
visited	1
the	1
theaters	1
that	1
were	1
established	1
by	1
his	1
order.	1
	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
philanthropy,	1
the	1
greatest	1
virtue	1
of	1
crowned	1
heads,	1
Napoleon	1
also	1
did	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
He	1
caused	1
the	1
words	1
Maison	1
de	1
ma	1
Mere	1
to	1
be	1
inscribed	1
on	1
the	1
charitable	1
institutions,	1
thereby	1
combining	1
tender	1
filial	1
affection	1
with	1
the	1
majestic	1
benevolence	1
of	1
a	1
monarch.	1
He	1
visited	1
the	1
Foundling	1
Hospital	1
and,	1
allowing	1
the	1
orphans	1
saved	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
kiss	1
his	1
white	1
hands,	1
graciously	1
conversed	1
with	1
Tutolmin.	1
Then,	1
as	1
Thiers	1
eloquently	1
recounts,	1
he	1
ordered	1
his	1
soldiers	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
in	1
forged	1
Russian	1
money	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
prepared:	1
"Raising	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
these	1
means	1
by	1
an	1
act	1
worthy	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
he	1
let	1
relief	1
be	1
distributed	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
out.	1
But	1
as	1
food	1
was	1
too	1
precious	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
foreigners,	1
who	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
enemies,	1
Napoleon	1
preferred	1
to	1
supply	1
them	1
with	1
money	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
purchase	1
food	1
from	1
outside,	1
and	1
had	1
paper	1
rubles	1
distributed	1
to	1
them."	1
	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
army	1
discipline,	1
orders	1
were	1
continually	1
being	1
issued	1
to	1
inflict	1
severe	1
punishment	1
for	1
the	1
nonperformance	1
of	1
military	1
duties	1
and	1
to	1
suppress	1
robbery.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
But	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
all	1
these	1
measures,	1
efforts,	1
and	1
plans--which	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
worse	1
than	1
others	1
issued	1
in	1
similar	1
circumstances--did	1
not	1
affect	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
but,	1
like	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
clock	1
detached	1
from	1
the	1
mechanism,	1
swung	1
about	1
in	1
an	1
arbitrary	1
and	1
aimless	1
way	1
without	1
engaging	1
the	1
cogwheels.	1
	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
military	1
side--the	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign--that	1
work	1
of	1
genius	1
of	1
which	1
Thiers	1
remarks	1
that,	1
"His	1
genius	1
never	1
devised	1
anything	1
more	1
profound,	1
more	1
skillful,	1
or	1
more	1
admirable,"	1
and	1
enters	1
into	1
a	1
polemic	1
with	1
M.	1
Fain	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
this	1
work	1
of	1
genius	1
must	1
be	1
referred	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
of	1
October--that	1
plan	1
never	1
was	1
or	1
could	1
be	1
executed,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
case.	1
The	1
fortifying	1
of	1
the	1
Kremlin,	1
for	1
which	1
la	1
Mosquee	1
(as	1
Napoleon	1
termed	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Basil	1
the	1
Beatified)	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
razed	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
proved	1
quite	1
useless.	1
The	1
mining	1
of	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
only	1
helped	1
toward	1
fulfilling	1
Napoleon's	1
wish	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
blown	1
up	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
Moscow--as	1
a	1
child	1
wants	1
the	1
floor	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
hurt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
beaten.	1
The	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
about	1
which	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
so	1
concerned,	1
produced	1
an	1
unheard-of	1
result.	1
The	1
French	1
generals	1
lost	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
of	1
sixty	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
Thiers	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
eventually	1
found,	1
like	1
a	1
lost	1
pin,	1
by	1
the	1
skill--and	1
apparently	1
the	1
genius--of	1
Murat.	1
	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
diplomacy,	1
all	1
Napoleon's	1
arguments	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
magnanimity	1
and	1
justice,	1
both	1
to	1
Tutolmin	1
and	1
to	1
Yakovlev	1
(whose	1
chief	1
concern	1
was	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
greatcoat	1
and	1
a	1
conveyance),	1
proved	1
useless;	1
Alexander	1
did	1
not	1
receive	1
these	1
envoys	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
to	1
their	1
embassage.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
legal	1
matters,	1
after	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
supposed	1
incendiaries	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Moscow	1
burned	1
down.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
administrative	1
matters,	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
municipality	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
the	1
robberies	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
certain	1
people	1
who	1
formed	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
municipality	1
and	1
under	1
pretext	1
of	1
preserving	1
order	1
looted	1
Moscow	1
or	1
saved	1
their	1
own	1
property	1
from	1
being	1
looted.	1
	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
religion,	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
in	1
Egypt	1
matters	1
had	1
so	1
easily	1
been	1
settled	1
by	1
Napoleon's	1
visit	1
to	1
a	1
mosque,	1
no	1
results	1
were	1
achieved.	1
Two	1
or	1
three	1
priests	1
who	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
Moscow	1
did	1
try	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
Napoleon's	1
wish,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
slapped	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
soldier	1
while	1
conducting	1
service,	1
and	1
a	1
French	1
official	1
reported	1
of	1
another	1
that:	1
"The	1
priest	1
whom	1
I	1
found	1
and	1
invited	1
to	1
say	1
Mass	1
cleaned	1
and	1
locked	1
up	1
the	1
church.	1
That	1
night	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
again	1
broken	1
open,	1
the	1
padlocks	1
smashed,	1
the	1
books	1
mutilated,	1
and	1
other	1
disorders	1
perpetrated."	1
	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
commerce,	1
the	1
proclamation	1
to	1
industrious	1
workmen	1
and	1
to	1
peasants	1
evoked	1
no	1
response.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
industrious	1
workmen,	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
caught	1
the	1
commissaries	1
who	1
ventured	1
too	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
town	1
with	1
the	1
proclamation	1
and	1
killed	1
them.	1
	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
theaters	1
for	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
troops,	1
these	1
did	1
not	1
meet	1
with	1
success	1
either.	1
The	1
theaters	1
set	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
and	1
in	1
Posnyakov's	1
house	1
were	1
closed	1
again	1
at	1
once	1
because	1
the	1
actors	1
and	1
actresses	1
were	1
robbed.	1
	1
Even	1
philanthropy	1
did	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
desired	1
effect.	1
The	1
genuine	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
false	1
paper	1
money	1
which	1
flooded	1
Moscow	1
lost	1
its	1
value.	1
The	1
French,	1
collecting	1
booty,	1
cared	1
only	1
for	1
gold.	1
Not	1
only	1
was	1
the	1
paper	1
money	1
valueless	1
which	1
Napoleon	1
so	1
graciously	1
distributed	1
to	1
the	1
unfortunate,	1
but	1
even	1
silver	1
lost	1
its	1
value	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
gold.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
most	1
amazing	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
ineffectiveness	1
of	1
the	1
orders	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
authorities	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
Napoleon's	1
attempt	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
looting	1
and	1
re-establish	1
discipline.	1
	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
army	1
authorities	1
were	1
reporting:	1
	1
"Looting	1
continues	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
despite	1
the	1
decrees	1
against	1
it.	1
Order	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
restored	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
merchant	1
is	1
carrying	1
on	1
trade	1
in	1
a	1
lawful	1
manner.	1
The	1
sutlers	1
alone	1
venture	1
to	1
trade,	1
and	1
they	1
sell	1
stolen	1
goods."	1
	1
"The	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
my	1
ward	1
continues	1
to	1
be	1
pillaged	1
by	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
3rd	1
Corps	1
who,	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
taking	1
from	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
inhabitants	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
cellars	1
the	1
little	1
they	1
have	1
left,	1
even	1
have	1
the	1
ferocity	1
to	1
wound	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
sabers,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
repeatedly	1
witnessed."	1
	1
"Nothing	1
new,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
soldiers	1
are	1
robbing	1
and	1
pillaging--	1
October	1
9."	1
	1
"Robbery	1
and	1
pillaging	1
continue.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
thieves	1
in	1
our	1
district	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
arrested	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
force--October	1
11."	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
is	1
extremely	1
displeased	1
that	1
despite	1
the	1
strict	1
orders	1
to	1
stop	1
pillage,	1
parties	1
of	1
marauding	1
Guards	1
are	1
continually	1
seen	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
Kremlin.	1
Among	1
the	1
Old	1
Guard	1
disorder	1
and	1
pillage	1
were	1
renewed	1
more	1
violently	1
than	1
ever	1
yesterday	1
evening,	1
last	1
night,	1
and	1
today.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
sees	1
with	1
regret	1
that	1
the	1
picked	1
soldiers	1
appointed	1
to	1
guard	1
his	1
person,	1
who	1
should	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
discipline,	1
carry	1
disobedience	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
they	1
break	1
into	1
the	1
cellars	1
and	1
stores	1
containing	1
army	1
supplies.	1
Others	1
have	1
disgraced	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
disobeying	1
sentinels	1
and	1
officers,	1
and	1
have	1
abused	1
and	1
beaten	1
them."	1
	1
"The	1
Grand	1
Marshal	1
of	1
the	1
palace,"	1
wrote	1
the	1
governor,	1
"complains	1
bitterly	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
repeated	1
orders,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
continue	1
to	1
commit	1
nuisances	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
courtyards	1
and	1
even	1
under	1
the	1
very	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor."	1
	1
That	1
army,	1
like	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
run	1
wild	1
and	1
trampling	1
underfoot	1
the	1
provender	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
saved	1
it	1
from	1
starvation,	1
disintegrated	1
and	1
perished	1
with	1
each	1
additional	1
day	1
it	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
away.	1
	1
It	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
only	1
when	1
suddenly	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
panic	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
transport	1
trains	1
on	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino.	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
that	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino,	1
unexpectedly	1
received	1
by	1
Napoleon	1
at	1
a	1
review,	1
evoked	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
Russians	1
(Thiers	1
says),	1
and	1
he	1
issued	1
the	1
order	1
for	1
departure	1
which	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
was	1
demanding.	1
	1
Fleeing	1
from	1
Moscow	1
the	1
soldiers	1
took	1
with	1
them	1
everything	1
they	1
had	1
stolen.	1
Napoleon,	1
too,	1
carried	1
away	1
his	1
own	1
personal	1
tresor,	1
but	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
baggage	1
trains	1
that	1
impeded	1
the	1
army,	1
he	1
was	1
(Thiers	1
says)	1
horror-struck.	1
And	1
yet	1
with	1
his	1
experience	1
of	1
war	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
order	1
all	1
the	1
superfluous	1
vehicles	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
marshal	1
when	1
approaching	1
Moscow.	1
He	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
caleches	1
and	1
carriages	1
in	1
which	1
soldiers	1
were	1
riding	1
and	1
remarked	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing,	1
as	1
those	1
vehicles	1
could	1
be	1
used	1
to	1
carry	1
provisions,	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
the	1
wounded.	1
	1
The	1
plight	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
resembled	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
wounded	1
animal	1
which	1
feels	1
it	1
is	1
perishing	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
doing.	1
To	1
study	1
the	1
skillful	1
tactics	1
and	1
aims	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
entered	1
Moscow	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
destroyed	1
is	1
like	1
studying	1
the	1
dying	1
leaps	1
and	1
shudders	1
of	1
a	1
mortally	1
wounded	1
animal.	1
Very	1
often	1
a	1
wounded	1
animal,	1
hearing	1
a	1
rustle,	1
rushes	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
hunter's	1
gun,	1
runs	1
forward	1
and	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
hastens	1
its	1
own	1
end.	1
Napoleon,	1
under	1
pressure	1
from	1
his	1
whole	1
army,	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
The	1
rustle	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Tarutino	1
frightened	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
it	1
rushed	1
forward	1
onto	1
the	1
hunter's	1
gun,	1
reached	1
him,	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
finally--like	1
any	1
wild	1
beast--ran	1
back	1
along	1
the	1
most	1
disadvantageous	1
and	1
dangerous	1
path,	1
where	1
the	1
old	1
scent	1
was	1
familiar.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
period	1
Napoleon,	1
who	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
movements--as	1
the	1
figurehead	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
a	1
savage	1
to	1
guide	1
the	1
vessel--acted	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
who,	1
holding	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
strings	1
inside	1
a	1
carriage,	1
thinks	1
he	1
is	1
driving	1
it.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
of	1
October	1
Pierre	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed,	1
and	1
on	1
returning	1
stopped	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
blue-	1
gray	1
dog,	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
body	1
and	1
short	1
bandy	1
legs,	1
that	1
jumped	1
about	1
him.	1
This	1
little	1
dog	1
lived	1
in	1
their	1
shed,	1
sleeping	1
beside	1
Karataev	1
at	1
night;	1
it	1
sometimes	1
made	1
excursions	1
into	1
the	1
town	1
but	1
always	1
returned	1
again.	1
Probably	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
an	1
owner,	1
and	1
it	1
still	1
belonged	1
to	1
nobody	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
name.	1
The	1
French	1
called	1
it	1
Azor;	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
told	1
stories	1
called	1
it	1
Femgalka;	1
Karataev	1
and	1
others	1
called	1
it	1
Gray,	1
or	1
sometimes	1
Flabby.	1
Its	1
lack	1
of	1
a	1
master,	1
a	1
name,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
a	1
breed	1
or	1
any	1
definite	1
color	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
trouble	1
the	1
blue-gray	1
dog	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
Its	1
furry	1
tail	1
stood	1
up	1
firm	1
and	1
round	1
as	1
a	1
plume,	1
its	1
bandy	1
legs	1
served	1
it	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
often	1
gracefully	1
lift	1
a	1
hind	1
leg	1
and	1
run	1
very	1
easily	1
and	1
quickly	1
on	1
three	1
legs,	1
as	1
if	1
disdaining	1
to	1
use	1
all	1
four.	1
Everything	1
pleased	1
it.	1
Now	1
it	1
would	1
roll	1
on	1
its	1
back,	1
yelping	1
with	1
delight,	1
now	1
bask	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
air	1
of	1
importance,	1
and	1
now	1
frolic	1
about	1
playing	1
with	1
a	1
chip	1
of	1
wood	1
or	1
a	1
straw.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
attire	1
by	1
now	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
dirty	1
torn	1
shirt	1
(the	1
only	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
clothing),	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
soldier's	1
trousers	1
which	1
by	1
Karataev's	1
advice	1
he	1
tied	1
with	1
string	1
round	1
the	1
ankles	1
for	1
warmth,	1
and	1
a	1
peasant	1
coat	1
and	1
cap.	1
Physically	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
much	1
during	1
this	1
time.	1
He	1
no	1
longer	1
seemed	1
stout,	1
though	1
he	1
still	1
had	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
solidity	1
and	1
strength	1
hereditary	1
in	1
his	1
family.	1
A	1
beard	1
and	1
mustache	1
covered	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
a	1
tangle	1
of	1
hair,	1
infested	1
with	1
lice,	1
curled	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
cap.	1
The	1
look	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
was	1
resolute,	1
calm,	1
and	1
animatedly	1
alert,	1
as	1
never	1
before.	1
The	1
former	1
slackness	1
which	1
had	1
shown	1
itself	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
was	1
now	1
replaced	1
by	1
an	1
energetic	1
readiness	1
for	1
action	1
and	1
resistance.	1
His	1
feet	1
were	1
bare.	1
	1
Pierre	1
first	1
looked	1
down	1
the	1
field	1
across	1
which	1
vehicles	1
and	1
horsemen	1
were	1
passing	1
that	1
morning,	1
then	1
into	1
the	1
distance	1
across	1
the	1
river,	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
dog	1
who	1
was	1
pretending	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
earnest	1
about	1
biting	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
his	1
bare	1
feet	1
which	1
he	1
placed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
in	1
various	1
positions,	1
moving	1
his	1
dirty	1
thick	1
big	1
toes.	1
Every	1
time	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
bare	1
feet	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
animated	1
self-satisfaction	1
flitted	1
across	1
his	1
face.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
and	1
learned	1
during	1
these	1
weeks	1
and	1
this	1
recollection	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
For	1
some	1
days	1
the	1
weather	1
had	1
been	1
calm	1
and	1
clear	1
with	1
slight	1
frosts	1
in	1
the	1
mornings--what	1
is	1
called	1
an	1
"old	1
wives'	1
summer."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
sunshine	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
warm,	1
and	1
that	1
warmth	1
was	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
with	1
the	1
invigorating	1
freshness	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
frost	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
On	1
everything--far	1
and	1
near--lay	1
the	1
magic	1
crystal	1
glitter	1
seen	1
only	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
autumn.	1
The	1
Sparrow	1
Hills	1
were	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
with	1
the	1
village,	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
the	1
large	1
white	1
house.	1
The	1
bare	1
trees,	1
the	1
sand,	1
the	1
bricks	1
and	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
the	1
green	1
church	1
spire,	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
all	1
stood	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
transparent	1
air	1
in	1
most	1
delicate	1
outline	1
and	1
with	1
unnatural	1
clearness.	1
Near	1
by	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
the	1
familiar	1
ruins	1
of	1
a	1
half-burned	1
mansion	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
with	1
lilac	1
bushes	1
still	1
showing	1
dark	1
green	1
beside	1
the	1
fence.	1
And	1
even	1
that	1
ruined	1
and	1
befouled	1
house--which	1
in	1
dull	1
weather	1
was	1
repulsively	1
ugly--seemed	1
quietly	1
beautiful	1
now,	1
in	1
the	1
clear,	1
motionless	1
brilliance.	1
	1
A	1
French	1
corporal,	1
with	1
coat	1
unbuttoned	1
in	1
a	1
homely	1
way,	1
a	1
skullcap	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
pipe	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
came	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
and	1
approached	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
wink.	1
	1
"What	1
sunshine,	1
Monsieur	1
Kiril!"	1
(Their	1
name	1
for	1
Pierre.)	1
"Eh?	1
Just	1
like	1
spring!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
corporal	1
leaned	1
against	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
offered	1
Pierre	1
his	1
pipe,	1
though	1
whenever	1
he	1
offered	1
it	1
Pierre	1
always	1
declined	1
it.	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
in	1
such	1
weather..."	1
he	1
began.	1
	1
Pierre	1
inquired	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
about	1
leaving,	1
and	1
the	1
corporal	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
starting	1
and	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
order	1
about	1
the	1
prisoners	1
that	1
day.	1
Sokolov,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
dying,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
told	1
the	1
corporal	1
that	1
something	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
about	1
him.	1
The	1
corporal	1
replied	1
that	1
Pierre	1
need	1
not	1
worry	1
about	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
an	1
ambulance	1
and	1
a	1
permanent	1
hospital	1
and	1
arrangements	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
general	1
everything	1
that	1
could	1
happen	1
had	1
been	1
foreseen	1
by	1
the	1
authorities.	1
	1
"Besides,	1
Monsieur	1
Kiril,	1
you	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
captain,	1
you	1
know.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
never	1
forgets	1
anything.	1
Speak	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
when	1
he	1
makes	1
his	1
round,	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
(The	1
captain	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
corporal	1
spoke	1
often	1
had	1
long	1
chats	1
with	1
Pierre	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
favors.)	1
	1
"'You	1
see,	1
St.	1
Thomas,'	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
day.	1
'Monsieur	1
Kiril	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
education,	1
who	1
speaks	1
French.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
Russian	1
seigneur	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
misfortunes,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man.	1
He	1
knows	1
what's	1
what....	1
If	1
he	1
wants	1
anything	1
and	1
asks	1
me,	1
he	1
won't	1
get	1
a	1
refusal.	1
When	1
one	1
has	1
studied,	1
you	1
see,	1
one	1
likes	1
education	1
and	1
well-bred	1
people.'	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
I	1
mention	1
it,	1
Monsieur	1
Kiril.	1
The	1
other	1
day	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
affair	1
would	1
have	1
ended	1
ill."	1
	1
And	1
after	1
chatting	1
a	1
while	1
longer,	1
the	1
corporal	1
went	1
away.	1
(The	1
affair	1
he	1
had	1
alluded	1
to	1
had	1
happened	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before--a	1
fight	1
between	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
in	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
pacifying	1
his	1
comrades.)	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
Pierre	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
corporal	1
immediately	1
asked	1
what	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
said.	1
While	1
Pierre	1
was	1
repeating	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
about	1
the	1
army	1
leaving	1
Moscow,	1
a	1
thin,	1
sallow,	1
tattered	1
French	1
soldier	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1
Rapidly	1
and	1
timidly	1
raising	1
his	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
forehead	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
greeting,	1
he	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
whether	1
the	1
soldier	1
Platoche	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
shirt	1
to	1
sew	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
shed.	1
	1
A	1
week	1
before	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
had	1
boot	1
leather	1
and	1
linen	1
issued	1
to	1
them,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
into	1
boots	1
and	1
shirts	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
"Ready,	1
ready,	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
said	1
Karataev,	1
coming	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
neatly	1
folded	1
shirt.	1
	1
Karataev,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
warm	1
weather	1
and	1
for	1
convenience	1
at	1
work,	1
was	1
wearing	1
only	1
trousers	1
and	1
a	1
tattered	1
shirt	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
soot.	1
His	1
hair	1
was	1
bound	1
round,	1
workman	1
fashion,	1
with	1
a	1
wisp	1
of	1
lime-tree	1
bast,	1
and	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
seemed	1
rounder	1
and	1
pleasanter	1
than	1
ever.	1
	1
"A	1
promise	1
is	1
own	1
brother	1
to	1
performance!	1
I	1
said	1
Friday	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
is,	1
ready,"	1
said	1
Platon,	1
smiling	1
and	1
unfolding	1
the	1
shirt	1
he	1
had	1
sewn.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
glanced	1
around	1
uneasily	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
if	1
overcoming	1
his	1
hesitation,	1
rapidly	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
uniform	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
shirt.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
long,	1
greasy,	1
flowered	1
silk	1
waistcoat	1
next	1
to	1
his	1
sallow,	1
thin	1
bare	1
body,	1
but	1
no	1
shirt.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
afraid	1
the	1
prisoners	1
looking	1
on	1
would	1
laugh	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
thrust	1
his	1
head	1
into	1
the	1
shirt	1
hurriedly.	1
None	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
said	1
a	1
word.	1
	1
"See,	1
it	1
fits	1
well!"	1
Platon	1
kept	1
repeating,	1
pulling	1
the	1
shirt	1
straight.	1
	1
The	1
Frenchman,	1
having	1
pushed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
hands	1
through,	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes,	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
shirt	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
seams.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
dear	1
man,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
sewing	1
shop,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
proper	1
tools;	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
one	1
needs	1
a	1
tool	1
even	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
louse,"	1
said	1
Platon	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
round	1
smiles,	1
obviously	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
"It's	1
good,	1
quite	1
good,	1
thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
in	1
French,	1
"but	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
linen	1
left	1
over."	1
	1
"It	1
will	1
fit	1
better	1
still	1
when	1
it	1
sets	1
to	1
your	1
body,"	1
said	1
Karataev,	1
still	1
admiring	1
his	1
handiwork.	1
"You'll	1
be	1
nice	1
and	1
comfortable...."	1
	1
"Thanks,	1
thanks,	1
old	1
fellow....	1
But	1
the	1
bits	1
left	1
over?"	1
said	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
again	1
and	1
smiled.	1
He	1
took	1
out	1
an	1
assignation	1
ruble	1
note	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Karataev.	1
"But	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
pieces	1
that	1
are	1
over."	1
	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
Platon	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
was	1
saying,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
without	1
interfering.	1
Karataev	1
thanked	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
for	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
admiring	1
his	1
own	1
work.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
insisted	1
on	1
having	1
the	1
pieces	1
returned	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
over	1
and	1
asked	1
Pierre	1
to	1
translate	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
he	1
want	1
the	1
bits	1
for?"	1
said	1
Karataev.	1
"They'd	1
make	1
fine	1
leg	1
bands	1
for	1
us.	1
Well,	1
never	1
mind."	1
	1
And	1
Karataev,	1
with	1
a	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
and	1
saddened	1
expression,	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
bundle	1
of	1
scraps	1
from	1
inside	1
his	1
shirt	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
"Oh	1
dear!"	1
muttered	1
Karataev	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
linen,	1
considered	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
then	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
Pierre's	1
look	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
something,	1
suddenly	1
blushed	1
and	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
squeaky	1
voice:	1
	1
"Platoche!	1
Eh,	1
Platoche!	1
Keep	1
them	1
yourself!"	1
And	1
handing	1
back	1
the	1
odd	1
bits	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
"There,	1
look	1
at	1
that,"	1
said	1
Karataev,	1
swaying	1
his	1
head.	1
"People	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
Christians,	1
but	1
they	1
too	1
have	1
souls.	1
It's	1
what	1
the	1
old	1
folk	1
used	1
to	1
say:	1
'A	1
sweating	1
hand's	1
an	1
open	1
hand,	1
a	1
dry	1
hand's	1
close.'	1
He's	1
naked,	1
but	1
yet	1
he's	1
given	1
it	1
back."	1
	1
Karataev	1
smiled	1
thoughtfully	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
awhile	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
pieces.	1
	1
"But	1
they'll	1
make	1
grand	1
leg	1
bands,	1
dear	1
friend,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
Four	1
weeks	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
offered	1
to	1
move	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
men's	1
to	1
the	1
officers'	1
shed,	1
he	1
had	1
stayed	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
first	1
put.	1
	1
In	1
burned	1
and	1
devastated	1
Moscow	1
Pierre	1
experienced	1
almost	1
the	1
extreme	1
limits	1
of	1
privation	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
endure;	1
but	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
physical	1
strength	1
and	1
health,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
been	1
unconscious,	1
and	1
thanks	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
privations	1
came	1
so	1
gradually	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
they	1
began,	1
he	1
endured	1
his	1
position	1
not	1
only	1
lightly	1
but	1
joyfully.	1
And	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
obtained	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
ease	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
striven	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
reach.	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
sought	1
in	1
different	1
ways	1
that	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
mind,	1
that	1
inner	1
harmony	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
impressed	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
soldiers	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
He	1
had	1
sought	1
it	1
in	1
philanthropy,	1
in	1
Freemasonry,	1
in	1
the	1
dissipations	1
of	1
town	1
life,	1
in	1
wine,	1
in	1
heroic	1
feats	1
of	1
self-sacrifice,	1
and	1
in	1
romantic	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha;	1
he	1
had	1
sought	1
it	1
by	1
reasoning--and	1
all	1
these	1
quests	1
and	1
experiments	1
had	1
failed	1
him.	1
And	1
now	1
without	1
thinking	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
that	1
peace	1
and	1
inner	1
harmony	1
only	1
through	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
death,	1
through	1
privation,	1
and	1
through	1
what	1
he	1
recognized	1
in	1
Karataev.	1
	1
Those	1
dreadful	1
moments	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
at	1
the	1
executions	1
had	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
forever	1
washed	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
imagination	1
and	1
memory	1
the	1
agitating	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
seemed	1
so	1
important.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
Russia,	1
or	1
the	1
war,	1
or	1
politics,	1
or	1
Napoleon.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
no	1
business	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
judge	1
concerning	1
them	1
and	1
therefore	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
"Russia	1
and	1
summer	1
weather	1
are	1
not	1
bound	1
together,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
repeating	1
words	1
of	1
Karataev's	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
strangely	1
consoling.	1
His	1
intention	1
of	1
killing	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
calculations	1
of	1
the	1
cabalistic	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
Apocalypse	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
meaningless	1
and	1
even	1
ridiculous.	1
His	1
anger	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
anxiety	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
smirched	1
now	1
seemed	1
not	1
merely	1
trivial	1
but	1
even	1
amusing.	1
What	1
concern	1
was	1
it	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
somewhere	1
or	1
other	1
that	1
woman	1
was	1
leading	1
the	1
life	1
she	1
preferred?	1
What	1
did	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
anybody,	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
him,	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
they	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
their	1
prisoner's	1
name	1
was	1
Count	1
Bezukhov?	1
	1
He	1
now	1
often	1
remembered	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
quite	1
agreed	1
with	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
understood	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
thoughts	1
somewhat	1
differently.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
thought	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
happiness	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
negative,	1
but	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
bitterness	1
and	1
irony	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
saying	1
that	1
all	1
desire	1
for	1
positive	1
happiness	1
is	1
implanted	1
in	1
us	1
merely	1
to	1
torment	1
us	1
and	1
never	1
be	1
satisfied.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
believed	1
it	1
without	1
any	1
mental	1
reservation.	1
The	1
absence	1
of	1
suffering,	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
one's	1
needs	1
and	1
consequent	1
freedom	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
one's	1
occupation,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
one's	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
to	1
be	1
indubitably	1
man's	1
highest	1
happiness.	1
Here	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
fully	1
appreciated	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
eating	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
eat,	1
drinking	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
drink,	1
sleeping	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
sleep,	1
of	1
warmth	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
cold,	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
fellow	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
talk	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
human	1
voice.	1
The	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
one's	1
needs--good	1
food,	1
cleanliness,	1
and	1
freedom--now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
to	1
constitute	1
perfect	1
happiness;	1
and	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
occupation,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
life--now	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
restricted--seemed	1
to	1
him	1
such	1
an	1
easy	1
matter	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
that	1
a	1
superfluity	1
of	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life	1
destroys	1
all	1
joy	1
in	1
satisfying	1
one's	1
needs,	1
while	1
great	1
freedom	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
occupation--such	1
freedom	1
as	1
his	1
wealth,	1
his	1
education,	1
and	1
his	1
social	1
position	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
life--is	1
just	1
what	1
makes	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
occupation	1
insolubly	1
difficult	1
and	1
destroys	1
the	1
desire	1
and	1
possibility	1
of	1
having	1
an	1
occupation.	1
	1
All	1
Pierre's	1
daydreams	1
now	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
free.	1
Yet	1
subsequently,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
spoke	1
with	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
that	1
month	1
of	1
captivity,	1
of	1
those	1
irrecoverable,	1
strong,	1
joyful	1
sensations,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
of	1
the	1
complete	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
inner	1
freedom	1
which	1
he	1
experienced	1
only	1
during	1
those	1
weeks.	1
	1
When	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
early,	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
at	1
dawn,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
cupolas	1
and	1
crosses	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Convent	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin	1
still	1
dark	1
at	1
first,	1
the	1
hoarfrost	1
on	1
the	1
dusty	1
grass,	1
the	1
Sparrow	1
Hills,	1
and	1
the	1
wooded	1
banks	1
above	1
the	1
winding	1
river	1
vanishing	1
in	1
the	1
purple	1
distance,	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
contact	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
crows	1
flying	1
from	1
Moscow	1
across	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
when	1
afterwards	1
light	1
gleamed	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
the	1
sun's	1
rim	1
appeared	1
solemnly	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
the	1
cupolas	1
and	1
crosses,	1
the	1
hoarfrost,	1
the	1
distance	1
and	1
the	1
river,	1
all	1
began	1
to	1
sparkle	1
in	1
the	1
glad	1
light--Pierre	1
felt	1
a	1
new	1
joy	1
and	1
strength	1
in	1
life	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
known.	1
And	1
this	1
not	1
only	1
stayed	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
imprisonment,	1
but	1
even	1
grew	1
in	1
strength	1
as	1
the	1
hardships	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
increased.	1
	1
That	1
feeling	1
of	1
alertness	1
and	1
of	1
readiness	1
for	1
anything	1
was	1
still	1
further	1
strengthened	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
opinion	1
his	1
fellow	1
prisoners	1
formed	1
of	1
him	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
shed.	1
With	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
languages,	1
the	1
respect	1
shown	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
his	1
simplicity,	1
his	1
readiness	1
to	1
give	1
anything	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
(he	1
received	1
the	1
allowance	1
of	1
three	1
rubles	1
a	1
week	1
made	1
to	1
officers);	1
with	1
his	1
strength,	1
which	1
he	1
showed	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
by	1
pressing	1
nails	1
into	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
hut;	1
his	1
gentleness	1
to	1
his	1
companions,	1
and	1
his	1
capacity	1
for	1
sitting	1
still	1
and	1
thinking	1
without	1
doing	1
anything	1
(which	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
incomprehensible),	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
rather	1
mysterious	1
and	1
superior	1
being.	1
The	1
very	1
qualities	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
hindrance,	1
if	1
not	1
actually	1
harmful,	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
in--his	1
strength,	1
his	1
disdain	1
for	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life,	1
his	1
absent-mindedness	1
and	1
simplicity--here	1
among	1
these	1
people	1
gave	1
him	1
almost	1
the	1
status	1
of	1
a	1
hero.	1
And	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
their	1
opinion	1
placed	1
responsibilities	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
The	1
French	1
evacuation	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
between	1
the	1
sixth	1
and	1
seventh	1
of	1
October:	1
kitchens	1
and	1
sheds	1
were	1
dismantled,	1
carts	1
loaded,	1
and	1
troops	1
and	1
baggage	1
trains	1
started.	1
	1
At	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
a	1
French	1
convoy	1
in	1
marching	1
trim,	1
wearing	1
shakos	1
and	1
carrying	1
muskets,	1
knapsacks,	1
and	1
enormous	1
sacks,	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
sheds,	1
and	1
animated	1
French	1
talk	1
mingled	1
with	1
curses	1
sounded	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
lines.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
shed	1
everyone	1
was	1
ready,	1
dressed,	1
belted,	1
shod,	1
and	1
only	1
awaited	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
start.	1
The	1
sick	1
soldier,	1
Sokolov,	1
pale	1
and	1
thin	1
with	1
dark	1
shadows	1
round	1
his	1
eyes,	1
alone	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
barefoot	1
and	1
not	1
dressed.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
prominent	1
from	1
the	1
emaciation	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
gazed	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
comrades	1
who	1
were	1
paying	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
moaned	1
regularly	1
and	1
quietly.	1
It	1
was	1
evidently	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
his	1
sufferings	1
that	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
moan	1
(he	1
had	1
dysentery)	1
as	1
his	1
fear	1
and	1
grief	1
at	1
being	1
left	1
alone.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
girt	1
with	1
a	1
rope	1
round	1
his	1
waist	1
and	1
wearing	1
shoes	1
Karataev	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
some	1
leather	1
a	1
French	1
soldier	1
had	1
torn	1
off	1
a	1
tea	1
chest	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
boots	1
mended	1
with,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
and	1
squatted	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Sokolov,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
going	1
away!	1
They	1
have	1
a	1
hospital	1
here.	1
You	1
may	1
be	1
better	1
off	1
than	1
we	1
others,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord!	1
Oh,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
me!	1
O	1
Lord!"	1
moaned	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
louder	1
voice.	1
	1
"I'll	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
them	1
again	1
directly,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
rising	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
shed.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
Pierre	1
reached	1
the	1
door,	1
the	1
corporal	1
who	1
had	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
pipe	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
two	1
soldiers.	1
The	1
corporal	1
and	1
soldiers	1
were	1
in	1
marching	1
kit	1
with	1
knapsacks	1
and	1
shakos	1
that	1
had	1
metal	1
straps,	1
and	1
these	1
changed	1
their	1
familiar	1
faces.	1
	1
The	1
corporal	1
came,	1
according	1
to	1
orders,	1
to	1
shut	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
prisoners	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
counted	1
before	1
being	1
let	1
out.	1
	1
"Corporal,	1
what	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
sick	1
man?..."	1
Pierre	1
began.	1
	1
But	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
doubt	1
whether	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
corporal	1
he	1
knew	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
so	1
unlike	1
himself	1
did	1
the	1
corporal	1
seem	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
Moreover,	1
just	1
as	1
Pierre	1
was	1
speaking	1
a	1
sharp	1
rattle	1
of	1
drums	1
was	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
from	1
both	1
sides.	1
The	1
corporal	1
frowned	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
words	1
and,	1
uttering	1
some	1
meaningless	1
oaths,	1
slammed	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
shed	1
became	1
semidark,	1
and	1
the	1
sharp	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
drums	1
on	1
two	1
sides	1
drowned	1
the	1
sick	1
man's	1
groans.	1
	1
"There	1
it	1
is!...	1
It	1
again!..."	1
said	1
Pierre	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
an	1
involuntary	1
shudder	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
spine.	1
In	1
the	1
corporal's	1
changed	1
face,	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice,	1
in	1
the	1
stirring	1
and	1
deafening	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
drums,	1
he	1
recognized	1
that	1
mysterious,	1
callous	1
force	1
which	1
compelled	1
people	1
against	1
their	1
will	1
to	1
kill	1
their	1
fellow	1
men--that	1
force	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
during	1
the	1
executions.	1
To	1
fear	1
or	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
escape	1
that	1
force,	1
to	1
address	1
entreaties	1
or	1
exhortations	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
served	1
as	1
its	1
tools,	1
was	1
useless.	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
this	1
now.	1
One	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
endure.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
again	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man,	1
nor	1
turn	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
but	1
stood	1
frowning	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
hut.	1
	1
When	1
that	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
crowding	1
against	1
one	1
another	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep,	1
squeezed	1
into	1
the	1
exit,	1
Pierre	1
pushed	1
his	1
way	1
forward	1
and	1
approached	1
that	1
very	1
captain	1
who	1
as	1
the	1
corporal	1
had	1
assured	1
him	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
him.	1
The	1
captain	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
marching	1
kit,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
cold	1
face	1
appeared	1
that	1
same	1
it	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
recognized	1
in	1
the	1
corporal's	1
words	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
drums.	1
	1
"Pass	1
on,	1
pass	1
on!"	1
the	1
captain	1
reiterated,	1
frowning	1
sternly,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
prisoners	1
who	1
thronged	1
past	1
him.	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
attempt	1
would	1
be	1
vain.	1
	1
"What	1
now?"	1
the	1
officer	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
recognizing	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Pierre	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
sick	1
man.	1
	1
"He'll	1
manage	1
to	1
walk,	1
devil	1
take	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
captain.	1
"Pass	1
on,	1
pass	1
on!"	1
he	1
continued	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
is	1
dying,"	1
Pierre	1
again	1
began.	1
	1
"Be	1
so	1
good..."	1
shouted	1
the	1
captain,	1
frowning	1
angrily.	1
	1
"Dram-da-da-dam,	1
dam-dam..."	1
rattled	1
the	1
drums,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
mysterious	1
force	1
completely	1
controlled	1
these	1
men	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
useless	1
to	1
say	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
prisoners	1
were	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
told	1
to	1
march	1
in	1
front.	1
There	1
were	1
about	1
thirty	1
officers,	1
with	1
Pierre	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
about	1
three	1
hundred	1
men.	1
	1
The	1
officers,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
sheds,	1
were	1
all	1
strangers	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
much	1
better	1
dressed	1
than	1
he.	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
shoes	1
mistrustfully,	1
as	1
at	1
an	1
alien.	1
Not	1
far	1
from	1
him	1
walked	1
a	1
fat	1
major	1
with	1
a	1
sallow,	1
bloated,	1
angry	1
face,	1
who	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
Kazan	1
dressing	1
gown	1
tied	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
towel,	1
and	1
who	1
evidently	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
respect	1
of	1
his	1
fellow	1
prisoners.	1
He	1
kept	1
one	1
hand,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
clasped	1
his	1
tobacco	1
pouch,	1
inside	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
held	1
the	1
stem	1
of	1
his	1
pipe	1
firmly	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
Panting	1
and	1
puffing,	1
the	1
major	1
grumbled	1
and	1
growled	1
at	1
everybody	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
pushed	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
hurrying	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
nowhere	1
to	1
hurry	1
to	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
surprised	1
at	1
something	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
at.	1
Another,	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
officer,	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
everyone,	1
conjecturing	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
being	1
taken	1
and	1
how	1
far	1
they	1
would	1
get	1
that	1
day.	1
An	1
official	1
in	1
felt	1
boots	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
commissariat	1
uniform	1
ran	1
round	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
loudly	1
announcing	1
his	1
observations	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
down	1
and	1
what	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
see.	1
A	1
third	1
officer,	1
who	1
by	1
his	1
accent	1
was	1
a	1
Pole,	1
disputed	1
with	1
the	1
commissariat	1
officer,	1
arguing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
identification	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
wards	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
disputing	1
about?"	1
said	1
the	1
major	1
angrily.	1
"What	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
St.	1
Nicholas	1
or	1
St.	1
Blasius?	1
You	1
see	1
it's	1
burned	1
down,	1
and	1
there's	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it....	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
pushing	1
for?	1
Isn't	1
the	1
road	1
wide	1
enough?"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
behind	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
pushing	1
him	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
oh,	1
oh!	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
done?"	1
the	1
prisoners	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
another	1
were	1
heard	1
saying	1
as	1
they	1
gazed	1
on	1
the	1
charred	1
ruins.	1
"All	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
Zubova,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin....	1
Just	1
look!	1
There's	1
not	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
left.	1
Yes,	1
I	1
told	1
you--the	1
whole	1
quarter	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know	1
it's	1
burned,	1
so	1
what's	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking?"	1
said	1
the	1
major.	1
	1
As	1
they	1
passed	1
near	1
a	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
Khamovniki	1
(one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
unburned	1
quarters	1
of	1
Moscow)	1
the	1
whole	1
mass	1
of	1
prisoners	1
suddenly	1
started	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
exclamations	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
disgust	1
were	1
heard.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
the	1
villains!	1
What	1
heathens!	1
Yes;	1
dead,	1
dead,	1
so	1
he	1
is...	1
And	1
smeared	1
with	1
something!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
too	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
church	1
where	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
that	1
evoked	1
these	1
exclamations,	1
and	1
dimly	1
made	1
out	1
something	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
palings	1
surrounding	1
the	1
church.	1
From	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
who	1
saw	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
did,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
set	1
upright	1
against	1
the	1
palings	1
with	1
its	1
face	1
smeared	1
with	1
soot.	1
	1
"Go	1
on!	1
What	1
the	1
devil...	1
Go	1
on!	1
Thirty	1
thousand	1
devils!..."	1
the	1
convoy	1
guards	1
began	1
cursing	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers,	1
with	1
fresh	1
virulence,	1
drove	1
away	1
with	1
their	1
swords	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
prisoners	1
who	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
man.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
cross	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
Khamovniki	1
quarter	1
the	1
prisoners	1
marched,	1
followed	1
only	1
by	1
their	1
escort	1
and	1
the	1
vehicles	1
and	1
wagons	1
belonging	1
to	1
that	1
escort,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
supply	1
stores	1
they	1
came	1
among	1
a	1
huge	1
and	1
closely	1
packed	1
train	1
of	1
artillery	1
mingled	1
with	1
private	1
vehicles.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
bridge	1
they	1
all	1
halted,	1
waiting	1
for	1
those	1
in	1
front	1
to	1
get	1
across.	1
From	1
the	1
bridge	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
endless	1
lines	1
of	1
moving	1
baggage	1
trains	1
before	1
and	1
behind	1
them.	1
To	1
the	1
right,	1
where	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
turns	1
near	1
Neskuchny,	1
endless	1
rows	1
of	1
troops	1
and	1
carts	1
stretched	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
distance.	1
These	1
were	1
troops	1
of	1
Beauharnais'	1
corps	1
which	1
had	1
started	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
Behind,	1
along	1
the	1
riverside	1
and	1
across	1
the	1
Stone	1
Bridge,	1
were	1
Ney's	1
troops	1
and	1
transport.	1
	1
Davout's	1
troops,	1
in	1
whose	1
charge	1
were	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
were	1
crossing	1
the	1
Crimean	1
bridge	1
and	1
some	1
were	1
already	1
debouching	1
into	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
But	1
the	1
baggage	1
trains	1
stretched	1
out	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
Beauharnais'	1
train	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
when	1
the	1
vanguard	1
of	1
Ney's	1
army	1
was	1
already	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
Great	1
Ordynka	1
Street.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
Crimean	1
bridge	1
the	1
prisoners	1
moved	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
forward,	1
halted,	1
and	1
again	1
moved	1
on,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
vehicles	1
and	1
men	1
crowded	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
together.	1
They	1
advanced	1
the	1
few	1
hundred	1
paces	1
that	1
separated	1
the	1
bridge	1
from	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
taking	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
square	1
where	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
Transmoskva	1
ward	1
and	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
converge,	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
jammed	1
close	1
together	1
had	1
to	1
stand	1
for	1
some	1
hours	1
at	1
that	1
crossway.	1
From	1
all	1
sides,	1
like	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
were	1
heard	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
wheels,	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
feet,	1
and	1
incessant	1
shouts	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
abuse.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
pressed	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
a	1
charred	1
house,	1
listening	1
to	1
that	1
noise	1
which	1
mingled	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
with	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
drums.	1
	1
To	1
get	1
a	1
better	1
view,	1
several	1
officer	1
prisoners	1
climbed	1
onto	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
half-burned	1
house	1
against	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
leaning.	1
	1
"What	1
crowds!	1
Just	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
crowds!...	1
They've	1
loaded	1
goods	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
cannon!	1
Look	1
there,	1
those	1
are	1
furs!"	1
they	1
exclaimed.	1
"Just	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
blackguards	1
have	1
looted....	1
There!	1
See	1
what	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
behind	1
in	1
the	1
cart....	1
Why,	1
those	1
are	1
settings	1
taken	1
from	1
some	1
icons,	1
by	1
heaven!...	1
Oh,	1
the	1
rascals!...	1
See	1
how	1
that	1
fellow	1
has	1
loaded	1
himself	1
up,	1
he	1
can	1
hardly	1
walk!	1
Good	1
lord,	1
they've	1
even	1
grabbed	1
those	1
chaises!...	1
See	1
that	1
fellow	1
there	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
trunks....	1
Heavens!	1
They're	1
fighting."	1
	1
"That's	1
right,	1
hit	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
snout--on	1
his	1
snout!	1
Like	1
this,	1
we	1
shan't	1
get	1
away	1
before	1
evening.	1
Look,	1
look	1
there....	1
Why,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
Napoleon's	1
own.	1
See	1
what	1
horses!	1
And	1
the	1
monograms	1
with	1
a	1
crown!	1
It's	1
like	1
a	1
portable	1
house....	1
That	1
fellow's	1
dropped	1
his	1
sack	1
and	1
doesn't	1
see	1
it.	1
Fighting	1
again...	1
A	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
baby,	1
and	1
not	1
bad-looking	1
either!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
they'll	1
let	1
you	1
pass...	1
Just	1
look,	1
there's	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
it.	1
Russian	1
wenches,	1
by	1
heaven,	1
so	1
they	1
are!	1
In	1
carriages--see	1
how	1
comfortably	1
they've	1
settled	1
themselves!"	1
	1
Again,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Khamovniki,	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
general	1
curiosity	1
bore	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
forward	1
onto	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
stature,	1
saw	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
what	1
so	1
attracted	1
their	1
curiosity.	1
In	1
three	1
carriages	1
involved	1
among	1
the	1
munition	1
carts,	1
closely	1
squeezed	1
together,	1
sat	1
women	1
with	1
rouged	1
faces,	1
dressed	1
in	1
glaring	1
colors,	1
who	1
were	1
shouting	1
something	1
in	1
shrill	1
voices.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
had	1
recognized	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
force	1
nothing	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
strange	1
or	1
dreadful:	1
neither	1
the	1
corpse	1
smeared	1
with	1
soot	1
for	1
fun	1
nor	1
these	1
women	1
hurrying	1
away	1
nor	1
the	1
burned	1
ruins	1
of	1
Moscow.	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
witnessed	1
scarcely	1
made	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
him--as	1
if	1
his	1
soul,	1
making	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
hard	1
struggle,	1
refused	1
to	1
receive	1
impressions	1
that	1
might	1
weaken	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
women's	1
vehicles	1
drove	1
by.	1
Behind	1
them	1
came	1
more	1
carts,	1
soldiers,	1
wagons,	1
soldiers,	1
gun	1
carriages,	1
carriages,	1
soldiers,	1
ammunition	1
carts,	1
more	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
women.	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
individuals	1
but	1
saw	1
their	1
movement.	1
	1
All	1
these	1
people	1
and	1
horses	1
seemed	1
driven	1
forward	1
by	1
some	1
invisible	1
power.	1
During	1
the	1
hour	1
Pierre	1
watched	1
them	1
they	1
all	1
came	1
flowing	1
from	1
the	1
different	1
streets	1
with	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
desire	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
quickly;	1
they	1
all	1
jostled	1
one	1
another,	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
angry	1
and	1
to	1
fight,	1
white	1
teeth	1
gleamed,	1
brows	1
frowned,	1
ever	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
of	1
abuse	1
flew	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
bore	1
the	1
same	1
swaggeringly	1
resolute	1
and	1
coldly	1
cruel	1
expression	1
that	1
had	1
struck	1
Pierre	1
that	1
morning	1
on	1
the	1
corporal's	1
face	1
when	1
the	1
drums	1
were	1
beating.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
nearly	1
evening	1
that	1
the	1
officer	1
commanding	1
the	1
escort	1
collected	1
his	1
men	1
and	1
with	1
shouts	1
and	1
quarrels	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
baggage	1
trains,	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
hemmed	1
in	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
emerged	1
onto	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
	1
They	1
marched	1
very	1
quickly,	1
without	1
resting,	1
and	1
halted	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
began	1
to	1
set.	1
The	1
baggage	1
carts	1
drew	1
up	1
close	1
together	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
their	1
night's	1
rest.	1
They	1
all	1
appeared	1
angry	1
and	1
dissatisfied.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
oaths,	1
angry	1
shouts,	1
and	1
fighting	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
all	1
sides.	1
A	1
carriage	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
escort	1
ran	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
carts	1
and	1
knocked	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
it	1
with	1
its	1
pole.	1
Several	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
toward	1
the	1
cart	1
from	1
different	1
sides:	1
some	1
beat	1
the	1
carriage	1
horses	1
on	1
their	1
heads,	1
turning	1
them	1
aside,	1
others	1
fought	1
among	1
themselves,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
one	1
German	1
was	1
badly	1
wounded	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
by	1
a	1
sword.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
men,	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
stopped	1
amid	1
fields	1
in	1
the	1
chill	1
dusk	1
of	1
the	1
autumn	1
evening,	1
experienced	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
unpleasant	1
awakening	1
from	1
the	1
hurry	1
and	1
eagerness	1
to	1
push	1
on	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
start.	1
Once	1
at	1
a	1
standstill	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
going,	1
and	1
that	1
much	1
that	1
was	1
painful	1
and	1
difficult	1
awaited	1
them	1
on	1
this	1
journey.	1
	1
During	1
this	1
halt	1
the	1
escort	1
treated	1
the	1
prisoners	1
even	1
worse	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
the	1
start.	1
It	1
was	1
here	1
that	1
the	1
prisoners	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
received	1
horseflesh	1
for	1
their	1
meat	1
ration.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
officer	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
soldier	1
they	1
showed	1
what	1
seemed	1
like	1
personal	1
spite	1
against	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
in	1
unexpected	1
contrast	1
to	1
their	1
former	1
friendly	1
relations.	1
	1
This	1
spite	1
increased	1
still	1
more	1
when,	1
on	1
calling	1
over	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
bustle	1
of	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
one	1
Russian	1
soldier,	1
who	1
had	1
pretended	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
colic,	1
had	1
escaped.	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
beat	1
a	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
cruelly	1
for	1
straying	1
too	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
captain	1
reprimand	1
and	1
threaten	1
to	1
court-	1
martial	1
a	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
the	1
Russian.	1
To	1
the	1
noncommissioned	1
officer's	1
excuse	1
that	1
the	1
prisoner	1
was	1
ill	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
walk,	1
the	1
officer	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
order	1
was	1
to	1
shoot	1
those	1
who	1
lagged	1
behind.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
that	1
fatal	1
force	1
which	1
had	1
crushed	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
executions,	1
but	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
felt	1
during	1
his	1
imprisonment,	1
now	1
again	1
controlled	1
his	1
existence.	1
It	1
was	1
terrible,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
that	1
fatal	1
force	1
to	1
crush	1
him,	1
there	1
grew	1
and	1
strengthened	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
life	1
independent	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
He	1
ate	1
his	1
supper	1
of	1
buckwheat	1
soup	1
with	1
horseflesh	1
and	1
chatted	1
with	1
his	1
comrades.	1
	1
Neither	1
Pierre	1
nor	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
spoke	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
their	1
treatment	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
shoot	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
announced	1
to	1
them.	1
As	1
if	1
in	1
reaction	1
against	1
the	1
worsening	1
of	1
their	1
position	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
particularly	1
animated	1
and	1
gay.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
personal	1
reminiscences,	1
of	1
amusing	1
scenes	1
they	1
had	1
witnessed	1
during	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
avoided	1
all	1
talk	1
of	1
their	1
present	1
situation.	1
	1
The	1
sun	1
had	1
set	1
long	1
since.	1
Bright	1
stars	1
shone	1
out	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
A	1
red	1
glow	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
conflagration	1
spread	1
above	1
the	1
horizon	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
full	1
moon,	1
and	1
that	1
vast	1
red	1
ball	1
swayed	1
strangely	1
in	1
the	1
gray	1
haze.	1
It	1
grew	1
light.	1
The	1
evening	1
was	1
ending,	1
but	1
the	1
night	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
Pierre	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
his	1
new	1
companions,	1
crossing	1
between	1
the	1
campfires	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
the	1
common	1
soldier	1
prisoners	1
were	1
stationed.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
them.	1
On	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
sentinel	1
who	1
ordered	1
him	1
back.	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
back,	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
companions	1
by	1
the	1
campfire,	1
but	1
to	1
an	1
unharnessed	1
cart	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
nobody.	1
Tucking	1
his	1
legs	1
under	1
him	1
and	1
dropping	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
cold	1
ground	1
by	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
remained	1
motionless	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
sunk	1
in	1
thought.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
burst	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
his	1
broad,	1
good-natured	1
laughter,	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
men	1
from	1
various	1
sides	1
turned	1
with	1
surprise	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
this	1
strange	1
and	1
evidently	1
solitary	1
laughter	1
could	1
mean.	1
	1
"Ha-ha-ha!"	1
laughed	1
Pierre.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
to	1
himself:	1
"The	1
soldier	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
pass.	1
They	1
took	1
me	1
and	1
shut	1
me	1
up.	1
They	1
hold	1
me	1
captive.	1
What,	1
me?	1
Me?	1
My	1
immortal	1
soul?	1
Ha-ha-ha!	1
Ha-ha-ha!..."	1
and	1
he	1
laughed	1
till	1
tears	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
A	1
man	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
this	1
queer	1
big	1
fellow	1
was	1
laughing	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
himself.	1
Pierre	1
stopped	1
laughing,	1
got	1
up,	1
went	1
farther	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
inquisitive	1
man,	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
huge,	1
endless	1
bivouac	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
resounded	1
with	1
the	1
crackling	1
of	1
campfires	1
and	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
many	1
men	1
had	1
grown	1
quiet,	1
the	1
red	1
campfires	1
were	1
growing	1
paler	1
and	1
dying	1
down.	1
High	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
sky	1
hung	1
the	1
full	1
moon.	1
Forests	1
and	1
fields	1
beyond	1
the	1
camp,	1
unseen	1
before,	1
were	1
now	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
And	1
farther	1
still,	1
beyond	1
those	1
forests	1
and	1
fields,	1
the	1
bright,	1
oscillating,	1
limitless	1
distance	1
lured	1
one	1
to	1
itself.	1
Pierre	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
the	1
twinkling	1
stars	1
in	1
its	1
faraway	1
depths.	1
"And	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
me,	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
me,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
I!"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"And	1
they	1
caught	1
all	1
that	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
shed	1
boarded	1
up	1
with	1
planks!"	1
He	1
smiled,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
to	1
sleep	1
beside	1
his	1
companions.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
October	1
another	1
envoy	1
came	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Napoleon	1
proposing	1
peace	1
and	1
falsely	1
dated	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
though	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
already	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Kutuzov	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
Kutuzov	1
replied	1
to	1
this	1
letter	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
formerly	1
brought	1
by	1
Lauriston,	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
that	1
a	1
report	1
was	1
received	1
from	1
Dorokhov's	1
guerrilla	1
detachment	1
operating	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
Tarutino	1
that	1
troops	1
of	1
Broussier's	1
division	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
at	1
Forminsk	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
they	1
might	1
easily	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
again	1
demanded	1
action.	1
Generals	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
excited	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
easy	1
victory	1
at	1
Tarutino,	1
urged	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
Dorokhov's	1
suggestion.	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
any	1
offensive	1
necessary.	1
The	1
result	1
was	1
a	1
compromise	1
which	1
was	1
inevitable:	1
a	1
small	1
detachment	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
Forminsk	1
to	1
attack	1
Broussier.	1
	1
By	1
a	1
strange	1
coincidence,	1
this	1
task,	1
which	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
difficult	1
and	1
important	1
one,	1
was	1
entrusted	1
to	1
Dokhturov--that	1
same	1
modest	1
little	1
Dokhturov	1
whom	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
described	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
drawing	1
up	1
plans	1
of	1
battles,	1
dashing	1
about	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
regiments,	1
showering	1
crosses	1
on	1
batteries,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
undecided	1
and	1
undiscerning--but	1
whom	1
we	1
find	1
commanding	1
wherever	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
most	1
difficult	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
Russo-French	1
wars	1
from	1
Austerlitz	1
to	1
the	1
year	1
1813.	1
At	1
Austerlitz	1
he	1
remained	1
last	1
at	1
the	1
Augezd	1
dam,	1
rallying	1
the	1
regiments,	1
saving	1
what	1
was	1
possible	1
when	1
all	1
were	1
flying	1
and	1
perishing	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
general	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
guard.	1
Ill	1
with	1
fever	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Smolensk	1
with	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
town	1
against	1
Napoleon's	1
whole	1
army.	1
In	1
Smolensk,	1
at	1
the	1
Malakhov	1
Gate,	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
dozed	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
paroxysm	1
of	1
fever	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
bombardment	1
of	1
the	1
town--and	1
Smolensk	1
held	1
out	1
all	1
day	1
long.	1
At	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
when	1
Bagration	1
was	1
killed	1
and	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
had	1
fallen	1
and	1
the	1
full	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
artillery	1
fire	1
was	1
directed	1
against	1
it,	1
the	1
man	1
sent	1
there	1
was	1
this	1
same	1
irresolute	1
and	1
undiscerning	1
Dokhturov--Kutuzov	1
hastening	1
to	1
rectify	1
a	1
mistake	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
by	1
sending	1
someone	1
else	1
there	1
first.	1
And	1
the	1
quiet	1
little	1
Dokhturov	1
rode	1
thither,	1
and	1
Borodino	1
became	1
the	1
greatest	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army.	1
Many	1
heroes	1
have	1
been	1
described	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
verse	1
and	1
prose,	1
but	1
of	1
Dokhturov	1
scarcely	1
a	1
word	1
has	1
been	1
said.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
Dokhturov	1
again	1
whom	1
they	1
sent	1
to	1
Forminsk	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
to	1
Malo-Yaroslavets,	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
last	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
fought	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
obvious	1
disintegration	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
began;	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
told	1
of	1
many	1
geniuses	1
and	1
heroes	1
of	1
that	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
but	1
of	1
Dokhturov	1
nothing	1
or	1
very	1
little	1
is	1
said	1
and	1
that	1
dubiously.	1
And	1
this	1
silence	1
about	1
Dokhturov	1
is	1
the	1
clearest	1
testimony	1
to	1
his	1
merit.	1
	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
workings	1
of	1
a	1
machine	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
a	1
shaving	1
that	1
has	1
fallen	1
into	1
it	1
by	1
chance	1
and	1
is	1
interfering	1
with	1
its	1
action	1
and	1
tossing	1
about	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
its	1
most	1
important	1
part.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
machine	1
cannot	1
conceive	1
that	1
the	1
small	1
connecting	1
cogwheel	1
which	1
revolves	1
quietly	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
essential	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
machine,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
shaving	1
which	1
merely	1
harms	1
and	1
hinders	1
the	1
working.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
October	1
when	1
Dokhturov	1
had	1
gone	1
halfway	1
to	1
Forminsk	1
and	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Aristovo,	1
preparing	1
faithfully	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
orders	1
he	1
had	1
received,	1
the	1
whole	1
French	1
army	1
having,	1
in	1
its	1
convulsive	1
movement,	1
reached	1
Murat's	1
position	1
apparently	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
battle--	1
suddenly	1
without	1
any	1
reason	1
turned	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
onto	1
the	1
new	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
enter	1
Forminsk,	1
where	1
only	1
Broussier	1
had	1
been	1
till	1
then.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Dokhturov	1
had	1
under	1
his	1
command,	1
besides	1
Dorokhov's	1
detachment,	1
the	1
two	1
small	1
guerrilla	1
detachments	1
of	1
Figner	1
and	1
Seslavin.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
October	1
11	1
Seslavin	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Aristovo	1
headquarters	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
guardsman	1
he	1
had	1
captured.	1
The	1
prisoner	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
troops	1
that	1
had	1
entered	1
Forminsk	1
that	1
day	1
were	1
the	1
vanguard	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow	1
four	1
days	1
previously.	1
That	1
same	1
evening	1
a	1
house	1
serf	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Borovsk	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
an	1
immense	1
army	1
entering	1
the	1
town.	1
Some	1
Cossacks	1
of	1
Dokhturov's	1
detachment	1
reported	1
having	1
sighted	1
the	1
French	1
Guards	1
marching	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Borovsk.	1
From	1
all	1
these	1
reports	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
single	1
division	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
French	1
army	1
marching	1
from	1
Moscow	1
in	1
an	1
unexpected	1
direction--along	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road.	1
Dokhturov	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
undertake	1
any	1
action,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
attack	1
Forminsk.	1
But	1
only	1
Broussier	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
there.	1
Ermolov	1
wished	1
to	1
act	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
judgment,	1
but	1
Dokhturov	1
insisted	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
Kutuzov's	1
instructions.	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
dispatch	1
to	1
the	1
staff.	1
	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
a	1
capable	1
officer,	1
Bolkhovitinov,	1
was	1
chosen,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth,	1
besides	1
delivering	1
a	1
written	1
report.	1
Toward	1
midnight	1
Bolkhovitinov,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
dispatch	1
and	1
verbal	1
instructions,	1
galloped	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
General	1
Staff	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
Cossack	1
with	1
spare	1
horses.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
warm,	1
dark,	1
autumn	1
night.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
raining	1
for	1
four	1
days.	1
Having	1
changed	1
horses	1
twice	1
and	1
galloped	1
twenty	1
miles	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
over	1
a	1
sticky,	1
muddy	1
road,	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
reached	1
Litashevka	1
after	1
one	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night.	1
Dismounting	1
at	1
a	1
cottage	1
on	1
whose	1
wattle	1
fence	1
hung	1
a	1
signboard,	1
GENERAL	1
STAFF,	1
and	1
throwing	1
down	1
his	1
reins,	1
he	1
entered	1
a	1
dark	1
passage.	1
	1
"The	1
general	1
on	1
duty,	1
quick!	1
It's	1
very	1
important!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
was	1
sniffing	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
passage.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
unwell	1
since	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
night	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
slept,"	1
said	1
the	1
orderly	1
pleadingly	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
"You	1
should	1
wake	1
the	1
captain	1
first."	1
	1
"But	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
important,	1
from	1
General	1
Dokhturov,"	1
said	1
Bolkhovitinov,	1
entering	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
by	1
feeling	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
	1
The	1
orderly	1
had	1
gone	1
in	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
waking	1
somebody.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
your	1
honor!	1
A	1
courier."	1
	1
"What?	1
What's	1
that?	1
From	1
whom?"	1
came	1
a	1
sleepy	1
voice.	1
	1
"From	1
Dokhturov	1
and	1
from	1
Alexey	1
Petrovich.	1
Napoleon	1
is	1
at	1
Forminsk,"	1
said	1
Bolkhovitinov,	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
who	1
was	1
speaking	1
but	1
guessing	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Konovnitsyn.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
wakened	1
yawned	1
and	1
stretched	1
himself.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
waking	1
him,"	1
he	1
said,	1
fumbling	1
for	1
something.	1
"He	1
is	1
very	1
ill.	1
Perhaps	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
rumor."	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
the	1
dispatch,"	1
said	1
Bolkhovitinov.	1
"My	1
orders	1
are	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
on	1
duty."	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
I'll	1
light	1
a	1
candle.	1
You	1
damned	1
rascal,	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
always	1
hide	1
it?"	1
said	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
stretching	1
himself,	1
to	1
the	1
orderly.	1
(This	1
was	1
Shcherbinin,	1
Konovnitsyn's	1
adjutant.)	1
"I've	1
found	1
it,	1
I've	1
found	1
it!"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
The	1
orderly	1
was	1
striking	1
a	1
light	1
and	1
Shcherbinin	1
was	1
fumbling	1
for	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
candlestick.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
nasty	1
beasts!"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
disgust.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sparks	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
saw	1
Shcherbinin's	1
youthful	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
candle,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
another	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
asleep.	1
This	1
was	1
Konovnitsyn.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
sulphur	1
splinters	1
kindled	1
by	1
the	1
tinder	1
burned	1
up,	1
first	1
blue	1
and	1
then	1
red,	1
Shcherbinin	1
lit	1
the	1
tallow	1
candle,	1
from	1
the	1
candlestick	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
cockroaches	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
gnawing	1
it	1
were	1
running	1
away,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
messenger.	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
was	1
bespattered	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
mud	1
and	1
had	1
smeared	1
his	1
face	1
by	1
wiping	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
sleeve.	1
	1
"Who	1
gave	1
the	1
report?"	1
inquired	1
Shcherbinin,	1
taking	1
the	1
envelope.	1
	1
"The	1
news	1
is	1
reliable,"	1
said	1
Bolkhovitinov.	1
"Prisoners,	1
Cossacks,	1
and	1
the	1
scouts	1
all	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
thing."	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
we'll	1
have	1
to	1
wake	1
him,"	1
said	1
Shcherbinin,	1
rising	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
nightcap	1
who	1
lay	1
covered	1
by	1
a	1
greatcoat.	1
"Peter	1
Petrovich!"	1
said	1
he.	1
(Konovnitsyn	1
did	1
not	1
stir.)	1
"To	1
the	1
General	1
Staff!"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
knowing	1
that	1
those	1
words	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
arouse	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
the	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
nightcap	1
was	1
lifted	1
at	1
once.	1
On	1
Konovnitsyn's	1
handsome,	1
resolute	1
face	1
with	1
cheeks	1
flushed	1
by	1
fever,	1
there	1
still	1
remained	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
a	1
faraway	1
dreamy	1
expression	1
remote	1
from	1
present	1
affairs,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
started	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
its	1
habitual	1
calm	1
and	1
firm	1
appearance.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
is	1
it?	1
From	1
whom?"	1
he	1
asked	1
immediately	1
but	1
without	1
hurry,	1
blinking	1
at	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
While	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
officer's	1
report	1
Konovnitsyn	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
dispatch.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
he	1
done	1
so	1
before	1
he	1
lowered	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
their	1
woolen	1
stockings	1
to	1
the	1
earthen	1
floor	1
and	1
began	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
boots.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
nightcap,	1
combed	1
his	1
hair	1
over	1
his	1
temples,	1
and	1
donned	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
get	1
here	1
quickly?	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
Highness."	1
	1
Konovnitsyn	1
had	1
understood	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
the	1
news	1
brought	1
was	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
time	1
must	1
be	1
lost.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
or	1
ask	1
himself	1
whether	1
the	1
news	1
was	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
That	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him.	1
He	1
regarded	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
intelligence	1
or	1
his	1
reason	1
but	1
by	1
something	1
else.	1
There	1
was	1
within	1
him	1
a	1
deep	1
unexpressed	1
conviction	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well,	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
not	1
trust	1
to	1
this	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
speak	1
about	1
it,	1
but	1
must	1
only	1
attend	1
to	1
one's	1
own	1
work.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
his	1
work,	1
giving	1
his	1
whole	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
task.	1
	1
Peter	1
Petrovich	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
like	1
Dokhturov,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
included	1
merely	1
for	1
propriety's	1
sake	1
in	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
so-called	1
heroes	1
of	1
1812-	1
-the	1
Barclays,	1
Raevskis,	1
Ermolovs,	1
Platovs,	1
and	1
Miloradoviches.	1
Like	1
Dokhturov	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
limited	1
capacity	1
and	1
information,	1
and	1
like	1
Dokhturov	1
he	1
never	1
made	1
plans	1
of	1
battle	1
but	1
was	1
always	1
found	1
where	1
the	1
situation	1
was	1
most	1
difficult.	1
Since	1
his	1
appointment	1
as	1
general	1
on	1
duty	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
door	1
open,	1
giving	1
orders	1
that	1
every	1
messenger	1
should	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
wake	1
him	1
up.	1
In	1
battle	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
under	1
fire,	1
so	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
reproved	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
feared	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
and	1
like	1
Dokhturov	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
unnoticed	1
cogwheels	1
that,	1
without	1
clatter	1
or	1
noise,	1
constitute	1
the	1
most	1
essential	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
machine.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
into	1
the	1
damp,	1
dark	1
night	1
Konovnitsyn	1
frowned--	1
partly	1
from	1
an	1
increased	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
partly	1
at	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
thought	1
that	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
of	1
how	1
all	1
that	1
nest	1
of	1
influential	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
would	1
be	1
stirred	1
up	1
by	1
this	1
news,	1
especially	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
ever	1
since	1
Tarutino	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
daggers	1
drawn	1
with	1
Kutuzov;	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
make	1
suggestions,	1
quarrel,	1
issue	1
orders,	1
and	1
rescind	1
them.	1
And	1
this	1
premonition	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
helped.	1
	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
Toll,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
communicate	1
the	1
news,	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
his	1
plans	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
sharing	1
his	1
quarters,	1
until	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
who	1
listened	1
in	1
weary	1
silence,	1
reminded	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
Highness.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
like	1
all	1
old	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
much	1
at	1
night.	1
He	1
often	1
fell	1
asleep	1
unexpectedly	1
in	1
the	1
daytime,	1
but	1
at	1
night,	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
without	1
undressing,	1
he	1
generally	1
remained	1
awake	1
thinking.	1
	1
So	1
he	1
lay	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
bed,	1
supporting	1
his	1
large,	1
heavy,	1
scarred	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
plump	1
hand,	1
with	1
his	1
one	1
eye	1
open,	1
meditating	1
and	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
Since	1
Bennigsen,	1
who	1
corresponded	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
influence	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
avoid	1
him,	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
more	1
at	1
ease	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
troops	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
useless	1
aggressive	1
movements.	1
The	1
lesson	1
of	1
the	1
Tarutino	1
battle	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
it,	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
remembered	1
with	1
pain,	1
must,	1
he	1
thought,	1
have	1
some	1
effect	1
on	1
others	1
too.	1
	1
"They	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
only	1
lose	1
by	1
taking	1
the	1
offensive.	1
Patience	1
and	1
time	1
are	1
my	1
warriors,	1
my	1
champions,"	1
thought	1
Kutuzov.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
an	1
apple	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
plucked	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
green.	1
It	1
will	1
fall	1
of	1
itself	1
when	1
ripe,	1
but	1
if	1
picked	1
unripe	1
the	1
apple	1
is	1
spoiled,	1
the	1
tree	1
is	1
harmed,	1
and	1
your	1
teeth	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
edge.	1
Like	1
an	1
experienced	1
sportsman	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
wounded,	1
and	1
wounded	1
as	1
only	1
the	1
whole	1
strength	1
of	1
Russia	1
could	1
have	1
wounded	1
it,	1
but	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
mortally	1
wounded	1
or	1
not	1
was	1
still	1
an	1
undecided	1
question.	1
Now	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
Lauriston	1
and	1
Barthelemi	1
having	1
been	1
sent,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
guerrillas,	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
almost	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
wound	1
was	1
mortal.	1
But	1
he	1
needed	1
further	1
proofs	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
wait.	1
	1
"They	1
want	1
to	1
run	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
have	1
wounded	1
it.	1
Wait	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see!	1
Continual	1
maneuvers,	1
continual	1
advances!"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"What	1
for?	1
Only	1
to	1
distinguish	1
themselves!	1
As	1
if	1
fighting	1
were	1
fun.	1
They	1
are	1
like	1
children	1
from	1
whom	1
one	1
can't	1
get	1
any	1
sensible	1
account	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
because	1
they	1
all	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
well	1
they	1
can	1
fight.	1
But	1
that's	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
needed	1
now.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
ingenious	1
maneuvers	1
they	1
all	1
propose	1
to	1
me!	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
contingencies"	1
(he	1
remembered	1
the	1
general	1
plan	1
sent	1
him	1
from	1
Petersburg)	1
"they	1
have	1
foreseen	1
everything.	1
But	1
the	1
contingencies	1
are	1
endless."	1
	1
The	1
undecided	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
the	1
wound	1
inflicted	1
at	1
Borodino	1
was	1
mortal	1
or	1
not	1
had	1
hung	1
over	1
Kutuzov's	1
head	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
occupied	1
Moscow.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
Kutuzov	1
felt	1
assured	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
being	1
that	1
the	1
terrible	1
blow	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
put	1
their	1
whole	1
strength	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
mortal.	1
But	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
proofs	1
were	1
needed;	1
he	1
had	1
waited	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
grew	1
more	1
impatient	1
the	1
longer	1
he	1
waited.	1
Lying	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
during	1
those	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
he	1
did	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
reproached	1
those	1
younger	1
generals	1
for	1
doing.	1
He	1
imagined	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
possible	1
contingencies,	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
younger	1
men,	1
but	1
with	1
this	1
difference,	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
thousands	1
of	1
contingencies	1
instead	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
and	1
based	1
nothing	1
on	1
them.	1
The	1
longer	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
more	1
contingencies	1
presented	1
themselves.	1
He	1
imagined	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Napoleonic	1
army	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
or	1
in	1
sections--against	1
Petersburg,	1
or	1
against	1
him,	1
or	1
to	1
outflank	1
him.	1
He	1
thought	1
too	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
(which	1
he	1
feared	1
most	1
of	1
all)	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
might	1
fight	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
weapon	1
and	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
awaiting	1
him.	1
Kutuzov	1
even	1
imagined	1
that	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
might	1
turn	1
back	1
through	1
Medyn	1
and	1
Yukhnov,	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
foresee	1
was	1
what	1
happened--the	1
insane,	1
convulsive	1
stampede	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
during	1
its	1
first	1
eleven	1
days	1
after	1
leaving	1
Moscow:	1
a	1
stampede	1
which	1
made	1
possible	1
what	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
even	1
dared	1
to	1
think	1
of--the	1
complete	1
extermination	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
Dorokhov's	1
report	1
about	1
Broussier's	1
division,	1
the	1
guerrillas'	1
reports	1
of	1
distress	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
army,	1
rumors	1
of	1
preparations	1
for	1
leaving	1
Moscow,	1
all	1
confirmed	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
was	1
beaten	1
and	1
preparing	1
for	1
flight.	1
But	1
these	1
were	1
only	1
suppositions,	1
which	1
seemed	1
important	1
to	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
With	1
his	1
sixty	1
years'	1
experience	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
value	1
to	1
attach	1
to	1
rumors,	1
knew	1
how	1
apt	1
people	1
who	1
desire	1
anything	1
are	1
to	1
group	1
all	1
news	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
confirm	1
what	1
they	1
desire,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
readily	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
they	1
omit	1
all	1
that	1
makes	1
for	1
the	1
contrary.	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
desired	1
it	1
the	1
less	1
he	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
believe	1
it.	1
This	1
question	1
absorbed	1
all	1
his	1
mental	1
powers.	1
All	1
else	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
life's	1
customary	1
routine.	1
To	1
such	1
customary	1
routine	1
belonged	1
his	1
conversations	1
with	1
the	1
staff,	1
the	1
letters	1
he	1
wrote	1
from	1
Tarutino	1
to	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
novels,	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
awards,	1
his	1
correspondence	1
with	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
which	1
he	1
alone	1
foresaw,	1
was	1
his	1
heart's	1
one	1
desire.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
of	1
October	1
he	1
lay	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
that.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
Toll,	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
and	1
Bolkhovitinov.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
who's	1
there?	1
Come	1
in,	1
come	1
in!	1
What	1
news?"	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
While	1
a	1
footman	1
was	1
lighting	1
a	1
candle,	1
Toll	1
communicated	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
news.	1
	1
"Who	1
brought	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
which,	1
when	1
the	1
candle	1
was	1
lit,	1
struck	1
Toll	1
by	1
its	1
cold	1
severity.	1
	1
"There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
it,	1
your	1
Highness."	1
	1
"Call	1
him	1
in,	1
call	1
him	1
here."	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
hanging	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
paunch	1
resting	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
was	1
doubled	1
under	1
him.	1
He	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
seeing	1
eye	1
to	1
scrutinize	1
the	1
messenger	1
more	1
carefully,	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
read	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
what	1
preoccupied	1
his	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
tell	1
me,	1
friend,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
in	1
his	1
low,	1
aged	1
voice,	1
as	1
he	1
pulled	1
together	1
the	1
shirt	1
which	1
gaped	1
open	1
on	1
his	1
chest,	1
"come	1
nearer--nearer.	1
What	1
news	1
have	1
you	1
brought	1
me?	1
Eh?	1
That	1
Napoleon	1
has	1
left	1
Moscow?	1
Are	1
you	1
sure?	1
Eh?"	1
	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
gave	1
a	1
detailed	1
account	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
to	1
report.	1
	1
"Speak	1
quicker,	1
quicker!	1
Don't	1
torture	1
me!"	1
Kutuzov	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
Bolkhovitinov	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
and	1
was	1
then	1
silent,	1
awaiting	1
instructions.	1
Toll	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
Kutuzov	1
checked	1
him.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
suddenly	1
puckered	1
and	1
wrinkled;	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arm	1
at	1
Toll	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
darkened	1
by	1
the	1
icons	1
that	1
hung	1
there.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord,	1
my	1
Creator,	1
Thou	1
has	1
heard	1
our	1
prayer..."	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
tremulous	1
voice	1
with	1
folded	1
hands.	1
"Russia	1
is	1
saved.	1
I	1
thank	1
Thee,	1
O	1
Lord!"	1
and	1
he	1
wept.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
received	1
this	1
news	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
all	1
Kutuzov's	1
activity	1
was	1
directed	1
toward	1
restraining	1
his	1
troops,	1
by	1
authority,	1
by	1
guile,	1
and	1
by	1
entreaty,	1
from	1
useless	1
attacks,	1
maneuvers,	1
or	1
encounters	1
with	1
the	1
perishing	1
enemy.	1
Dokhturov	1
went	1
to	1
Malo-	1
Yaroslavets,	1
but	1
Kutuzov	1
lingered	1
with	1
the	1
main	1
army	1
and	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
evacuation	1
of	1
Kaluga--a	1
retreat	1
beyond	1
which	1
town	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
quite	1
possible.	1
	1
Everywhere	1
Kutuzov	1
retreated,	1
but	1
the	1
enemy	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
retreat	1
fled	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
direction.	1
	1
Napoleon's	1
historians	1
describe	1
to	1
us	1
his	1
skilled	1
maneuvers	1
at	1
Tarutino	1
and	1
Malo-Yaroslavets,	1
and	1
make	1
conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
Napoleon	1
been	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
penetrate	1
into	1
the	1
rich	1
southern	1
provinces.	1
	1
But	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
nothing	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
advancing	1
into	1
those	1
southern	1
provinces	1
(for	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
did	1
not	1
bar	1
his	1
way),	1
the	1
historians	1
forget	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
have	1
saved	1
his	1
army,	1
for	1
then	1
already	1
it	1
bore	1
within	1
itself	1
the	1
germs	1
of	1
inevitable	1
ruin.	1
How	1
could	1
that	1
army--which	1
had	1
found	1
abundant	1
supplies	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
had	1
trampled	1
them	1
underfoot	1
instead	1
of	1
keeping	1
them,	1
and	1
on	1
arriving	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
had	1
looted	1
provisions	1
instead	1
of	1
storing	1
them--how	1
could	1
that	1
army	1
recuperate	1
in	1
Kaluga	1
province,	1
which	1
was	1
inhabited	1
by	1
Russians	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
where	1
fire	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
property	1
of	1
consuming	1
what	1
was	1
set	1
ablaze?	1
	1
That	1
army	1
could	1
not	1
recover	1
anywhere.	1
Since	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
pillage	1
of	1
Moscow	1
it	1
had	1
borne	1
within	1
itself,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
chemical	1
elements	1
of	1
dissolution.	1
	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
an	1
army--Napoleon	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
soldiers	1
fled--without	1
knowing	1
whither,	1
each	1
concerned	1
only	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
escape	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
this	1
position,	1
of	1
the	1
hopelessness	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
vaguely	1
conscious.	1
	1
So	1
it	1
came	1
about	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
council	1
at	1
Malo-Yaroslavets,	1
when	1
the	1
generals	1
pretending	1
to	1
confer	1
together	1
expressed	1
various	1
opinions,	1
all	1
mouths	1
were	1
closed	1
by	1
the	1
opinion	1
uttered	1
by	1
the	1
simple-minded	1
soldier	1
Mouton	1
who,	1
speaking	1
last,	1
said	1
what	1
they	1
all	1
felt:	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
needful	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible;	1
and	1
no	1
one,	1
not	1
even	1
Napoleon,	1
could	1
say	1
anything	1
against	1
that	1
truth	1
which	1
they	1
all	1
recognized.	1
	1
But	1
though	1
they	1
all	1
realized	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
get	1
away,	1
there	1
still	1
remained	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
at	1
admitting	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
flee.	1
An	1
external	1
shock	1
was	1
needed	1
to	1
overcome	1
that	1
shame,	1
and	1
this	1
shock	1
came	1
in	1
due	1
time.	1
It	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
French	1
called	1
"le	1
hourra	1
de	1
l'Empereur."	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
council	1
at	1
Malo-Yaroslavets	1
Napoleon	1
rode	1
out	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
amid	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
with	1
his	1
suite	1
of	1
marshals	1
and	1
an	1
escort,	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
inspecting	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
battle.	1
Some	1
Cossacks	1
on	1
the	1
prowl	1
for	1
booty	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
very	1
nearly	1
captured	1
him.	1
If	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
did	1
not	1
capture	1
Napoleon	1
then,	1
what	1
saved	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
destroying	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
the	1
booty	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
fell.	1
Here	1
as	1
at	1
Tarutino	1
they	1
went	1
after	1
plunder,	1
leaving	1
the	1
men.	1
Disregarding	1
Napoleon	1
they	1
rushed	1
after	1
the	1
plunder	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
managed	1
to	1
escape.	1
	1
When	1
les	1
enfants	1
du	1
Don	1
might	1
so	1
easily	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
army,	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
fly	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
possible	1
along	1
the	1
nearest,	1
familiar	1
road.	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
his	1
forty-year-old	1
stomach	1
understood	1
that	1
hint,	1
not	1
feeling	1
his	1
former	1
agility	1
and	1
boldness,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
fright	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
agreed	1
with	1
Mouton	1
and	1
issued	1
orders--	1
as	1
the	1
historians	1
tell	1
us--to	1
retreat	1
by	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road.	1
	1
That	1
Napoleon	1
agreed	1
with	1
Mouton,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
retreated,	1
does	1
not	1
prove	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
retreat,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
forces	1
which	1
influenced	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
and	1
directed	1
it	1
along	1
the	1
Mozhaysk	1
(that	1
is,	1
the	1
Smolensk)	1
road	1
acted	1
simultaneously	1
on	1
him	1
also.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
A	1
man	1
in	1
motion	1
always	1
devises	1
an	1
aim	1
for	1
that	1
motion.	1
To	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
thousand	1
miles	1
he	1
must	1
imagine	1
that	1
something	1
good	1
awaits	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
those	1
thousand	1
miles.	1
One	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
promised	1
land	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
move.	1
	1
The	1
promised	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
during	1
their	1
advance	1
had	1
been	1
Moscow,	1
during	1
their	1
retreat	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
native	1
land.	1
But	1
that	1
native	1
land	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
going	1
a	1
thousand	1
miles	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
set	1
aside	1
his	1
final	1
goal	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
himself:	1
"Today	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
twenty-five	1
miles	1
off	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
rest	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
night,"	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
day's	1
journey	1
that	1
resting	1
place	1
eclipses	1
his	1
ultimate	1
goal	1
and	1
attracts	1
all	1
his	1
hopes	1
and	1
desires.	1
And	1
the	1
impulses	1
felt	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
person	1
are	1
always	1
magnified	1
in	1
a	1
crowd.	1
	1
For	1
the	1
French	1
retreating	1
along	1
the	1
old	1
Smolensk	1
road,	1
the	1
final	1
goal--	1
their	1
native	1
land--was	1
too	1
remote,	1
and	1
their	1
immediate	1
goal	1
was	1
Smolensk,	1
toward	1
which	1
all	1
their	1
desires	1
and	1
hopes,	1
enormously	1
intensified	1
in	1
the	1
mass,	1
urged	1
them	1
on.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
much	1
food	1
and	1
fresh	1
troops	1
awaited	1
them	1
in	1
Smolensk,	1
nor	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
told	1
so	1
(on	1
the	1
contrary	1
their	1
superior	1
officers,	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
himself,	1
knew	1
that	1
provisions	1
were	1
scarce	1
there),	1
but	1
because	1
this	1
alone	1
could	1
give	1
them	1
strength	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
and	1
endure	1
their	1
present	1
privations.	1
So	1
both	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
deceived	1
themselves,	1
and	1
pushed	1
on	1
to	1
Smolensk	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
promised	1
land.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
highroad	1
the	1
French	1
fled	1
with	1
surprising	1
energy	1
and	1
unheard-of	1
rapidity	1
toward	1
the	1
goal	1
they	1
had	1
fixed	1
on.	1
Besides	1
the	1
common	1
impulse	1
which	1
bound	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd	1
of	1
French	1
into	1
one	1
mass	1
and	1
supplied	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
energy,	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
cause	1
binding	1
them	1
together--their	1
great	1
numbers.	1
As	1
with	1
the	1
physical	1
law	1
of	1
gravity,	1
their	1
enormous	1
mass	1
drew	1
the	1
individual	1
human	1
atoms	1
to	1
itself.	1
In	1
their	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
they	1
moved	1
like	1
a	1
whole	1
nation.	1
	1
Each	1
of	1
them	1
desired	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
give	1
himself	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
prisoner	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
all	1
this	1
horror	1
and	1
misery;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
this	1
common	1
attraction	1
to	1
Smolensk,	1
their	1
goal,	1
drew	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction;	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
an	1
army	1
corps	1
could	1
not	1
surrender	1
to	1
a	1
company,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
French	1
availed	1
themselves	1
of	1
every	1
convenient	1
opportunity	1
to	1
detach	1
themselves	1
and	1
to	1
surrender	1
on	1
the	1
slightest	1
decent	1
pretext,	1
such	1
pretexts	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
occur.	1
Their	1
very	1
numbers	1
and	1
their	1
crowded	1
and	1
swift	1
movement	1
deprived	1
them	1
of	1
that	1
possibility	1
and	1
rendered	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
difficult	1
but	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
Russians	1
to	1
stop	1
this	1
movement,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
directing	1
all	1
their	1
energies.	1
Beyond	1
a	1
certain	1
limit	1
no	1
mechanical	1
disruption	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
could	1
hasten	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
decomposition.	1
	1
A	1
lump	1
of	1
snow	1
cannot	1
be	1
melted	1
instantaneously.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
limit	1
of	1
time	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
which	1
no	1
amount	1
of	1
heat	1
can	1
melt	1
the	1
snow.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
heat	1
the	1
more	1
solidified	1
the	1
remaining	1
snow	1
becomes.	1
	1
Of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders	1
Kutuzov	1
alone	1
understood	1
this.	1
When	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
along	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road	1
became	1
well	1
defined,	1
what	1
Konovnitsyn	1
had	1
foreseen	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
of	1
October	1
began	1
to	1
occur.	1
The	1
superior	1
officers	1
all	1
wanted	1
to	1
distinguish	1
themselves,	1
to	1
cut	1
off,	1
to	1
seize,	1
to	1
capture,	1
and	1
to	1
overthrow	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
all	1
clamored	1
for	1
action.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
alone	1
used	1
all	1
his	1
power	1
(and	1
such	1
power	1
is	1
very	1
limited	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
any	1
commander-in-chief)	1
to	1
prevent	1
an	1
attack.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
them	1
what	1
we	1
say	1
now:	1
"Why	1
fight,	1
why	1
block	1
the	1
road,	1
losing	1
our	1
own	1
men	1
and	1
inhumanly	1
slaughtering	1
unfortunate	1
wretches?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
that,	1
when	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
their	1
army	1
has	1
melted	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Vyazma	1
without	1
any	1
battle?"	1
But	1
drawing	1
from	1
his	1
aged	1
wisdom	1
what	1
they	1
could	1
understand,	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
bridge,	1
and	1
they	1
laughed	1
at	1
and	1
slandered	1
him,	1
flinging	1
themselves	1
on,	1
rending	1
and	1
exulting	1
over	1
the	1
dying	1
beast.	1
	1
Ermolov,	1
Miloradovich,	1
Platov,	1
and	1
others	1
in	1
proximity	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
near	1
Vyazma	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
their	1
desire	1
to	1

two	1

corps,	1
and	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
reporting	1
their	1
intention	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
they	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
blank	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
in	1
an	1
envelope.	1
	1
And	1
try	1
as	1
Kutuzov	1
might	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
troops,	1
our	1

trying	1

Infantry	1

	1
But	1
they	1

the	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
The	1
Battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
with	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
Moscow	1
that	1
followed	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
without	1
further	1
conflicts,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
instructive	1
phenomena	1
in	1
history.	1
	1
All	1
historians	1
agree	1
that	1
the	1
external	1
activity	1
of	1
states	1
and	1
nations	1
in	1
their	1
conflicts	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
is	1
expressed	1
in	1
wars,	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
direct	1
result	1
of	1
greater	1
or	1
less	1
success	1
in	1
war	1
the	1
political	1
strength	1
of	1
states	1
and	1
nations	1
increases	1
or	1
decreases.	1
	1
Strange	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
historical	1
account	1
of	1
how	1
some	1
king	1
or	1
emperor,	1
having	1
quarreled	1
with	1
another,	1
collects	1
an	1
army,	1
fights	1
his	1
enemy's	1
army,	1
gains	1
a	1
victory	1
by	1
killing	1
three,	1
five,	1
or	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
subjugates	1
a	1
kingdom	1
and	1
an	1
entire	1
nation	1
of	1
several	1
millions,	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
history	1
(as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
it)	1
confirm	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
statement	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
success	1
of	1
one	1
army	1
against	1
another	1
is	1
the	1
cause,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
essential	1
indication,	1
of	1
an	1
increase	1
or	1
decrease	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
nation--even	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
unintelligible	1
why	1
the	1
defeat	1
of	1
an	1
army--a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
nation--should	1
oblige	1
that	1
whole	1
nation	1
to	1
submit.	1
An	1
army	1
gains	1
a	1
victory,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
conquering	1
nation	1
have	1
increased	1
to	1
the	1
detriment	1
of	1
the	1
defeated.	1
An	1
army	1
has	1
suffered	1
defeat,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
people	1
loses	1
its	1
rights	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
severity	1
of	1
the	1
reverse,	1
and	1
if	1
its	1
army	1
suffers	1
a	1
complete	1
defeat	1
the	1
nation	1
is	1
quite	1
subjugated.	1
	1
So	1
according	1
to	1
history	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
times,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
day.	1
All	1
Napoleon's	1
wars	1
serve	1
to	1
confirm	1
this	1
rule.	1
In	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
defeat	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army	1
Austria	1
loses	1
its	1
rights,	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
France	1
increase.	1
The	1
victories	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
at	1
Jena	1
and	1
Auerstadt	1
destroy	1
the	1
independent	1
existence	1
of	1
Prussia.	1
	1
But	1
then,	1
in	1
1812,	1
the	1
French	1
gain	1
a	1
victory	1
near	1
Moscow.	1
Moscow	1
is	1
taken	1
and	1
after	1
that,	1
with	1
no	1
further	1
battles,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
Russia	1
that	1
ceases	1
to	1
exist,	1
but	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
of	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand,	1
and	1
then	1
Napoleonic	1
France	1
itself.	1
To	1
strain	1
the	1
facts	1
to	1
fit	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
history:	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
at	1
Borodino	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Russians,	1
or	1
that	1
after	1
Moscow	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
battles	1
that	1
destroyed	1
Napoleon's	1
army,	1
is	1
impossible.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
French	1
victory	1
at	1
Borodino	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
general	1
engagement	1
nor	1
any	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
all	1
serious,	1
yet	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
ceased	1
to	1
exist.	1
What	1
does	1
this	1
mean?	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
an	1
example	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
China,	1
we	1
might	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
historic	1
phenomenon	1
(which	1
is	1
the	1
historians'	1
usual	1
expedient	1
when	1
anything	1
does	1
not	1
fit	1
their	1
standards);	1
if	1
the	1
matter	1
concerned	1
some	1
brief	1
conflict	1
in	1
which	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
took	1
part,	1
we	1
might	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
exception;	1
but	1
this	1
event	1
occurred	1
before	1
our	1
fathers'	1
eyes,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
of	1
their	1
fatherland,	1
and	1
it	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
known	1
wars.	1
	1
The	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812	1
from	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
to	1
the	1
expulsion	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
winning	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
does	1
not	1
produce	1
a	1
conquest	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
an	1
invariable	1
indication	1
of	1
conquest;	1
it	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
force	1
which	1
decides	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
peoples	1
lies	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
conquerors,	1
nor	1
even	1
in	1
armies	1
and	1
battles,	1
but	1
in	1
something	1
else.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
historians,	1
describing	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
before	1
it	1
left	1
Moscow,	1
affirm	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
in	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
Grand	1
Army,	1
except	1
the	1
cavalry,	1
the	1
artillery,	1
and	1
the	1
transport--there	1
was	1
no	1
forage	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
or	1
the	1
cattle.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
remedy,	1
for	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
burned	1
their	1
hay	1
rather	1
than	1
let	1
the	1
French	1
have	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
victory	1
gained	1
did	1
not	1
bring	1
the	1
usual	1
results	1
because	1
the	1
peasants	1
Karp	1
and	1
Vlas	1
(who	1
after	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
evacuated	1
Moscow	1
drove	1
in	1
their	1
carts	1
to	1
pillage	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
personally	1
failed	1
to	1
manifest	1
any	1
heroic	1
feelings),	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
innumerable	1
multitude	1
of	1
such	1
peasants,	1
did	1
not	1
bring	1
their	1
hay	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
the	1
high	1
price	1
offered	1
them,	1
but	1
burned	1
it	1
instead.	1
	1
Let	1
us	1
imagine	1
two	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel	1
with	1
rapiers	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
fencing.	1
The	1
fencing	1
has	1
gone	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
time;	1
suddenly	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
combatants,	1
feeling	1
himself	1
wounded	1
and	1
understanding	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
no	1
joke	1
but	1
concerns	1
his	1
life,	1
throws	1
down	1
his	1
rapier,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
first	1
cudgel	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
hand	1
begins	1
to	1
brandish	1
it.	1
Then	1
let	1
us	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
combatant	1
who	1
so	1
sensibly	1
employed	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
simplest	1
means	1
to	1
attain	1
his	1
end	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
influenced	1
by	1
traditions	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and,	1
desiring	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
insisted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
his	1
victory	1
with	1
the	1
rapier	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
art.	1
One	1
can	1
imagine	1
what	1
confusion	1
and	1
obscurity	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
such	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
duel.	1
	1
The	1
fencer	1
who	1
demanded	1
a	1
contest	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
fencing	1
was	1
the	1
French	1
army;	1
his	1
opponent	1
who	1
threw	1
away	1
the	1
rapier	1
and	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
cudgel	1
was	1
the	1
Russian	1
people;	1
those	1
who	1
try	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
matter	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
fencing	1
are	1
the	1
historians	1
who	1
have	1
described	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
a	1
war	1
began	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
any	1
previous	1
traditions	1
of	1
war.	1
The	1
burning	1
of	1
towns	1
and	1
villages,	1
the	1
retreats	1
after	1
battles,	1
the	1
blow	1
dealt	1
at	1
Borodino	1
and	1
the	1
renewed	1
retreat,	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
marauders,	1
the	1
seizure	1
of	1
transports,	1
and	1
the	1
guerrilla	1
war	1
were	1
all	1
departures	1
from	1
the	1
rules.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
felt	1
this,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
correct	1
fencing	1
attitude	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
opponent's	1
rapier	1
saw	1
a	1
cudgel	1
raised	1
above	1
his	1
head,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
complain	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules--as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
rules	1
for	1
killing	1
people.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
complaints	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
nonobservance	1
of	1
the	1
rules,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
to	1
some	1
highly	1
placed	1
Russians	1
it	1
seemed	1
rather	1
disgraceful	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
a	1
cudgel	1
and	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
assume	1
a	1
pose	1
en	1
quarte	1
or	1
en	1
tierce	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
adroit	1
thrust	1
en	1
prime,	1
and	1
so	1
on--the	1
cudgel	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
war	1
was	1
lifted	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
menacing	1
and	1
majestic	1
strength,	1
and	1
without	1
consulting	1
anyone's	1
tastes	1
or	1
rules	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
anything	1
else,	1
it	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
with	1
stupid	1
simplicity,	1
but	1
consistently,	1
and	1
belabored	1
the	1
French	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
invasion	1
had	1
perished.	1
	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
for	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
do	1
not--as	1
the	1
French	1
did	1
in	1
1813--	1
salute	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
art,	1
and,	1
presenting	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
their	1
rapier	1
gracefully	1
and	1
politely,	1
hand	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
magnanimous	1
conqueror,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
trial,	1
without	1
asking	1
what	1
rules	1
others	1
have	1
adopted	1
in	1
similar	1
cases,	1
simply	1
and	1
easily	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
first	1
cudgel	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
hand	1
and	1
strike	1
with	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
resentment	1
and	1
revenge	1
in	1
their	1
soul	1
yields	1
to	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
contempt	1
and	1
compassion.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
obvious	1
and	1
advantageous	1
departures	1
from	1
the	1
so-called	1
laws	1
of	1
war	1
is	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
scattered	1
groups	1
against	1
men	1
pressed	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
mass.	1
Such	1
action	1
always	1
occurs	1
in	1
wars	1
that	1
take	1
on	1
a	1
national	1
character.	1
In	1
such	1
actions,	1
instead	1
of	1
two	1
crowds	1
opposing	1
each	1
other,	1
the	1
men	1
disperse,	1
attack	1
singly,	1
run	1
away	1
when	1
attacked	1
by	1
stronger	1
forces,	1
but	1
again	1
attack	1
when	1
opportunity	1
offers.	1
This	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
guerrillas	1
in	1
Spain,	1
by	1
the	1
mountain	1
tribes	1
in	1
the	1
Caucasus,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Russians	1
in	1
1812.	1
	1
People	1
have	1
called	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
war	1
"guerrilla	1
warfare"	1
and	1
assume	1
that	1
by	1
so	1
calling	1
it	1
they	1
have	1
explained	1
its	1
meaning.	1
But	1
such	1
a	1
war	1
does	1
not	1
fit	1
in	1
under	1
any	1
rule	1
and	1
is	1
directly	1
opposed	1
to	1
a	1
well-known	1
rule	1
of	1
tactics	1
which	1
is	1
accepted	1
as	1
infallible.	1
That	1
rule	1
says	1
that	1
an	1
attacker	1
should	1
concentrate	1
his	1
forces	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
his	1
opponent	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
conflict.	1
	1
Guerrilla	1
war	1
(always	1
successful,	1
as	1
history	1
shows)	1
directly	1
infringes	1
that	1
rule.	1
	1
This	1
contradiction	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
military	1
science	1
assumes	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
be	1
identical	1
with	1
its	1
numbers.	1
Military	1
science	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
troops	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
strength.	1
Les	1
gros	1
bataillons	1
ont	1
toujours	1
raison.	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
Large	1
battalions	1
are	1
always	1
victorious.	1
	1
For	1
military	1
science	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
is	1
like	1
defining	1
momentum	1
in	1
mechanics	1

only:	1
stating	1
that	1
momenta	1
are	1
equal	1
or	1
unequal	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
simply	1
because	1
the	1
masses	1
involved	1
are	1
equal	1
or	1
unequal.	1
	1
Momentum	1
(quantity	1
of	1
motion)	1
is	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
mass	1
and	1
velocity.	1
	1
In	1
military	1
affairs	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
is	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
its	1
mass	1
and	1
some	1
unknown	1
x.	1
	1
Military	1
science,	1
seeing	1
in	1
history	1
innumerable	1
instances	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
any	1
army	1
does	1
not	1
coincide	1
with	1
its	1
strength	1
and	1
that	1
small	1
detachments	1
defeat	1
larger	1
ones,	1
obscurely	1
admits	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
this	1
unknown	1
factor	1
and	1
tries	1
to	1
discover	1
it--now	1
in	1
a	1
geometric	1
formation,	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
equipment	1
employed,	1
now,	1
and	1
most	1
usually,	1
in	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
commanders.	1
But	1
the	1
assignment	1
of	1
these	1
various	1
meanings	1
to	1
the	1
factor	1
does	1
not	1
yield	1
results	1
which	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
historic	1
facts.	1
	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
false	1
view	1
(adopted	1
to	1
gratify	1
the	1
"heroes")	1
of	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
directions	1
issued	1
in	1
wartime	1
by	1
commanders,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
find	1
this	1
unknown	1
quantity.	1
	1
That	1
unknown	1
quantity	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
readiness	1
to	1
fight	1
and	1
face	1
danger	1
felt	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
composing	1
an	1
army,	1
quite	1
independently	1
of	1
whether	1
they	1
are,	1
or	1
are	1
not,	1
fighting	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
genius,	1
in	1
two--or	1
three-line	1
formation,	1
with	1
cudgels	1
or	1
with	1
rifles	1
that	1
repeat	1
thirty	1
times	1
a	1
minute.	1
Men	1
who	1
want	1
to	1
fight	1
will	1
always	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
advantageous	1
conditions	1
for	1
fighting.	1
	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
is	1
the	1
factor	1
which	1
multiplied	1
by	1
the	1
mass	1
gives	1
the	1
resulting	1
force.	1
To	1
define	1
and	1
express	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
unknown	1
factor--the	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
army--is	1
a	1
problem	1
for	1
science.	1
	1
This	1
problem	1
is	1
only	1
solvable	1
if	1
we	1
cease	1
arbitrarily	1
to	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
x	1
itself	1
the	1
conditions	1
under	1
which	1
that	1
force	1
becomes	1
apparent--such	1
as	1
the	1
commands	1
of	1
the	1
general,	1
the	1
equipment	1
employed,	1
and	1
so	1
on--mistaking	1
these	1
for	1
the	1
real	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
factor,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
recognize	1
this	1
unknown	1
quantity	1
in	1
its	1
entirety	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
desire	1
to	1
fight	1
and	1
to	1
face	1
danger.	1
Only	1
then,	1
expressing	1
known	1
historic	1
facts	1
by	1
equations	1
and	1
comparing	1
the	1
relative	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
factor,	1
can	1
we	1
hope	1
to	1
define	1
the	1
unknown.	1
	1
Ten	1
men,	1
battalions,	1
or	1
divisions,	1
fighting	1
fifteen	1
men,	1
battalions,	1
or	1
divisions,	1
conquer--that	1
is,	1
kill	1
or	1
take	1
captive--all	1
the	1
others,	1
while	1
themselves	1
losing	1
four,	1
so	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
four	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
fifteen	1
were	1
lost.	1
Consequently	1
the	1
four	1
were	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
fifteen,	1
and	1
therefore	1
4x	1
=	1
15y.	1
Consequently	1
x/y	1
=	1
15/4.	1
This	1
equation	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
factor	1
but	1
gives	1
us	1
a	1
ratio	1
between	1
two	1
unknowns.	1
And	1
by	1
bringing	1
variously	1
selected	1
historic	1
units	1
(battles,	1
campaigns,	1
periods	1
of	1
war)	1
into	1
such	1
equations,	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
numbers	1
could	1
be	1
obtained	1
in	1
which	1
certain	1
laws	1
should	1
exist	1
and	1
might	1
be	1
discovered.	1
	1
The	1
tactical	1
rule	1
that	1
an	1
army	1
should	1
act	1
in	1
masses	1
when	1
attacking,	1
and	1
in	1
smaller	1
groups	1
in	1
retreat,	1
unconsciously	1
confirms	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
depends	1
on	1
its	1
spirit.	1
To	1
lead	1
men	1
forward	1
under	1
fire	1
more	1
discipline	1
(obtainable	1
only	1
by	1
movement	1
in	1
masses)	1
is	1
needed	1
than	1
is	1
needed	1
to	1
resist	1
attacks.	1
But	1
this	1
rule	1
which	1
leaves	1
out	1
of	1
account	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
continually	1
proves	1
incorrect	1
and	1
is	1
in	1
particularly	1
striking	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
facts	1
when	1
some	1
strong	1
rise	1
or	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
occurs,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
national	1
wars.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
retreating	1
in	1
1812--though	1
according	1
to	1
tactics	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
separated	1
into	1
detachments	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves--congregated	1
into	1
a	1
mass	1
because	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
had	1
so	1
fallen	1
that	1
only	1
the	1
mass	1
held	1
the	1
army	1
together.	1
The	1
Russians,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
ought	1
according	1
to	1
tactics	1
to	1
have	1
attacked	1
in	1
mass,	1
but	1
in	1
fact	1
they	1
split	1
up	1
into	1
small	1
units,	1
because	1
their	1
spirit	1
had	1
so	1
risen	1
that	1
separate	1
individuals,	1
without	1
orders,	1
dealt	1
blows	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
without	1
needing	1
any	1
compulsion	1
to	1
induce	1
them	1
to	1
expose	1
themselves	1
to	1
hardships	1
and	1
dangers.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
The	1
so-called	1
partisan	1
war	1
began	1
with	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
into	1
Smolensk.	1
	1
Before	1
partisan	1
warfare	1
had	1
been	1
officially	1
recognized	1
by	1
the	1
government,	1
thousands	1
of	1
enemy	1
stragglers,	1
marauders,	1
and	1
foragers	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
the	1
peasants,	1
who	1
killed	1
them	1
off	1
as	1
instinctively	1
as	1
dogs	1
worry	1
a	1
stray	1
mad	1
dog	1
to	1
death.	1
Denis	1
Davydov,	1
with	1
his	1
Russian	1
instinct,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
recognize	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
this	1
terrible	1
cudgel	1
which	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
military	1
science	1
destroyed	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
belongs	1
the	1
credit	1
for	1
taking	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
toward	1
regularizing	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
warfare.	1
	1
On	1
August	1
24	1
Davydov's	1
first	1
partisan	1
detachment	1
was	1
formed	1
and	1
then	1
others	1
were	1
recognized.	1
The	1
further	1
the	1
campaign	1
progressed	1
the	1
more	1
numerous	1
these	1
detachments	1
became.	1
	1
The	1
irregulars	1
destroyed	1
the	1
great	1
army	1
piecemeal.	1
They	1
gathered	1
the	1
fallen	1
leaves	1
that	1
dropped	1
of	1
themselves	1
from	1
that	1
withered	1
tree--the	1
French	1
army--and	1
sometimes	1
shook	1
that	1
tree	1
itself.	1
By	1
October,	1
when	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
fleeing	1
toward	1
Smolensk,	1
there	1
were	1
hundreds	1
of	1
such	1
companies,	1
of	1
various	1
sizes	1
and	1
characters.	1
There	1
were	1
some	1
that	1
adopted	1
all	1
the	1
army	1
methods	1
and	1
had	1
infantry,	1
artillery,	1
staffs,	1
and	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life.	1
Others	1
consisted	1
solely	1
of	1
Cossack	1
cavalry.	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
small	1
scratch	1
groups	1
of	1
foot	1
and	1
horse,	1
and	1
groups	1
of	1
peasants	1
and	1
landowners	1
that	1
remained	1
unknown.	1
A	1
sacristan	1
commanded	1
one	1
party	1
which	1
captured	1
several	1
hundred	1
prisoners	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
month;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
Vasilisa,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
elder,	1
who	1
slew	1
hundreds	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
The	1
partisan	1
warfare	1
flamed	1
up	1
most	1
fiercely	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
of	1
October.	1
Its	1
first	1
period	1
had	1
passed:	1
when	1
the	1
partisans	1
themselves,	1
amazed	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
boldness,	1
feared	1
every	1
minute	1
to	1
be	1
surrounded	1
and	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
forests	1
without	1
unsaddling,	1
hardly	1
daring	1
to	1
dismount	1
and	1
always	1
expecting	1
to	1
be	1
pursued.	1
By	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
October	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
warfare	1
had	1
taken	1
definite	1
shape:	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
clear	1
to	1
all	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
ventured	1
against	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
what	1
could	1
not.	1
Now	1
only	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
detachments	1
with	1
staffs,	1
and	1
moving	1
according	1
to	1
rules	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
still	1
regarded	1
many	1
things	1
as	1
impossible.	1
The	1
small	1
bands	1
that	1
had	1
started	1
their	1
activities	1
long	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
already	1
observed	1
the	1
French	1
closely	1
considered	1
things	1
possible	1
which	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
detachments	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
contemplate.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
peasants	1
who	1
crept	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
French	1
now	1
considered	1
everything	1
possible.	1
	1
On	1
October	1
22,	1
Denisov	1
(who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
irregulars)	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
group	1
at	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
guerrilla	1
enthusiasm.	1
Since	1
early	1
morning	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
move.	1
All	1
day	1
long	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
from	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
skirted	1
the	1
highroad	1
a	1
large	1
French	1
convoy	1
of	1
cavalry	1
baggage	1
and	1
Russian	1
prisoners	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
which--as	1
was	1
learned	1
from	1
spies	1
and	1
prisoners--was	1
moving	1
under	1
a	1
strong	1
escort	1
to	1
Smolensk.	1
Besides	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
(who	1
also	1
led	1
a	1
small	1
party	1
and	1
moved	1
in	1
Denisov's	1
vicinity),	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
some	1
large	1
divisions	1
with	1
staffs	1
also	1
knew	1
of	1
this	1
convoy	1
and,	1
as	1
Denisov	1
expressed	1
it,	1
were	1
sharpening	1
their	1
teeth	1
for	1
it.	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
large	1
parties--one	1
a	1
Pole	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
German--sent	1
invitations	1
to	1
Denisov	1
almost	1
simultaneously,	1
requesting	1
him	1
to	1
join	1
up	1
with	1
their	1
divisions	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
convoy.	1
	1
"No,	1
bwother,	1
I	1
have	1
gwown	1
mustaches	1
myself,"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
on	1
reading	1
these	1
documents,	1
and	1
he	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
German	1
that,	1
despite	1
his	1
heartfelt	1
desire	1
to	1
serve	1
under	1
so	1
valiant	1
and	1
renowned	1
a	1
general,	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
forgo	1
that	1
pleasure	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
Polish	1
general.	1
To	1
the	1
Polish	1
general	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
effect,	1
informing	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
German.	1
	1
Having	1
arranged	1
matters	1
thus,	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
intended,	1
without	1
reporting	1
matters	1
to	1
the	1
higher	1
command,	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
seize	1
that	1
convoy	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
small	1
forces.	1
On	1
October	1
22	1
it	1
was	1
moving	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Mikulino	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
Shamshevo.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
between	1
Mikulino	1
and	1
Shamshevo	1
there	1
were	1
large	1
forests,	1
extending	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
itself	1
though	1
in	1
others	1
a	1
mile	1
or	1
more	1
back	1
from	1
it.	1
Through	1
these	1
forests	1
Denisov	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
rode	1
all	1
day,	1
sometimes	1
keeping	1
well	1
back	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
sometimes	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
edge,	1
but	1
never	1
losing	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
French.	1
That	1
morning,	1
Cossacks	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
party	1
had	1
seized	1
and	1
carried	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
two	1
wagons	1
loaded	1
with	1
cavalry	1
saddles,	1
which	1
had	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Mikulino	1
where	1
the	1
forest	1
ran	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
road.	1
Since	1
then,	1
and	1
until	1
evening,	1
the	1
party	1
had	1
watched	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
without	1
attacking.	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
French	1
reach	1
Shamshevo	1
quietly	1
without	1
alarming	1
them	1
and	1
then,	1
after	1
joining	1
Dolokhov	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
a	1
consultation	1
at	1
a	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
Shamshevo,	1
to	1
surprise	1
the	1
French	1
at	1
dawn,	1
falling	1
like	1
an	1
avalanche	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
from	1
two	1
sides,	1
and	1
rout	1
and	1
capture	1
them	1
all	1
at	1
one	1
blow.	1
	1
In	1
their	1
rear,	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
Mikulino	1
where	1
the	1
forest	1
came	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
six	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
posted	1
to	1
report	1
if	1
any	1
fresh	1
columns	1
of	1
French	1
should	1
show	1
themselves.	1
	1
Beyond	1
Shamshevo,	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
road	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
at	1
what	1
distance	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
French	1
troops.	1
They	1
reckoned	1
that	1
the	1
convoy	1
had	1
fifteen	1
hundred	1
men.	1
Denisov	1
had	1
two	1
hundred,	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
might	1
have	1
as	1
many	1
more,	1
but	1
the	1
disparity	1
of	1
numbers	1
did	1
not	1
deter	1
Denisov.	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
was	1
what	1
troops	1
these	1
were	1
and	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
"tongue"--that	1
is,	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
enemy	1
column.	1
That	1
morning's	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
wagons	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
so	1
hastily	1
that	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
with	1
the	1
wagons	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
killed;	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
drummer	1
boy	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
alive,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
straggler	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
them	1
nothing	1
definite	1
about	1
the	1
troops	1
in	1
that	1
column.	1
	1
Denisov	1
considered	1
it	1
dangerous	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
second	1
attack	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
putting	1
the	1
whole	1
column	1
on	1
the	1
alert,	1
so	1
he	1
sent	1
Tikhon	1
Shcherbaty,	1
a	1
peasant	1
of	1
his	1
party,	1
to	1
Shamshevo	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
seize	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
quartermasters	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
on	1
in	1
advance.	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
warm	1
rainy	1
autumn	1
day.	1
The	1
sky	1
and	1
the	1
horizon	1
were	1
both	1
the	1
color	1
of	1
muddy	1
water.	1
At	1
times	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
mist	1
descended,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
heavy	1
slanting	1
rain	1
came	1
down.	1
	1
Denisov	1
in	1
a	1
felt	1
cloak	1
and	1
a	1
sheepskin	1
cap	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
rain	1
ran	1
down	1
was	1
riding	1
a	1
thin	1
thoroughbred	1
horse	1
with	1
sunken	1
sides.	1
Like	1
his	1
horse,	1
which	1
turned	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
laid	1
its	1
ears	1
back,	1
he	1
shrank	1
from	1
the	1
driving	1
rain	1
and	1
gazed	1
anxiously	1
before	1
him.	1
His	1
thin	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
short,	1
thick	1
black	1
beard	1
looked	1
angry.	1
	1
Beside	1
Denisov	1
rode	1
an	1
esaul,	1
*	1
Denisov's	1
fellow	1
worker,	1
also	1
in	1
felt	1
cloak	1
and	1
sheepskin	1
cap,	1
and	1
riding	1
a	1
large	1
sleek	1
Don	1
horse.	1
	1
	1
*	1
A	1
captain	1
of	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
Esaul	1
Lovayski	1
the	1
Third	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
as	1
straight	1
as	1
an	1
arrow,	1
pale-	1
faced,	1
fair-haired,	1
with	1
narrow	1
light	1
eyes	1
and	1
with	1
calm	1
self-	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
bearing.	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
rider	1
lay,	1
yet	1
at	1
first	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
esaul	1
and	1
Denisov	1
one	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
wet	1
and	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
horse,	1
while	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
esaul	1
one	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
comfortable	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
ease	1
as	1
always	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
mounted	1
a	1
horse,	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
horse,	1
a	1
being	1
consequently	1
possessed	1
of	1
twofold	1
strength.	1
	1
A	1
little	1
ahead	1
of	1
them	1
walked	1
a	1
peasant	1
guide,	1
wet	1
to	1
the	1
skin	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
gray	1
peasant	1
coat	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
knitted	1
cap.	1
	1
A	1
little	1
behind,	1
on	1
a	1
poor,	1
small,	1
lean	1
Kirghiz	1
mount	1
with	1
an	1
enormous	1
tail	1
and	1
mane	1
and	1
a	1
bleeding	1
mouth,	1
rode	1
a	1
young	1
officer	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
French	1
overcoat.	1
	1
Beside	1
him	1
rode	1
an	1
hussar,	1
with	1
a	1
boy	1
in	1
a	1
tattered	1
French	1
uniform	1
and	1
blue	1
cap	1
behind	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
crupper	1
of	1
his	1
horse.	1
The	1
boy	1
held	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
with	1
cold,	1
red	1
hands,	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
gazed	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
surprise.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
French	1
drummer	1
boy	1
captured	1
that	1
morning.	1
	1
Behind	1
them	1
along	1
the	1
narrow,	1
sodden,	1
cutup	1
forest	1
road	1
came	1
hussars	1
in	1
threes	1
and	1
fours,	1
and	1
then	1
Cossacks:	1
some	1
in	1
felt	1
cloaks,	1
some	1
in	1
French	1
greatcoats,	1
and	1
some	1
with	1
horsecloths	1
over	1
their	1
heads.	1
The	1
horses,	1
being	1
drenched	1
by	1
the	1
rain,	1
all	1
looked	1
black	1
whether	1
chestnut	1
or	1
bay.	1
Their	1
necks,	1
with	1
their	1
wet,	1
close-clinging	1
manes,	1
looked	1
strangely	1
thin.	1
Steam	1
rose	1
from	1
them.	1
Clothes,	1
saddles,	1
reins,	1
were	1
all	1
wet,	1
slippery,	1
and	1
sodden,	1
like	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
the	1
fallen	1
leaves	1
that	1
strewed	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
men	1
sat	1
huddled	1
up	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
stir,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
warm	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
had	1
trickled	1
to	1
their	1
bodies	1
and	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
fresh	1
cold	1
water	1
that	1
was	1
leaking	1
in	1
under	1
their	1
seats,	1
their	1
knees,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
their	1
necks.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
outspread	1
line	1
of	1
Cossacks	1
two	1
wagons,	1
drawn	1
by	1
French	1
horses	1
and	1
by	1
saddled	1
Cossack	1
horses	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
hitched	1
on	1
in	1
front,	1
rumbled	1
over	1
the	1
tree	1
stumps	1
and	1
branches	1
and	1
splashed	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
ruts.	1
	1
Denisov's	1
horse	1
swerved	1
aside	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
track	1
and	1
bumped	1
his	1
rider's	1
knee	1
against	1
a	1
tree.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
devil!"	1
exclaimed	1
Denisov	1
angrily,	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
teeth	1
he	1
struck	1
his	1
horse	1
three	1
times	1
with	1
his	1
whip,	1
splashing	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
comrades	1
with	1
mud.	1
	1
Denisov	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sorts	1
both	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
rain	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
hunger	1
(none	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
eaten	1
anything	1
since	1
morning),	1
and	1
yet	1
more	1
because	1
he	1
still	1
had	1
no	1
news	1
from	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
sent	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
"tongue"	1
had	1
not	1
returned.	1
	1
"There'll	1
hardly	1
be	1
another	1
such	1
chance	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
a	1
transport	1
as	1
today.	1
It's	1
too	1
risky	1
to	1
attack	1
them	1
by	1
oneself,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
till	1
another	1
day	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
guerrilla	1
detachments	1
will	1
snatch	1
the	1
prey	1
from	1
under	1
our	1
noses,"	1
thought	1
Denisov,	1
continually	1
peering	1
forward,	1
hoping	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
messenger	1
from	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
On	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
path	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
far	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
Denisov	1
stopped.	1
	1
"There's	1
someone	1
coming,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
esaul	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
Denisov	1
indicated.	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
two,	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
presupposable	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
colonel	1
himself,"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul,	1
who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
using	1
words	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
	1
The	1
approaching	1
riders	1
having	1
descended	1
a	1
decline	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
visible,	1
but	1
they	1
reappeared	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later.	1
In	1
front,	1
at	1
a	1
weary	1
gallop	1
and	1
using	1
his	1
leather	1
whip,	1
rode	1
an	1
officer,	1
disheveled	1
and	1
drenched,	1
whose	1
trousers	1
had	1
worked	1
up	1
to	1
above	1
his	1
knees.	1
Behind	1
him,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
stirrups,	1
trotted	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
The	1
officer,	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
lad	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
rosy	1
face	1
and	1
keen	1
merry	1
eyes,	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
Denisov	1
and	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
sodden	1
envelope.	1
	1
"From	1
the	1
general,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer.	1
"Please	1
excuse	1
its	1
not	1
being	1
quite	1
dry."	1
	1
Denisov,	1
frowning,	1
took	1
the	1
envelope	1
and	1
opened	1
it.	1
	1
"There,	1
they	1
kept	1
telling	1
us:	1
'It's	1
dangerous,	1
it's	1
dangerous,'"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
addressing	1
the	1
esaul	1
while	1
Denisov	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
dispatch.	1
"But	1
Komarov	1
and	1
I"--he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
Cossack--"were	1
prepared.	1
We	1
have	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
two	1
pistols....	1
But	1
what's	1
this?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
noticing	1
the	1
French	1
drummer	1
boy.	1
"A	1
prisoner?	1
You've	1
already	1
been	1
in	1
action?	1
May	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
"Wostov!	1
Petya!"	1
exclaimed	1
Denisov,	1
having	1
run	1
through	1
the	1
dispatch.	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
say	1
who	1
you	1
were?"	1
and	1
turning	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
lad.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
was	1
Petya	1
Rostov.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
way	1
Petya	1
had	1
been	1
preparing	1
himself	1
to	1
behave	1
with	1
Denisov	1
as	1
befitted	1
a	1
grownup	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
officer--without	1
hinting	1
at	1
their	1
previous	1
acquaintance.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Denisov	1
smiled	1
at	1
him	1
Petya	1
brightened	1
up,	1
blushed	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
forgot	1
the	1
official	1
manner	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
rehearsing,	1
and	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
battle	1
near	1
Vyazma	1
and	1
how	1
a	1
certain	1
hussar	1
had	1
distinguished	1
himself	1
there.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
Denisov	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
again	1
assumed	1
its	1
anxious	1
expression.	1
	1
"Michael	1
Feoklitych,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
esaul,	1
"this	1
is	1
again	1
fwom	1
that	1
German,	1
you	1
know.	1
He"--he	1
indicated	1
Petya--"is	1
serving	1
under	1
him."	1
	1
And	1
Denisov	1
told	1
the	1
esaul	1
that	1
the	1
dispatch	1
just	1
delivered	1
was	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
German	1
general's	1
demand	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
join	1
forces	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
transport.	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
don't	1
take	1
it	1
tomowwow,	1
he'll	1
snatch	1
it	1
fwom	1
under	1
our	1
noses,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
While	1
Denisov	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
esaul,	1
Petya--abashed	1
by	1
Denisov's	1
cold	1
tone	1
and	1
supposing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
trousers--	1
furtively	1
tried	1
to	1
pull	1
them	1
down	1
under	1
his	1
greatcoat	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
notice	1
it,	1
while	1
maintaining	1
as	1
martial	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
"Will	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
orders,	1
your	1
honor?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov,	1
holding	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
salute	1
and	1
resuming	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
adjutant	1
and	1
general	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
himself,	1
"or	1
shall	1
I	1
remain	1
with	1
your	1
honor?"	1
	1
"Orders?"	1
Denisov	1
repeated	1
thoughtfully.	1
"But	1
can	1
you	1
stay	1
till	1
tomowwow?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
please...	1
May	1
I	1
stay	1
with	1
you?"	1
cried	1
Petya.	1
	1
"But,	1
just	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
genewal	1
tell	1
you?	1
To	1
weturn	1
at	1
once?"	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Petya	1
blushed.	1
	1
"He	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
instructions.	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
could?"	1
he	1
returned,	1
inquiringly.	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
wight,"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
And	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
men	1
he	1
directed	1
a	1
party	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
halting	1
place	1
arranged	1
near	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
the	1
Kirghiz	1
horse	1
(who	1
performed	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
an	1
adjutant)	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
that	1
evening.	1
Denisov	1
himself	1
intended	1
going	1
with	1
the	1
esaul	1
and	1
Petya	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
where	1
it	1
reached	1
out	1
to	1
Shamshevo,	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
bivouac	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
attack	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
"Well,	1
old	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
peasant	1
guide,	1
"lead	1
us	1
to	1
Shamshevo."	1
	1
Denisov,	1
Petya,	1
and	1
the	1
esaul,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
some	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
the	1
hussar	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
prisoner,	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
across	1
a	1
ravine	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
The	1
rain	1
had	1
stopped,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
mist	1
was	1
falling	1
and	1
drops	1
from	1
the	1
trees.	1
Denisov,	1
the	1
esaul,	1
and	1
Petya	1
rode	1
silently,	1
following	1
the	1
peasant	1
in	1
the	1
knitted	1
cap	1
who,	1
stepping	1
lightly	1
with	1
outturned	1
toes	1
and	1
moving	1
noiselessly	1
in	1
his	1
bast	1
shoes	1
over	1
the	1
roots	1
and	1
wet	1
leaves,	1
silently	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
He	1
ascended	1
an	1
incline,	1
stopped,	1
looked	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
advanced	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
screen	1
of	1
trees	1
was	1
less	1
dense.	1
On	1
reaching	1
a	1
large	1
oak	1
tree	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
shed	1
its	1
leaves,	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
beckoned	1
mysteriously	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Petya	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
From	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
peasant	1
was	1
standing	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
French.	1
Immediately	1
beyond	1
the	1
forest,	1
on	1
a	1
downward	1
slope,	1
lay	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
spring	1
rye.	1
To	1
the	1
right,	1
beyond	1
a	1
steep	1
ravine,	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
village	1
and	1
a	1
landowner's	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
roof.	1
In	1
the	1
village,	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
by	1
the	1
well,	1
by	1
the	1
pond,	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
rising	1
ground,	1
and	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
uphill	1
from	1
the	1
bridge	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
village,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
hundred	1
yards	1
away,	1
crowds	1
of	1
men	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
the	1
shimmering	1
mist.	1
Their	1
un-	1
Russian	1
shouting	1
at	1
their	1
horses	1
which	1
were	1
straining	1
uphill	1
with	1
the	1
carts,	1
and	1
their	1
calls	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
could	1
be	1
clearly	1
heard.	1
	1
"Bwing	1
the	1
prisoner	1
here,"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
A	1
Cossack	1
dismounted,	1
lifted	1
the	1
boy	1
down,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
Pointing	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
troops,	1
Denisov	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
these	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
them	1
were.	1
The	1
boy,	1
thrusting	1
his	1
cold	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
pockets	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows,	1
looked	1
at	1
Denisov	1
in	1
affright,	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
an	1
evident	1
desire	1
to	1
say	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
gave	1
confused	1
answers,	1
merely	1
assenting	1
to	1
everything	1
Denisov	1
asked	1
him.	1
Denisov	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
frowning	1
and	1
addressed	1
the	1
esaul,	1
conveying	1
his	1
own	1
conjectures	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Petya,	1
rapidly	1
turning	1
his	1
head,	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy,	1
now	1
at	1
Denisov,	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
esaul,	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
road,	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
anything	1
of	1
importance.	1
	1
"Whether	1
Dolokhov	1
comes	1
or	1
not,	1
we	1
must	1
seize	1
it,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
sparkle	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
suitable	1
spot,"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul.	1
	1
"We'll	1
send	1
the	1
infantwy	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
swamps,"	1
Denisov	1
continued.	1
"They'll	1
cweep	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
garden;	1
you'll	1
wide	1
up	1
fwom	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
Cossacks"--he	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
spot	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
beyond	1
the	1
village--"and	1
I	1
with	1
my	1
hussars	1
fwom	1
here.	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
signal	1
shot..."	1
	1
"The	1
hollow	1
is	1
impassable--there's	1
a	1
swamp	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul.	1
"The	1
horses	1
would	1
sink.	1
We	1
must	1
ride	1
round	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
left...."	1
	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
in	1
undertones	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
a	1
shot	1
sounded	1
from	1
the	1
low	1
ground	1
by	1
the	1
pond,	1
a	1
puff	1
of	1
white	1
smoke	1
appeared,	1
then	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hundreds	1
of	1
seemingly	1
merry	1
French	1
voices	1
shouting	1
together	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
slope.	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
Denisov	1
and	1
the	1
esaul	1
drew	1
back.	1
They	1
were	1
so	1
near	1
that	1
they	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
firing	1
and	1
shouting.	1
But	1
the	1
firing	1
and	1
shouting	1
did	1
not	1
relate	1
to	1
them.	1
Down	1
below,	1
a	1
man	1
wearing	1
something	1
red	1
was	1
running	1
through	1
the	1
marsh.	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
evidently	1
firing	1
and	1
shouting	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Why,	1
that's	1
our	1
Tikhon,"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul.	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
is!	1
It	1
is!"	1
	1
"The	1
wascal!"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"He'll	1
get	1
away!"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
called	1
Tikhon,	1
having	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
stream,	1
plunged	1
in	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
splashed	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and,	1
having	1
disappeared	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
scrambled	1
out	1
on	1
all	1
fours,	1
all	1
black	1
with	1
the	1
wet,	1
and	1
ran	1
on.	1
The	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
pursuing	1
him	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Smart,	1
that!"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
beast!"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
former	1
look	1
of	1
vexation.	1
"What	1
has	1
he	1
been	1
doing	1
all	1
this	1
time?"	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
he?"	1
asked	1
Petya.	1
	1
"He's	1
our	1
plastun.	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
'tongue.'"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
Petya,	1
nodding	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
Denisov	1
uttered	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
all,	1
though	1
he	1
really	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
anything	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
Shcherbaty	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
indispensable	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
band.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
peasant	1
from	1
Pokrovsk,	1
near	1
the	1
river	1
Gzhat.	1
When	1
Denisov	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Pokrovsk	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
operations	1
and	1
had	1
as	1
usual	1
summoned	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
about	1
the	1
French,	1
the	1
elder,	1
as	1
though	1
shielding	1
himself,	1
had	1
replied,	1
as	1
all	1
village	1
elders	1
did,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
neither	1
seen	1
nor	1
heard	1
anything	1
of	1
them.	1
But	1
when	1
Denisov	1
explained	1
that	1
his	1
purpose	1
was	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
no	1
French	1
had	1
strayed	1
that	1
way,	1
the	1
elder	1
replied	1
that	1
some	1
"more-orderers"	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
at	1
their	1
village,	1
but	1
that	1
Tikhon	1
Shcherbaty	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
dealt	1
with	1
such	1
matters.	1
Denisov	1
had	1
Tikhon	1
called	1
and,	1
having	1
praised	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
activity,	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
elder's	1
presence	1
about	1
loyalty	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
the	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
that	1
all	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
fatherland	1
should	1
cherish.	1
	1
"We	1
don't	1
do	1
the	1
French	1
any	1
harm,"	1
said	1
Tikhon,	1
evidently	1
frightened	1
by	1
Denisov's	1
words.	1
"We	1
only	1
fooled	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
lads	1
for	1
fun,	1
you	1
know!	1
We	1
killed	1
a	1
score	1
or	1
so	1
of	1
'more-orderers,'	1
but	1
we	1
did	1
no	1
harm	1
else..."	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
when	1
Denisov	1
had	1
left	1
Pokrovsk,	1
having	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
about	1
this	1
peasant,	1
it	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Tikhon	1
had	1
attached	1
himself	1
to	1
their	1
party	1
and	1
asked	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
it.	1
Denisov	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
Tikhon,	1
who	1
at	1
first	1
did	1
rough	1
work,	1
laying	1
campfires,	1
fetching	1
water,	1
flaying	1
dead	1
horses,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
soon	1
showed	1
a	1
great	1
liking	1
and	1
aptitude	1
for	1
partisan	1
warfare.	1
At	1
night	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
out	1
for	1
booty	1
and	1
always	1
brought	1
back	1
French	1
clothing	1
and	1
weapons,	1
and	1
when	1
told	1
to	1
would	1
bring	1
in	1
French	1
captives	1
also.	1
Denisov	1
then	1
relieved	1
him	1
from	1
drudgery	1
and	1
began	1
taking	1
him	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
expeditions	1
and	1
had	1
him	1
enrolled	1
among	1
the	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
riding,	1
and	1
always	1
went	1
on	1
foot,	1
never	1
lagging	1
behind	1
the	1
cavalry.	1
He	1
was	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
musketoon	1
(which	1
he	1
carried	1
rather	1
as	1
a	1
joke),	1
a	1
pike	1
and	1
an	1
ax,	1
which	1
latter	1
he	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
wolf	1
uses	1
its	1
teeth,	1
with	1
equal	1
ease	1
picking	1
fleas	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
fur	1
or	1
crunching	1
thick	1
bones.	1
Tikhon	1
with	1
equal	1
accuracy	1
would	1
split	1
logs	1
with	1
blows	1
at	1
arm's	1
length,	1
or	1
holding	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
ax	1
would	1
cut	1
thin	1
little	1
pegs	1
or	1
carve	1
spoons.	1
In	1
Denisov's	1
party	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
peculiar	1
and	1
exceptional	1
position.	1
When	1
anything	1
particularly	1
difficult	1
or	1
nasty	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done--	1
to	1
push	1
a	1
cart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mud	1
with	1
one's	1
shoulders,	1
pull	1
a	1
horse	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
swamp	1
by	1
its	1
tail,	1
skin	1
it,	1
slink	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
French,	1
or	1
walk	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
miles	1
in	1
a	1
day--everybody	1
pointed	1
laughingly	1
at	1
Tikhon.	1
	1
"It	1
won't	1
hurt	1
that	1
devil--he's	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
a	1
horse!"	1
they	1
said	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
Once	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
capture	1
fired	1
a	1
pistol	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
shot	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fleshy	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
back.	1
That	1
wound	1
(which	1
Tikhon	1
treated	1
only	1
with	1
internal	1
and	1
external	1
applications	1
of	1
vodka)	1
was	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
liveliest	1
jokes	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
detachment--jokes	1
in	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
readily	1
joined.	1
	1
"Hallo,	1
mate!	1
Never	1
again?	1
Gave	1
you	1
a	1
twist?"	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
would	1
banter	1
him.	1
And	1
Tikhon,	1
purposely	1
writhing	1
and	1
making	1
faces,	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
and	1
swore	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
the	1
funniest	1
curses.	1
The	1
only	1
effect	1
of	1
this	1
incident	1
on	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
that	1
after	1
being	1
wounded	1
he	1
seldom	1
brought	1
in	1
prisoners.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
bravest	1
and	1
most	1
useful	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
party.	1
No	1
one	1
found	1
more	1
opportunities	1
for	1
attacking,	1
no	1
one	1
captured	1
or	1
killed	1
more	1
Frenchmen,	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
the	1
buffoon	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
hussars	1
and	1
willingly	1
accepted	1
that	1
role.	1
Now	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
by	1
Denisov	1
overnight	1
to	1
Shamshevo	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
"tongue."	1
But	1
whether	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
content	1
to	1
take	1
only	1
one	1
Frenchman	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
slept	1
through	1
the	1
night,	1
he	1
had	1
crept	1
by	1
day	1
into	1
some	1
bushes	1
right	1
among	1
the	1
French	1
and,	1
as	1
Denisov	1
had	1
witnessed	1
from	1
above,	1
had	1
been	1
detected	1
by	1
them.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
After	1
talking	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
esaul	1
about	1
next	1
day's	1
attack,	1
which	1
now,	1
seeing	1
how	1
near	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
French,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
definitely	1
decided	1
on,	1
Denisov	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
back.	1
	1
"Now,	1
my	1
lad,	1
we'll	1
go	1
and	1
get	1
dwy,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Petya.	1
	1
As	1
they	1
approached	1
the	1
watchhouse	1
Denisov	1
stopped,	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
forest.	1
Among	1
the	1
trees	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
long	1
legs	1
and	1
long,	1
swinging	1
arms,	1
wearing	1
a	1
short	1
jacket,	1
bast	1
shoes,	1
and	1
a	1
Kazan	1
hat,	1
was	1
approaching	1
with	1
long,	1
light	1
steps.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
musketoon	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
an	1
ax	1
stuck	1
in	1
his	1
girdle.	1
When	1
he	1
espied	1
Denisov	1
he	1
hastily	1
threw	1
something	1
into	1
the	1
bushes,	1
removed	1
his	1
sodden	1
hat	1
by	1
its	1
floppy	1
brim,	1
and	1
approached	1
his	1
commander.	1
It	1
was	1
Tikhon.	1
His	1
wrinkled	1
and	1
pockmarked	1
face	1
and	1
narrow	1
little	1
eyes	1
beamed	1
with	1
self-satisfied	1
merriment.	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
high	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
Denisov	1
as	1
if	1
repressing	1
a	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Well,	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
disappear	1
to?"	1
inquired	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Where	1
did	1
I	1
disappear	1
to?	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
get	1
Frenchmen,"	1
answered	1
Tikhon	1
boldly	1
and	1
hurriedly,	1
in	1
a	1
husky	1
but	1
melodious	1
bass	1
voice.	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
push	1
yourself	1
in	1
there	1
by	1
daylight?	1
You	1
ass!	1
Well,	1
why	1
haven't	1
you	1
taken	1
one?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
took	1
one	1
all	1
right,"	1
said	1
Tikhon.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
I	1
took	1
him	1
first	1
thing	1
at	1
dawn,"	1
Tikhon	1
continued,	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
flat	1
feet	1
with	1
outturned	1
toes	1
in	1
their	1
bast	1
shoes.	1
"I	1
took	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
forest.	1
Then	1
I	1
see	1
he's	1
no	1
good	1
and	1
think	1
I'll	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
a	1
likelier	1
one."	1
	1
"You	1
see?...	1
What	1
a	1
wogue--it's	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
thought,"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
to	1
the	1
esaul.	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
bwing	1
that	1
one?"	1
	1
"What	1
was	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
bringing	1
him?"	1
Tikhon	1
interrupted	1
hastily	1
and	1
angrily--"that	1
one	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
you.	1
As	1
if	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
sort	1
you	1
want!"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
bwute	1
you	1
are!...	1
Well?"	1
	1
"I	1
went	1
for	1
another	1
one,"	1
Tikhon	1
continued,	1
"and	1
I	1
crept	1
like	1
this	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
lay	1
down."	1
(He	1
suddenly	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
stomach	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
movement	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it.)	1
"One	1
turned	1
up	1
and	1
I	1
grabbed	1
him,	1
like	1
this."	1
(He	1
jumped	1
up	1
quickly	1
and	1
lightly.)	1
"'Come	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
colonel,'	1
I	1
said.	1
He	1
starts	1
yelling,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
were	1
four	1
of	1
them.	1
They	1
rushed	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
little	1
swords.	1
So	1
I	1
went	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
my	1
ax,	1
this	1
way:	1
'What	1
are	1
you	1
up	1
to?'	1
says	1
I.	1
'Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you!'"	1
shouted	1
Tikhon,	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
scowl	1
and	1
throwing	1
out	1
his	1
chest.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
saw	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
how	1
you	1
took	1
to	1
your	1
heels	1
through	1
the	1
puddles!"	1
said	1
the	1
esaul,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
Petya	1
badly	1
wanted	1
to	1
laugh,	1
but	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
refrained	1
from	1
laughing.	1
He	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
rapidly	1
from	1
Tikhon's	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
esaul's	1
and	1
Denisov's,	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
all	1
meant.	1
	1
"Don't	1
play	1
the	1
fool!"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
coughing	1
angrily.	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
bwing	1
the	1
first	1
one?"	1
	1
Tikhon	1
scratched	1
his	1
back	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
then	1
suddenly	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
expanded	1
into	1
a	1
beaming,	1
foolish	1
grin,	1
disclosing	1
a	1
gap	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
tooth	1
(that	1
was	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
Shcherbaty--the	1
gap-toothed).	1
Denisov	1
smiled,	1
and	1
Petya	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
peal	1
of	1
merry	1
laughter	1
in	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
himself	1
joined.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
regular	1
good-for-nothing,"	1
said	1
Tikhon.	1
"The	1
clothes	1
on	1
him--poor	1
stuff!	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
bring	1
him?	1
And	1
so	1
rude,	1
your	1
honor!	1
Why,	1
he	1
says:	1
'I'm	1
a	1
general's	1
son	1
myself,	1
I	1
won't	1
go!'	1
he	1
says."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
bwute!"	1
said	1
Denisov.	1
"I	1
wanted	1
to	1
question..."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
questioned	1
him,"	1
said	1
Tikhon.	1
"He	1
said	1
he	1
didn't	1
know	1
much.	1
'There	1
are	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
us,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'but	1
all	1
poor	1
stuff--only	1
soldiers	1
in	1
name,'	1
he	1
says.	1
'Shout	1
loud	1
at	1
them,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'and	1
you'll	1
take	1
them	1
all,'"	1
Tikhon	1
concluded,	1
looking	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
resolutely	1
into	1
Denisov's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"I'll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
hundwed	1
sharp	1
lashes--that'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
fool!"	1
said	1
Denisov	1
severely.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
angry?"	1
remonstrated	1
Tikhon,	1
"just	1
as	1
if	1
I'd	1
never	1
seen	1
your	1
Frenchmen!	1
Only	1
wait	1
till	1
it	1
gets	1
dark	1
and	1
I'll	1
fetch	1
you	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
you	1
want--three	1
if	1
you	1
like."	1
	1
"Well,	1
let's	1
go,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
rode	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
watchhouse	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
frowning	1
angrily.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
followed	1
behind	1
and	1
Petya	1
heard	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
laughing	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
him,	1
about	1
some	1
pair	1
of	1
boots	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
bushes.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
him	1
at	1
Tikhon's	1
words	1
and	1
smile	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
Petya	1
realized	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
this	1
Tikhon	1
had	1
killed	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
felt	1
uneasy.	1
He	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
captive	1
drummer	1
boy	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
pang	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
But	1
this	1
uneasiness	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
moment.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
head	1
higher,	1
to	1
brace	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
esaul	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
importance	1
about	1
tomorrow's	1
undertaking,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
unworthy	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
inquire	1
met	1
Denisov	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
soon	1
coming	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
Denisov	1
at	1
once	1
cheered	1
up	1
and,	1
calling	1
Petya	1
to	1
him,	1
said:	1
"Well,	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
yourself."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Petya,	1
having	1
left	1
his	1
people	1
after	1
their	1
departure	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
joined	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
taken	1
as	1
orderly	1
by	1
a	1
general	1
commanding	1
a	1
large	1
guerrilla	1
detachment.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
received	1
his	1
commission,	1
and	1
especially	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
joined	1
the	1
active	1
army	1
and	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Vyazma,	1
Petya	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
constant	1
state	1
of	1
blissful	1
excitement	1
at	1
being	1
grown-up	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
perpetual	1
ecstatic	1
hurry	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
any	1
chance	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
really	1
heroic.	1
He	1
was	1
highly	1
delighted	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
experienced	1
in	1
the	1
army,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
it	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
really	1
heroic	1
exploits	1
were	1
being	1
performed	1
just	1
where	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
happen	1
to	1
be.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
get	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
not.	1
	1
When	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-first	1
of	1
October	1
his	1
general	1
expressed	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
send	1
somebody	1
to	1
Denisov's	1
detachment,	1
Petya	1
begged	1
so	1
piteously	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
that	1
the	1
general	1
could	1
not	1
refuse.	1
But	1
when	1
dispatching	1
him	1
he	1
recalled	1
Petya's	1
mad	1
action	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Vyazma,	1
where	1
instead	1
of	1
riding	1
by	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent,	1
he	1
had	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
advanced	1
line	1
under	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
had	1
there	1
twice	1
fired	1
his	1
pistol.	1
So	1
now	1
the	1
general	1
explicitly	1
forbade	1
his	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
any	1
action	1
whatever	1
of	1
Denisov's.	1
That	1
was	1
why	1
Petya	1
had	1
blushed	1
and	1
grown	1
confused	1
when	1
Denisov	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
stay.	1
Before	1
they	1
had	1
ridden	1
to	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
Petya	1
had	1
considered	1
he	1
must	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
instructions	1
strictly	1
and	1
return	1
at	1
once.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
saw	1
Tikhon	1
and	1
learned	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
an	1
attack	1
that	1
night,	1
he	1
decided,	1
with	1
the	1
rapidity	1
with	1
which	1
young	1
people	1
change	1
their	1
views,	1
that	1
the	1
general,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
greatly	1
respected	1
till	1
then,	1
was	1
a	1
rubbishy	1
German,	1
that	1
Denisov	1
was	1
a	1
hero,	1
the	1
esaul	1
a	1
hero,	1
and	1
Tikhon	1
a	1
hero	1
too,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
shameful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
difficulty.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
dusk	1
when	1
Denisov,	1
Petya,	1
and	1
the	1
esaul	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
watchhouse.	1
In	1
the	1
twilight	1
saddled	1
horses	1
could	1
be	1
seen,	1
and	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
hussars	1
who	1
had	1
rigged	1
up	1
rough	1
shelters	1
in	1
the	1
glade	1
and	1
were	1
kindling	1
glowing	1
fires	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
where	1
the	1
French	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
smoke.	1
In	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
watchhouse	1
a	1
Cossack	1
with	1
sleeves	1
rolled	1
up	1
was	1
chopping	1
some	1
mutton.	1
In	1
the	1
room	1
three	1
officers	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
band	1
were	1
converting	1
a	1
door	1
into	1
a	1
tabletop.	1
Petya	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
wet	1
clothes,	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
dried,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
helping	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
fix	1
up	1
the	1
dinner	1
table.	1
	1
In	1
ten	1
minutes	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
ready	1
and	1
a	1
napkin	1
spread	1
on	1
it.	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
were	1
vodka,	1
a	1
flask	1
of	1
rum,	1
white	1
bread,	1
roast	1
mutton,	1
and	1
salt.	1
	1
Sitting	1
at	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
tearing	1
the	1
fat	1
savory	1
mutton	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
down	1
which	1
the	1
grease	1
trickled,	1
Petya	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
ecstatic	1
childish	1
state	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
consequently	1
of	1
confidence	1
that	1
others	1
loved	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
	1
"So	1
then	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
"It's	1
all	1
right	1
my	1
staying	1
a	1
day	1
with	1
you?"	1
And	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
answered	1
his	1
own	1
question:	1
"You	1
see	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
find	1
out--well,	1
I	1
am	1
finding	1
out....	1
Only	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
very...	1
into	1
the	1
chief...	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
a	1
reward...	1
But	1
I	1
want..."	1
	1
Petya	1
clenched	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
looked	1
around,	1
throwing	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arms.	1
	1
"Into	1
the	1
vewy	1
chief..."	1
Denisov	1
repeated	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Only,	1
please	1
let	1
me	1
command	1
something,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
really	1
command..."	1
Petya	1
went	1
on.	1
"What	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
you?...	1
Oh,	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
knife?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
cut	1
himself	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
mutton.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
handed	1
him	1
his	1
clasp	1
knife.	1
The	1
officer	1
admired	1
it.	1
	1
"Please	1
keep	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
several	1
like	1
it,"	1
said	1
Petya,	1
blushing.	1
"Heavens!	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
forgetting!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
cried.	1
"I	1
have	1
some	1
raisins,	1
fine	1
ones;	1
you	1
know,	1
seedless	1
ones.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
new	1
sutler	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
such	1
capital	1
things.	1
I	1
bought	1
ten	1
pounds.	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
something	1
sweet.	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
some?..."	1
and	1
Petya	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
to	1
his	1
Cossack	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
some	1
bags	1
which	1
contained	1
about	1
five	1
pounds	1
of	1
raisins.	1
"Have	1
some,	1
gentlemen,	1
have	1
some!"	1
	1
"You	1
want	1
a	1
coffeepot,	1
don't	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
esaul.	1
"I	1
bought	1
a	1
capital	1
one	1
from	1
our	1
sutler!	1
He	1
has	1
splendid	1
things.	1
And	1
he's	1
very	1
honest,	1
that's	1
the	1
chief	1
thing.	1
I'll	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
send	1
it	1
to	1
you.	1
Or	1
perhaps	1
your	1
flints	1
are	1
giving	1
out,	1
or	1
are	1
worn	1
out--that	1
happens	1
sometimes,	1
you	1
know.	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
some	1
with	1
me,	1
here	1
they	1
are"--and	1
he	1
showed	1
a	1
bag--"a	1
hundred	1
flints.	1
I	1
bought	1
them	1
very	1
cheap.	1
Please	1
take	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
you	1
want,	1
or	1
all	1
if	1
you	1
like...."	1
	1
Then	1
suddenly,	1
dismayed	1
lest	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
too	1
much,	1
Petya	1
stopped	1
and	1
blushed.	1
	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
remember	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
anything	1
else	1
that	1
was	1
foolish.	1
And	1
running	1
over	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
French	1
drummer	1
boy.	1
"It's	1
capital	1
for	1
us	1
here,	1
but	1
what	1
of	1
him?	1
Where	1
have	1
they	1
put	1
him?	1
Have	1
they	1
fed	1
him?	1
Haven't	1
they	1
hurt	1
his	1
feelings?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
But	1
having	1
caught	1
himself	1
saying	1
too	1
much	1
about	1
the	1
flints,	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
out.	1
	1
"I	1
might	1
ask,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"but	1
they'll	1
say:	1
'He's	1
a	1
boy	1
himself	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
pities	1
the	1
boy.'	1
I'll	1
show	1
them	1
tomorrow	1
whether	1
I'm	1
a	1
boy.	1
Will	1
it	1
seem	1
odd	1
if	1
I	1
ask?"	1
Petya	1
thought.	1
"Well,	1
never	1
mind!"	1
and	1
immediately,	1
blushing	1
and	1
looking	1
anxiously	1
at	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
they	1
appeared	1
ironical,	1
he	1
said:	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
call	1
in	1
that	1
boy	1
who	1
was	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat?...	1
Perhaps..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he's	1
a	1
poor	1
little	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
evidently	1
saw	1
nothing	1
shameful	1
in	1
this	1
reminder.	1
"Call	1
him	1
in.	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
Vincent	1
Bosse.	1
Have	1
him	1
fetched."	1
	1
"I'll	1
call	1
him,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
call	1
him.	1
A	1
poor	1
little	1
fellow,"	1
Denisov	1
repeated.	1
	1
Petya	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
when	1
Denisov	1
said	1
this.	1
He	1
slipped	1
in	1
between	1
the	1
officers,	1
came	1
close	1
to	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
kiss	1
you,	1
dear	1
old	1
fellow!	1
Oh,	1
how	1
fine,	1
how	1
splendid!"	1
	1
And	1
having	1
kissed	1
Denisov	1
he	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hut.	1
	1
"Bosse!	1
Vincent!"	1
Petya	1
cried,	1
stopping	1
outside	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Who	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
sir?"	1
asked	1
a	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
Petya	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
the	1
French	1
lad	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Vesenny?"	1
said	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
	1
Vincent,	1
the	1
boy's	1
name,	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
changed	1
by	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
into	1
Vesenny	1
(vernal)	1
and	1
into	1
Vesenya	1
by	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
soldiers.	1
In	1
both	1
these	1
adaptations	1
the	1
reference	1
to	1
spring	1
(vesna)	1
matched	1
the	1
impression	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
lad.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
warming	1
himself	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
bonfire.	1
Ho,	1
Vesenya!	1
Vesenya!--	1
Vesenny!"	1
laughing	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
calling	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
smart	1
lad,"	1
said	1
an	1
hussar	1
standing	1
near	1
Petya.	1
"We	1
gave	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
a	1
while	1
ago.	1
He	1
was	1
awfully	1
hungry!"	1
	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
bare	1
feet	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
c'est	1
vous!"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
"Voulez-vous	1
manger?	1
N'ayez	1
pas	1
peur,	1
on	1
ne	1
vous	1
fera	1
pas	1
de	1
mal,"	1
*	1
he	1
added	1
shyly	1
and	1
affectionately,	1
touching	1
the	1
boy's	1
hand.	1
"Entrez,	1
entrez."	1
*(2)	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Ah,	1
it's	1
you!	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
something	1
to	1
eat?	1
Don't	1
be	1
afraid,	1
they	1
won't	1
hurt	1
you."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"Come	1
in,	1
come	1
in."	1
	1
"Merci,	1
monsieur,"	1
*	1
said	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
almost	1
childish	1
voice,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
scraping	1
his	1
dirty	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
threshold.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
sir."	1
	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
things	1
Petya	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to.	1
He	1
stood	1
irresolutely	1
beside	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
Then	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
boy's	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
it.	1
	1
"Come	1
in,	1
come	1
in!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
in	1
a	1
gentle	1
whisper.	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
him?"	1
he	1
thought,	1
and	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
boy	1
pass	1
in	1
first.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
boy	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
hut,	1
Petya	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
him,	1
considering	1
it	1
beneath	1
his	1
dignity	1
to	1
pay	1
attention	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
he	1
fingered	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
wondered	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
to	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
arrival	1
of	1
Dolokhov	1
diverted	1
Petya's	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
drummer	1
boy,	1
to	1
whom	1
Denisov	1
had	1
had	1
some	1
mutton	1
and	1
vodka	1
given,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
Russian	1
coat	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
kept	1
with	1
their	1
band	1
and	1
not	1
sent	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
prisoners.	1
Petya	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
many	1
stories	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
extraordinary	1
bravery	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
cruelty	1
to	1
the	1
French,	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
hut	1
Petya	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
him,	1
but	1
braced	1
himself	1
up	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
held	1
his	1
head	1
high,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
unworthy	1
even	1
of	1
such	1
company.	1
	1
Dolokhov's	1
appearance	1
amazed	1
Petya	1
by	1
its	1
simplicity.	1
	1
Denisov	1
wore	1
a	1
Cossack	1
coat,	1
had	1
a	1
beard,	1
had	1
an	1
icon	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
Wonder-Worker	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
speaking	1
and	1
everything	1
he	1
did	1
indicated	1
his	1
unusual	1
position.	1
But	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
in	1
Moscow	1
had	1
worn	1
a	1
Persian	1
costume,	1
had	1
now	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
correct	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards.	1
He	1
was	1
clean-shaven	1
and	1
wore	1
a	1
Guardsman's	1
padded	1
coat	1
with	1
an	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
at	1
his	1
buttonhole	1
and	1
a	1
plain	1
forage	1
cap	1
set	1
straight	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
wet	1
felt	1
cloak	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
without	1
greeting	1
anyone	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Denisov	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
hand.	1
Denisov	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
designs	1
the	1
large	1
detachments	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
transport,	1
of	1
the	1
message	1
Petya	1
had	1
brought,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
replies	1
to	1
both	1
generals.	1
Then	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
detachment.	1
	1
"That's	1
so.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
know	1
what	1
troops	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
their	1
numbers,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
"It	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
there.	1
We	1
can't	1
start	1
the	1
affair	1
without	1
knowing	1
for	1
certain	1
how	1
many	1
there	1
are.	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
work	1
accurately.	1
Here	1
now--wouldn't	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
like	1
to	1
ride	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
camp	1
with	1
me?	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
a	1
spare	1
uniform."	1
	1
"I,	1
I...	1
I'll	1
go	1
with	1
you!"	1
cried	1
Petya.	1
	1
"There's	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
addressing	1
Dolokhov,	1
"and	1
as	1
for	1
him,	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
on	1
any	1
account."	1
	1
"I	1
like	1
that!"	1
exclaimed	1
Petya.	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
I	1
go?"	1
	1
"Because	1
it's	1
useless."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me,	1
because...	1
because...	1
I	1
shall	1
go,	1
and	1
that's	1
all.	1
You'll	1
take	1
me,	1
won't	1
you?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
Dolokhov	1
answered	1
absently,	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
drummer	1
boy.	1
"Have	1
you	1
had	1
that	1
youngster	1
with	1
you	1
long?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
taken	1
today	1
but	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing.	1
I'm	1
keeping	1
him	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
put	1
the	1
others?"	1
inquired	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Where?	1
I	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
weceipt	1
for	1
them,"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
suddenly	1
flushing.	1
"And	1
I	1
say	1
boldly	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
man's	1
life	1
on	1
my	1
conscience.	1
Would	1
it	1
be	1
difficult	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
send	1
thirty	1
or	1
thwee	1
hundwed	1
men	1
to	1
town	1
under	1
escort,	1
instead	1
of	1
staining--I	1
speak	1
bluntly--	1
staining	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
a	1
soldier?"	1
	1
"That	1
kind	1
of	1
amiable	1
talk	1
would	1
be	1
suitable	1
from	1
this	1
young	1
count	1
of	1
sixteen,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
cold	1
irony,	1
"but	1
it's	1
time	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
drop	1
it."	1
	1
"Why,	1
I've	1
not	1
said	1
anything!	1
I	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
I'll	1
certainly	1
go	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
Petya	1
shyly.	1
	1
"But	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
old	1
fellow,	1
it's	1
time	1
to	1
drop	1
these	1
amenities,"	1
continued	1
Dolokhov,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
particular	1
pleasure	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
this	1
subject	1
which	1
irritated	1
Denisov.	1
"Now,	1
why	1
have	1
you	1
kept	1
this	1
lad?"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
swaying	1
his	1
head.	1
"Because	1
you	1
are	1
sorry	1
for	1
him!	1
Don't	1
we	1
know	1
those	1
'receipts'	1
of	1
yours?	1
You	1
send	1
a	1
hundred	1
men	1
away,	1
and	1
thirty	1
get	1
there.	1
The	1
rest	1
either	1
starve	1
or	1
get	1
killed.	1
So	1
isn't	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
them?"	1
	1
The	1
esaul,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
light-colored	1
eyes,	1
nodded	1
approvingly.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
I'm	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
conscience.	1
You	1
say	1
they'll	1
die.	1
All	1
wight.	1
Only	1
not	1
by	1
my	1
fault!"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
began	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Who	1
has	1
told	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
capture	1
me	1
these	1
twenty	1
times	1
over?	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
catch	1
me	1
they'd	1
string	1
me	1
up	1
to	1
an	1
aspen	1
tree,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
chivalry	1
just	1
the	1
same."	1
He	1
paused.	1
"However,	1
we	1
must	1
get	1
to	1
work.	1
Tell	1
the	1
Cossack	1
to	1
fetch	1
my	1
kit.	1
I	1
have	1
two	1
French	1
uniforms	1
in	1
it.	1
Well,	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
with	1
me?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Petya.	1
	1
"I?	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
certainly!"	1
cried	1
Petya,	1
blushing	1
almost	1
to	1
tears	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
Denisov.	1
	1
While	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
been	1
disputing	1
with	1
Denisov	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
prisoners,	1
Petya	1
had	1
once	1
more	1
felt	1
awkward	1
and	1
restless;	1
but	1
again	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
grasp	1
fully	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about.	1
"If	1
grown-up,	1
distinguished	1
men	1
think	1
so,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
necessary	1
and	1
right,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"But	1
above	1
all	1
Denisov	1
must	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
I'll	1
obey	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
order	1
me	1
about.	1
I	1
will	1
certainly	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
camp	1
with	1
Dolokhov.	1
If	1
he	1
can,	1
so	1
can	1
I!"	1
	1
And	1
to	1
all	1
Denisov's	1
persuasions,	1
Petya	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
accurately	1
and	1
not	1
just	1
anyhow,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
considered	1
personal	1
danger.	1
	1
"For	1
you'll	1
admit	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
don't	1
know	1
for	1
sure	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
there	1
are...	1
hundreds	1
of	1
lives	1
may	1
depend	1
on	1
it,	1
while	1
there	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
of	1
us.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
very	1
much	1
and	1
certainly	1
will	1
go,	1
so	1
don't	1
hinder	1
me,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
will	1
only	1
make	1
things	1
worse..."	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Having	1
put	1
on	1
French	1
greatcoats	1
and	1
shakos,	1
Petya	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
clearing	1
from	1
which	1
Denisov	1
had	1
reconnoitered	1
the	1
French	1
camp,	1
and	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
forest	1
in	1
pitch	1
darkness	1
they	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
hollow.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
bottom,	1
Dolokhov	1
told	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
accompanying	1
him	1
to	1
await	1
him	1
there	1
and	1
rode	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
quick	1
trot	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Petya,	1
his	1
heart	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
excitement,	1
rode	1
by	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
"If	1
we're	1
caught,	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
taken	1
alive!	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
pistol,"	1
whispered	1
he.	1
	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
Russian,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
a	1
hurried	1
whisper,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
they	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
the	1
challenge:	1
"Qui	1
vive?"	1
*	1
and	1
the	1
click	1
of	1
a	1
musket.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Who	1
goes	1
there?"	1
	1
The	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
Petya's	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
grasped	1
his	1
pistol.	1
	1
"Lanciers	1
du	1
6-me,"	1
*	1
replied	1
Dolokhov,	1
neither	1
hastening	1
nor	1
slackening	1
his	1
horse's	1
pace.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Lancers	1
of	1
the	1
6th	1
Regiment."	1
	1
The	1
black	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
sentinel	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
"Mot	1
d'ordre."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Password."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
advanced	1
at	1
a	1
walk.	1
	1
"Dites	1
donc,	1
le	1
colonel	1
Gerard	1
est	1
ici?"	1
*	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
is	1
Colonel	1
Gerard	1
here?"	1
	1
"Mot	1
d'ordre,"	1
repeated	1
the	1
sentinel,	1
barring	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
not	1
replying.	1
	1
"Quand	1
un	1
officier	1
fait	1
sa	1
ronde,	1
les	1
sentinelles	1
ne	1
demandent	1
pas	1
le	1
mot	1
d'ordre..."	1
cried	1
Dolokhov	1
suddenly	1
flaring	1
up	1
and	1
riding	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
sentinel.	1
"Je	1
vous	1
demande	1
si	1
le	1
colonel	1
est	1
ici."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"When	1
an	1
officer	1
is	1
making	1
his	1
round,	1
sentinels	1
don't	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
password....	1
I	1
am	1
asking	1
you	1
if	1
the	1
colonel	1
is	1
here."	1
	1
And	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
the	1
sentinel,	1
who	1
had	1
stepped	1
aside,	1
Dolokhov	1
rode	1
up	1
the	1
incline	1
at	1
a	1
walk.	1
	1
Noticing	1
the	1
black	1
outline	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
crossing	1
the	1
road,	1
Dolokhov	1
stopped	1
him	1
and	1
inquired	1
where	1
the	1
commander	1
and	1
officers	1
were.	1
The	1
man,	1
a	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
sack	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
stopped,	1
came	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
Dolokhov's	1
horse,	1
touched	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
explained	1
simply	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
were	1
higher	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
farm,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
landowner's	1
house.	1
	1
Having	1
ridden	1
up	1
the	1
road,	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
which	1
French	1
talk	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
around	1
the	1
campfires,	1
Dolokhov	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
landowner's	1
house.	1
Having	1
ridden	1
in,	1
he	1
dismounted	1
and	1
approached	1
a	1
big	1
blazing	1
campfire,	1
around	1
which	1
sat	1
several	1
men	1
talking	1
noisily.	1
Something	1
was	1
boiling	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
cauldron	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
a	1
peaked	1
cap	1
and	1
blue	1
overcoat,	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
was	1
kneeling	1
beside	1
it	1
stirring	1
its	1
contents	1
with	1
a	1
ramrod.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he's	1
a	1
hard	1
nut	1
to	1
crack,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"He'll	1
make	1
them	1
get	1
a	1
move	1
on,	1
those	1
fellows!"	1
said	1
another,	1
laughing.	1
	1
Both	1
fell	1
silent,	1
peering	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
and	1
Petya's	1
steps	1
as	1
they	1
advanced	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
leading	1
their	1
horses.	1
	1
"Bonjour,	1
messieurs!"	1
*	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
loudly	1
and	1
clearly.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Good	1
day,	1
gentlemen."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
among	1
the	1
officers	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
beyond	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
one	1
tall,	1
long-necked	1
officer,	1
walking	1
round	1
the	1
fire,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
you,	1
Clement?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Where	1
the	1
devil...?"	1
But,	1
noticing	1
his	1
mistake,	1
he	1
broke	1
off	1
short	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
frown,	1
greeted	1
Dolokhov	1
as	1
a	1
stranger,	1
asking	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
overtake	1
their	1
regiment,	1
and	1
addressing	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
general	1
asked	1
whether	1
they	1
knew	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
6th	1
Regiment.	1
None	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
anything,	1
and	1
Petya	1
thought	1
the	1
officers	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
hostility	1
and	1
suspicion.	1
For	1
some	1
seconds	1
all	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
were	1
counting	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
soup,	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
too	1
late,"	1
said	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
a	1
repressed	1
laugh.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
replied	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
hungry	1
and	1
must	1
push	1
on	1
farther	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
He	1
handed	1
the	1
horses	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
stirring	1
the	1
pot	1
and	1
squatted	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
heels	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
beside	1
the	1
officer	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
neck.	1
That	1
officer	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
again	1
asked	1
to	1
what	1
regiment	1
he	1
belonged.	1
Dolokhov,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
question,	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
but	1
lighting	1
a	1
short	1
French	1
pipe	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
began	1
asking	1
the	1
officer	1
in	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
road	1
before	1
them	1
was	1
safe	1
from	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
"Those	1
brigands	1
are	1
everywhere,"	1
replied	1
an	1
officer	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
remarked	1
that	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
a	1
danger	1
only	1
to	1
stragglers	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
companion	1
and	1
himself,	1
"but	1
probably	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
attack	1
large	1
detachments?"	1
he	1
added	1
inquiringly.	1
No	1
one	1
replied.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
he'll	1
come	1
away,"	1
Petya	1
thought	1
every	1
moment	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
campfire	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
talk.	1
	1
But	1
Dolokhov	1
restarted	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
had	1
dropped	1
and	1
began	1
putting	1
direct	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
many	1
men	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
battalion,	1
how	1
many	1
battalions,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
prisoners.	1
Asking	1
about	1
the	1
Russian	1
prisoners	1
with	1
that	1
detachment,	1
Dolokhov	1
said:	1
	1
"A	1
horrid	1
business	1
dragging	1
these	1
corpses	1
about	1
with	1
one!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
shoot	1
such	1
rabble,"	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
loud	1
laughter,	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
Petya	1
thought	1
the	1
French	1
would	1
immediately	1
detect	1
their	1
disguise,	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
campfire.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
replied	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Dolokhov's	1
laughter,	1
and	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
whom	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
(he	1
lay	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat)	1
rose	1
and	1
whispered	1
something	1
to	1
a	1
companion.	1
Dolokhov	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
their	1
horses.	1
	1
"Will	1
they	1
bring	1
our	1
horses	1
or	1
not?"	1
thought	1
Petya,	1
instinctively	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
brought.	1
	1
"Good	1
evening,	1
gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
Petya	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
"Good	1
night"	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word.	1
The	1
officers	1
were	1
whispering	1
together.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
mounting	1
his	1
horse	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
stand	1
still,	1
then	1
he	1
rode	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
at	1
a	1
footpace.	1
Petya	1
rode	1
beside	1
him,	1
longing	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
running	1
after	1
them,	1
but	1
not	1
daring	1
to.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
road	1
Dolokhov	1
did	1
not	1
ride	1
back	1
across	1
the	1
open	1
country,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
village.	1
At	1
one	1
spot	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
listened.	1
"Do	1
you	1
hear?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
Petya	1
recognized	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Russian	1
voices	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
dark	1
figures	1
of	1
Russian	1
prisoners	1
round	1
their	1
campfires.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
descended	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
Petya	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
rode	1
past	1
the	1
sentinel,	1
who	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
paced	1
morosely	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
it,	1
then	1
they	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
hollow	1
where	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
awaited	1
them.	1
	1
"Well	1
now,	1
good-by.	1
Tell	1
Denisov,	1
'at	1
the	1
first	1
shot	1
at	1
daybreak,'"	1
said	1
Dolokhov	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ride	1
away,	1
but	1
Petya	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Really!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"you	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
hero!	1
Oh,	1
how	1
fine,	1
how	1
splendid!	1
How	1
I	1
love	1
you!"	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
But	1
Petya	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
saw	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
that	1
Petya	1
was	1
bending	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
kiss	1
him.	1
Dolokhov	1
kissed	1
him,	1
laughed,	1
turned	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Having	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut,	1
Petya	1
found	1
Denisov	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
He	1
was	1
awaiting	1
Petya's	1
return	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
agitation,	1
anxiety,	1
and	1
self-reproach	1
for	1
having	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
"Yes,	1
thank	1
God!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
listening	1
to	1
Petya's	1
rapturous	1
account.	1
"But,	1
devil	1
take	1
you,	1
I	1
haven't	1
slept	1
because	1
of	1
you!	1
Well,	1
thank	1
God.	1
Now	1
lie	1
down.	1
We	1
can	1
still	1
get	1
a	1
nap	1
before	1
morning."	1
	1
"But...	1
no,"	1
said	1
Petya,	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
sleep	1
yet.	1
Besides	1
I	1
know	1
myself,	1
if	1
I	1
fall	1
asleep	1
it's	1
finished.	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
not	1
sleeping	1
before	1
a	1
battle."	1
	1
He	1
sat	1
awhile	1
in	1
the	1
hut	1
joyfully	1
recalling	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
expedition	1
and	1
vividly	1
picturing	1
to	1
himself	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
Then,	1
noticing	1
that	1
Denisov	1
was	1
asleep,	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
doors.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
dark	1
outside.	1
The	1
rain	1
was	1
over,	1
but	1
drops	1
were	1
still	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1
trees.	1
Near	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
the	1
black	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
Cossacks'	1
shanties	1
and	1
of	1
horses	1
tethered	1
together	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
Behind	1
the	1
hut	1
the	1
dark	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
wagons	1
with	1
their	1
horses	1
beside	1
them	1
were	1
discernible,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
the	1
dying	1
campfire	1
gleamed	1
red.	1
Not	1
all	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
hussars	1
were	1
asleep;	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
amid	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
falling	1
drops	1
and	1
the	1
munching	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
near	1
by,	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
low	1
voices	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
whispering.	1
	1
Petya	1
came	1
out,	1
peered	1
into	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
wagons.	1
Someone	1
was	1
snoring	1
under	1
them,	1
and	1
around	1
them	1
stood	1
saddled	1
horses	1
munching	1
their	1
oats.	1
In	1
the	1
dark	1
Petya	1
recognized	1
his	1
own	1
horse,	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
"Karabakh"	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
Ukranian	1
breed,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Karabakh!	1
We'll	1
do	1
some	1
service	1
tomorrow,"	1
said	1
he,	1
sniffing	1
its	1
nostrils	1
and	1
kissing	1
it.	1
	1
"Why	1
aren't	1
you	1
asleep,	1
sir?"	1
said	1
a	1
Cossack	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
under	1
a	1
wagon.	1
	1
"No,	1
ah...	1
Likhachev--isn't	1
that	1
your	1
name?	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
back!	1
We've	1
been	1
into	1
the	1
French	1
camp."	1
	1
And	1
Petya	1
gave	1
the	1
Cossack	1
a	1
detailed	1
account	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
ride	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
his	1
object,	1
and	1
why	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
better	1
to	1
risk	1
his	1
life	1
than	1
to	1
act	1
"just	1
anyhow."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
should	1
get	1
some	1
sleep	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
this,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
"I	1
say,	1
aren't	1
the	1
flints	1
in	1
your	1
pistols	1
worn	1
out?	1
I	1
brought	1
some	1
with	1
me.	1
Don't	1
you	1
want	1
any?	1
You	1
can	1
have	1
some."	1
	1
The	1
Cossack	1
bent	1
forward	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
wagon	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
closer	1
look	1
at	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Because	1
I	1
am	1
accustomed	1
to	1
doing	1
everything	1
accurately,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
"Some	1
fellows	1
do	1
things	1
just	1
anyhow,	1
without	1
preparation,	1
and	1
then	1
they're	1
sorry	1
for	1
it	1
afterwards.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
"Just	1
so,"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
another	1
thing!	1
Please,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
will	1
you	1
sharpen	1
my	1
saber	1
for	1
me?	1
It's	1
got	1
bl..."	1
(Petya	1
feared	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
the	1
saber	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
sharpened.)	1
"Can	1
you	1
do	1
it?"	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
I	1
can."	1
	1
Likhachev	1
got	1
up,	1
rummaged	1
in	1
his	1
pack,	1
and	1
soon	1
Petya	1
heard	1
the	1
warlike	1
sound	1
of	1
steel	1
on	1
whetstone.	1
He	1
climbed	1
onto	1
the	1
wagon	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
its	1
edge.	1
The	1
Cossack	1
was	1
sharpening	1
the	1
saber	1
under	1
the	1
wagon.	1
	1
"I	1
say!	1
Are	1
the	1
lads	1
asleep?"	1
asked	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Some	1
are,	1
and	1
some	1
aren't--like	1
us."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
that	1
boy?"	1
	1
"Vesenny?	1
Oh,	1
he's	1
thrown	1
himself	1
down	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
Fast	1
asleep	1
after	1
his	1
fright.	1
He	1
was	1
that	1
glad!"	1
	1
After	1
that	1
Petya	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sounds.	1
He	1
heard	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
figure	1
appeared.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
sharpening?"	1
asked	1
a	1
man	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
wagon.	1
	1
"Why,	1
this	1
gentleman's	1
saber."	1
	1
"That's	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
whom	1
Petya	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar.	1
"Was	1
the	1
cup	1
left	1
here?"	1
	1
"There,	1
by	1
the	1
wheel!"	1
	1
The	1
hussar	1
took	1
the	1
cup.	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
daylight	1
soon,"	1
said	1
he,	1
yawning,	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
	1
Petya	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
forest	1
with	1
Denisov's	1
guerrilla	1
band,	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
wagon	1
captured	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
beside	1
which	1
horses	1
were	1
tethered,	1
that	1
under	1
it	1
Likhachev	1
was	1
sitting	1
sharpening	1
a	1
saber	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
big	1
dark	1
blotch	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
was	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut,	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
blotch	1
below	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
was	1
the	1
dying	1
embers	1
of	1
a	1
campfire,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
cup	1
was	1
an	1
hussar	1
who	1
wanted	1
a	1
drink;	1
but	1
he	1
neither	1
knew	1
nor	1
waited	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
all	1
this.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
fairy	1
kingdom	1
where	1
nothing	1
resembled	1
reality.	1
The	1
big	1
dark	1
blotch	1
might	1
really	1
be	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
or	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
cavern	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
red	1
spot	1
was	1
a	1
fire,	1
or	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
an	1
enormous	1
monster.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
wagon,	1
but	1
it	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
wagon	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
terribly	1
high	1
tower	1
from	1
which,	1
if	1
he	1
fell,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
fall	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
or	1
a	1
whole	1
month,	1
or	1
go	1
on	1
falling	1
and	1
never	1
reach	1
the	1
bottom.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
Cossack,	1
Likhachev,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
under	1
the	1
wagon,	1
but	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
kindest,	1
bravest,	1
most	1
wonderful,	1
most	1
splendid	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
whom	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
of.	1
It	1
might	1
really	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
the	1
hussar	1
came	1
for	1
water	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
hollow,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
simply	1
vanished--disappeared	1
altogether	1
and	1
dissolved	1
into	1
nothingness.	1
	1
Nothing	1
Petya	1
could	1
have	1
seen	1
now	1
would	1
have	1
surprised	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
fairy	1
kingdom	1
where	1
everything	1
was	1
possible.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky.	1
And	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
a	1
fairy	1
realm	1
like	1
the	1
earth.	1
It	1
was	1
clearing,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
clouds	1
were	1
swiftly	1
sailing	1
as	1
if	1
unveiling	1
the	1
stars.	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
clouds	1
were	1
passing,	1
and	1
a	1
clear	1
black	1
sky	1
appeared.	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
black	1
spaces	1
were	1
clouds.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
sky	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
rising	1
high,	1
high	1
overhead,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
sink	1
so	1
low	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
touch	1
it	1
with	1
one's	1
hand.	1
	1
Petya's	1
eyes	1
began	1
to	1
close	1
and	1
he	1
swayed	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
The	1
trees	1
were	1
dripping.	1
Quiet	1
talking	1
was	1
heard.	1
The	1
horses	1
neighed	1
and	1
jostled	1
one	1
another.	1
Someone	1
snored.	1
	1
"Ozheg-zheg,	1
Ozheg-zheg..."	1
hissed	1
the	1
saber	1
against	1
the	1
whetstone,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
Petya	1
heard	1
an	1
harmonious	1
orchestra	1
playing	1
some	1
unknown,	1
sweetly	1
solemn	1
hymn.	1
Petya	1
was	1
as	1
musical	1
as	1
Natasha	1
and	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
Nicholas,	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
learned	1
music	1
or	1
thought	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
melody	1
that	1
unexpectedly	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
particularly	1
fresh	1
and	1
attractive.	1
The	1
music	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
audible.	1
The	1
melody	1
grew	1
and	1
passed	1
from	1
one	1
instrument	1
to	1
another.	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
played	1
was	1
a	1
fugue--though	1
Petya	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
conception	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
fugue	1
is.	1
Each	1
instrument--now	1
resembling	1
a	1
violin	1
and	1
now	1
a	1
horn,	1
but	1
better	1
and	1
clearer	1
than	1
violin	1
or	1
horn--played	1
its	1
own	1
part,	1
and	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
melody	1
merged	1
with	1
another	1
instrument	1
that	1
began	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
air,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
third	1
and	1
a	1
fourth;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
blended	1
into	1
one	1
and	1
again	1
became	1
separate	1
and	1
again	1
blended,	1
now	1
into	1
solemn	1
church	1
music,	1
now	1
into	1
something	1
dazzlingly	1
brilliant	1
and	1
triumphant.	1
	1
"Oh--why,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
dream!"	1
Petya	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
he	1
lurched	1
forward.	1
"It's	1
in	1
my	1
ears.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
it's	1
music	1
of	1
my	1
own.	1
Well,	1
go	1
on,	1
my	1
music!	1
Now!..."	1
	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and,	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
distance,	1
sounds	1
fluttered,	1
grew	1
into	1
harmonies,	1
separated,	1
blended,	1
and	1
again	1
all	1
mingled	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
sweet	1
and	1
solemn	1
hymn.	1
"Oh,	1
this	1
is	1
delightful!	1
As	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
like	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
like!"	1
said	1
Petya	1
to	1
himself.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
conduct	1
that	1
enormous	1
orchestra.	1
	1
"Now	1
softly,	1
softly	1
die	1
away!"	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
obeyed	1
him.	1
"Now	1
fuller,	1
more	1
joyful.	1
Still	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
joyful!"	1
And	1
from	1
an	1
unknown	1
depth	1
rose	1
increasingly	1
triumphant	1
sounds.	1
"Now	1
voices	1
join	1
in!"	1
ordered	1
Petya.	1
And	1
at	1
first	1
from	1
afar	1
he	1
heard	1
men's	1
voices	1
and	1
then	1
women's.	1
The	1
voices	1
grew	1
in	1
harmonious	1
triumphant	1
strength,	1
and	1
Petya	1
listened	1
to	1
their	1
surpassing	1
beauty	1
in	1
awe	1
and	1
joy.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
solemn	1
triumphal	1
march	1
there	1
mingled	1
a	1
song,	1
the	1
drip	1
from	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
the	1
hissing	1
of	1
the	1
saber,	1
"Ozheg-zheg-zheg..."	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
horses	1
jostled	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
neighed,	1
not	1
disturbing	1
the	1
choir	1
but	1
joining	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
Petya	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
this	1
lasted:	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
himself	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
wondered	1
at	1
his	1
enjoyment	1
and	1
regretted	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
share	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
Likhachev's	1
kindly	1
voice.	1
	1
"It's	1
ready,	1
your	1
honor;	1
you	1
can	1
split	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
in	1
half	1
with	1
it!"	1
	1
Petya	1
woke	1
up.	1
	1
"It's	1
getting	1
light,	1
it's	1
really	1
getting	1
light!"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
been	1
invisible	1
could	1
now	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
their	1
very	1
tails,	1
and	1
a	1
watery	1
light	1
showed	1
itself	1
through	1
the	1
bare	1
branches.	1
Petya	1
shook	1
himself,	1
jumped	1
up,	1
took	1
a	1
ruble	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Likhachev;	1
then	1
he	1
flourished	1
the	1
saber,	1
tested	1
it,	1
and	1
sheathed	1
it.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
untying	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
tightening	1
their	1
saddle	1
girths.	1
	1
"And	1
here's	1
the	1
commander,"	1
said	1
Likhachev.	1
	1
Denisov	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
and,	1
having	1
called	1
Petya,	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
get	1
ready.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
The	1
men	1
rapidly	1
picked	1
out	1
their	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
semidarkness,	1
tightened	1
their	1
saddle	1
girths,	1
and	1
formed	1
companies.	1
Denisov	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hut	1
giving	1
final	1
orders.	1
The	1
infantry	1
of	1
the	1
detachment	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
quickly	1
disappeared	1
amid	1
the	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
early	1
dawn,	1
hundreds	1
of	1
feet	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud.	1
The	1
esaul	1
gave	1
some	1
orders	1
to	1
his	1
men.	1
Petya	1
held	1
his	1
horse	1
by	1
the	1
bridle,	1
impatiently	1
awaiting	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
mount.	1
His	1
face,	1
having	1
been	1
bathed	1
in	1
cold	1
water,	1
was	1
all	1
aglow,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
particularly	1
brilliant.	1
Cold	1
shivers	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
spine	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
pulsed	1
rhythmically.	1
	1
"Well,	1
is	1
ev'wything	1
weady?"	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
"Bwing	1
the	1
horses."	1
	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
brought.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
Cossack	1
because	1
the	1
saddle	1
girths	1
were	1
too	1
slack,	1
reproved	1
him,	1
and	1
mounted.	1
Petya	1
put	1
his	1
foot	1
in	1
the	1
stirrup.	1
His	1
horse	1
by	1
habit	1
made	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
nip	1
his	1
leg,	1
but	1
Petya	1
leaped	1
quickly	1
into	1
the	1
saddle	1
unconscious	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
weight	1
and,	1
turning	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
hussars	1
starting	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
behind	1
him,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Vasili	1
Dmitrich,	1
entrust	1
me	1
with	1
some	1
commission!	1
Please...	1
for	1
God's	1
sake...!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Denisov	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
Petya's	1
very	1
existence.	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
ask	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
you,"	1
he	1
said	1
sternly,	1
"to	1
obey	1
me	1
and	1
not	1
shove	1
yourself	1
forward	1
anywhere."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
another	1
word	1
to	1
Petya	1
but	1
rode	1
in	1
silence	1
all	1
the	1
way.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
it	1
was	1
noticeably	1
growing	1
light	1
over	1
the	1
field.	1
Denisov	1
talked	1
in	1
whispers	1
with	1
the	1
esaul	1
and	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
rode	1
past	1
Petya	1
and	1
Denisov.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
ridden	1
by,	1
Denisov	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
down	1
the	1
hill.	1
Slipping	1
onto	1
their	1
haunches	1
and	1
sliding,	1
the	1
horses	1
descended	1
with	1
their	1
riders	1
into	1
the	1
ravine.	1
Petya	1
rode	1
beside	1
Denisov,	1
the	1
pulsation	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
constantly	1
increasing.	1
It	1
was	1
getting	1
lighter	1
and	1
lighter,	1
but	1
the	1
mist	1
still	1
hid	1
distant	1
objects.	1
Having	1
reached	1
the	1
valley,	1
Denisov	1
looked	1
back	1
and	1
nodded	1
to	1
a	1
Cossack	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
signal!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
Cossack	1
raised	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
a	1
shot	1
rang	1
out.	1
In	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses	1
galloping	1
forward	1
was	1
heard,	1
shouts	1
came	1
from	1
various	1
sides,	1
and	1
then	1
more	1
shots.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
sound	1
of	1
trampling	1
hoofs	1
and	1
shouting,	1
Petya	1
lashed	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
loosening	1
his	1
rein	1
galloped	1
forward,	1
not	1
heeding	1
Denisov	1
who	1
shouted	1
at	1
him.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Petya	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
shot	1
was	1
fired	1
it	1
suddenly	1
became	1
as	1
bright	1
as	1
noon.	1
He	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
galloping	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
bridge	1
he	1
collided	1
with	1
a	1
Cossack	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind,	1
but	1
he	1
galloped	1
on.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
soldiers,	1
probably	1
Frenchmen,	1
were	1
running	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
across	1
the	1
road.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
under	1
his	1
horse's	1
feet.	1
	1
Cossacks	1
were	1
crowding	1
about	1
a	1
hut,	1
busy	1
with	1
something.	1
From	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
that	1
crowd	1
terrible	1
screams	1
arose.	1
Petya	1
galloped	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
the	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
trembling	1
jaw	1
of	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
clutching	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
a	1
lance	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
aimed	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"Hurrah!...	1
Lads!...	1
ours!"	1
shouted	1
Petya,	1
and	1
giving	1
rein	1
to	1
his	1
excited	1
horse	1
he	1
galloped	1
forward	1
along	1
the	1
village	1
street.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
hear	1
shooting	1
ahead	1
of	1
him.	1
Cossacks,	1
hussars,	1
and	1
ragged	1
Russian	1
prisoners,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
running	1
from	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
were	1
shouting	1
something	1
loudly	1
and	1
incoherently.	1
A	1
gallant-looking	1
Frenchman,	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
overcoat,	1
capless,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
red	1
face,	1
had	1
been	1
defending	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
hussars.	1
When	1
Petya	1
galloped	1
up	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
already	1
fallen.	1
"Too	1
late	1
again!"	1
flashed	1
through	1
Petya's	1
mind	1
and	1
he	1
galloped	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
rapid	1
firing	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
The	1
shots	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
yard	1
of	1
the	1
landowner's	1
house	1
he	1
had	1
visited	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
with	1
Dolokhov.	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
making	1
a	1
stand	1
there	1
behind	1
a	1
wattle	1
fence	1
in	1
a	1
garden	1
thickly	1
overgrown	1
with	1
bushes	1
and	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
who	1
crowded	1
at	1
the	1
gateway.	1
Through	1
the	1
smoke,	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
gate,	1
Petya	1
saw	1
Dolokhov,	1
whose	1
face	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
pale-greenish	1
tint,	1
shouting	1
to	1
his	1
men.	1
"Go	1
round!	1
Wait	1
for	1
the	1
infantry!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
as	1
Petya	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Wait?...	1
Hurrah-ah-ah!"	1
shouted	1
Petya,	1
and	1
without	1
pausing	1
a	1
moment	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
whence	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
smoke	1
was	1
thickest.	1
	1
A	1
volley	1
was	1
heard,	1
and	1
some	1
bullets	1
whistled	1
past,	1
while	1
others	1
plashed	1
against	1
something.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
galloped	1
after	1
Petya	1
into	1
the	1
gateway	1
of	1
the	1
courtyard.	1
In	1
the	1
dense	1
wavering	1
smoke	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bushes	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Cossacks,	1
while	1
others	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
toward	1
the	1
pond.	1
Petya	1
was	1
galloping	1
along	1
the	1
courtyard,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
holding	1
the	1
reins	1
he	1
waved	1
both	1
his	1
arms	1
about	1
rapidly	1
and	1
strangely,	1
slipping	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
in	1
his	1
saddle.	1
His	1
horse,	1
having	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
campfire	1
that	1
was	1
smoldering	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
light,	1
stopped	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
Petya	1
fell	1
heavily	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
wet	1
ground.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
jerked	1
rapidly	1
though	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
quite	1
motionless.	1
A	1
bullet	1
had	1
pierced	1
his	1
skull.	1
	1
After	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
senior	1
French	1
officer,	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
handkerchief	1
tied	1
to	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
they	1
surrendered,	1
Dolokhov	1
dismounted	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Petya,	1
who	1
lay	1
motionless	1
with	1
outstretched	1
arms.	1
	1
"Done	1
for!"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
frown,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
to	1
meet	1
Denisov	1
who	1
was	1
riding	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
"Killed?"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
recognizing	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
the	1
unmistakably	1
lifeless	1
attitude--very	1
familiar	1
to	1
him--in	1
which	1
Petya's	1
body	1
was	1
lying.	1
	1
"Done	1
for!"	1
repeated	1
Dolokhov	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
utterance	1
of	1
these	1
words	1
afforded	1
him	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
quickly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
who	1
were	1
surrounded	1
by	1
Cossacks	1
who	1
had	1
hurried	1
up.	1
"We	1
won't	1
take	1
them!"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
	1
Denisov	1
did	1
not	1
reply;	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Petya,	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands	1
turned	1
toward	1
himself	1
the	1
bloodstained,	1
mud-bespattered	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
white.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
something	1
sweet.	1
Raisins,	1
fine	1
ones...	1
take	1
them	1
all!"	1
he	1
recalled	1
Petya's	1
words.	1
And	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
sound,	1
like	1
the	1
yelp	1
of	1
a	1
dog,	1
with	1
which	1
Denisov	1
turned	1
away,	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
wattle	1
fence,	1
and	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
Russian	1
prisoners	1
rescued	1
by	1
Denisov	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
Pierre	1
Bezukhov.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
their	1
march	1
from	1
Moscow	1
no	1
fresh	1
orders	1
had	1
been	1
issued	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
authorities	1
concerning	1
the	1
party	1
of	1
prisoners	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Pierre.	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-second	1
of	1
October	1
that	1
party	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
troops	1
and	1
baggage	1
trains	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow.	1
Half	1
the	1
wagons	1
laden	1
with	1
hardtack	1
that	1
had	1
traveled	1
the	1
first	1
stages	1
with	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
by	1
Cossacks,	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
ahead.	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
dismounted	1
cavalrymen	1
who	1
had	1
marched	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
was	1
left;	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
disappeared.	1
The	1
artillery	1
the	1
prisoners	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
was	1
now	1
replaced	1
by	1
Marshal	1
Junot's	1
enormous	1
baggage	1
train,	1
convoyed	1
by	1
Westphalians.	1
Behind	1
the	1
prisoners	1
came	1
a	1
cavalry	1
baggage	1
train.	1
	1
From	1
Vyazma	1
onwards	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
which	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
moved	1
in	1
three	1
columns,	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
group.	1
The	1
symptoms	1
of	1
disorder	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
noticed	1
at	1
their	1
first	1
halting	1
place	1
after	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
had	1
now	1
reached	1
the	1
utmost	1
limit.	1
	1
The	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
they	1
moved	1
was	1
bordered	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
by	1
dead	1
horses;	1
ragged	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind	1
from	1
various	1
regiments	1
continually	1
changed	1
about,	1
now	1
joining	1
the	1
moving	1
column,	1
now	1
again	1
lagging	1
behind	1
it.	1
	1
Several	1
times	1
during	1
the	1
march	1
false	1
alarms	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
escort	1
had	1
raised	1
their	1
muskets,	1
fired,	1
and	1
run	1
headlong,	1
crushing	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
had	1
afterwards	1
reassembled	1
and	1
abused	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
their	1
causeless	1
panic.	1
	1
These	1
three	1
groups	1
traveling	1
together--the	1
cavalry	1
stores,	1
the	1
convoy	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
Junot's	1
baggage	1
train--still	1
constituted	1
a	1
separate	1
and	1
united	1
whole,	1
though	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
groups	1
was	1
rapidly	1
melting	1
away.	1
	1
Of	1
the	1
artillery	1
baggage	1
train	1
which	1
had	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
wagons,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
sixty	1
now	1
remained;	1
the	1
rest	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
or	1
left	1
behind.	1
Some	1
of	1
Junot's	1
wagons	1
also	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
or	1
abandoned.	1
Three	1
wagons	1
had	1
been	1
raided	1
and	1
robbed	1
by	1
stragglers	1
from	1
Davout's	1
corps.	1
From	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
Germans	1
Pierre	1
learned	1
that	1
a	1
larger	1
guard	1
had	1
been	1
allotted	1
to	1
that	1
baggage	1
train	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
comrades,	1
a	1
German	1
soldier,	1
had	1
been	1
shot	1
by	1
the	1
marshal's	1
own	1
order	1
because	1
a	1
silver	1
spoon	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
marshal	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
The	1
group	1
of	1
prisoners	1
had	1
melted	1
away	1
most	1
of	1
all.	1
Of	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
Moscow	1
fewer	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
now	1
remained.	1
The	1
prisoners	1
were	1
more	1
burdensome	1
to	1
the	1
escort	1
than	1
even	1
the	1
cavalry	1
saddles	1
or	1
Junot's	1
baggage.	1
They	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
saddles	1
and	1
Junot's	1
spoon	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use,	1
but	1
that	1
cold	1
and	1
hungry	1
soldiers	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
stand	1
and	1
guard	1
equally	1
cold	1
and	1
hungry	1
Russians	1
who	1
froze	1
and	1
lagged	1
behind	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
(in	1
which	1
case	1
the	1
order	1
was	1
to	1
shoot	1
them)	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
incomprehensible	1
but	1
revolting.	1
And	1
the	1
escort,	1
as	1
if	1
afraid,	1
in	1
the	1
grievous	1
condition	1
they	1
themselves	1
were	1
in,	1
of	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
pity	1
they	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
so	1
rendering	1
their	1
own	1
plight	1
still	1
worse,	1
treated	1
them	1
with	1
particular	1
moroseness	1
and	1
severity.	1
	1
At	1
Dorogobuzh	1
while	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
convoy,	1
after	1
locking	1
the	1
prisoners	1
in	1
a	1
stable,	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
to	1
pillage	1
their	1
own	1
stores,	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
soldier	1
prisoners	1
tunneled	1
under	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
ran	1
away,	1
but	1
were	1
recaptured	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
shot.	1
	1
The	1
arrangement	1
adopted	1
when	1
they	1
started,	1
that	1
the	1
officer	1
prisoners	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
separate	1
from	1
the	1
rest,	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
abandoned.	1
All	1
who	1
could	1
walk	1
went	1
together,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
third	1
stage	1
Pierre	1
had	1
rejoined	1
Karataev	1
and	1
the	1
gray-blue	1
bandy-legged	1
dog	1
that	1
had	1
chosen	1
Karataev	1
for	1
its	1
master.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
Karataev	1
again	1
fell	1
ill	1
with	1
the	1
fever	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
gradually	1
weaker	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why,	1
but	1
since	1
Karataev	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
grow	1
weaker	1
it	1
had	1
cost	1
him	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
go	1
near	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
subdued	1
moaning	1
with	1
which	1
Karataev	1
generally	1
lay	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
halting	1
places,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
smelled	1
the	1
odor	1
emanating	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
stronger	1
than	1
before,	1
Pierre	1
moved	1
farther	1
away	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
While	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
Pierre	1
had	1
learned	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
intellect	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
being,	1
by	1
life	1
itself,	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
created	1
for	1
happiness,	1
that	1
happiness	1
is	1
within	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
simple	1
human	1
needs,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
unhappiness	1
arises	1
not	1
from	1
privation	1
but	1
from	1
superfluity.	1
And	1
now	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
three	1
weeks	1
of	1
the	1
march	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
still	1
another	1
new,	1
consolatory	1
truth--that	1
nothing	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
terrible.	1
He	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
entirely	1
free,	1
so	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
need	1
be	1
unhappy	1
and	1
lack	1
freedom.	1
He	1
learned	1
that	1
suffering	1
and	1
freedom	1
have	1
their	1
limits	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
limits	1
are	1
very	1
near	1
together;	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
roses	1
with	1
one	1
crumpled	1
petal	1
suffered	1
as	1
keenly	1
as	1
he	1
now,	1
sleeping	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
damp	1
earth	1
with	1
one	1
side	1
growing	1
chilled	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
warming;	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
tight	1
dancing	1
shoes	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
bare	1
feet	1
that	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
sores--his	1
footgear	1
having	1
long	1
since	1
fallen	1
to	1
pieces.	1
He	1
discovered	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
his	1
wife--of	1
his	1
own	1
free	1
will	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him--he	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
more	1
free	1
than	1
now	1
when	1
they	1
locked	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
stable.	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
subsequently	1
termed	1
his	1
sufferings,	1
but	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
scarcely	1
felt,	1
the	1
worst	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
bare,	1
raw,	1
and	1
scab-covered	1
feet.	1
(The	1
horseflesh	1
was	1
appetizing	1
and	1
nourishing,	1
the	1
saltpeter	1
flavor	1
of	1
the	1
gunpowder	1
they	1
used	1
instead	1
of	1
salt	1
was	1
even	1
pleasant;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
great	1
cold,	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
warm	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
daytime,	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
campfires;	1
the	1
lice	1
that	1
devoured	1
him	1
warmed	1
his	1
body.)	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
hard	1
to	1
bear	1
was	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
second	1
day's	1
march	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
examined	1
his	1
feet	1
by	1
the	1
campfire,	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
them;	1
but	1
when	1
everybody	1
got	1
up	1
he	1
went	1
along,	1
limping,	1
and,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
warmed	1
up,	1
walked	1
without	1
feeling	1
the	1
pain,	1
though	1
at	1
night	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
more	1
terrible	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
than	1
before.	1
However,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
now,	1
but	1
thought	1
of	1
other	1
things.	1
	1
Only	1
now	1
did	1
Pierre	1
realize	1
the	1
full	1
strength	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
saving	1
power	1
he	1
has	1
of	1
transferring	1
his	1
attention	1
from	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
another,	1
which	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
safety	1
valve	1
of	1
a	1
boiler	1
that	1
allows	1
superfluous	1
steam	1
to	1
blow	1
off	1
when	1
the	1
pressure	1
exceeds	1
a	1
certain	1
limit.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
how	1
they	1
shot	1
the	1
prisoners	1
who	1
lagged	1
behind,	1
though	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
perished	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Karataev	1
who	1
grew	1
weaker	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
evidently	1
would	1
soon	1
have	1
to	1
share	1
that	1
fate.	1
Still	1
less	1
did	1
Pierre	1
think	1
about	1
himself.	1
The	1
harder	1
his	1
position	1
became	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
terrible	1
the	1
future,	1
the	1
more	1
independent	1
of	1
that	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
were	1
the	1
joyful	1
and	1
comforting	1
thoughts,	1
memories,	1
and	1
imaginings	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
him.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
At	1
midday	1
on	1
the	1
twenty-second	1
of	1
October	1
Pierre	1
was	1
going	1
uphill	1
along	1
the	1
muddy,	1
slippery	1
road,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
Occasionally	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
familiar	1
crowd	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
The	1
former	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
were	1
alike	1
familiar	1
and	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
blue-gray	1
bandy	1
legged	1
dog	1
ran	1
merrily	1
along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
sometimes	1
in	1
proof	1
of	1
its	1
agility	1
and	1
self-satisfaction	1
lifting	1
one	1
hind	1
leg	1
and	1
hopping	1
along	1
on	1
three,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
going	1
on	1
all	1
four	1
and	1
rushing	1
to	1
bark	1
at	1
the	1
crows	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
carrion.	1
The	1
dog	1
was	1
merrier	1
and	1
sleeker	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
All	1
around	1
lay	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
different	1
animals--from	1
men	1
to	1
horses--in	1
various	1
stages	1
of	1
decomposition;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
wolves	1
were	1
kept	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
passing	1
men	1
the	1
dog	1
could	1
eat	1
all	1
it	1
wanted.	1
	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
raining	1
since	1
morning	1
and	1
had	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
it	1
might	1
cease	1
and	1
the	1
sky	1
clear,	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
break	1
it	1
began	1
raining	1
harder	1
than	1
before.	1
The	1
saturated	1
road	1
no	1
longer	1
absorbed	1
the	1
water,	1
which	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
ruts	1
in	1
streams.	1
	1
Pierre	1
walked	1
along,	1
looking	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
counting	1
his	1
steps	1
in	1
threes,	1
and	1
reckoning	1
them	1
off	1
on	1
his	1
fingers.	1
Mentally	1
addressing	1
the	1
rain,	1
he	1
repeated:	1
"Now	1
then,	1
now	1
then,	1
go	1
on!	1
Pelt	1
harder!"	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing,	1
but	1
far	1
down	1
and	1
deep	1
within	1
him	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
occupied	1
with	1
something	1
important	1
and	1
comforting.	1
This	1
something	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
subtle	1
spiritual	1
deduction	1
from	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
Karataev	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
	1
At	1
their	1
yesterday's	1
halting	1
place,	1
feeling	1
chilly	1
by	1
a	1
dying	1
campfire,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
one,	1
which	1
was	1
burning	1
better.	1
There	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
was	1
sitting	1
covered	1
up--head	1
and	1
all--with	1
his	1
greatcoat	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
vestment,	1
telling	1
the	1
soldiers	1
in	1
his	1
effective	1
and	1
pleasant	1
though	1
now	1
feeble	1
voice	1
a	1
story	1
Pierre	1
knew.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
past	1
midnight,	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
Karataev	1
was	1
usually	1
free	1
of	1
his	1
fever	1
and	1
particularly	1
lively.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
reached	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
heard	1
Platon's	1
voice	1
enfeebled	1
by	1
illness,	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
pathetic	1
face	1
brightly	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
blaze,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
painful	1
prick	1
at	1
his	1
heart.	1
His	1
feeling	1
of	1
pity	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
frightened	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
fire,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down,	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Platon.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"How	1
am	1
I?	1
If	1
we	1
grumble	1
at	1
sickness,	1
God	1
won't	1
grant	1
us	1
death,"	1
replied	1
Platon,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
resumed	1
the	1
story	1
he	1
had	1
begun.	1
	1
"And	1
so,	1
brother,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
pale	1
emaciated	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
particularly	1
happy	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
"you	1
see,	1
brother..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
familiar	1
with	1
that	1
story.	1
Karataev	1
had	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
alone	1
some	1
half-dozen	1
times	1
and	1
always	1
with	1
a	1
specially	1
joyful	1
emotion.	1
But	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
it,	1
Pierre	1
now	1
listened	1
to	1
that	1
tale	1
as	1
to	1
something	1
new,	1
and	1
the	1
quiet	1
rapture	1
Karataev	1
evidently	1
felt	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
it	1
communicated	1
itself	1
also	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
story	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
merchant	1
who	1
lived	1
a	1
good	1
and	1
God-fearing	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
who	1
went	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
Nizhni	1
fair	1
with	1
a	1
companion--a	1
rich	1
merchant.	1
	1
Having	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
an	1
inn	1
they	1
both	1
went	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
next	1
morning	1
his	1
companion	1
was	1
found	1
robbed	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
throat	1
cut.	1
A	1
bloodstained	1
knife	1
was	1
found	1
under	1
the	1
old	1
merchant's	1
pillow.	1
He	1
was	1
tried,	1
knouted,	1
and	1
his	1
nostrils	1
having	1
been	1
torn	1
off,	1
"all	1
in	1
due	1
form"	1
as	1
Karataev	1
put	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
hard	1
labor	1
in	1
Siberia.	1
	1
"And	1
so,	1
brother"	1
(it	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
that	1
Pierre	1
came	1
up),	1
"ten	1
years	1
or	1
more	1
passed	1
by.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
living	1
as	1
a	1
convict,	1
submitting	1
as	1
he	1
should	1
and	1
doing	1
no	1
wrong.	1
Only	1
he	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
death.	1
Well,	1
one	1
night	1
the	1
convicts	1
were	1
gathered	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
among	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
telling	1
what	1
each	1
was	1
suffering	1
for,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
sinned	1
against	1
God.	1
One	1
told	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
life,	1
another	1
had	1
taken	1
two,	1
a	1
third	1
had	1
set	1
a	1
house	1
on	1
fire,	1
while	1
another	1
had	1
simply	1
been	1
a	1
vagrant	1
and	1
had	1
done	1
nothing.	1
So	1
they	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
man:	1
'What	1
are	1
you	1
being	1
punished	1
for,	1
Daddy?'--'I,	1
my	1
dear	1
brothers,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'am	1
being	1
punished	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
and	1
other	1
men's	1
sins.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
killed	1
anyone	1
or	1
taken	1
anything	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
have	1
only	1
helped	1
my	1
poorer	1
brothers.	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
merchant,	1
my	1
dear	1
brothers,	1
and	1
had	1
much	1
property.	1
'And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
due	1
order.	1
'I	1
don't	1
grieve	1
for	1
myself,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'God,	1
it	1
seems,	1
has	1
chastened	1
me.	1
Only	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
my	1
old	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
children,'	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
weep.	1
Now	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
group	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
killed	1
the	1
other	1
merchant.	1
'Where	1
did	1
it	1
happen,	1
Daddy?'	1
he	1
said.	1
'When,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
month?'	1
He	1
asked	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
ache.	1
So	1
he	1
comes	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
like	1
this,	1
and	1
falls	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet!	1
'You	1
are	1
perishing	1
because	1
of	1
me,	1
Daddy,'	1
he	1
says.	1
'It's	1
quite	1
true,	1
lads,	1
that	1
this	1
man,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'is	1
being	1
tortured	1
innocently	1
and	1
for	1
nothing!	1
I,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'did	1
that	1
deed,	1
and	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
knife	1
under	1
your	1
head	1
while	1
you	1
were	1
asleep.	1
Forgive	1
me,	1
Daddy,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'for	1
Christ's	1
sake!'"	1
	1
Karataev	1
paused,	1
smiling	1
joyously	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
the	1
logs	1
together.	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
said,	1
'God	1
will	1
forgive	1
you,	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
sinners	1
in	1
His	1
sight.	1
I	1
suffer	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sins,'	1
and	1
he	1
wept	1
bitter	1
tears.	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
dear	1
friends?"	1
Karataev	1
continued,	1
his	1
face	1
brightening	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
smile	1
as	1
if	1
what	1
he	1
now	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
contained	1
the	1
chief	1
charm	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
story:	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
dear	1
fellows?	1
That	1
murderer	1
confessed	1
to	1
the	1
authorities.	1
'I	1
have	1
taken	1
six	1
lives,'	1
he	1
says	1
(he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
sinner),	1
'but	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
most	1
sorry	1
for	1
is	1
this	1
old	1
man.	1
Don't	1
let	1
him	1
suffer	1
because	1
of	1
me.'	1
So	1
he	1
confessed	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
written	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
papers	1
sent	1
off	1
in	1
due	1
form.	1
The	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
off,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
judging,	1
what	1
with	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
another,	1
filling	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
all	1
in	1
due	1
form--the	1
authorities	1
I	1
mean--time	1
passed.	1
The	1
affair	1
reached	1
the	1
Tsar.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
decree	1
came:	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
merchant	1
free	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
compensation	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
awarded.	1
The	1
paper	1
arrived	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
'Where	1
is	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
suffering	1
innocently	1
and	1
in	1
vain?	1
A	1
paper	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Tsar!'	1
so	1
they	1
began	1
looking	1
for	1
him,"	1
here	1
Karataev's	1
lower	1
jaw	1
trembled,	1
"but	1
God	1
had	1
already	1
forgiven	1
him--he	1
was	1
dead!	1
That's	1
how	1
it	1
was,	1
dear	1
fellows!"	1
Karataev	1
concluded	1
and	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
silent,	1
gazing	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
And	1
Pierre's	1
soul	1
was	1
dimly	1
but	1
joyfully	1
filled	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
story	1
itself	1
but	1
by	1
its	1
mysterious	1
significance:	1
by	1
the	1
rapturous	1
joy	1
that	1
lit	1
up	1
Karataev's	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
mystic	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
joy.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
"A	1
vos	1
places!"	1
*	1
suddenly	1
cried	1
a	1
voice.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"To	1
your	1
places."	1
	1
A	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
of	1
excitement	1
and	1
an	1
expectation	1
of	1
something	1
joyful	1
and	1
solemn	1
was	1
aroused	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
convoy	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners.	1
From	1
all	1
sides	1
came	1
shouts	1
of	1
command,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
came	1
smartly	1
dressed	1
cavalrymen	1
on	1
good	1
horses,	1
passing	1
the	1
prisoners	1
at	1
a	1
trot.	1
The	1
expression	1
on	1
all	1
faces	1
showed	1
the	1
tension	1
people	1
feel	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
authority.	1
The	1
prisoners	1
thronged	1
together	1
and	1
were	1
pushed	1
off	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
convoy	1
formed	1
up.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor!	1
The	1
Emperor!	1
The	1
Marshal!	1
The	1
Duke!"	1
and	1
hardly	1
had	1
the	1
sleek	1
cavalry	1
passed,	1
before	1
a	1
carriage	1
drawn	1
by	1
six	1
gray	1
horses	1
rattled	1
by.	1
Pierre	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
three-cornered	1
hat	1
with	1
a	1
tranquil	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
handsome,	1
plump,	1
white	1
face.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
marshals.	1
His	1
eye	1
fell	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
large	1
and	1
striking	1
figure,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
looked	1
away	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
detected	1
sympathy	1
and	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
conceal	1
that	1
sympathy.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
stores	1
galloped	1
after	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
and	1
frightened	1
face,	1
whipping	1
up	1
his	1
skinny	1
horse.	1
Several	1
officers	1
formed	1
a	1
group	1
and	1
some	1
soldiers	1
crowded	1
round	1
them.	1
Their	1
faces	1
all	1
looked	1
excited	1
and	1
worried.	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
he	1
say?	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
say?"	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
them	1
ask.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
marshal	1
was	1
passing,	1
the	1
prisoners	1
had	1
huddled	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
crowd,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
Karataev	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
that	1
morning.	1
He	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
short	1
overcoat	1
leaning	1
against	1
a	1
birch	1
tree.	1
On	1
his	1
face,	1
besides	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
joyful	1
emotion	1
it	1
had	1
worn	1
yesterday	1
while	1
telling	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
merchant	1
who	1
suffered	1
innocently,	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
quiet	1
solemnity.	1
	1
Karataev	1
looked	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
his	1
kindly	1
round	1
eyes	1
now	1
filled	1
with	1
tears,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
was	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
sure	1
of	1
himself.	1
He	1
made	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
that	1
look	1
and	1
moved	1
hastily	1
away.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
prisoners	1
again	1
went	1
forward	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
round.	1
Karataev	1
was	1
still	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
under	1
the	1
birch	1
tree	1
and	1
two	1
Frenchmen	1
were	1
talking	1
over	1
his	1
head.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round	1
again	1
but	1
went	1
limping	1
up	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
From	1
behind,	1
where	1
Karataev	1
had	1
been	1
sitting,	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
shot.	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
it	1
plainly,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
finished	1
reckoning	1
up	1
how	1
many	1
stages	1
still	1
remained	1
to	1
Smolensk--a	1
calculation	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
before	1
the	1
marshal	1
went	1
by.	1
And	1
he	1
again	1
started	1
reckoning.	1
Two	1
French	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
past	1
Pierre,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
carried	1
a	1
lowered	1
and	1
smoking	1
gun.	1
They	1
both	1
looked	1
pale,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
their	1
faces--one	1
of	1
them	1
glanced	1
timidly	1
at	1
Pierre--	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
resembling	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
soldier	1
at	1
the	1
execution.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
soldier	1
and	1
remembered	1
that,	1
two	1
days	1
before,	1
that	1
man	1
had	1
burned	1
his	1
shirt	1
while	1
drying	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
laughed	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
Behind	1
him,	1
where	1
Karataev	1
had	1
been	1
sitting,	1
the	1
dog	1
began	1
to	1
howl.	1
"What	1
a	1
stupid	1
beast!	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
howling?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
His	1
comrades,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
soldiers	1
walking	1
beside	1
him,	1
avoided	1
looking	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
shot	1
had	1
been	1
fired	1
and	1
the	1
dog	1
was	1
howling,	1
just	1
as	1
Pierre	1
did,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
set	1
look	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
faces.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
The	1
stores,	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
the	1
marshal's	1
baggage	1
train	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Shamshevo.	1
The	1
men	1
crowded	1
together	1
round	1
the	1
campfires.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
ate	1
some	1
roast	1
horseflesh,	1
lay	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
immediately	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
He	1
again	1
slept	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Mozhaysk	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino.	1
	1
Again	1
real	1
events	1
mingled	1
with	1
dreams	1
and	1
again	1
someone,	1
he	1
or	1
another,	1
gave	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
expressed	1
in	1
his	1
dream	1
at	1
Mozhaysk.	1
	1
"Life	1
is	1
everything.	1
Life	1
is	1
God.	1
Everything	1
changes	1
and	1
moves	1
and	1
that	1
movement	1
is	1
God.	1
And	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
life	1
there	1
is	1
joy	1
in	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
divine.	1
To	1
love	1
life	1
is	1
to	1
love	1
God.	1
Harder	1
and	1
more	1
blessed	1
than	1
all	1
else	1
is	1
to	1
love	1
this	1
life	1
in	1
one's	1
sufferings,	1
in	1
innocent	1
sufferings."	1
	1
"Karataev!"	1
came	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
mind.	1
	1
And	1
suddenly	1
he	1
saw	1
vividly	1
before	1
him	1
a	1
long-forgotten,	1
kindly	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
geography	1
lessons	1
in	1
Switzerland.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
a	1
globe.	1
This	1
globe	1
was	1
alive--a	1
vibrating	1
ball	1
without	1
fixed	1
dimensions.	1
Its	1
whole	1
surface	1
consisted	1
of	1
drops	1
closely	1
pressed	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
drops	1
moved	1
and	1
changed	1
places,	1
sometimes	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
merging	1
into	1
one,	1
sometimes	1
one	1
dividing	1
into	1
many.	1
Each	1
drop	1
tried	1
to	1
spread	1
out	1
and	1
occupy	1
as	1
much	1
space	1
as	1
possible,	1
but	1
others	1
striving	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
compressed	1
it,	1
sometimes	1
destroyed	1
it,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
merged	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
life,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
teacher.	1
	1
"How	1
simple	1
and	1
clear	1
it	1
is,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
before?"	1
	1
"God	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
each	1
drop	1
tries	1
to	1
expand	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
reflect	1
Him	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
extent.	1
And	1
it	1
grows,	1
merges,	1
disappears	1
from	1
the	1
surface,	1
sinks	1
to	1
the	1
depths,	1
and	1
again	1
emerges.	1
There	1
now,	1
Karataev	1
has	1
spread	1
out	1
and	1
disappeared.	1
Do	1
you	1
understand,	1
my	1
child?"	1
said	1
the	1
teacher.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
understand,	1
damn	1
you?"	1
shouted	1
a	1
voice,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
woke	1
up.	1
	1
He	1
lifted	1
himself	1
and	1
sat	1
up.	1
A	1
Frenchman	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
pushed	1
a	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
away	1
was	1
squatting	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
engaged	1
in	1
roasting	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
meat	1
stuck	1
on	1
a	1
ramrod.	1
His	1
sleeves	1
were	1
rolled	1
up	1
and	1
his	1
sinewy,	1
hairy,	1
red	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
short	1
fingers	1
deftly	1
turned	1
the	1
ramrod.	1
His	1
brown	1
morose	1
face	1
with	1
frowning	1
brows	1
was	1
clearly	1
visible	1
by	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
charcoal.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
him,"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
turning	1
quickly	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
stood	1
behind	1
him.	1
"Brigand!	1
Get	1
away!"	1
	1
And	1
twisting	1
the	1
ramrod	1
he	1
looked	1
gloomily	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
gazed	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
A	1
prisoner,	1
the	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
pushed	1
away,	1
was	1
sitting	1
near	1
the	1
fire	1
patting	1
something	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
Looking	1
more	1
closely	1
Pierre	1
recognized	1
the	1
blue-gray	1
dog,	1
sitting	1
beside	1
the	1
soldier,	1
wagging	1
its	1
tail.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
he's	1
come?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"And	1
Plat-"	1
he	1
began,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
and	1
simultaneously	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
memories	1
awoke	1
in	1
his	1
fancy--of	1
the	1
look	1
Platon	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
under	1
the	1
tree,	1
of	1
the	1
shot	1
heard	1
from	1
that	1
spot,	1
of	1
the	1
dog's	1
howl,	1
of	1
the	1
guilty	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
Frenchmen	1
as	1
they	1
ran	1
past	1
him,	1
of	1
the	1
lowered	1
and	1
smoking	1
gun,	1
and	1
of	1
Karataev's	1
absence	1
at	1
this	1
halt--and	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
realizing	1
that	1
Karataev	1
had	1
been	1
killed,	1
but	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
instant,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why,	1
the	1
recollection	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
of	1
a	1
summer	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
with	1
a	1
beautiful	1
Polish	1
lady	1
on	1
the	1
veranda	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
Kiev.	1
And	1
without	1
linking	1
up	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
or	1
drawing	1
a	1
conclusion	1
from	1
them,	1
Pierre	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
seeing	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
summertime	1
mingled	1
with	1
memories	1
of	1
bathing	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
liquid,	1
vibrating	1
globe,	1
and	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
water	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
closed	1
over	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
Before	1
sunrise	1
he	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
shouts	1
and	1
loud	1
and	1
rapid	1
firing.	1
French	1
soldiers	1
were	1
running	1
past	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
Cossacks!"	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
shouted,	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
Russians	1
surrounded	1
Pierre.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
to	1
him.	1
All	1
around	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
comrades	1
sobbing	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
"Brothers!	1
Dear	1
fellows!	1
Darlings!"	1
old	1
soldiers	1
exclaimed,	1
weeping,	1
as	1
they	1
embraced	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
hussars.	1
	1
The	1
hussars	1
and	1
Cossacks	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
prisoners;	1
one	1
offered	1
them	1
clothes,	1
another	1
boots,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
bread.	1
Pierre	1
sobbed	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word.	1
He	1
hugged	1
the	1
first	1
soldier	1
who	1
approached	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
weeping.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
ruined	1
house,	1
letting	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
disarmed	1
Frenchmen	1
pass	1
by.	1
The	1
French,	1
excited	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened,	1
were	1
talking	1
loudly	1
among	1
themselves,	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
Dolokhov	1
who	1
gently	1
switched	1
his	1
boots	1
with	1
his	1
whip	1
and	1
watched	1
them	1
with	1
cold	1
glassy	1
eyes	1
that	1
boded	1
no	1
good,	1
they	1
became	1
silent.	1
On	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
stood	1
Dolokhov's	1
Cossack,	1
counting	1
the	1
prisoners	1
and	1
marking	1
off	1
each	1
hundred	1
with	1
a	1
chalk	1
line	1
on	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
"How	1
many?"	1
Dolokhov	1
asked	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"The	1
second	1
hundred,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Cossack.	1
	1
"Filez,	1
filez!"	1
*	1
Dolokhov	1
kept	1
saying,	1
having	1
adopted	1
this	1
expression	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
eyes	1
met	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
they	1
flashed	1
with	1
a	1
cruel	1
light.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Get	1
along,	1
get	1
along!"	1
	1
Denisov,	1
bareheaded	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
face,	1
walked	1
behind	1
some	1
Cossacks	1
who	1
were	1
carrying	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Petya	1
Rostov	1
to	1
a	1
hole	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
dug	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
After	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
of	1
October	1
when	1
the	1
frosts	1
began,	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
assumed	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
tragic	1
character,	1
with	1
men	1
freezing,	1
or	1
roasting	1
themselves	1
to	1
death	1
at	1
the	1
campfires,	1
while	1
carriages	1
with	1
people	1
dressed	1
in	1
furs	1
continued	1
to	1
drive	1
past,	1
carrying	1
away	1
the	1
property	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
stolen	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
kings,	1
and	1
dukes;	1
but	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
the	1
flight	1
and	1
disintegration	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
went	1
on	1
essentially	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
From	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Vyazma	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
of	1
seventy-three	1
thousand	1
men	1
not	1
reckoning	1
the	1
Guards	1
(who	1
did	1
nothing	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
war	1
but	1
pillage)	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
thirty-six	1
thousand,	1
though	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
thousand	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
battle.	1
From	1
this	1
beginning	1
the	1
succeeding	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
progression	1
could	1
be	1
determined	1
mathematically.	1
The	1
French	1
army	1
melted	1
away	1
and	1
perished	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
rate	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Vyazma,	1
from	1
Vyazma	1
to	1
Smolensk,	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
to	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Berezina	1
to	1
Vilna-	1
-independently	1
of	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
intensity	1
of	1
the	1
cold,	1
the	1
pursuit,	1
the	1
barring	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
particular	1
conditions.	1
Beyond	1
Vyazma	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
instead	1
of	1
moving	1
in	1
three	1
columns	1
huddled	1
together	1
into	1
one	1
mass,	1
and	1
so	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
end.	1
Berthier	1
wrote	1
to	1
his	1
Emperor	1
(we	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
commanding	1
officers	1
allow	1
themselves	1
to	1
diverge	1
from	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
describing	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
an	1
army)	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
said:	1
	1
I	1
deem	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
report	1
to	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
corps	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
occasion	1
to	1
observe	1
during	1
different	1
stages	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days'	1
march.	1
They	1
are	1
almost	1
disbanded.	1
Scarcely	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
remain	1
with	1
the	1
standards	1
of	1
their	1
regiments,	1
the	1
others	1
go	1
off	1
by	1
themselves	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
food	1
and	1
escape	1
discipline.	1
In	1
general	1
they	1
regard	1
Smolensk	1
as	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
hope	1
to	1
recover.	1
During	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
their	1
cartridges	1
and	1
their	1
arms.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
affairs,	1
whatever	1
your	1
ultimate	1
plans	1
may	1
be,	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
Your	1
Majesty's	1
service	1
demands	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
should	1
be	1
rallied	1
at	1
Smolensk	1
and	1
should	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
be	1
freed	1
from	1
ineffectives,	1
such	1
as	1
dismounted	1
cavalry,	1
unnecessary	1
baggage,	1
and	1
artillery	1
material	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
forces.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
are	1
worn	1
out	1
with	1
hunger	1
and	1
fatigue,	1
need	1
these	1
supplies	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
few	1
days'	1
rest.	1
Many	1
have	1
died	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
bivouacs.	1
This	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
is	1
continually	1
becoming	1
worse	1
and	1
makes	1
one	1
fear	1
that	1
unless	1
a	1
prompt	1
remedy	1
is	1
applied	1
the	1
troops	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
under	1
control	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
an	1
engagement.	1
	1
November	1
9:	1
twenty	1
miles	1
from	1
Smolensk.	1
	1
After	1
staggering	1
into	1
Smolensk	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
promised	1
land,	1
the	1
French,	1
searching	1
for	1
food,	1
killed	1
one	1
another,	1
sacked	1
their	1
own	1
stores,	1
and	1
when	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
plundered	1
fled	1
farther.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
went	1
without	1
knowing	1
whither	1
or	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
going.	1
Still	1
less	1
did	1
that	1
genius,	1
Napoleon,	1
know	1
it,	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
issued	1
any	1
orders	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
and	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
retained	1
their	1
old	1
habits:	1
wrote	1
commands,	1
letters,	1
reports,	1
and	1
orders	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
called	1
one	1
another	1
sire,	1
mon	1
cousin,	1
prince	1
d'Eckmuhl,	1
roi	1
de	1
Naples,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
But	1
these	1
orders	1
and	1
reports	1
were	1
only	1
on	1
paper,	1
nothing	1
in	1
them	1
was	1
acted	1
upon	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
carried	1
out,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
entitled	1
one	1
another	1
Majesties,	1
Highnesses,	1
or	1
Cousins,	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
miserable	1
wretches	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
much	1
evil	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
now	1
to	1
pay.	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
concerned	1
about	1
the	1
army,	1
each	1
was	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
and	1
save	1
himself.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
The	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
and	1
French	1
armies	1
during	1
the	1
campaign	1
from	1
Moscow	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Niemen	1
were	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
Russian	1
blindman's	1
bluff,	1
in	1
which	1
two	1
players	1
are	1
blindfolded	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
occasionally	1
rings	1
a	1
little	1
bell	1
to	1
inform	1
the	1
catcher	1
of	1
his	1
whereabouts.	1
First	1
he	1
rings	1
his	1
bell	1
fearlessly,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
gets	1
into	1
a	1
tight	1
place	1
he	1
runs	1
away	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
he	1
can,	1
and	1
often	1
thinking	1
to	1
escape	1
runs	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
opponent's	1
arms.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
moving	1
along	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road,	1
Napoleon's	1
armies	1
made	1
their	1
presence	1
known,	1
but	1
later	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
Smolensk	1
road	1
they	1
ran	1
holding	1
the	1
clapper	1
of	1
their	1
bell	1
tight--and	1
often	1
thinking	1
they	1
were	1
escaping	1
ran	1
right	1
into	1
the	1
Russians.	1
	1
Owing	1
to	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
flight	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
pursuit	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
exhaustion	1
of	1
the	1
horses,	1
the	1
chief	1
means	1
of	1
approximately	1
ascertaining	1
the	1
enemy's	1
position--by	1
cavalry	1
scouting--	1
was	1
not	1
available.	1
Besides,	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
frequent	1
and	1
rapid	1
change	1
of	1
position	1
by	1
each	1
army,	1
even	1
what	1
information	1
was	1
obtained	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
in	1
time.	1
If	1
news	1
was	1
received	1
one	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
position	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
by	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
when	1
something	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
done,	1
that	1
army	1
was	1
already	1
two	1
days'	1
march	1
farther	1
on	1
and	1
in	1
quite	1
another	1
position.	1
	1
One	1
army	1
fled	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
pursued.	1
Beyond	1
Smolensk	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
different	1
roads	1
available	1
for	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
during	1
their	1
stay	1
of	1
four	1
days	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
learned	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
was,	1
might	1
have	1
arranged	1
some	1
more	1
advantageous	1
plan	1
and	1
undertaken	1
something	1
new.	1
But	1
after	1
a	1
four	1
days'	1
halt	1
the	1
mob,	1
with	1
no	1
maneuvers	1
or	1
plans,	1
again	1
began	1
running	1
along	1
the	1
beaten	1
track,	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
but	1
along	1
the	1
old--the	1
worst--road,	1
through	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
Orsha.	1
	1
Expecting	1
the	1
enemy	1
from	1
behind	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
front,	1
the	1
French	1
separated	1
in	1
their	1
flight	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
over	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
twenty-four	1
hours.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
fled	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
then	1
the	1
kings,	1
then	1
the	1
dukes.	1
The	1
Russian	1
army,	1
expecting	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
beyond	1
the	1
Dnieper--which	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
reasonable	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do--	1
themselves	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
highroad	1
at	1
Krasnoe.	1
And	1
here	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
blindman's	1
buff	1
the	1
French	1
ran	1
into	1
our	1
vanguard.	1
Seeing	1
their	1
enemy	1
unexpectedly	1
the	1
French	1
fell	1
into	1
confusion	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
from	1
the	1
sudden	1
fright,	1
but	1
then	1
they	1
resumed	1
their	1
flight,	1
abandoning	1
their	1
comrades	1
who	1
were	1
farther	1
behind.	1
Then	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
separate	1
portions	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army--first	1
Murat's	1
(the	1
vice-king's),	1
then	1
Davout's,	1
and	1
then	1
Ney's--ran,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
gauntlet	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army.	1
They	1
abandoned	1
one	1
another,	1
abandoned	1
all	1
their	1
heavy	1
baggage,	1
their	1
artillery,	1
and	1
half	1
their	1
men,	1
and	1
fled,	1
getting	1
past	1
the	1
Russians	1
by	1
night	1
by	1
making	1
semicircles	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
	1
Ney,	1
who	1
came	1
last,	1
had	1
been	1
busying	1
himself	1
blowing	1
up	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Smolensk	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
nobody's	1
way,	1
because	1
despite	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
plight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
floor	1
against	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
hurt	1
themselves.	1
Ney,	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
corps	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men,	1
reached	1
Napoleon	1
at	1
Orsha	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
thousand	1
men	1
left,	1
having	1
abandoned	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
cannon,	1
and	1
having	1
crossed	1
the	1
Dnieper	1
at	1
night	1
by	1
stealth	1
at	1
a	1
wooded	1
spot.	1
	1
From	1
Orsha	1
they	1
fled	1
farther	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Vilna,	1
still	1
playing	1
at	1
blindman's	1
buff	1
with	1
the	1
pursuing	1
army.	1
At	1
the	1
Berezina	1
they	1
again	1
became	1
disorganized,	1
many	1
were	1
drowned	1
and	1
many	1
surrendered,	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
got	1
across	1
the	1
river	1
fled	1
farther.	1
Their	1
supreme	1
chief	1
donned	1
a	1
fur	1
coat	1
and,	1
having	1
seated	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
sleigh,	1
galloped	1
on	1
alone,	1
abandoning	1
his	1
companions.	1
The	1
others	1
who	1
could	1
do	1
so	1
drove	1
away	1
too,	1
leaving	1
those	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
to	1
surrender	1
or	1
die.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
This	1
campaign	1
consisted	1
in	1
a	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
during	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
to	1
destroy	1
themselves.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
turned	1
onto	1
the	1
Kaluga	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
their	1
leader	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
army,	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
had	1
any	1
sense.	1
So	1
one	1
might	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
regarding	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
the	1
historians,	1
who	1
attributed	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
retreat	1
fit	1
their	1
theory.	1
But	1
no!	1
Mountains	1
of	1
books	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
historians	1
about	1
this	1
campaign,	1
and	1
everywhere	1
are	1
described	1
Napoleon's	1
arrangements,	1
the	1
maneuvers,	1
and	1
his	1
profound	1
plans	1
which	1
guided	1
the	1
army,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
military	1
genius	1
shown	1
by	1
his	1
marshals.	1
	1
The	1
retreat	1
from	1
Malo-Yaroslavets	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
free	1
road	1
into	1
a	1
well-	1
supplied	1
district	1
and	1
the	1
parallel	1
road	1
was	1
open	1
to	1
him	1
along	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
afterwards	1
pursued	1
him--this	1
unnecessary	1
retreat	1
along	1
a	1
devastated	1
road--is	1
explained	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
being	1
due	1
to	1
profound	1
considerations.	1
Similarly	1
profound	1
considerations	1
are	1
given	1
for	1
his	1
retreat	1
from	1
Smolensk	1
to	1
Orsha.	1
Then	1
his	1
heroism	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
is	1
described,	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
reported	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
prepared	1
to	1
accept	1
battle	1
and	1
take	1
personal	1
command,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
walked	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
birch	1
stick	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"J'ai	1
assez	1
fait	1
l'empereur;	1
il	1
est	1
temps	1
de	1
faire	1
le	1
general,"	1
*	1
but	1
nevertheless	1
immediately	1
ran	1
away	1
again,	1
abandoning	1
to	1
its	1
fate	1
the	1
scattered	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
left	1
behind.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"I	1
have	1
acted	1
the	1
Emperor	1
long	1
enough;	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
act	1
the	1
general."	1
	1
Then	1
we	1
are	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
marshals,	1
especially	1
of	1
Ney--a	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
consisting	1
in	1
this:	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
by	1
night	1
around	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
across	1
the	1
Dnieper	1
and	1
escaped	1
to	1
Orsha,	1
abandoning	1
standards,	1
artillery,	1
and	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
And	1
lastly,	1
the	1
final	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Emperor	1
from	1
his	1
heroic	1
army	1
is	1
presented	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
historians	1
as	1
something	1
great	1
and	1
characteristic	1
of	1
genius.	1
Even	1
that	1
final	1
running	1
away,	1
described	1
in	1
ordinary	1
language	1
as	1
the	1
lowest	1
depth	1
of	1
baseness	1
which	1
every	1
child	1
is	1
taught	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of--even	1
that	1
act	1
finds	1
justification	1
in	1
the	1
historians'	1
language.	1
	1
When	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
stretch	1
the	1
very	1
elastic	1
threads	1
of	1
historical	1
ratiocination	1
any	1
farther,	1
when	1
actions	1
are	1
clearly	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
humanity	1
calls	1
right	1
or	1
even	1
just,	1
the	1
historians	1
produce	1
a	1
saving	1
conception	1
of	1
"greatness."	1
"Greatness,"	1
it	1
seems,	1
excludes	1
the	1
standards	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong.	1
For	1
the	1
"great"	1
man	1
nothing	1
is	1
wrong,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
atrocity	1
for	1
which	1
a	1
"great"	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
blamed.	1
	1
"C'est	1
grand!"	1
*	1
say	1
the	1
historians,	1
and	1
there	1
no	1
longer	1
exists	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
but	1
only	1
"grand"	1
and	1
"not	1
grand."	1
Grand	1
is	1
good,	1
not	1
grand	1
is	1
bad.	1
Grand	1
is	1
the	1
characteristic,	1
in	1
their	1
conception,	1
of	1
some	1
special	1
animals	1
called	1
"heroes."	1
And	1
Napoleon,	1
escaping	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
warm	1
fur	1
coat	1
and	1
leaving	1
to	1
perish	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
his	1
comrades	1
but	1
were	1
(in	1
his	1
opinion)	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
there,	1
feels	1
que	1
c'est	1
grand,	1
*(2)	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
tranquil.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"It	1
is	1
great."	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
great.	1
	1
"Du	1
sublime	1
(he	1
saw	1
something	1
sublime	1
in	1
himself)	1
au	1
ridicule	1
il	1
n'y	1
a	1
qu'un	1
pas,"	1
*	1
said	1
he.	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
for	1
fifty	1
years	1
has	1
been	1
repeating:	1
"Sublime!	1
Grand!	1
Napoleon	1
le	1
Grand!"	1
Du	1
sublime	1
au	1
ridicule	1
il	1
n'y	1
a	1
qu'un	1
pas.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"From	1
the	1
sublime	1
to	1
the	1
ridiculous	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
step."	1
	1
And	1
it	1
occurs	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
that	1
to	1
admit	1
a	1
greatness	1
not	1
commensurable	1
with	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
is	1
merely	1
to	1
admit	1
one's	1
own	1
nothingness	1
and	1
immeasurable	1
meanness.	1
	1
For	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil	1
given	1
us	1
by	1
Christ,	1
no	1
human	1
actions	1
are	1
incommensurable.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
greatness	1
where	1
simplicity,	1
goodness,	1
and	1
truth	1
are	1
absent.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
What	1
Russian,	1
reading	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812,	1
has	1
not	1
experienced	1
an	1
uncomfortable	1
feeling	1
of	1
regret,	1
dissatisfaction,	1
and	1
perplexity?	1
Who	1
has	1
not	1
asked	1
himself	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
captured	1
or	1
destroyed	1
when	1
our	1
three	1
armies	1
surrounded	1
them	1
in	1
superior	1
numbers,	1
when	1
the	1
disordered	1
French,	1
hungry	1
and	1
freezing,	1
surrendered	1
in	1
crowds,	1
and	1
when	1
(as	1
the	1
historians	1
relate)	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
was	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
French,	1
to	1
cut	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
capture	1
them	1
all?	1
	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
which	1
when	1
numerically	1
weaker	1
than	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
given	1
battle	1
at	1
Borodino,	1
did	1
not	1
achieve	1
its	1
purpose	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
surrounded	1
the	1
French	1
on	1
three	1
sides	1
and	1
when	1
its	1
aim	1
was	1
to	1
capture	1
them?	1
Can	1
the	1
French	1
be	1
so	1
enormously	1
superior	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
surrounded	1
them	1
with	1
superior	1
forces	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
beat	1
them?	1
How	1
could	1
that	1
happen?	1
	1
History	1
(or	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
that	1
name)	1
replying	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
says	1
that	1
this	1
occurred	1
because	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
Tormasov	1
and	1
Chichagov,	1
and	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
man,	1
did	1
not	1
execute	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
maneuvers...	1
	1
But	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
execute	1
those	1
maneuvers?	1
And	1
why	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
guilty	1
of	1
not	1
carrying	1
out	1
a	1
prearranged	1
plan	1
were	1
they	1
not	1
tried	1
and	1
punished?	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
admitted	1
that	1
Kutuzov,	1
Chichagov,	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
failures,	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
incomprehensible	1
why,	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
being	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
Berezina	1
(in	1
both	1
cases	1
we	1
had	1
superior	1
forces),	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
with	1
its	1
marshals,	1
kings,	1
and	1
Emperor	1
was	1
not	1
captured,	1
if	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
Russians	1
aimed	1
at.	1
	1
The	1
explanation	1
of	1
this	1
strange	1
fact	1
given	1
by	1
Russian	1
military	1
historians	1
(to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
hindered	1
an	1
attack)	1
is	1
unfounded,	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
the	1
troops	1
from	1
attacking	1
at	1
Vyazma	1
and	1
Tarutino.	1
	1
Why	1
was	1
the	1
Russian	1
army--which	1
with	1
inferior	1
forces	1
had	1
withstood	1
the	1
enemy	1
in	1
full	1
strength	1
at	1
Borodino--defeated	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
the	1
Berezina	1
by	1
the	1
disorganized	1
crowds	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
numerically	1
superior?	1
	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
consisted	1
in	1
cutting	1
off	1
and	1
capturing	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
marshals--and	1
that	1
aim	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
frustrated	1
but	1
all	1
attempts	1
to	1
attain	1
it	1
were	1
most	1
shamefully	1
baffled--then	1
this	1
last	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
is	1
quite	1
rightly	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
victories,	1
and	1
quite	1
wrongly	1
considered	1
victorious	1
by	1
Russian	1
historians.	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
military	1
historians	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
submit	1
to	1
claims	1
of	1
logic	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
conclusion,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
their	1
lyrical	1
rhapsodies	1
about	1
valor,	1
devotion,	1
and	1
so	1
forth,	1
must	1
reluctantly	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
retreat	1
from	1
Moscow	1
was	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
victories	1
for	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
defeats	1
for	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
But	1
putting	1
national	1
vanity	1
entirely	1
aside	1
one	1
feels	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
conclusion	1
involves	1
a	1
contradiction,	1
since	1
the	1
series	1
of	1
French	1
victories	1
brought	1
the	1
French	1
complete	1
destruction,	1
while	1
the	1
series	1
of	1
Russian	1
defeats	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
total	1
destruction	1
of	1
their	1
enemy	1
and	1
the	1
liberation	1
of	1
their	1
country.	1
	1
The	1
source	1
of	1
this	1
contradiction	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
historians	1
studying	1
the	1
events	1
from	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
the	1
sovereigns	1
and	1
the	1
generals,	1
from	1
memoirs,	1
reports,	1
projects,	1
and	1
so	1
forth,	1
have	1
attributed	1
to	1
this	1
last	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
of	1
1812	1
an	1
aim	1
that	1
never	1
existed,	1
namely	1
that	1
of	1
cutting	1
off	1
and	1
capturing	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
his	1
marshals	1
and	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
There	1
never	1
was	1
or	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
an	1
aim,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
and	1
its	1
attainment	1
quite	1
impossible.	1
	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless,	1
first	1
because	1
Napoleon's	1
disorganized	1
army	1
was	1
flying	1
from	1
Russia	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
speed,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
was	1
doing	1
just	1
what	1
every	1
Russian	1
desired.	1
So	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
performing	1
various	1
operations	1
on	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
were	1
running	1
away	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
they	1
possibly	1
could?	1
	1
Secondly,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
to	1
block	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
men	1
whose	1
whole	1
energy	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
flight.	1
	1
Thirdly,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
one's	1
own	1
troops	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
which	1
without	1
external	1
interference	1
was	1
destroying	1
itself	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
rate	1
that,	1
though	1
its	1
path	1
was	1
not	1
blocked,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
across	1
the	1
frontier	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
actually	1
did	1
in	1
December,	1
namely	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
army.	1
	1
Fourthly,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
captive	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
kings,	1
and	1
dukes--whose	1
capture	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
embarrassing	1
for	1
the	1
Russians,	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
adroit	1
diplomatists	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
(Joseph	1
de	1
Maistre	1
and	1
others)	1
recognized.	1
Still	1
more	1
senseless	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
wish	1
to	1
capture	1
army	1
corps	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
when	1
our	1
own	1
army	1
had	1
melted	1
away	1
to	1
half	1
before	1
reaching	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
a	1
whole	1
division	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
needed	1
to	1
convoy	1
the	1
corps	1
of	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
when	1
our	1
men	1
were	1
not	1
always	1
getting	1
full	1
rations	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
already	1
taken	1
were	1
perishing	1
of	1
hunger.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
profound	1
plans	1
about	1
cutting	1
off	1
and	1
capturing	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
a	1
market	1
gardener	1
who,	1
when	1
driving	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
garden	1
a	1
cow	1
that	1
had	1
trampled	1
down	1
the	1
beds	1
he	1
had	1
planted,	1
should	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
hit	1
the	1
cow	1
on	1
the	1
head.	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
excuse	1
of	1
that	1
gardener	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
angry.	1
But	1
not	1
even	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
drew	1
up	1
this	1
project,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
trampled	1
beds.	1
	1
But	1
besides	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
cutting	1
off	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
senseless,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
first	1
because--as	1
experience	1
shows	1
that	1
a	1
three-mile	1
movement	1
of	1
columns	1
on	1
a	1
battlefield	1
never	1
coincides	1
with	1
the	1
plans--the	1
probability	1
of	1
Chichagov,	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
Wittgenstein	1
effecting	1
a	1
junction	1
on	1
time	1
at	1
an	1
appointed	1
place	1
was	1
so	1
remote	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
tantamount	1
to	1
impossibility,	1
as	1
in	1
fact	1
thought	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
plan	1
remarked	1
that	1
diversions	1
planned	1
over	1
great	1
distances	1
do	1
not	1
yield	1
the	1
desired	1
results.	1
	1
Secondly	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
because	1
to	1
paralyze	1
the	1
momentum	1
with	1
which	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
was	1
retiring,	1
incomparably	1
greater	1
forces	1
than	1
the	1
Russians	1
possessed	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
required.	1
	1
Thirdly	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
because	1
the	1
military	1
term	1
"to	1
cut	1
off"	1
has	1
no	1
meaning.	1
One	1
can	1
cut	1
off	1
a	1
slice	1
of	1
bread,	1
but	1
not	1
an	1
army.	1
To	1
cut	1
off	1
an	1
army--to	1
bar	1
its	1
road--is	1
quite	1
impossible,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
plenty	1
of	1
room	1
to	1
avoid	1
capture	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
seen,	1
as	1
the	1
military	1
scientists	1
might	1
convince	1
themselves	1
by	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
possible	1
to	1
capture	1
prisoners	1
if	1
they	1
agree	1
to	1
be	1
captured,	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
possible	1
to	1
catch	1
a	1
swallow	1
if	1
it	1
settles	1
on	1
one's	1
hand.	1
Men	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
if	1
they	1
surrender	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
strategy	1
and	1
tactics,	1
as	1
the	1
Germans	1
did.	1
But	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
quite	1
rightly	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
this	1
suited	1
them,	1
since	1
death	1
by	1
hunger	1
and	1
cold	1
awaited	1
them	1
in	1
flight	1
or	1
captivity	1
alike.	1
	1
Fourthly	1
and	1
chiefly	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
because	1
never	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
has	1
a	1
war	1
been	1
fought	1
under	1
such	1
conditions	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
obtained	1
in	1
1812,	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
in	1
its	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
strained	1
its	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
more	1
without	1
destroying	1
itself.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
from	1
Tarutino	1
to	1
Krasnoe	1
it	1
lost	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
sick	1
or	1
stragglers,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
number	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
provincial	1
town.	1
Half	1
the	1
men	1
fell	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
without	1
a	1
battle.	1
	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign--when	1
the	1
army	1
lacked	1
boots	1
and	1
sheepskin	1
coats,	1
was	1
short	1
of	1
provisions	1
and	1
without	1
vodka,	1
and	1
was	1
camping	1
out	1
at	1
night	1
for	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
with	1
fifteen	1
degrees	1
of	1
frost,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
hours	1
of	1
daylight	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
was	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
discipline	1
cannot	1
be	1
maintained,	1
when	1
men	1
were	1
taken	1
into	1
that	1
region	1
of	1
death	1
where	1
discipline	1
fails,	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
only	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
battle,	1
but	1
for	1
months,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
every	1
moment	1
fighting	1
death	1
from	1
hunger	1
and	1
cold,	1
when	1
half	1
the	1
army	1
perished	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
month--it	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
that	1
the	1
historians	1
tell	1
us	1
how	1
Miloradovich	1
should	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
flank	1
march	1
to	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
place,	1
Tormasov	1
to	1
another	1
place,	1
and	1
Chichagov	1
should	1
have	1
crossed	1
(more	1
than	1
knee-deep	1
in	1
snow)	1
to	1
somewhere	1
else,	1
and	1
how	1
so-and-so	1
"routed"	1
and	1
"cut	1
off"	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
Russians,	1
half	1
of	1
whom	1
died,	1
did	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
to	1
attain	1
an	1
end	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
because	1
other	1
Russians,	1
sitting	1
in	1
warm	1
rooms,	1
proposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
impossible.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
strange	1
contradiction	1
now	1
difficult	1
to	1
understand	1
between	1
the	1
facts	1
and	1
the	1
historical	1
accounts	1
only	1
arises	1
because	1
the	1
historians	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
matter	1
have	1
written	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
words	1
and	1
sentiments	1
of	1
various	1
generals,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
events.	1
	1
To	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Miloradovich	1
seem	1
very	1
interesting,	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
their	1
surmises	1
and	1
the	1
rewards	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
general	1
received;	1
but	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
those	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
hospitals	1
and	1
in	1
graves	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
interest	1
them,	1
for	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
within	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
their	1
investigation.	1
	1
Yet	1
one	1
need	1
only	1
discard	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
reports	1
and	1
general	1
plans	1
and	1
consider	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
those	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
took	1
a	1
direct	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
events,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
seemed	1
insoluble	1
easily	1
and	1
simply	1
receive	1
an	1
immediate	1
and	1
certain	1
solution.	1
	1
The	1
aim	1
of	1
cutting	1
off	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
never	1
existed	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
imaginations	1
of	1
a	1
dozen	1
people.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
exist	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
senseless	1
and	1
unattainable.	1
	1
The	1
people	1
had	1
a	1
single	1
aim:	1
to	1
free	1
their	1
land	1
from	1
invasion.	1
That	1
aim	1
was	1
attained	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
of	1
itself,	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
ran	1
away,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
necessary	1
not	1
to	1
stop	1
their	1
flight.	1
Secondly	1
it	1
was	1
attained	1
by	1
the	1
guerrilla	1
warfare	1
which	1
was	1
destroying	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
thirdly	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
large	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
following	1
the	1
French,	1
ready	1
to	1
use	1
its	1
strength	1
in	1
case	1
their	1
movement	1
stopped.	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
army	1
had	1
to	1
act	1
like	1
a	1
whip	1
to	1
a	1
running	1
animal.	1
And	1
the	1
experienced	1
driver	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
whip	1
raised	1
as	1
a	1
menace	1
than	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
running	1
animal	1
on	1
the	1
head.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
When	1
seeing	1
a	1
dying	1
animal	1
a	1
man	1
feels	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
horror:	1
substance	1
similar	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
is	1
perishing	1
before	1
his	1
eyes.	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
beloved	1
and	1
intimate	1
human	1
being	1
that	1
is	1
dying,	1
besides	1
this	1
horror	1
at	1
the	1
extinction	1
of	1
life	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
severance,	1
a	1
spiritual	1
wound,	1
which	1
like	1
a	1
physical	1
wound	1
is	1
sometimes	1
fatal	1
and	1
sometimes	1
heals,	1
but	1
always	1
aches	1
and	1
shrinks	1
at	1
any	1
external	1
irritating	1
touch.	1
	1
After	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
death	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
alike	1
felt	1
this.	1
Drooping	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
closing	1
their	1
eyes	1
before	1
the	1
menacing	1
cloud	1
of	1
death	1
that	1
overhung	1
them,	1
they	1
dared	1
not	1
look	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
They	1
carefully	1
guarded	1
their	1
open	1
wounds	1
from	1
any	1
rough	1
and	1
painful	1
contact.	1
Everything:	1
a	1
carriage	1
passing	1
rapidly	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
a	1
summons	1
to	1
dinner,	1
the	1
maid's	1
inquiry	1
what	1
dress	1
to	1
prepare,	1
or	1
worse	1
still	1
any	1
word	1
of	1
insincere	1
or	1
feeble	1
sympathy,	1
seemed	1
an	1
insult,	1
painfully	1
irritated	1
the	1
wound,	1
interrupting	1
that	1
necessary	1
quiet	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
both	1
tried	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
stern	1
and	1
dreadful	1
choir	1
that	1
still	1
resounded	1
in	1
their	1
imagination,	1
and	1
hindered	1
their	1
gazing	1
into	1
those	1
mysterious	1
limitless	1
vistas	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
had	1
opened	1
out	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
alone	1
together	1
were	1
they	1
free	1
from	1
such	1
outrage	1
and	1
pain.	1
They	1
spoke	1
little	1
even	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
did	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
very	1
unimportant	1
matters.	1
	1
Both	1
avoided	1
any	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
future.	1
To	1
admit	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
insult	1
his	1
memory.	1
Still	1
more	1
carefully	1
did	1
they	1
avoid	1
anything	1
relating	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
dead.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
and	1
experienced	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
expressed	1
in	1
words,	1
and	1
that	1
any	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
infringed	1
the	1
majesty	1
and	1
sacredness	1
of	1
the	1
mystery	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
accomplished	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
Continued	1
abstention	1
from	1
speech,	1
and	1
constant	1
avoidance	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
might	1
lead	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
subject--this	1
halting	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
at	1
the	1
boundary	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
mention--brought	1
before	1
their	1
minds	1
with	1
still	1
greater	1
purity	1
and	1
clearness	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
feeling.	1
	1
But	1
pure	1
and	1
complete	1
sorrow	1
is	1
as	1
impossible	1
as	1
pure	1
and	1
complete	1
joy.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
as	1
absolute	1
and	1
independent	1
arbiter	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
fate	1
and	1
guardian	1
and	1
instructor	1
of	1
her	1
nephew,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
back	1
to	1
life	1
from	1
that	1
realm	1
of	1
sorrow	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
dwelt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
fortnight.	1
She	1
received	1
letters	1
from	1
her	1
relations	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
reply;	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
was	1
damp	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cough;	1
Alpatych	1
came	1
to	1
Yaroslavl	1
with	1
reports	1
on	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
their	1
affairs	1
and	1
with	1
advice	1
and	1
suggestions	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
to	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Vozdvizhenka	1
Street,	1
which	1
had	1
remained	1
uninjured	1
and	1
needed	1
only	1
slight	1
repairs.	1
Life	1
did	1
not	1
stand	1
still	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
live.	1
Hard	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
emerge	1
from	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
secluded	1
contemplation	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
till	1
then,	1
and	1
sorry	1
and	1
almost	1
ashamed	1
as	1
she	1
felt	1
to	1
leave	1
Natasha	1
alone,	1
yet	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
life	1
demanded	1
her	1
attention	1
and	1
she	1
involuntarily	1
yielded	1
to	1
them.	1
She	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
accounts	1
with	1
Alpatych,	1
conferred	1
with	1
Dessalles	1
about	1
her	1
nephew,	1
and	1
gave	1
orders	1
and	1
made	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
	1
Natasha	1
remained	1
alone	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
began	1
making	1
preparations	1
for	1
departure,	1
held	1
aloof	1
from	1
her	1
too.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
to	1
let	1
Natasha	1
go	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
both	1
parents	1
gladly	1
accepted	1
this	1
offer,	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
their	1
daughter	1
losing	1
strength	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
scene	1
and	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
Moscow	1
doctors	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
anywhere,"	1
Natasha	1
replied	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
her.	1
"Do	1
please	1
just	1
leave	1
me	1
alone!"	1
And	1
she	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
with	1
difficulty	1
refraining	1
from	1
tears	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
irritation	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
sorrow.	1
	1
After	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
deserted	1
by	1
Princes	1
Mary	1
and	1
alone	1
in	1
her	1
grief,	1
Natasha	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
by	1
herself,	1
sitting	1
huddled	1
up	1
feet	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
sofa,	1
tearing	1
and	1
twisting	1
something	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
nervous	1
fingers	1
and	1
gazing	1
intently	1
and	1
fixedly	1
at	1
whatever	1
her	1
eyes	1
chanced	1
to	1
fall	1
on.	1
This	1
solitude	1
exhausted	1
and	1
tormented	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
absolute	1
need	1
of	1
it.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
anyone	1
entered	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
quickly,	1
changed	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
expression,	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
book	1
or	1
some	1
sewing,	1
evidently	1
waiting	1
impatiently	1
for	1
the	1
intruder	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
She	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
penetrate	1
that	1
on	1
which--with	1
a	1
terrible	1
questioning	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
her	1
strength--her	1
spiritual	1
gaze	1
was	1
fixed.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
toward	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
December	1
Natasha,	1
pale	1
and	1
thin,	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
woolen	1
gown,	1
her	1
plaited	1
hair	1
negligently	1
twisted	1
into	1
a	1
knot,	1
was	1
crouched	1
feet	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
her	1
sofa,	1
nervously	1
crumpling	1
and	1
smoothing	1
out	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
her	1
sash	1
while	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
gazing	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gone--to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
life.	1
And	1
that	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
life,	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
thought	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
formerly	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
and	1
improbable,	1
was	1
now	1
nearer	1
and	1
more	1
akin	1
and	1
more	1
comprehensible	1
than	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
life,	1
where	1
everything	1
was	1
either	1
emptiness	1
and	1
desolation	1
or	1
suffering	1
and	1
indignity.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
gazing	1
where	1
she	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
him	1
otherwise	1
than	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
here.	1
She	1
now	1
saw	1
him	1
again	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Mytishchi,	1
at	1
Troitsa,	1
and	1
at	1
Yaroslavl.	1
	1
She	1
saw	1
his	1
face,	1
heard	1
his	1
voice,	1
repeated	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
devised	1
other	1
words	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
spoken.	1
	1
There	1
he	1
is	1
lying	1
back	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
in	1
his	1
velvet	1
cloak,	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
thin	1
pale	1
hand.	1
His	1
chest	1
is	1
dreadfully	1
hollow	1
and	1
his	1
shoulders	1
raised.	1
His	1
lips	1
are	1
firmly	1
closed,	1
his	1
eyes	1
glitter,	1
and	1
a	1
wrinkle	1
comes	1
and	1
goes	1
on	1
his	1
pale	1
forehead.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
twitches	1
just	1
perceptibly,	1
but	1
rapidly.	1
Natasha	1
knows	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
struggling	1
with	1
terrible	1
pain.	1
"What	1
is	1
that	1
pain	1
like?	1
Why	1
does	1
he	1
have	1
that	1
pain?	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
feel?	1
How	1
does	1
it	1
hurt	1
him?"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
He	1
noticed	1
her	1
watching	1
him,	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
seriously:	1
	1
"One	1
thing	1
would	1
be	1
terrible,"	1
said	1
he:	1
"to	1
bind	1
oneself	1
forever	1
to	1
a	1
suffering	1
man.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
continual	1
torture."	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
searchingly	1
at	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
as	1
usual	1
answered	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say.	1
She	1
said:	1
"This	1
can't	1
go	1
on--it	1
won't.	1
You	1
will	1
get	1
well--	1
quite	1
well."	1
	1
She	1
now	1
saw	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
that	1
scene	1
and	1
relived	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
then	1
felt.	1
She	1
recalled	1
his	1
long	1
sad	1
and	1
severe	1
look	1
at	1
those	1
words	1
and	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
rebuke	1
and	1
despair	1
in	1
that	1
protracted	1
gaze.	1
	1
"I	1
agreed,"	1
Natasha	1
now	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
"that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dreadful	1
if	1
he	1
always	1
continued	1
to	1
suffer.	1
I	1
said	1
it	1
then	1
only	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
dreadful	1
for	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
differently.	1
He	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dreadful	1
for	1
me.	1
He	1
then	1
still	1
wished	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
feared	1
death.	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
it	1
so	1
awkwardly	1
and	1
stupidly!	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
meant.	1
I	1
thought	1
quite	1
differently.	1
Had	1
I	1
said	1
what	1
I	1
thought,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
said:	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
dying,	1
to	1
die	1
continually	1
before	1
my	1
eyes,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
now.	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
nothing...	1
nobody.	1
Did	1
he	1
know	1
that?	1
No,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
and	1
never	1
will	1
know	1
it.	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
will	1
never,	1
never	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
right."	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
again	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
to	1
her,	1
only	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
Natasha	1
this	1
time	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
different	1
answer.	1
She	1
stopped	1
him	1
and	1
said:	1
"Terrible	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
me!	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
for	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
life	1
but	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
suffer	1
with	1
you	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
for	1
me,"	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
pressed	1
it	1
that	1
terrible	1
evening	1
four	1
days	1
before	1
his	1
death.	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
she	1
said	1
other	1
tender	1
and	1
loving	1
words	1
which	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
then	1
but	1
only	1
spoke	1
now:	1
"I	1
love	1
thee!...	1
thee!	1
I	1
love,	1
love..."	1
she	1
said,	1
convulsively	1
pressing	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
setting	1
her	1
teeth	1
with	1
a	1
desperate	1
effort...	1
	1
She	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
sweet	1
sorrow	1
and	1
tears	1
were	1
already	1
rising	1
in	1
her	1
eyes;	1
then	1
she	1
suddenly	1
asked	1
herself	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
this.	1
Again	1
everything	1
was	1
shrouded	1
in	1
hard,	1
dry	1
perplexity,	1
and	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
strained	1
frown	1
she	1
peered	1
toward	1
the	1
world	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
And	1
now,	1
now	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
penetrating	1
the	1
mystery....	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
incomprehensible	1
was	1
revealing	1
itself	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
loud	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
handle	1
struck	1
painfully	1
on	1
her	1
ears.	1
Dunyasha,	1
her	1
maid,	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
quickly	1
and	1
abruptly	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
showing	1
no	1
concern	1
for	1
her	1
mistress.	1
	1
"Come	1
to	1
your	1
Papa	1
at	1
once,	1
please!"	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
strange,	1
excited	1
look.	1
"A	1
misfortune...	1
about	1
Peter	1
Ilynich...	1
a	1
letter,"	1
she	1
finished	1
with	1
a	1
sob.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Besides	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
aloofness	1
from	1
everybody	1
Natasha	1
was	1
feeling	1
a	1
special	1
estrangement	1
from	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
family.	1
All	1
of	1
them--	1
her	1
father,	1
mother,	1
and	1
Sonya--were	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
her,	1
so	1
familiar,	1
so	1
commonplace,	1
that	1
all	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
feelings	1
seemed	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
of	1
late,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
not	1
merely	1
indifferent	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
regarded	1
them	1
with	1
hostility.	1
She	1
heard	1
Dunyasha's	1
words	1
about	1
Peter	1
Ilynich	1
and	1
a	1
misfortune,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
grasp	1
them.	1
	1
"What	1
misfortune?	1
What	1
misfortune	1
can	1
happen	1
to	1
them?	1
They	1
just	1
live	1
their	1
own	1
old,	1
quiet,	1
and	1
commonplace	1
life,"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
hurriedly	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
room.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
puckered	1
up	1
and	1
wet	1
with	1
tears.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
run	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
room	1
to	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
the	1
sobs	1
that	1
were	1
choking	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Natasha	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arms	1
despairingly	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
convulsively	1
painful	1
sobs	1
that	1
distorted	1
his	1
soft	1
round	1
face.	1
	1
"Pe...	1
Petya...	1
Go,	1
go,	1
she...	1
is	1
calling..."	1
and	1
weeping	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
quickly	1
shuffling	1
on	1
his	1
feeble	1
legs	1
to	1
a	1
chair,	1
he	1
almost	1
fell	1
into	1
it,	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
an	1
electric	1
shock	1
seemed	1
to	1
run	1
through	1
Natasha's	1
whole	1
being.	1
Terrible	1
anguish	1
struck	1
her	1
heart,	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
dreadful	1
ache	1
as	1
if	1
something	1
was	1
being	1
torn	1
inside	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
were	1
dying.	1
But	1
the	1
pain	1
was	1
immediately	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
release	1
from	1
the	1
oppressive	1
constraint	1
that	1
had	1
prevented	1
her	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
life.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
the	1
terribly	1
wild	1
cries	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
that	1
she	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
door,	1
made	1
her	1
immediately	1
forget	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
grief.	1
	1
She	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
father,	1
but	1
he	1
feebly	1
waved	1
his	1
arm,	1
pointing	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
door.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
pale	1
and	1
with	1
quivering	1
chin,	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
that	1
room	1
and	1
taking	1
Natasha	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
her.	1
Natasha	1
neither	1
saw	1
nor	1
heard	1
her.	1
She	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps,	1
pausing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
if	1
struggling	1
with	1
herself,	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
awkward	1
position,	1
stretching	1
out	1
and	1
beating	1
her	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
maids	1
were	1
holding	1
her	1
arms.	1
	1
"Natasha!	1
Natasha!..."	1
cried	1
the	1
countess.	1
"It's	1
not	1
true...	1
it's	1
not	1
true...	1
He's	1
lying...	1
Natasha!"	1
she	1
shrieked,	1
pushing	1
those	1
around	1
her	1
away.	1
"Go	1
away,	1
all	1
of	1
you;	1
it's	1
not	1
true!	1
Killed!...	1
ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!...	1
It's	1
not	1
true!"	1
	1
Natasha	1
put	1
one	1
knee	1
on	1
the	1
armchair,	1
stooped	1
over	1
her	1
mother,	1
embraced	1
her,	1
and	1
with	1
unexpected	1
strength	1
raised	1
her,	1
turned	1
her	1
face	1
toward	1
herself,	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Mummy!...	1
darling!...	1
I	1
am	1
here,	1
my	1
dearest	1
Mummy,"	1
she	1
kept	1
on	1
whispering,	1
not	1
pausing	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
but	1
struggled	1
tenderly	1
with	1
her,	1
demanded	1
a	1
pillow	1
and	1
hot	1
water,	1
and	1
unfastened	1
and	1
tore	1
open	1
her	1
mother's	1
dress.	1
	1
"My	1
dearest	1
darling...	1
Mummy,	1
my	1
precious!..."	1
she	1
whispered	1
incessantly,	1
kissing	1
her	1
head,	1
her	1
hands,	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
feeling	1
her	1
own	1
irrepressible	1
and	1
streaming	1
tears	1
tickling	1
her	1
nose	1
and	1
cheeks.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
pressed	1
her	1
daughter's	1
hand,	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
became	1
quiet	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
unaccustomed	1
swiftness,	1
glanced	1
vacantly	1
around	1
her,	1
and	1
seeing	1
Natasha	1
began	1
to	1
press	1
her	1
daughter's	1
head	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
strength.	1
Then	1
she	1
turned	1
toward	1
her	1
daughter's	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
wincing	1
with	1
pain	1
and	1
gazed	1
long	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
you	1
love	1
me?"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
trustful	1
whisper.	1
"Natasha,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
deceive	1
me?	1
You'll	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
truth?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
look	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
love	1
and	1
an	1
entreaty	1
for	1
forgiveness.	1
	1
"My	1
darling	1
Mummy!"	1
she	1
repeated,	1
straining	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
taking	1
on	1
herself	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
grief	1
that	1
crushed	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
And	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
futile	1
struggle	1
with	1
reality	1
her	1
mother,	1
refusing	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
live	1
when	1
her	1
beloved	1
boy	1
was	1
killed	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
life,	1
escaped	1
from	1
reality	1
into	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
delirium.	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
how	1
that	1
day	1
passed	1
nor	1
that	1
night,	1
nor	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
mother.	1
Her	1
persevering	1
and	1
patient	1
love	1
seemed	1
completely	1
to	1
surround	1
the	1
countess	1
every	1
moment,	1
not	1
explaining	1
or	1
consoling,	1
but	1
recalling	1
her	1
to	1
life.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
third	1
night	1
the	1
countess	1
kept	1
very	1
quiet	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
rested	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
her	1
chair	1
and	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes,	1
but	1
opened	1
them	1
again	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
bedstead	1
creak.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
and	1
speaking	1
softly.	1
	1
"How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you	1
have	1
come.	1
You	1
are	1
tired.	1
Won't	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
tea?"	1
Natasha	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her.	1
"You	1
have	1
improved	1
in	1
looks	1
and	1
grown	1
more	1
manly,"	1
continued	1
the	1
countess,	1
taking	1
her	1
daughter's	1
hand.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
saying..."	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
more,	1
no	1
more!"	1
	1
And	1
embracing	1
her	1
daughter,	1
the	1
countess	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
postponed	1
her	1
departure.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
tried	1
to	1
replace	1
Natasha	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
They	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
alone	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
mother	1
from	1
unreasoning	1
despair.	1
For	1
three	1
weeks	1
Natasha	1
remained	1
constantly	1
at	1
her	1
mother's	1
side,	1
sleeping	1
on	1
a	1
lounge	1
chair	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
making	1
her	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
incessantly	1
because	1
the	1
mere	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
tender,	1
caressing	1
tones	1
soothed	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
The	1
mother's	1
wounded	1
spirit	1
could	1
not	1
heal.	1
Petya's	1
death	1
had	1
torn	1
from	1
her	1
half	1
her	1
life.	1
When	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
Petya's	1
death	1
had	1
come	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
fresh	1
and	1
vigorous	1
woman	1
of	1
fifty,	1
but	1
a	1
month	1
later	1
she	1
left	1
her	1
room	1
a	1
listless	1
old	1
woman	1
taking	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
life.	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
blow	1
that	1
almost	1
killed	1
the	1
countess,	1
this	1
second	1
blow,	1
restored	1
Natasha	1
to	1
life.	1
	1
A	1
spiritual	1
wound	1
produced	1
by	1
a	1
rending	1
of	1
the	1
spiritual	1
body	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
physical	1
wound	1
and,	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
deep	1
wound	1
may	1
heal	1
and	1
its	1
edges	1
join,	1
physical	1
and	1
spiritual	1
wounds	1
alike	1
can	1
yet	1
heal	1
completely	1
only	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
a	1
vital	1
force	1
from	1
within.	1
	1
Natasha's	1
wound	1
healed	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
She	1
thought	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
ended,	1
but	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
mother	1
unexpectedly	1
showed	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
life--love--was	1
still	1
active	1
within	1
her.	1
Love	1
awoke	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
life.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
last	1
days	1
had	1
bound	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
together;	1
this	1
new	1
sorrow	1
brought	1
them	1
still	1
closer	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
put	1
off	1
her	1
departure,	1
and	1
for	1
three	1
weeks	1
looked	1
after	1
Natasha	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
sick	1
child.	1
The	1
last	1
weeks	1
passed	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
bedroom	1
had	1
strained	1
Natasha's	1
physical	1
strength.	1
	1
One	1
afternoon	1
noticing	1
Natasha	1
shivering	1
with	1
fever,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
bed.	1
Natasha	1
lay	1
down,	1
but	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
drawn	1
the	1
blinds	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
back.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
sleep,	1
Mary,	1
sit	1
by	1
me	1
a	1
little."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
tired--try	1
to	1
sleep."	1
	1
"No,	1
no.	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
bring	1
me	1
away?	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
asking	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
much	1
better.	1
She	1
spoke	1
so	1
well	1
today,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Natasha	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
semidarkness	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
scanned	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face.	1
	1
"Is	1
she	1
like	1
him?"	1
thought	1
Natasha.	1
"Yes,	1
like	1
and	1
yet	1
not	1
like.	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
quite	1
original,	1
strange,	1
new,	1
and	1
unknown.	1
And	1
she	1
loves	1
me.	1
What	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
heart?	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
good.	1
But	1
how?	1
What	1
is	1
her	1
mind	1
like?	1
What	1
does	1
she	1
think	1
about	1
me?	1
Yes,	1
she	1
is	1
splendid!"	1
	1
"Mary,"	1
she	1
said	1
timidly,	1
drawing	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
hand	1
to	1
herself,	1
"Mary,	1
you	1
mustn't	1
think	1
me	1
wicked.	1
No?	1
Mary	1
darling,	1
how	1
I	1
love	1
you!	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
quite,	1
quite	1
friends."	1
	1
And	1
Natasha,	1
embracing	1
her,	1
began	1
kissing	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
hands,	1
making	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
feel	1
shy	1
but	1
happy	1
by	1
this	1
demonstration	1
of	1
her	1
feelings.	1
	1
From	1
that	1
day	1
a	1
tender	1
and	1
passionate	1
friendship	1
such	1
as	1
exists	1
only	1
between	1
women	1
was	1
established	1
between	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha.	1
They	1
were	1
continually	1
kissing	1
and	1
saying	1
tender	1
things	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
their	1
time	1
together.	1
When	1
one	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
other	1
became	1
restless	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
rejoin	1
her.	1
Together	1
they	1
felt	1
more	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
felt	1
with	1
herself	1
when	1
alone.	1
A	1
feeling	1
stronger	1
than	1
friendship	1
sprang	1
up	1
between	1
them;	1
an	1
exclusive	1
feeling	1
of	1
life	1
being	1
possible	1
only	1
in	1
each	1
other's	1
presence.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
they	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
hours;	1
sometimes	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
bed	1
they	1
would	1
begin	1
talking	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
till	1
morning.	1
They	1
spoke	1
most	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
long	1
past.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
childhood,	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
her	1
daydreams;	1
and	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
passive	1
lack	1
of	1
understanding	1
had	1
formerly	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
that	1
life	1
of	1
devotion,	1
submission,	1
and	1
the	1
poetry	1
of	1
Christian	1
self-sacrifice,	1
now	1
feeling	1
herself	1
bound	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
by	1
affection,	1
learned	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
past	1
too	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
a	1
side	1
of	1
life	1
previously	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
applying	1
submission	1
and	1
self-abnegation	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
life,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
seek	1
other	1
joys,	1
but	1
she	1
understood	1
and	1
loved	1
in	1
another	1
those	1
previously	1
incomprehensible	1
virtues.	1
For	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
listening	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
tales	1
of	1
childhood	1
and	1
early	1
youth,	1
there	1
also	1
opened	1
out	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
hitherto	1
uncomprehended	1
side	1
of	1
life:	1
belief	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
its	1
enjoyment.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
before,	1
they	1
never	1
mentioned	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
lower	1
(as	1
they	1
thought)	1
their	1
exalted	1
feelings	1
by	1
words;	1
but	1
this	1
silence	1
about	1
him	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
making	1
them	1
gradually	1
begin	1
to	1
forget	1
him	1
without	1
being	1
conscious	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
Natasha	1
had	1
grown	1
thin	1
and	1
pale	1
and	1
physically	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
talked	1
about	1
her	1
health,	1
and	1
this	1
pleased	1
her.	1
But	1
sometimes	1
she	1
was	1
suddenly	1
overcome	1
by	1
fear	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
of	1
sickness,	1
weakness,	1
and	1
loss	1
of	1
good	1
looks,	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
she	1
examined	1
her	1
bare	1
arm	1
carefully,	1
surprised	1
at	1
its	1
thinness,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
noticed	1
her	1
drawn	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her,	1
piteous	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
glass.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
so,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
dreadfully	1
sad.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
she	1
went	1
quickly	1
upstairs	1
and	1
found	1
herself	1
out	1
of	1
breath.	1
Unconsciously	1
she	1
immediately	1
invented	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
going	1
down,	1
and	1
then,	1
testing	1
her	1
strength,	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
again,	1
observing	1
the	1
result.	1
	1
Another	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
called	1
Dunyasha	1
her	1
voice	1
trembled,	1
so	1
she	1
called	1
again--though	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
Dunyasha	1
coming--called	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
chest	1
tones	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
wont	1
to	1
sing,	1
and	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
herself.	1
	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
it,	1
but	1
beneath	1
the	1
layer	1
of	1
slime	1
that	1
covered	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
impenetrable,	1
delicate	1
young	1
shoots	1
of	1
grass	1
were	1
already	1
sprouting,	1
which	1
taking	1
root	1
would	1
so	1
cover	1
with	1
their	1
living	1
verdure	1
the	1
grief	1
that	1
weighed	1
her	1
down	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
soon	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
seen	1
or	1
noticed.	1
The	1
wound	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
heal	1
from	1
within.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
January	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
left	1
for	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
insisted	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
going	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
consult	1
the	1
doctors.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
After	1
the	1
encounter	1
at	1
Vyazma,	1
where	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
hold	1
back	1
his	1
troops	1
in	1
their	1
anxiety	1
to	1
overwhelm	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
the	1
farther	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
fleeing	1
French,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Russians	1
who	1
pursued	1
them,	1
continued	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Krasnoe	1
without	1
a	1
battle.	1
The	1
flight	1
was	1
so	1
rapid	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
pursuing	1
the	1
French	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
them;	1
cavalry	1
and	1
artillery	1
horses	1
broke	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
information	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
never	1
reliable.	1
	1
The	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
were	1
so	1
worn	1
out	1
by	1
this	1
continuous	1
marching	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
twenty-seven	1
miles	1
a	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
any	1
faster.	1
	1
To	1
realize	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
exhaustion	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
grasp	1
clearly	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that,	1
while	1
not	1
losing	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
thousand	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded	1
after	1
Tarutino	1
and	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
prisoners,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
which	1
left	1
that	1
place	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
strong	1
reached	1
Krasnoe	1
with	1
only	1
fifty	1
thousand.	1
	1
The	1
rapidity	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
pursuit	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
destructive	1
to	1
our	1
army	1
as	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
to	1
theirs.	1
The	1
only	1
difference	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
moved	1
voluntarily,	1
with	1
no	1
such	1
threat	1
of	1
destruction	1
as	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sick	1
Frenchmen	1
were	1
left	1
behind	1
in	1
enemy	1
hands	1
while	1
the	1
sick	1
Russians	1
left	1
behind	1
were	1
among	1
their	1
own	1
people.	1
The	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
wastage	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
was	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
its	1
movement,	1
and	1
a	1
convincing	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
corresponding	1
decrease	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power,	1
instead	1
of	1
trying	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
as	1
was	1
desired	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
generals,	1
directed	1
his	1
whole	1
activity	1
here,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Tarutino	1
and	1
Vyazma,	1
to	1
hastening	1
it	1
on	1
while	1
easing	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
our	1
army.	1
	1
But	1
besides	1
this,	1
since	1
the	1
exhaustion	1
and	1
enormous	1
diminution	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
the	1
advance	1
had	1
become	1
evident,	1
another	1
reason	1
for	1
slackening	1
the	1
pace	1
and	1
delaying	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
The	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
French.	1
The	1
road	1
the	1
French	1
would	1
take	1
was	1
unknown,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
closer	1
our	1
troops	1
trod	1
on	1
their	1
heels	1
the	1
greater	1
distance	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
cover.	1
Only	1
by	1
following	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
could	1
one	1
cut	1
across	1
the	1
zigzag	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
All	1
the	1
artful	1
maneuvers	1
suggested	1
by	1
our	1
generals	1
meant	1
fresh	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
a	1
lengthening	1
of	1
its	1
marches,	1
whereas	1
the	1
only	1
reasonable	1
aim	1
was	1
to	1
shorten	1
those	1
marches.	1
To	1
that	1
end	1
Kutuzov's	1
activity	1
was	1
directed	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Vilna--not	1
casually	1
or	1
intermittently	1
but	1
so	1
consistently	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
once	1
deviated	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
felt	1
and	1
knew--not	1
by	1
reasoning	1
or	1
science	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
Russian	1
being--what	1
every	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
felt:	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
beaten,	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
flying	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
driven	1
out;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
like	1
the	1
soldiers	1
realized	1
all	1
the	1
hardship	1
of	1
this	1
march,	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
unparalleled	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
generals,	1
especially	1
the	1
foreign	1
ones	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
distinguish	1
themselves,	1
to	1
astonish	1
somebody,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
to	1
capture	1
a	1
king	1
or	1
a	1
duke--it	1
seemed	1
that	1
now--when	1
any	1
battle	1
must	1
be	1
horrible	1
and	1
senseless--was	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
to	1
fight	1
and	1
conquer	1
somebody.	1
Kutuzov	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
when	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
they	1
presented	1
projects	1
of	1
maneuvers	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
with	1
those	1
soldiers--	1
ill-shod,	1
insufficiently	1
clad,	1
and	1
half	1
starved--who	1
within	1
a	1
month	1
and	1
without	1
fighting	1
a	1
battle	1
had	1
dwindled	1
to	1
half	1
their	1
number,	1
and	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
best	1
if	1
the	1
flight	1
continued	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
greater	1
distance	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
already	1
traversed,	1
before	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
frontier.	1
	1
This	1
longing	1
to	1
distinguish	1
themselves,	1
to	1
maneuver,	1
to	1
overthrow,	1
and	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
showed	1
itself	1
particularly	1
whenever	1
the	1
Russians	1
stumbled	1
on	1
the	1
French	1
army.	1
	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Krasnoe,	1
where	1
they	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
French	1
columns	1
and	1
stumbled	1
instead	1
on	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
with	1
sixteen	1
thousand	1
men.	1
Despite	1
all	1
Kutuzov's	1
efforts	1
to	1
avoid	1
that	1
ruinous	1
encounter	1
and	1
to	1
preserve	1
his	1
troops,	1
the	1
massacre	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
mob	1
of	1
French	1
soldiers	1
by	1
worn-out	1
Russians	1
continued	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
for	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
Toll	1
wrote	1
a	1
disposition:	1
"The	1
first	1
column	1
will	1
march	1
to	1
so	1
and	1
so,"	1
etc.	1
And	1
as	1
usual	1
nothing	1
happened	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
disposition.	1
Prince	1
Eugene	1
of	1
Wurttemberg	1
fired	1
from	1
a	1
hill	1
over	1
the	1
French	1
crowds	1
that	1
were	1
running	1
past,	1
and	1
demanded	1
reinforcements	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
arrive.	1
The	1
French,	1
avoiding	1
the	1
Russians,	1
dispersed	1
and	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
by	1
night,	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
round	1
as	1
best	1
they	1
could,	1
and	1
continued	1
their	1
flight.	1
	1
Miloradovich,	1
who	1
said	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
commissariat	1
affairs	1
of	1
his	1
detachment,	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
found	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
wanted--that	1
chevalier	1
sans	1
peur	1
et	1
sans	1
reproche	1
*	1
as	1
he	1
styled	1
himself--who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
parleys	1
with	1
the	1
French,	1
sent	1
envoys	1
demanding	1
their	1
surrender,	1
wasted	1
time,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Knight	1
without	1
fear	1
and	1
without	1
reproach.	1
	1
"I	1
give	1
you	1
that	1
column,	1
lads,"	1
he	1
said,	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
troops	1
and	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
the	1
cavalry.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
cavalry,	1
with	1
spurs	1
and	1
sabers	1
urging	1
on	1
horses	1
that	1
could	1
scarcely	1
move,	1
trotted	1
with	1
much	1
effort	1
to	1
the	1
column	1
presented	1
to	1
them-	1
-that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
to	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
Frenchmen	1
stark	1
with	1
cold,	1
frost-bitten,	1
and	1
starving--and	1
the	1
column	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
presented	1
to	1
them	1
threw	1
down	1
its	1
arms	1
and	1
surrendered	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
anxious	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
At	1
Krasnoe	1
they	1
took	1
twenty-six	1
thousand	1
prisoners,	1
several	1
hundred	1
cannon,	1
and	1
a	1
stick	1
called	1
a	1
"marshal's	1
staff,"	1
and	1
disputed	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
had	1
distinguished	1
himself	1
and	1
were	1
pleased	1
with	1
their	1
achievement--	1
though	1
they	1
much	1
regretted	1
not	1
having	1
taken	1
Napoleon,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
marshal	1
or	1
a	1
hero	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
and	1
reproached	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
especially	1
Kutuzov	1
for	1
having	1
failed	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
These	1
men,	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
their	1
passions,	1
were	1
but	1
blind	1
tools	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
melancholy	1
law	1
of	1
necessity,	1
but	1
considered	1
themselves	1
heroes	1
and	1
imagined	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
accomplishing	1
a	1
most	1
noble	1
and	1
honorable	1
deed.	1
They	1
blamed	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
he	1
had	1
prevented	1
their	1
vanquishing	1
Napoleon,	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
satisfying	1
his	1
passions	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
advance	1
from	1
the	1
Linen	1
Factories	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
comfortable	1
there,	1
that	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
he	1
checked	1
the	1
advance	1
because	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
there	1
he	1
had	1
quite	1
lost	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
probable	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
understanding	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
bribed	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
his	1
contemporaries,	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
their	1
passions,	1
talk	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
but	1
posterity	1
and	1
history	1
have	1
acclaimed	1
Napoleon	1
as	1
grand,	1
while	1
Kutuzov	1
is	1
described	1
by	1
foreigners	1
as	1
a	1
crafty,	1
dissolute,	1
weak	1
old	1
courtier,	1
and	1
by	1
Russians	1
as	1
something	1
indefinite--a	1
sort	1
of	1
puppet	1
useful	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
Russian	1
name.	1

V	1
	1
In	1
1812	1
and	1
1813	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
openly	1
accused	1
of	1
blundering.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
in	1
a	1
history	1
recently	1
written	1
by	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Highest	1
Authorities	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
a	1
cunning	1
court	1
liar,	1
frightened	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
blunders	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
the	1
Berezina	1
he	1
deprived	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
complete	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
French.	1

History	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1812.	1
The	1
character	1
of	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
reflections	1
on	1
the	1
unsatisfactory	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
battles	1
at	1
Krasnoe,	1
by	1
Bogdanovich.	1
	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
fate	1
not	1
of	1
great	1
men	1
(grands	1
hommes)	1
whom	1
the	1
Russian	1
mind	1
does	1
not	1
acknowledge,	1
but	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
and	1
always	1
solitary	1
individuals	1
who,	1
discerning	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Providence,	1
submit	1
their	1
personal	1
will	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
hatred	1
and	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
punish	1
such	1
men	1
for	1
discerning	1
the	1
higher	1
laws.	1
	1
For	1
Russian	1
historians,	1
strange	1
and	1
terrible	1
to	1
say,	1
Napoleon--that	1
most	1
insignificant	1
tool	1
of	1
history	1
who	1
never	1
anywhere,	1
even	1
in	1
exile,	1
showed	1
human	1
dignity--Napoleon	1
is	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
adulation	1
and	1
enthusiasm;	1
he	1
is	1
grand.	1
But	1
Kutuzov--the	1
man	1
who	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
activity	1
in	1
1812,	1
never	1
once	1
swerving	1
by	1
word	1
or	1
deed	1
from	1
Borodino	1
to	1
Vilna,	1
presented	1
an	1
example	1
exceptional	1
in	1
history	1
of	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
a	1
present	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
importance	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening--	1
Kutuzov	1
seems	1
to	1
them	1
something	1
indefinite	1
and	1
pitiful,	1
and	1
when	1
speaking	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1812	1
they	1
always	1
seem	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed.	1
	1
And	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
imagine	1
an	1
historical	1
character	1
whose	1
activity	1
was	1
so	1
unswervingly	1
directed	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
aim;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
aim	1
more	1
worthy	1
or	1
more	1
consonant	1
with	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
people.	1
Still	1
more	1
difficult	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
instance	1
in	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
an	1
historical	1
personage	1
being	1
so	1
completely	1
accomplished	1
as	1
that	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
Kutuzov's	1
efforts	1
were	1
directed	1
in	1
1812.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
never	1
talked	1
of	1
"forty	1
centuries	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
Pyramids,"	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
he	1
offered	1
for	1
the	1
fatherland,	1
or	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
accomplish	1
or	1
had	1
accomplished;	1
in	1
general	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
about	1
himself,	1
adopted	1
no	1
pose,	1
always	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
ordinary	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
ordinary	1
things.	1
He	1
wrote	1
letters	1
to	1
his	1
daughters	1
and	1
to	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
read	1
novels,	1
liked	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
pretty	1
women,	1
jested	1
with	1
generals,	1
officers,	1
and	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
never	1
contradicted	1
those	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
prove	1
anything	1
to	1
him.	1
When	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
at	1
the	1
Yauza	1
bridge	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
personal	1
reproaches	1
for	1
having	1
caused	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
said:	1
"How	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
abandon	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle?"	1
Kutuzov	1
replied:	1
"And	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
abandon	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
battle,"	1
though	1
Moscow	1
was	1
then	1
already	1
abandoned.	1
When	1
Arakcheev,	1
coming	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
said	1
that	1
Ermolov	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
artillery,	1
Kutuzov	1
replied:	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
saying	1
so	1
myself,"	1
though	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary.	1
What	1
did	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
him--who	1
then	1
alone	1
amid	1
a	1
senseless	1
crowd	1
understood	1
the	1
whole	1
tremendous	1
significance	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
happening--what	1
did	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
him	1
whether	1
Rostopchin	1
attributed	1
the	1
calamities	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
to	1
himself?	1
Still	1
less	1
could	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
appointed	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
artillery.	1
	1
Not	1
merely	1
in	1
these	1
cases	1
but	1
continually	1
did	1
that	1
old	1
man--who	1
by	1
experience	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
thoughts	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
serving	1
as	1
their	1
expression	1
are	1
not	1
what	1
move	1
people--use	1
quite	1
meaningless	1
words	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
enter	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
But	1
that	1
man,	1
so	1
heedless	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
activity	1
utter	1
one	1
word	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
single	1
aim	1
toward	1
which	1
he	1
moved	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
war.	1
Obviously	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself,	1
in	1
very	1
diverse	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
expressed	1
his	1
real	1
thoughts	1
with	1
the	1
bitter	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
understood.	1
Beginning	1
with	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino,	1
from	1
which	1
time	1
his	1
disagreement	1
with	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
began,	1
he	1
alone	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
was	1
a	1
victory,	1
and	1
repeated	1
this	1
both	1
verbally	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
dispatches	1
and	1
reports	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
death.	1
He	1
alone	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Moscow	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Russia.	1
In	1
reply	1
to	1
Lauriston's	1
proposal	1
of	1
peace,	1
he	1
said:	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
peace,	1
for	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
people's	1
will.	1
He	1
alone	1
during	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
our	1
maneuvers	1
are	1
useless,	1
everything	1
is	1
being	1
accomplished	1
of	1
itself	1
better	1
than	1
we	1
could	1
desire;	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
must	1
be	1
offered	1
"a	1
golden	1
bridge";	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
Tarutino,	1
the	1
Vyazma,	1
nor	1
the	1
Krasnoe	1
battles	1
were	1
necessary;	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
keep	1
some	1
force	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
frontier	1
with,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
a	1
single	1
Russian	1
for	1
ten	1
Frenchmen.	1
	1
And	1
this	1
courtier,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
described	1
to	1
us,	1
who	1
lies	1
to	1
Arakcheev	1
to	1
please	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
he	1
alone--incurring	1
thereby	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
displeasure--said	1
in	1
Vilna	1
that	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
war	1
beyond	1
the	1
frontier	1
is	1
useless	1
and	1
harmful.	1
	1
Nor	1
do	1
words	1
alone	1
prove	1
that	1
only	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
events.	1
His	1
actions--without	1
the	1
smallest	1
deviation--were	1
all	1
directed	1
to	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
threefold	1
end:	1
(1)	1
to	1
brace	1
all	1
his	1
strength	1
for	1
conflict	1
with	1
the	1
French,	1
(2)	1
to	1
defeat	1
them,	1
and	1
(3)	1
to	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Russia,	1
minimizing	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
our	1
people	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
army.	1
	1
This	1
procrastinator	1
Kutuzov,	1
whose	1
motto	1
was	1
"Patience	1
and	1
Time,"	1
this	1
enemy	1
of	1
decisive	1
action,	1
gave	1
battle	1
at	1
Borodino,	1
investing	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
it	1
with	1
unparalleled	1
solemnity.	1
This	1
Kutuzov	1
who	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
began	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
lost,	1
he	1
alone,	1
in	1
contradiction	1
to	1
everyone	1
else,	1
declared	1
till	1
his	1
death	1
that	1
Borodino	1
was	1
a	1
victory,	1
despite	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
generals	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
lost	1
and	1
despite	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
retire	1
after	1
winning	1
a	1
battle	1
was	1
unprecedented.	1
He	1
alone	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
retreat	1
insisted	1
that	1
battles,	1
which	1
were	1
useless	1
then,	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
fought,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
war	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
begun	1
nor	1
the	1
frontiers	1
of	1
Russia	1
crossed.	1
	1
It	1
is	1
easy	1
now	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
these	1
events--if	1
only	1
we	1
abstain	1
from	1
attributing	1
to	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
aims	1
that	1
existed	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
a	1
dozen	1
individuals--for	1
the	1
events	1
and	1
results	1
now	1
lie	1
before	1
us.	1
	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
that	1
old	1
man,	1
alone,	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
opinion,	1
so	1
truly	1
discern	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
activity	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
once	1
untrue	1
to	1
it?	1
	1
The	1
source	1
of	1
that	1
extraordinary	1
power	1
of	1
penetrating	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
then	1
occuring	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
feeling	1
which	1
he	1
possessed	1
in	1
full	1
purity	1
and	1
strength.	1
	1
Only	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
possessed	1
this	1
feeling	1
caused	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
manner,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
wish,	1
to	1
select	1
him--an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
disfavor--to	1
be	1
their	1
representative	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
war.	1
And	1
only	1
that	1
feeling	1
placed	1
him	1
on	1
that	1
highest	1
human	1
pedestal	1
from	1
which	1
he,	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
devoted	1
all	1
his	1
powers	1
not	1
to	1
slaying	1
and	1
destroying	1
men	1
but	1
to	1
saving	1
and	1
showing	1
pity	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
That	1
simple,	1
modest,	1
and	1
therefore	1
truly	1
great,	1
figure	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
cast	1
in	1
the	1
false	1
mold	1
of	1
a	1
European	1
hero--the	1
supposed	1
ruler	1
of	1
men--that	1
history	1
has	1
invented.	1
	1
To	1
a	1
lackey	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
great,	1
for	1
a	1
lackey	1
has	1
his	1
own	1
conception	1
of	1
greatness.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
The	1
fifth	1
of	1
November	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Krasnoe.	1
Toward	1
evening--after	1
much	1
disputing	1
and	1
many	1
mistakes	1
made	1
by	1
generals	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
proper	1
places,	1
and	1
after	1
adjutants	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
about	1
with	1
counterorders--when	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
everywhere	1
in	1
flight	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
battle,	1
Kutuzov	1
left	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Dobroe	1
whither	1
his	1
headquarters	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
been	1
transferred.	1
	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
frosty.	1
Kutuzov	1
rode	1
to	1
Dobroe	1
on	1
his	1
plump	1
little	1
white	1
horse,	1
followed	1
by	1
an	1
enormous	1
suite	1
of	1
discontented	1
generals	1
who	1
whispered	1
among	1
themselves	1
behind	1
his	1
back.	1
All	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
groups	1
of	1
French	1
prisoners	1
captured	1
that	1
day	1
(there	1
were	1
seven	1
thousand	1
of	1
them)	1
were	1
crowding	1
to	1
warm	1
themselves	1
at	1
campfires.	1
Near	1
Dobroe	1
an	1
immense	1
crowd	1
of	1
tattered	1
prisoners,	1
buzzing	1
with	1
talk	1
and	1
wrapped	1
and	1
bandaged	1
in	1
anything	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of,	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
beside	1
a	1
long	1
row	1
of	1
unharnessed	1
French	1
guns.	1
At	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
the	1
buzz	1
of	1
talk	1
ceased	1
and	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
Kutuzov	1
who,	1
wearing	1
a	1
white	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
band	1
and	1
a	1
padded	1
overcoat	1
that	1
bulged	1
on	1
his	1
round	1
shoulders,	1
moved	1
slowly	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
on	1
his	1
white	1
horse.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
was	1
reporting	1
to	1
him	1
where	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
prisoners	1
had	1
been	1
captured.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
seemed	1
preoccupied	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
general	1
was	1
saying.	1
He	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
dissatisfied	1
look	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
attentively	1
and	1
fixedly	1
at	1
these	1
prisoners,	1
who	1
presented	1
a	1
specially	1
wretched	1
appearance.	1
Most	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
disfigured	1
by	1
frost-bitten	1
noses	1
and	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
nearly	1
all	1
had	1
red,	1
swollen	1
and	1
festering	1
eyes.	1
	1
One	1
group	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
stood	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
them,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
his	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
sores,	1
were	1
tearing	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
raw	1
flesh	1
with	1
their	1
hands.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
horrible	1
and	1
bestial	1
in	1
the	1
fleeting	1
glance	1
they	1
threw	1
at	1
the	1
riders	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
malevolent	1
expression	1
with	1
which,	1
after	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
Kutuzov,	1
the	1
soldier	1
with	1
the	1
sores	1
immediately	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
long	1
and	1
intently	1
at	1
these	1
two	1
soldiers.	1
He	1
puckered	1
his	1
face,	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
pensively	1
swayed	1
his	1
head.	1
At	1
another	1
spot	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
Russian	1
soldier	1
laughingly	1
patting	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
manner,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
again	1
swayed	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"What	1
were	1
you	1
saying?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
general,	1
who	1
continuing	1
his	1
report	1
directed	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
attention	1
to	1
some	1
standards	1
captured	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
standing	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
regiment.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
the	1
standards!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
evidently	1
detaching	1
himself	1
with	1
difficulty	1
from	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
preoccupied	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
absently.	1
Thousands	1
of	1
eyes	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
awaiting	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
He	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
regiment,	1
sighed	1
deeply,	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
suite	1
beckoned	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
carrying	1
the	1
standards	1
to	1
advance	1
and	1
surround	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
with	1
them.	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
and	1
then,	1
submitting	1
with	1
evident	1
reluctance	1
to	1
the	1
duty	1
imposed	1
by	1
his	1
position,	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
A	1
throng	1
of	1
officers	1
surrounded	1
him.	1
He	1
looked	1
attentively	1
around	1
at	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
officers,	1
recognizing	1
several	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all!"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
the	1
officers.	1
In	1
the	1
stillness	1
around	1
him	1
his	1
slowly	1
uttered	1
words	1
were	1
distinctly	1
heard.	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
hard	1
and	1
faithful	1
service.	1
The	1
victory	1
is	1
complete	1
and	1
Russia	1
will	1
not	1
forget	1
you!	1
Honor	1
to	1
you	1
forever."	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
and	1
looked	1
around.	1
	1
"Lower	1
its	1
head,	1
lower	1
it!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
accidentally	1
lowered	1
the	1
French	1
eagle	1
he	1
was	1
holding	1
before	1
the	1
Preobrazhensk	1
standards.	1
"Lower,	1
lower,	1
that's	1
it.	1
Hurrah	1
lads!"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
the	1
men	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
chin.	1
	1
"Hur-r-rah!"	1
roared	1
thousands	1
of	1
voices.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
shouting	1
Kutuzov	1
leaned	1
forward	1
in	1
his	1
saddle	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
eye	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
mild	1
and	1
apparently	1
ironic	1
gleam.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
brothers..."	1
said	1
he	1
when	1
the	1
shouts	1
had	1
ceased...	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
changed.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
speaking	1
but	1
an	1
ordinary	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
comrades	1
something	1
very	1
important.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
among	1
the	1
throng	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
moved	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
hear	1
better	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
brothers,	1
I	1
know	1
it's	1
hard	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!	1
Bear	1
up;	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
for	1
long	1
now!	1
We'll	1
see	1
our	1
visitors	1
off	1
and	1
then	1
we'll	1
rest.	1
The	1
Tsar	1
won't	1
forget	1
your	1
service.	1
It	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
still	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
while	1
they--you	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
to,"	1
said	1
he,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners.	1
"Worse	1
off	1
than	1
our	1
poorest	1
beggars.	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
strong	1
we	1
didn't	1
spare	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
may	1
even	1
pity	1
them.	1
They	1
are	1
human	1
beings	1
too.	1
Isn't	1
it	1
so,	1
lads?"	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
around,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
direct,	1
respectful,	1
wondering	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
read	1
sympathy	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said.	1
His	1
face	1
grew	1
brighter	1
and	1
brighter	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
mild	1
smile,	1
which	1
drew	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
eyes	1
into	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
wrinkles.	1
He	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
perplexity.	1
	1
"But	1
after	1
all	1
who	1
asked	1
them	1
here?	1
Serves	1
them	1
right,	1
the	1
bloody	1
bastards!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
suddenly	1
lifting	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
And	1
flourishing	1
his	1
whip	1
he	1
rode	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
broken	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
laughing	1
joyfully	1
and	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
words	1
were	1
hardly	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
troops.	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
repeated	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
address,	1
begun	1
solemnly	1
and	1
then	1
changing	1
into	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
simplehearted	1
talk;	1
but	1
the	1
hearty	1
sincerity	1
of	1
that	1
speech,	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
majestic	1
triumph	1
combined	1
with	1
pity	1
for	1
the	1
foe	1
and	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
our	1
cause,	1
exactly	1
expressed	1
by	1
that	1
old	1
man's	1
good-natured	1
expletives,	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
understood	1
but	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
every	1
soldier	1
and	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
their	1
joyous	1
and	1
long-	1
sustained	1
shouts.	1
Afterwards	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
addressed	1
Kutuzov	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
wished	1
his	1
caleche	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
for,	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
answering	1
unexpectedly	1
gave	1
a	1
sob,	1
being	1
evidently	1
greatly	1
moved.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
When	1
the	1
troops	1
reached	1
their	1
night's	1
halting	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
of	1
November,	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Krasnoe	1
battles,	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
dusk.	1
All	1
day	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
calm	1
and	1
frosty	1
with	1
occasional	1
lightly	1
falling	1
snow	1
and	1
toward	1
evening	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
clear.	1
Through	1
the	1
falling	1
snow	1
a	1
purple-black	1
and	1
starry	1
sky	1
showed	1
itself	1
and	1
the	1
frost	1
grew	1
keener.	1
	1
An	1
infantry	1
regiment	1
which	1
had	1
left	1
Tarutino	1
three	1
thousand	1
strong	1
but	1
now	1
numbered	1
only	1
nine	1
hundred	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
its	1
halting	1
place--a	1
village	1
on	1
the	1
highroad.	1
The	1
quartermasters	1
who	1
met	1
the	1
regiment	1
announced	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
huts	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
sick	1
and	1
dead	1
Frenchmen,	1
cavalrymen,	1
and	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
staff.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
hut	1
available	1
for	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
hut.	1
The	1
regiment	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
stacked	1
its	1
arms	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
huts.	1
	1
Like	1
some	1
huge	1
many-limbed	1
animal,	1
the	1
regiment	1
began	1
to	1
prepare	1
its	1
lair	1
and	1
its	1
food.	1
One	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
dispersed	1
and	1
waded	1
knee-deep	1
through	1
the	1
snow	1
into	1
a	1
birch	1
forest	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
axes	1
and	1
swords,	1
the	1
crashing	1
of	1
branches,	1
and	1
merry	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
there.	1
Another	1
section	1
amid	1
the	1
regimental	1
wagons	1
and	1
horses	1
which	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
group	1
was	1
busy	1
getting	1
out	1
caldrons	1
and	1
rye	1
biscuit,	1
and	1
feeding	1
the	1
horses.	1
A	1
third	1
section	1
scattered	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
arranging	1
quarters	1
for	1
the	1
staff	1
officers,	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
French	1
corpses	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
huts,	1
and	1
dragging	1
away	1
boards,	1
dry	1
wood,	1
and	1
thatch	1
from	1
the	1
roofs,	1
for	1
the	1
campfires,	1
or	1
wattle	1
fences	1
to	1
serve	1
for	1
shelter.	1
	1
Some	1
fifteen	1
men	1
with	1
merry	1
shouts	1
were	1
shaking	1
down	1
the	1
high	1
wattle	1
wall	1
of	1
a	1
shed,	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
removed.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
all	1
together--shove!"	1
cried	1
the	1
voices,	1
and	1
the	1
huge	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
snow	1
and	1
creaking	1
with	1
frost,	1
was	1
seen	1
swaying	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
The	1
lower	1
stakes	1
cracked	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
wall	1
fell,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
pushing	1
it.	1
Loud,	1
coarse	1
laughter	1
and	1
joyous	1
shouts	1
ensued.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
catch	1
hold	1
in	1
twos!	1
Hand	1
up	1
the	1
lever!	1
That's	1
it...	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
shoving	1
to?"	1
	1
"Now,	1
all	1
together!	1
But	1
wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
boys...	1
With	1
a	1
song!"	1
	1
All	1
stood	1
silent,	1
and	1
a	1
soft,	1
pleasant	1
velvety	1
voice	1
began	1
to	1
sing.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
verse	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
note	1
died	1
away,	1
twenty	1
voices	1
roared	1
out	1
at	1
once:	1
"Oo-oo-oo-oo!	1
That's	1
it.	1
All	1
together!	1
Heave	1
away,	1
boys!..."	1
but	1
despite	1
their	1
united	1
efforts	1
the	1
wattle	1
hardly	1
moved,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
was	1
audible.	1
	1
"Here,	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Company!	1
Devils	1
that	1
you	1
are!	1
Lend	1
a	1
hand...	1
will	1
you?	1
You	1
may	1
want	1
us	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
days."	1
	1
Some	1
twenty	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Company	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
joined	1
the	1
haulers,	1
and	1
the	1
wattle	1
wall,	1
which	1
was	1
about	1
thirty-	1
five	1
feet	1
long	1
and	1
seven	1
feet	1
high,	1
moved	1
forward	1
along	1
the	1
village	1
street,	1
swaying,	1
pressing	1
upon	1
and	1
cutting	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
gasping	1
men.	1
	1
"Get	1
along...	1
Falling?	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
stopping	1
for?	1
There	1
now..."	1
	1
Merry	1
senseless	1
words	1
of	1
abuse	1
flowed	1
freely.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
up	1
to?"	1
suddenly	1
came	1
the	1
authoritative	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
sergeant	1
major	1
who	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
hauling	1
their	1
burden.	1
"There	1
are	1
gentry	1
here;	1
the	1
general	1
himself	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
hut,	1
and	1
you	1
foul-mouthed	1
devils,	1
you	1
brutes,	1
I'll	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you!"	1
shouted	1
he,	1
hitting	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
a	1
swinging	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
back.	1
"Can't	1
you	1
make	1
less	1
noise?"	1
	1
The	1
men	1
became	1
silent.	1
The	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
groaned	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
face,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
scratched	1
till	1
it	1
bled	1
by	1
his	1
falling	1
against	1
the	1
wattle.	1
	1
"There,	1
how	1
that	1
devil	1
hits	1
out!	1
He's	1
made	1
my	1
face	1
all	1
bloody,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
whisper	1
when	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major	1
had	1
passed	1
on.	1
	1
"Don't	1
you	1
like	1
it?"	1
said	1
a	1
laughing	1
voice,	1
and	1
moderating	1
their	1
tones	1
the	1
men	1
moved	1
forward.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
they	1
began	1
talking	1
again	1
as	1
loud	1
as	1
before,	1
interlarding	1
their	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
aimless	1
expletives.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
hut	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
passed,	1
the	1
chief	1
officers	1
had	1
gathered	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
animated	1
talk	1
over	1
their	1
tea	1
about	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
maneuvers	1
suggested	1
for	1
tomorrow.	1
It	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
flank	1
march	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
Vice-King	1
(Murat)	1
and	1
capture	1
him.	1
	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
soldiers	1
had	1
dragged	1
the	1
wattle	1
fence	1
to	1
its	1
place	1
the	1
campfires	1
were	1
blazing	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
ready	1
for	1
cooking,	1
the	1
wood	1
crackled,	1
the	1
snow	1
was	1
melting,	1
and	1
black	1
shadows	1
of	1
soldiers	1
flitted	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
occupied	1
space	1
where	1
the	1
snow	1
had	1
been	1
trodden	1
down.	1
	1
Axes	1
and	1
choppers	1
were	1
plied	1
all	1
around.	1
Everything	1
was	1
done	1
without	1
any	1
orders	1
being	1
given.	1
Stores	1
of	1
wood	1
were	1
brought	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
shelters	1
were	1
rigged	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
officers,	1
caldrons	1
were	1
being	1
boiled,	1
and	1
muskets	1
and	1
accouterments	1
put	1
in	1
order.	1
	1
The	1
wattle	1
wall	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
brought	1
was	1
set	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle	1
by	1
the	1
Eighth	1
Company	1
as	1
a	1
shelter	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
propped	1
up	1
by	1
musket	1
rests,	1
and	1
a	1
campfire	1
was	1
built	1
before	1
it.	1
They	1
beat	1
the	1
tattoo,	1
called	1
the	1
roll,	1
had	1
supper,	1
and	1
settled	1
down	1
round	1
the	1
fires	1
for	1
the	1
night--some	1
repairing	1
their	1
footgear,	1
some	1
smoking	1
pipes,	1
and	1
some	1
stripping	1
themselves	1
naked	1
to	1
steam	1
the	1
lice	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
shirts.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
almost	1
incredibly	1
wretched	1
conditions	1
the	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
were	1
in	1
at	1
that	1
time--lacking	1
warm	1
boots	1
and	1
sheepskin	1
coats,	1
without	1
a	1
roof	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
with	1
eighteen	1
degrees	1
of	1
frost,	1
and	1
without	1
even	1
full	1
rations	1
(the	1
commissariat	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
troops)--they	1
would	1
have	1
presented	1
a	1
very	1
sad	1
and	1
depressing	1
spectacle.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
army	1
had	1
never	1
under	1
the	1
best	1
material	1
conditions	1
presented	1
a	1
more	1
cheerful	1
and	1
animated	1
aspect.	1
This	1
was	1
because	1
all	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
depressed	1
or	1
who	1
lost	1
strength	1
were	1
sifted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
day	1
by	1
day.	1
All	1
the	1
physically	1
or	1
morally	1
weak	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
army--physically	1
and	1
mentally--	1
remained.	1
	1
More	1
men	1
collected	1
behind	1
the	1
wattle	1
fence	1
of	1
the	1
Eighth	1
Company	1
than	1
anywhere	1
else.	1
Two	1
sergeants	1
major	1
were	1
sitting	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
campfire	1
blazed	1
brighter	1
than	1
others.	1
For	1
leave	1
to	1
sit	1
by	1
their	1
wattle	1
they	1
demanded	1
contributions	1
of	1
fuel.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
Makeev!	1
What	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
you,	1
you	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
bitch?	1
Are	1
you	1
lost	1
or	1
have	1
the	1
wolves	1
eaten	1
you?	1
Fetch	1
some	1
more	1
wood!"	1
shouted	1
a	1
red-haired	1
and	1
red-faced	1
man,	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
blinking	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
but	1
not	1
moving	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
fire.	1
"And	1
you,	1
Jackdaw,	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
some	1
wood!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
another	1
soldier.	1
	1
This	1
red-haired	1
man	1
was	1
neither	1
a	1
sergeant	1
nor	1
a	1
corporal,	1
but	1
being	1
robust	1
he	1
ordered	1
about	1
those	1
weaker	1
than	1
himself.	1
The	1
soldier	1
they	1
called	1
"Jackdaw,"	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
nose,	1
rose	1
obediently	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
the	1
slender,	1
handsome	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
carrying	1
a	1
load	1
of	1
wood.	1
	1
"Bring	1
it	1
here--that's	1
fine!"	1
	1
They	1
split	1
up	1
the	1
wood,	1
pressed	1
it	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
fire,	1
blew	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
their	1
mouths,	1
and	1
fanned	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
their	1
greatcoats,	1
making	1
the	1
flames	1
hiss	1
and	1
crackle.	1
The	1
men	1
drew	1
nearer	1
and	1
lit	1
their	1
pipes.	1
The	1
handsome	1
young	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
wood,	1
setting	1
his	1
arms	1
akimbo,	1
began	1
stamping	1
his	1
cold	1
feet	1
rapidly	1
and	1
deftly	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
stood.	1
	1
"Mother!	1
The	1
dew	1
is	1
cold	1
but	1
clear....	1
It's	1
well	1
that	1
I'm	1
a	1
musketeer..."	1
he	1
sang,	1
pretending	1
to	1
hiccough	1
after	1
each	1
syllable.	1
	1
"Look	1
out,	1
your	1
soles	1
will	1
fly	1
off!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
red-haired	1
man,	1
noticing	1
that	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
the	1
dancer's	1
boot	1
was	1
hanging	1
loose.	1
"What	1
a	1
fellow	1
you	1
are	1
for	1
dancing!"	1
	1
The	1
dancer	1
stopped,	1
pulled	1
off	1
the	1
loose	1
piece	1
of	1
leather,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"Right	1
enough,	1
friend,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and,	1
having	1
sat	1
down,	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
knapsack	1
a	1
scrap	1
of	1
blue	1
French	1
cloth,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
it	1
round	1
his	1
foot.	1
"It's	1
the	1
steam	1
that	1
spoils	1
them,"	1
he	1
added,	1
stretching	1
out	1
his	1
feet	1
toward	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"They'll	1
soon	1
be	1
issuing	1
us	1
new	1
ones.	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
when	1
we've	1
finished	1
hammering	1
them,	1
we're	1
to	1
receive	1
double	1
kits!"	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
bitch	1
Petrov	1
has	1
lagged	1
behind	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
seems,"	1
said	1
one	1
sergeant	1
major.	1
	1
"I've	1
had	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
him	1
this	1
long	1
while,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"Well,	1
he's	1
a	1
poor	1
sort	1
of	1
soldier..."	1
	1
"But	1
in	1
the	1
Third	1
Company	1
they	1
say	1
nine	1
men	1
were	1
missing	1
yesterday."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
all	1
very	1
well,	1
but	1
when	1
a	1
man's	1
feet	1
are	1
frozen	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
walk?"	1
	1
"Eh?	1
Don't	1
talk	1
nonsense!"	1
said	1
a	1
sergeant	1
major.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
the	1
same?"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
soldier,	1
turning	1
reproachfully	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
frozen	1
feet.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
sharp-nosed	1
man	1
they	1
called	1
Jackdaw	1
in	1
a	1
squeaky	1
and	1
unsteady	1
voice,	1
raising	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
"a	1
plump	1
man	1
gets	1
thin,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
thin	1
one	1
it's	1
death.	1
Take	1
me,	1
now!	1
I've	1
got	1
no	1
strength	1
left,"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
sudden	1
resolution	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major.	1
"Tell	1
them	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
hospital;	1
I'm	1
aching	1
all	1
over;	1
anyway	1
I	1
shan't	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
up."	1
	1
"That'll	1
do,	1
that'll	1
do!"	1
replied	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major	1
quietly.	1
	1
The	1
soldier	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
the	1
talk	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
those	1
Frenchies	1
were	1
taken	1
today,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
what	1
you	1
might	1
call	1
real	1
boots	1
on,"	1
said	1
a	1
soldier,	1
starting	1
a	1
new	1
theme.	1
"They	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
make-believes."	1
	1
"The	1
Cossacks	1
have	1
taken	1
their	1
boots.	1
They	1
were	1
clearing	1
the	1
hut	1
for	1
the	1
colonel	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
out.	1
It	1
was	1
pitiful	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
boys,"	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
dancer.	1
"As	1
they	1
turned	1
them	1
over	1
one	1
seemed	1
still	1
alive	1
and,	1
would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
he	1
jabbered	1
something	1
in	1
their	1
lingo."	1
	1
"But	1
they're	1
a	1
clean	1
folk,	1
lads,"	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
went	1
on;	1
"he	1
was	1
white--	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
birchbark--and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
such	1
fine	1
fellows,	1
you	1
might	1
think	1
they	1
were	1
nobles."	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
They	1
make	1
soldiers	1
of	1
all	1
classes	1
there."	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
don't	1
understand	1
our	1
talk	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
the	1
dancer	1
with	1
a	1
puzzled	1
smile.	1
"I	1
asked	1
him	1
whose	1
subject	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
he	1
jabbered	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
A	1
queer	1
lot!"	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
strange,	1
friends,"	1
continued	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
wondered	1
at	1
their	1
whiteness,	1
"the	1
peasants	1
at	1
Mozhaysk	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
began	1
burying	1
the	1
dead--where	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
you	1
know--well,	1
those	1
dead	1
had	1
been	1
lying	1
there	1
for	1
nearly	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
says	1
the	1
peasant,	1
'they	1
lie	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
paper,	1
clean,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
much	1
smell	1
as	1
a	1
puff	1
of	1
powder	1
smoke.'"	1
	1
"Was	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
cold?"	1
asked	1
someone.	1
	1
"You're	1
a	1
clever	1
fellow!	1
From	1
the	1
cold	1
indeed!	1
Why,	1
it	1
was	1
hot.	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
from	1
the	1
cold,	1
ours	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
rotted	1
either.	1
'But,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'go	1
up	1
to	1
ours	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
rotten	1
and	1
maggoty.	1
So,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'we	1
tie	1
our	1
faces	1
up	1
with	1
kerchiefs	1
and	1
turn	1
our	1
heads	1
away	1
as	1
we	1
drag	1
them	1
off:	1
we	1
can	1
hardly	1
do	1
it.	1
But	1
theirs,'	1
he	1
says,	1
'are	1
white	1
as	1
paper	1
and	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
smell	1
as	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
gunpowder.'"	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
from	1
their	1
food,"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major.	1
"They	1
used	1
to	1
gobble	1
the	1
same	1
food	1
as	1
the	1
gentry."	1
	1
No	1
one	1
contradicted	1
him.	1
	1
"That	1
peasant	1
near	1
Mozhaysk	1
where	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
said	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
all	1
called	1
up	1
from	1
ten	1
villages	1
around	1
and	1
they	1
carted	1
for	1
twenty	1
days	1
and	1
still	1
didn't	1
finish	1
carting	1
the	1
dead	1
away.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
wolves,	1
he	1
says..."	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
battle,"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
soldier.	1
"It's	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
worth	1
remembering;	1
but	1
since	1
that...	1
it's	1
only	1
been	1
tormenting	1
folk."	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
Daddy,	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
we	1
ran	1
at	1
them	1
and,	1
my	1
word,	1
they	1
didn't	1
let	1
us	1
get	1
near	1
before	1
they	1
just	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
muskets	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
knees.	1
'Pardon!'	1
they	1
say.	1
That's	1
only	1
one	1
case.	1
They	1
say	1
Platov	1
took	1
'Poleon	1
himself	1
twice.	1
But	1
he	1
didn't	1
know	1
the	1
right	1
charm.	1
He	1
catches	1
him	1
and	1
catches	1
him--no	1
good!	1
He	1
turns	1
into	1
a	1
bird	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
flies	1
away.	1
And	1
there's	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
killing	1
him	1
either."	1
	1
"You're	1
a	1
first-class	1
liar,	1
Kiselev,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
you!"	1
	1
"Liar,	1
indeed!	1
It's	1
the	1
real	1
truth."	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
my	1
hands,	1
when	1
I'd	1
caught	1
him	1
I'd	1
bury	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
an	1
aspen	1
stake	1
to	1
fix	1
him	1
down.	1
What	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
men	1
he's	1
ruined!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
anyhow	1
we're	1
going	1
to	1
end	1
it.	1
He	1
won't	1
come	1
here	1
again,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
old	1
soldier,	1
yawning.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
flagged,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
began	1
settling	1
down	1
to	1
sleep.	1
	1
"Look	1
at	1
the	1
stars.	1
It's	1
wonderful	1
how	1
they	1
shine!	1
You	1
would	1
think	1
the	1
women	1
had	1
spread	1
out	1
their	1
linen,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men,	1
gazing	1
with	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
harvest	1
next	1
year."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
want	1
some	1
more	1
wood."	1
	1
"You	1
warm	1
your	1
back	1
and	1
your	1
belly	1
gets	1
frozen.	1
That's	1
queer."	1
	1
"O	1
Lord!"	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
pushing	1
for?	1
Is	1
the	1
fire	1
only	1
for	1
you?	1
Look	1
how	1
he's	1
sprawling!"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
ensued,	1
the	1
snoring	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Others	1
turned	1
over	1
and	1
warmed	1
themselves,	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
exchanging	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
From	1
a	1
campfire	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces	1
off	1
came	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
general,	1
merry	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Hark	1
at	1
them	1
roaring	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
Fifth	1
Company!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
"and	1
what	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
them	1
there	1
are!"	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Fifth	1
Company.	1
	1
"They're	1
having	1
such	1
fun,"	1
said	1
he,	1
coming	1
back.	1
"Two	1
Frenchies	1
have	1
turned	1
up.	1
One's	1
quite	1
frozen	1
and	1
the	1
other's	1
an	1
awful	1
swaggerer.	1
He's	1
singing	1
songs...."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I'll	1
go	1
across	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
look...."	1
	1
And	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Fifth	1
Company.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
fifth	1
company	1
was	1
bivouacking	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
A	1
huge	1
campfire	1
was	1
blazing	1
brightly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
snow,	1
lighting	1
up	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
trees	1
heavy	1
with	1
hoarfrost.	1
	1
About	1
midnight	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
the	1
crackling	1
of	1
dry	1
branches.	1
	1
"A	1
bear,	1
lads,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
raised	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
listen,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
into	1
the	1
bright	1
firelight	1
stepped	1
two	1
strangely	1
clad	1
human	1
figures	1
clinging	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
These	1
were	1
two	1
Frenchmen	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
forest.	1
They	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
hoarsely	1
uttering	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
language	1
our	1
soldiers	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
One	1
was	1
taller	1
than	1
the	1
other;	1
he	1
wore	1
an	1
officer's	1
hat	1
and	1
seemed	1
quite	1
exhausted.	1
On	1
approaching	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
to	1
sit	1
down,	1
but	1
fell.	1
The	1
other,	1
a	1
short	1
sturdy	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
shawl	1
tied	1
round	1
his	1
head,	1
was	1
stronger.	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
companion	1
and	1
said	1
something,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
mouth.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
surrounded	1
the	1
Frenchmen,	1
spread	1
a	1
greatcoat	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
the	1
sick	1
man,	1
and	1
brought	1
some	1
buckwheat	1
porridge	1
and	1
vodka	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
exhausted	1
French	1
officer	1
was	1
Ramballe	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
wrapped	1
in	1
the	1
shawl	1
was	1
Morel,	1
his	1
orderly.	1
	1
When	1
Morel	1
had	1
drunk	1
some	1
vodka	1
and	1
finished	1
his	1
bowl	1
of	1
porridge	1
he	1
suddenly	1
became	1
unnaturally	1
merry	1
and	1
chattered	1
incessantly	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
him.	1
Ramballe	1
refused	1
food	1
and	1
resting	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
lay	1
silent	1
beside	1
the	1
campfire,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Russian	1
soldiers	1
with	1
red	1
and	1
vacant	1
eyes.	1
Occasionally	1
he	1
emitted	1
a	1
long-drawn	1
groan	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
became	1
silent.	1
Morel,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
tried	1
to	1
impress	1
on	1
the	1
soldiers	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Ramballe	1
was	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
warmed.	1
A	1
Russian	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
sent	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
colonel	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
into	1
his	1
hut	1
to	1
warm	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
messenger	1
returned	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
colonel	1
wished	1
the	1
officer	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
him,	1
Ramballe	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
go.	1
He	1
rose	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
walk,	1
but	1
staggered	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
soldier	1
standing	1
by	1
held	1
him	1
up.	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
do	1
it	1
again,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
winking	1
and	1
turning	1
mockingly	1
to	1
Ramballe.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
fool!	1
Why	1
talk	1
rubbish,	1
lout	1
that	1
you	1
are--a	1
real	1
peasant!"	1
came	1
rebukes	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
jesting	1
soldier.	1
	1
They	1
surrounded	1
Ramballe,	1
lifted	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
crossed	1
arms	1
of	1
two	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
hut.	1
Ramballe	1
put	1
his	1
arms	1
around	1
their	1
necks	1
while	1
they	1
carried	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
wailing	1
plaintively:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
fine	1
fellows,	1
my	1
kind,	1
kind	1
friends!	1
These	1
are	1
men!	1
Oh,	1
my	1
brave,	1
kind	1
friends,"	1
and	1
he	1
leaned	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
like	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Morel	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
	1
Morel,	1
a	1
short	1
sturdy	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
inflamed	1
and	1
streaming	1
eyes,	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
woman's	1
cloak	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
shawl	1
tied	1
woman	1
fashion	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
over	1
his	1
cap.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
tipsy,	1
and	1
was	1
singing	1
a	1
French	1
song	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
broken	1
voice,	1
with	1
an	1
arm	1
thrown	1
round	1
the	1
nearest	1
soldier.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
simply	1
held	1
their	1
sides	1
as	1
they	1
watched	1
him.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
now	1
then,	1
teach	1
us	1
how	1
it	1
goes!	1
I'll	1
soon	1
pick	1
it	1
up.	1
How	1
is	1
it?"	1
said	1
the	1
man--a	1
singer	1
and	1
a	1
wag--whom	1
Morel	1
was	1
embracing.	1
	1
"Vive	1
Henri	1
Quatre!	1
Vive	1
ce	1
roi	1
valiant!"	1
sang	1
Morel,	1
winking.	1
"Ce	1
diable	1
a	1
quatre..."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Long	1
live	1
Henry	1
the	1
Fourth,	1
that	1
valiant	1
king!	1
That	1
rowdy	1
devil."	1
	1
"Vivarika!	1
Vif-seruvaru!	1
Sedyablyaka!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
soldier,	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
really	1
catching	1
the	1
tune.	1
	1
"Bravo!	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
rose	1
their	1
rough,	1
joyous	1
laughter	1
from	1
all	1
sides.	1
	1
Morel,	1
wrinkling	1
up	1
his	1
face,	1
laughed	1
too.	1
	1
"Well,	1
go	1
on,	1
go	1
on!"	1
	1
	1
"Qui	1
eut	1
le	1
triple	1
talent,	1
De	1
boire,	1
de	1
battre,	1
Et	1
d'etre	1
un	1
vert	1
galant."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
Who	1
had	1
a	1
triple	1
talent	1
For	1
drinking,	1
for	1
fighting,	1
And	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
gallant	1
old	1
boy...	1
	1
"It	1
goes	1
smoothly,	1
too.	1
Well,	1
now,	1
Zaletaev!"	1
	1
"Ke..."	1
Zaletaev,	1
brought	1
out	1
with	1
effort:	1
"ke-e-e-e,"	1
he	1
drawled,	1
laboriously	1
pursing	1
his	1
lips,	1
"le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba,	1
e	1
de-tra-va-	1
ga-la"	1
he	1
sang.	1
	1
"Fine!	1
Just	1
like	1
the	1
Frenchie!	1
Oh,	1
ho	1
ho!	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
some	1
more	1
to	1
eat?"	1
	1
"Give	1
him	1
some	1
porridge:	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
filled	1
up	1
after	1
starving."	1
	1
They	1
gave	1
him	1
some	1
more	1
porridge	1
and	1
Morel	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
third	1
bowl.	1
All	1
the	1
young	1
soldiers	1
smiled	1
gaily	1
as	1
they	1
watched	1
him.	1
The	1
older	1
men,	1
who	1
thought	1
it	1
undignified	1
to	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
with	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
continued	1
to	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
but	1
one	1
would	1
occasionally	1
raise	1
himself	1
on	1
an	1
elbow	1
and	1
glance	1
at	1
Morel	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
men	1
too,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
wrapped	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
coat.	1
"Even	1
wormwood	1
grows	1
on	1
its	1
own	1
root."	1
	1
"O	1
Lord,	1
O	1
Lord!	1
How	1
starry	1
it	1
is!	1
Tremendous!	1
That	1
means	1
a	1
hard	1
frost...."	1
	1
They	1
all	1
grew	1
silent.	1
The	1
stars,	1
as	1
if	1
knowing	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
them,	1
began	1
to	1
disport	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
sky:	1
now	1
flaring	1
up,	1
now	1
vanishing,	1
now	1
trembling,	1
they	1
were	1
busy	1
whispering	1
something	1
gladsome	1
and	1
mysterious	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
The	1
French	1
army	1
melted	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
uniform	1
rate	1
of	1
a	1
mathematical	1
progression;	1
and	1
that	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina	1
about	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
written	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
intermediate	1
stage	1
in	1
its	1
destruction,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
decisive	1
episode	1
of	1
the	1
campaign.	1
If	1
so	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
and	1
still	1
is	1
written	1
about	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
on	1
the	1
French	1
side	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
at	1
the	1
broken	1
bridge	1
across	1
that	1
river	1
the	1
calamities	1
their	1
army	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
enduring	1
were	1
suddenly	1
concentrated	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
into	1
a	1
tragic	1
spectacle	1
that	1
remained	1
in	1
every	1
memory,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
Russian	1
side	1
merely	1
because	1
in	1
Petersburg--far	1
from	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
war--a	1
plan	1
(again	1
one	1
of	1
Pfuel's)	1
had	1
been	1
devised	1
to	1
catch	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
a	1
strategic	1
trap	1
at	1
the	1
Berezina	1
River.	1
Everyone	1
assured	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
happen	1
according	1
to	1
plan,	1
and	1
therefore	1
insisted	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina	1
that	1
destroyed	1
the	1
French	1
army.	1
In	1
reality	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
crossing	1
were	1
much	1
less	1
disastrous	1
to	1
the	1
French--in	1
guns	1
and	1
men	1
lost--than	1
Krasnoe	1
had	1
been,	1
as	1
the	1
figures	1
show.	1
	1
The	1
sole	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
plainly	1
and	1
indubitably	1
proved	1
the	1
fallacy	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
plans	1
for	1
cutting	1
off	1
the	1
enemy's	1
retreat	1
and	1
the	1
soundness	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
possible	1
line	1
of	1
action--the	1
one	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
demanded--namely,	1
simply	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
enemy	1
up.	1
The	1
French	1
crowd	1
fled	1
at	1
a	1
continually	1
increasing	1
speed	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
energy	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
reaching	1
its	1
goal.	1
It	1
fled	1
like	1
a	1
wounded	1
animal	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
block	1
its	1
path.	1
This	1
was	1
shown	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
arrangements	1
it	1
made	1
for	1
crossing	1
as	1
by	1
what	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
bridges.	1
When	1
the	1
bridges	1
broke	1
down,	1
unarmed	1
soldiers,	1
people	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
women	1
with	1
children	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
transport,	1
all--carried	1
on	1
by	1
vis	1
inertiae--	1
pressed	1
forward	1
into	1
boats	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
ice-covered	1
water	1
and	1
did	1
not,	1
surrender.	1
	1
That	1
impulse	1
was	1
reasonable.	1
The	1
condition	1
of	1
fugitives	1
and	1
of	1
pursuers	1
was	1
equally	1
bad.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
remained	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
people	1
each	1
might	1
hope	1
for	1
help	1
from	1
his	1
fellows	1
and	1
the	1
definite	1
place	1
he	1
held	1
among	1
them.	1
But	1
those	1
who	1
surrendered,	1
while	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pitiful	1
plight,	1
would	1
be	1
on	1
a	1
lower	1
level	1
to	1
claim	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
life.	1
The	1
French	1
did	1
not	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
half	1
the	1
prisoners--with	1
whom	1
the	1
Russians	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do-	1
-perished	1
of	1
cold	1
and	1
hunger	1
despite	1
their	1
captors'	1
desire	1
to	1
save	1
them;	1
they	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise.	1
The	1
most	1
compassionate	1
Russian	1
commanders,	1
those	1
favorable	1
to	1
the	1
French--and	1
even	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
service--could	1
do	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
prisoners.	1
The	1
French	1
perished	1
from	1
the	1
conditions	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
itself	1
exposed.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
take	1
bread	1
and	1
clothes	1
from	1
our	1
hungry	1
and	1
indispensable	1
soldiers	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
who,	1
though	1
not	1
harmful,	1
or	1
hated,	1
or	1
guilty,	1
were	1
simply	1
unnecessary.	1
Some	1
Russians	1
even	1
did	1
that,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
exceptions.	1
	1
Certain	1
destruction	1
lay	1
behind	1
the	1
French	1
but	1
in	1
front	1
there	1
was	1
hope.	1
Their	1
ships	1
had	1
been	1
burned,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
salvation	1
save	1
in	1
collective	1
flight,	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
was	1
concentrated.	1
	1
The	1
farther	1
they	1
fled	1
the	1
more	1
wretched	1
became	1
the	1
plight	1
of	1
the	1
remnant,	1
especially	1
after	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
on	1
which	1
(in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
plan)	1
special	1
hopes	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
by	1
the	1
Russians,	1
and	1
the	1
keener	1
grew	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commanders,	1
who	1
blamed	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
most	1
of	1
all.	1
Anticipation	1
that	1
the	1
failure	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
Berezina	1
plan	1
would	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
led	1
to	1
dissatisfaction,	1
contempt,	1
and	1
ridicule,	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
strongly	1
expressed.	1
The	1
ridicule	1
and	1
contempt	1
were	1
of	1
course	1
expressed	1
in	1
a	1
respectful	1
form,	1
making	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
wherein	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
seriously	1
to	1
him;	1
when	1
reporting	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
asking	1
for	1
his	1
sanction	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilling	1
a	1
regrettable	1
formality,	1
but	1
they	1
winked	1
behind	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
mislead	1
him	1
at	1
every	1
turn.	1
	1
Because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
assumed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
grasp	1
the	1
profundity	1
of	1
their	1
plans,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
answer	1
with	1
his	1
phrases	1
(which	1
they	1
thought	1
were	1
mere	1
phrases)	1
about	1
a	1
"golden	1
bridge,"	1
about	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
crossing	1
the	1
frontier	1
with	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
tatterdemalions,	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
They	1
had	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
before.	1
And	1
all	1
he	1
said--that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
await	1
provisions,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
no	1
boots--was	1
so	1
simple,	1
while	1
what	1
they	1
proposed	1
was	1
so	1
complicated	1
and	1
clever,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
stupid	1
and	1
that	1
they,	1
though	1
not	1
in	1
power,	1
were	1
commanders	1
of	1
genius.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
junction	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
brilliant	1
admiral	1
and	1
Petersburg	1
hero	1
Wittgenstein,	1
this	1
mood	1
and	1
the	1
gossip	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
reached	1
their	1
maximum.	1
Kutuzov	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
merely	1
sighed	1
and	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Only	1
once,	1
after	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
did	1
he	1
get	1
angry	1
and	1
write	1
to	1
Bennigsen	1
(who	1
reported	1
separately	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor)	1
the	1
following	1
letter:	1
	1
"On	1
account	1
of	1
your	1
spells	1
of	1
ill	1
health,	1
will	1
your	1
excellency	1
please	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Kaluga	1
on	1
receipt	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
there	1
await	1
further	1
commands	1
and	1
appointments	1
from	1
His	1
Imperial	1
Majesty."	1
	1
But	1
after	1
Bennigsen's	1
departure,	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
Tsarevich	1
Constantine	1
Pavlovich	1
joined	1
the	1
army.	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
but	1
had	1
subsequently	1
been	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
by	1
Kutuzov.	1
Now	1
having	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
he	1
informed	1
Kutuzov	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
displeasure	1
at	1
the	1
poor	1
success	1
of	1
our	1
forces	1
and	1
the	1
slowness	1
of	1
their	1
advance.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
intended	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army	1
personally	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days'	1
time.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man,	1
experienced	1
in	1
court	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
military	1
affairs--this	1
same	1
Kutuzov	1
who	1
in	1
August	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
commander-in-chief	1
against	1
the	1
sovereign's	1
wishes	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
removed	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
and	1
heir--	1
apparent	1
from	1
the	1
army--who	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
authority	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
will	1
had	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
now	1
realized	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
his	1
day	1
was	1
over,	1
that	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
played,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
he	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
hold	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
his.	1
And	1
he	1
understood	1
this	1
not	1
merely	1
from	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
court.	1
He	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
that	1
the	1
military	1
business	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
played	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
ended	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
mission	1
was	1
accomplished;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
physical	1
weariness	1
of	1
his	1
aged	1
body	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
physical	1
rest.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-ninth	1
of	1
November	1
Kutuzov	1
entered	1
Vilna--his	1
"dear	1
Vilna"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it.	1
Twice	1
during	1
his	1
career	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
been	1
governor	1
of	1
Vilna.	1
In	1
that	1
wealthy	1
town,	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
injured,	1
he	1
found	1
old	1
friends	1
and	1
associations,	1
besides	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
deprived.	1
And	1
he	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
army	1
and	1
state	1
and,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
passions	1
that	1
seethed	1
around	1
him	1
allowed,	1
immersed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
quiet	1
life	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
accustomed,	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
history	1
did	1
not	1
concern	1
him	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
Chichagov,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
zealous	1
"cutters-off"	1
and	1
"breakers-up,"	1
who	1
had	1
first	1
wanted	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
diversion	1
in	1
Greece	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
Warsaw	1
but	1
never	1
wished	1
to	1
go	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
sent:	1
Chichagov,	1
noted	1
for	1
the	1
boldness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
who	1
considered	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
an	1
obligation	1
to	1
him	1
because	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
make	1
peace	1
with	1
Turkey	1
in	1
1811	1
independently	1
of	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
peace	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
concluded,	1
he	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
that	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
securing	1
that	1
peace	1
was	1
really	1
Kutuzov's;	1
this	1
Chichagov	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
meet	1
Kutuzov	1
at	1
the	1
castle	1
where	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
to	1
stay.	1
In	1
undress	1
naval	1
uniform,	1
with	1
a	1
dirk,	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
cap	1
under	1
his	1
arm,	1
he	1
handed	1
Kutuzov	1
a	1
garrison	1
report	1
and	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
The	1
contemptuously	1
respectful	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
dotage	1
was	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
by	1
the	1
behavior	1
of	1
Chichagov,	1
who	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
accusations	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
directed	1
against	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
When	1
speaking	1
to	1
Chichagov,	1
Kutuzov	1
incidentally	1
mentioned	1
that	1
the	1
vehicles	1
packed	1
with	1
china	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
from	1
him	1
at	1
Borisov	1
had	1
been	1
recovered	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
mean	1
to	1
imply	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
out	1
of....	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
can	1
supply	1
you	1
with	1
everything	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
give	1
dinner	1
parties,"	1
warmly	1
replied	1
Chichagov,	1
who	1
tried	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
prove	1
his	1
own	1
rectitude	1
and	1
therefore	1
imagined	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
be	1
animated	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
desire.	1
	1
Kutuzov,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
replied	1
with	1
his	1
subtle	1
penetrating	1
smile:	1
"I	1
meant	1
merely	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
said."	1
	1
Contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
wish	1
Kutuzov	1
detained	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
Vilna.	1
Those	1
about	1
him	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
extraordinarily	1
slack	1
and	1
physically	1
feeble	1
during	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
that	1
town.	1
He	1
attended	1
to	1
army	1
affairs	1
reluctantly,	1
left	1
everything	1
to	1
his	1
generals,	1
and	1
while	1
awaiting	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival	1
led	1
a	1
dissipated	1
life.	1
	1
Having	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
of	1
December	1
with	1
his	1
suite--Count	1
Tolstoy,	1
Prince	1
Volkonski,	1
Arakcheev,	1
and	1
others--the	1
Emperor	1
reached	1
Vilna	1
on	1
the	1
eleventh,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
traveling	1
sleigh	1
drove	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
castle.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
severe	1
frost	1
some	1
hundred	1
generals	1
and	1
staff	1
officers	1
in	1
full	1
parade	1
uniform	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
guard	1
of	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment.	1
	1
A	1
courier	1
who	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
castle	1
in	1
advance,	1
in	1
a	1
troyka	1
with	1
three	1
foam-flecked	1
horses,	1
shouted	1
"Coming!"	1
and	1
Konovnitsyn	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
vestibule	1
to	1
inform	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
porter's	1
little	1
lodge.	1
	1
A	1
minute	1
later	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
large	1
stout	1
figure	1
in	1
full-dress	1
uniform,	1
his	1
chest	1
covered	1
with	1
orders	1
and	1
a	1
scarf	1
drawn	1
round	1
his	1
stomach,	1
waddled	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
hat	1
with	1
its	1
peaks	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
and,	1
holding	1
his	1
gloves	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
walking	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
sideways	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
took	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
report	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
and	1
whispering;	1
another	1
troyka	1
flew	1
furiously	1
up,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
turned	1
on	1
an	1
approaching	1
sleigh	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
Volkonski	1
could	1
already	1
be	1
descried.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
fifty	1
years	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
a	1
physically	1
agitating	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
general.	1
He	1
carefully	1
and	1
hastily	1
felt	1
himself	1
all	1
over,	1
readjusted	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
pulling	1
himself	1
together	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
having	1
alighted	1
from	1
the	1
sleigh,	1
lifted	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
him,	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
in	1
his	1
smooth,	1
ingratiating	1
voice.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
scanned	1
Kutuzov	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
frowned	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
but	1
immediately	1
mastering	1
himself	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
extended	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
embraced	1
him.	1
And	1
this	1
embrace	1
too,	1
owing	1
to	1
a	1
long-standing	1
impression	1
related	1
to	1
his	1
innermost	1
feelings,	1
had	1
its	1
usual	1
effect	1
on	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
sob.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
greeted	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
the	1
Semenov	1
guard,	1
and	1
again	1
pressing	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
hand	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
When	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
the	1
Emperor	1
expressed	1
his	1
dissatisfaction	1
at	1
the	1
slowness	1
of	1
the	1
pursuit	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
mistakes	1
made	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
and	1
the	1
Berezina,	1
and	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
intentions	1
for	1
a	1
future	1
campaign	1
abroad.	1
Kutuzov	1
made	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
or	1
remark.	1
The	1
same	1
submissive,	1
expressionless	1
look	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
commands	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
seven	1
years	1
before	1
settled	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
now.	1
	1
When	1
Kutuzov	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
with	1
lowered	1
head	1
was	1
crossing	1
the	1
ballroom	1
with	1
his	1
heavy	1
waddling	1
gait,	1
he	1
was	1
arrested	1
by	1
someone's	1
voice	1
saying:	1
	1
"Your	1
Serene	1
Highness!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Count	1
Tolstoy,	1
who	1
stood	1
before	1
him	1
holding	1
a	1
silver	1
salver	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
a	1
small	1
object.	1
Kutuzov	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
remember;	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
flashed	1
across	1
his	1
puffy	1
face,	1
and	1
bowing	1
low	1
and	1
respectfully	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
object	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
salver.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Class.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
field	1
marshal	1
gave	1
a	1
dinner	1
and	1
ball	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
honored	1
by	1
his	1
presence.	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Class	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
highest	1
honors,	1
but	1
everyone	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
imperial	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
him.	1
The	1
proprieties	1
were	1
observed	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
set	1
that	1
example,	1
but	1
everybody	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
blameworthy	1
and	1
good-for-	1
nothing.	1
When	1
Kutuzov,	1
conforming	1
to	1
a	1
custom	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
day,	1
ordered	1
the	1
standards	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
to	1
be	1
lowered	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
feet	1
on	1
his	1
entering	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
made	1
a	1
wry	1
face	1
and	1
muttered	1
something	1
in	1
which	1
some	1
people	1
caught	1
the	1
words,	1
"the	1
old	1
comedian."	1
	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
displeasure	1
with	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
specially	1
increased	1
at	1
Vilna	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
evidently	1
could	1
not	1
or	1
would	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
campaign.	1
	1
When	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
morning	1
the	1
Emperor	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
assembled	1
about	1
him:	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
only	1
saved	1
Russia,	1
you	1
have	1
saved	1
Europe!"	1
they	1
all	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
not	1
ended.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
alone	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
this	1
and	1
openly	1
expressed	1
his	1
opinion	1
that	1
no	1
fresh	1
war	1
could	1
improve	1
the	1
position	1
or	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Russia,	1
but	1
could	1
only	1
spoil	1
and	1
lower	1
the	1
glorious	1
position	1
that	1
Russia	1
had	1
gained.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
levying	1
fresh	1
troops,	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
hardships	1
already	1
endured	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
failure	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
	1
This	1
being	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
was	1
naturally	1
regarded	1
as	1
merely	1
a	1
hindrance	1
and	1
obstacle	1
to	1
the	1
impending	1
war.	1
	1
To	1
avoid	1
unpleasant	1
encounters	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
the	1
natural	1
method	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
Austerlitz	1
and	1
with	1
Barclay	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
campaign--to	1
transfer	1
the	1
authority	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself,	1
thus	1
cutting	1
the	1
ground	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief's	1
feet	1
without	1
upsetting	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
by	1
informing	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
change.	1
	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
his	1
staff	1
was	1
gradually	1
reconstructed	1
and	1
its	1
real	1
strength	1
removed	1
and	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Toll,	1
Konovnitsyn,	1
and	1
Ermolov	1
received	1
fresh	1
appointments.	1
Everyone	1
spoke	1
loudly	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
marshal's	1
great	1
weakness	1
and	1
failing	1
health.	1
	1
His	1
health	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
bad	1
for	1
his	1
place	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
another.	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
his	1
health	1
was	1
poor.	1
	1
So	1
naturally,	1
simply,	1
and	1
gradually--just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Turkey	1
to	1
the	1
Treasury	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
recruit	1
the	1
militia,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
needed	1
there--now	1
when	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
played	1
out,	1
Kutuzov's	1
place	1
was	1
taken	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
necessary	1
performer.	1
	1
The	1
war	1
of	1
1812,	1
besides	1
its	1
national	1
significance	1
dear	1
to	1
every	1
Russian	1
heart,	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
assume	1
another,	1
a	1
European,	1
significance.	1
	1
The	1
movement	1
of	1
peoples	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
succeeded	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
peoples	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
fresh	1
war	1
another	1
leader	1
was	1
necessary,	1
having	1
qualities	1
and	1
views	1
differing	1
from	1
Kutuzov's	1
and	1
animated	1
by	1
different	1
motives.	1
	1
Alexander	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
refixing	1
of	1
national	1
frontiers	1
as	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
salvation	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
Europe,	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power,	1
or	1
Napoleon	1
meant.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
For	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people,	1
after	1
the	1
enemy	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
and	1
Russia	1
had	1
been	1
liberated	1
and	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
her	1
glory,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
left	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
a	1
Russian.	1
Nothing	1
remained	1
for	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
war	1
but	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
died.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
As	1
generally	1
happens,	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
full	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
physical	1
privation	1
and	1
strain	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
as	1
prisoner	1
until	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
over.	1
After	1
his	1
liberation	1
he	1
reached	1
Orel,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
there,	1
when	1
preparing	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Kiev,	1
he	1
fell	1
ill	1
and	1
was	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
three	1
months.	1
He	1
had	1
what	1
the	1
doctors	1
termed	1
"bilious	1
fever."	1
But	1
despite	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
doctors	1
treated	1
him,	1
bled	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
medicines	1
to	1
drink,	1
he	1
recovered.	1
	1
Scarcely	1
any	1
impression	1
was	1
left	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
mind	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
rescue	1
till	1
his	1
illness.	1
He	1
remembered	1
only	1
the	1
dull	1
gray	1
weather	1
now	1
rainy	1
and	1
now	1
snowy,	1
internal	1
physical	1
distress,	1
and	1
pains	1
in	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
side.	1
He	1
remembered	1
a	1
general	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
sufferings	1
of	1
people	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
worried	1
by	1
the	1
curiosity	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
generals	1
who	1
questioned	1
him,	1
he	1
also	1
remembered	1
his	1
difficulty	1
in	1
procuring	1
a	1
conveyance	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
incapacity	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
feel	1
all	1
that	1
time.	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
rescue	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Petya	1
Rostov.	1
That	1
same	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
after	1
surviving	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Borodino	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
month	1
had	1
recently	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
house	1
at	1
Yaroslavl,	1
and	1
Denisov	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
this	1
news	1
also	1
mentioned	1
Helene's	1
death,	1
supposing	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
long	1
before.	1
All	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
seemed	1
merely	1
strange	1
to	1
Pierre:	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
grasp	1
its	1
significance.	1
Just	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
places	1
where	1
people	1
were	1
killing	1
one	1
another,	1
to	1
some	1
peaceful	1
refuge	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
recover	1
himself,	1
rest,	1
and	1
think	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
strange	1
new	1
facts	1
he	1
had	1
learned;	1
but	1
on	1
reaching	1
Orel	1
he	1
immediately	1
fell	1
ill.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
after	1
his	1
illness	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
him	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
Terenty	1
and	1
Vaska,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Moscow;	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
cousin	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
on	1
his	1
estate	1
at	1
Elets	1
and	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
rescue	1
and	1
illness	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
gradually	1
during	1
his	1
convalescence	1
that	1
Pierre	1
lost	1
the	1
impressions	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
accustomed	1
to	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
months	1
and	1
got	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere	1
tomorrow,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
warm	1
bed,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
dinner,	1
tea,	1
and	1
supper.	1
But	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
dreams	1
he	1
still	1
saw	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
captivity.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
after	1
his	1
rescue,	1
about	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
A	1
joyous	1
feeling	1
of	1
freedom--that	1
complete	1
inalienable	1
freedom	1
natural	1
to	1
man	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
experienced	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
halt	1
outside	1
Moscow--	1
filled	1
Pierre's	1
soul	1
during	1
his	1
convalescence.	1
He	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
this	1
inner	1
freedom,	1
which	1
was	1
independent	1
of	1
external	1
conditions,	1
now	1
had	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
an	1
additional	1
setting	1
of	1
external	1
liberty.	1
He	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
town,	1
without	1
acquaintances.	1
No	1
one	1
demanded	1
anything	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
sent	1
him	1
anywhere.	1
He	1
had	1
all	1
he	1
wanted:	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
continual	1
torment	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there,	1
since	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
good!	1
How	1
splendid!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself	1
when	1
a	1
cleanly	1
laid	1
table	1
was	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
savory	1
beef	1
tea,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
a	1
soft	1
clean	1
bed,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
no	1
more.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
good,	1
how	1
splendid!"	1
	1
And	1
by	1
old	1
habit	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
the	1
question:	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
then?	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
And	1
he	1
immediately	1
gave	1
himself	1
the	1
answer:	1
"Well,	1
I	1
shall	1
live.	1
Ah,	1
how	1
splendid!"	1
	1
The	1
very	1
question	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
tormented	1
him,	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
had	1
continually	1
sought	1
to	1
find--the	1
aim	1
of	1
life--no	1
longer	1
existed	1
for	1
him	1
now.	1
That	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
disappeared	1
temporarily--he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
no	1
longer	1
existed	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
present	1
itself	1
again.	1
And	1
this	1
very	1
absence	1
of	1
an	1
aim	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
complete,	1
joyous	1
sense	1
of	1
freedom	1
which	1
constituted	1
his	1
happiness	1
at	1
this	1
time.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
an	1
aim,	1
for	1
he	1
now	1
had	1
faith--not	1
faith	1
in	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
rule,	1
or	1
words,	1
or	1
ideas,	1
but	1
faith	1
in	1
an	1
ever-living,	1
ever-manifest	1
God.	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
sought	1
Him	1
in	1
aims	1
he	1
set	1
himself.	1
That	1
search	1
for	1
an	1
aim	1
had	1
been	1
simply	1
a	1
search	1
for	1
God,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
in	1
his	1
captivity	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
not	1
by	1
words	1
or	1
reasoning	1
but	1
by	1
direct	1
feeling	1
what	1
his	1
nurse	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
long	1
ago:	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
here	1
and	1
everywhere.	1
In	1
his	1
captivity	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
in	1
Karataev	1
God	1
was	1
greater,	1
more	1
infinite	1
and	1
unfathomable	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
Architect	1
of	1
the	1
Universe	1
recognized	1
by	1
the	1
Freemasons.	1
He	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
after	1
straining	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
see	1
into	1
the	1
far	1
distance	1
finds	1
what	1
he	1
sought	1
at	1
his	1
very	1
feet.	1
All	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
around	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
merely	1
looked	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
without	1
straining	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
past	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
great	1
inscrutable	1
infinite	1
something.	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
exist	1
somewhere	1
and	1
had	1
looked	1
for	1
it.	1
In	1
everything	1
near	1
and	1
comprehensible	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
what	1
was	1
limited,	1
petty,	1
commonplace,	1
and	1
senseless.	1
He	1
had	1
equipped	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
mental	1
telescope	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
remote	1
space,	1
where	1
petty	1
worldliness	1
hiding	1
itself	1
in	1
misty	1
distance	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
great	1
and	1
infinite	1
merely	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
clearly	1
seen.	1
And	1
such	1
had	1
European	1
life,	1
politics,	1
Freemasonry,	1
philosophy,	1
and	1
philanthropy	1
seemed	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
even	1
then,	1
at	1
moments	1
of	1
weakness	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
accounted	1
them,	1
his	1
mind	1
had	1
penetrated	1
to	1
those	1
distances	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
there	1
seen	1
the	1
same	1
pettiness,	1
worldliness,	1
and	1
senselessness.	1
Now,	1
however,	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
great,	1
eternal,	1
and	1
infinite	1
in	1
everything,	1
and	1
therefore--to	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
enjoy	1
its	1
contemplation--he	1
naturally	1
threw	1
away	1
the	1
telescope	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
till	1
now	1
gazed	1
over	1
men's	1
heads,	1
and	1
gladly	1
regarded	1
the	1
ever-changing,	1
eternally	1
great,	1
unfathomable,	1
and	1
infinite	1
life	1
around	1
him.	1
And	1
the	1
closer	1
he	1
looked	1
the	1
more	1
tranquil	1
and	1
happy	1
he	1
became.	1
That	1
dreadful	1
question,	1
"What	1
for?"	1
which	1
had	1
formerly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
his	1
mental	1
edifices,	1
no	1
longer	1
existed	1
for	1
him.	1
To	1
that	1
question,	1
"What	1
for?"	1
a	1
simple	1
answer	1
was	1
now	1
always	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
soul:	1
"Because	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God,	1
that	1
God	1
without	1
whose	1
will	1
not	1
one	1
hair	1
falls	1
from	1
a	1
man's	1
head."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
In	1
external	1
ways	1
Pierre	1
had	1
hardly	1
changed	1
at	1
all.	1
In	1
appearance	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be.	1
As	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
absent-minded	1
and	1
seemed	1
occupied	1
not	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
but	1
with	1
something	1
special	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
difference	1
between	1
his	1
former	1
and	1
present	1
self	1
was	1
that	1
formerly	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
grasp	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
or	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
puckered	1
his	1
forehead	1
painfully	1
as	1
if	1
vainly	1
seeking	1
to	1
distinguish	1
something	1
at	1
a	1
distance.	1
At	1
present	1
he	1
still	1
forgot	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
looked	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
and	1
seemingly	1
ironic	1
smile	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
said,	1
though	1
evidently	1
seeing	1
and	1
hearing	1
something	1
quite	1
different.	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
kindhearted	1
but	1
unhappy	1
man,	1
and	1
so	1
people	1
had	1
been	1
inclined	1
to	1
avoid	1
him.	1
Now	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
life	1
always	1
played	1
round	1
his	1
lips,	1
and	1
sympathy	1
for	1
others,	1
shone	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
questioning	1
look	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
contented	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
people	1
felt	1
pleased	1
by	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
Previously	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
grew	1
excited	1
when	1
he	1
talked,	1
and	1
seldom	1
listened;	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
seldom	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
conversation	1
and	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
listen	1
so	1
that	1
people	1
readily	1
told	1
him	1
their	1
most	1
intimate	1
secrets.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
liked	1
Pierre	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
particularly	1
hostile	1
to	1
him	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
herself	1
under	1
obligations	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
old	1
count's	1
death,	1
now	1
after	1
staying	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
in	1
Orel--where	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
intending	1
to	1
show	1
Pierre	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
ingratitude	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
nurse	1
him--felt	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
and	1
vexation	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
fond	1
of	1
him.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
seek	1
her	1
approval,	1
he	1
merely	1
studied	1
her	1
with	1
interest.	1
Formerly	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
regarded	1
her	1
with	1
indifference	1
and	1
irony,	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
shrunk	1
into	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
with	1
others	1
and	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
only	1
the	1
combative	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
nature;	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
places	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
and,	1
mistrustfully	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
afterwards	1
gratefully,	1
she	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
the	1
hidden,	1
kindly	1
sides	1
of	1
her	1
character.	1
	1
The	1
most	1
cunning	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
crept	1
into	1
her	1
confidence	1
more	1
successfully,	1
evoking	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
times	1
of	1
her	1
youth	1
and	1
showing	1
sympathy	1
with	1
them.	1
Yet	1
Pierre's	1
cunning	1
consisted	1
simply	1
in	1
finding	1
pleasure	1
in	1
drawing	1
out	1
the	1
human	1
qualities	1
of	1
the	1
embittered,	1
hard,	1
and	1
(in	1
her	1
own	1
way)	1
proud	1
princess.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very,	1
very	1
kind	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
bad	1
people	1
but	1
of	1
people	1
such	1
as	1
myself,"	1
thought	1
she.	1
	1
His	1
servants	1
too--Terenty	1
and	1
Vaska--in	1
their	1
own	1
way	1
noticed	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
Pierre.	1
They	1
considered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
much	1
"simpler."	1
Terenty,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
helped	1
him	1
undress	1
and	1
wished	1
him	1
good	1
night,	1
often	1
lingered	1
with	1
his	1
master's	1
boots	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
clothes	1
over	1
his	1
arm,	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
start	1
a	1
talk.	1
And	1
Pierre,	1
noticing	1
that	1
Terenty	1
wanted	1
a	1
chat,	1
generally	1
kept	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
"Well,	1
tell	1
me...	1
now,	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
food?"	1
he	1
would	1
ask.	1
	1
And	1
Terenty	1
would	1
begin	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
and	1
would	1
stand	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
holding	1
the	1
clothes	1
and	1
talking,	1
or	1
sometimes	1
listening	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
stories,	1
and	1
then	1
would	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
sense	1
of	1
intimacy	1
with	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
affection	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
who	1
attended	1
Pierre	1
and	1
visited	1
him	1
every	1
day,	1
though	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
doctor	1
to	1
pose	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
every	1
moment	1
was	1
of	1
value	1
to	1
suffering	1
humanity,	1
would	1
sit	1
for	1
hours	1
with	1
Pierre	1
telling	1
him	1
his	1
favorite	1
anecdotes	1
and	1
his	1
observations	1
on	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
his	1
patients	1
in	1
general,	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
ladies.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
that;	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
our	1
provincials,"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
several	1
prisoners	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
in	1
Orel,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
brought	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
young	1
Italian,	1
to	1
see	1
Pierre.	1
	1
This	1
officer	1
began	1
visiting	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
used	1
to	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
the	1
tenderness	1
the	1
Italian	1
expressed	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
Italian	1
seemed	1
happy	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
Pierre,	1
talk	1
with	1
him,	1
tell	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
past,	1
his	1
life	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
his	1
love,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
especially	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
	1
"If	1
all	1
Russians	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
like	1
you,	1
it	1
is	1
sacrilege	1
to	1
fight	1
such	1
a	1
nation,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
"You,	1
who	1
have	1
suffered	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
feel	1
animosity	1
toward	1
them."	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
evoked	1
the	1
passionate	1
affection	1
of	1
the	1
Italian	1
merely	1
by	1
evoking	1
the	1
best	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
nature	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
pleasure	1
in	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
stay	1
in	1
Orel	1
his	1
old	1
masonic	1
acquaintance	1
Count	1
Willarski,	1
who	1
had	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
lodge	1
in	1
1807,	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Willarski	1
was	1
married	1
to	1
a	1
Russian	1
heiress	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
large	1
estate	1
in	1
Orel	1
province,	1
and	1
he	1
occupied	1
a	1
temporary	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
commissariat	1
department	1
in	1
that	1
town.	1
	1
Hearing	1
that	1
Bezukhov	1
was	1
in	1
Orel,	1
Willarski,	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
intimate,	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
professions	1
of	1
friendship	1
and	1
intimacy	1
that	1
people	1
who	1
meet	1
in	1
a	1
desert	1
generally	1
express	1
for	1
one	1
another.	1
Willarski	1
felt	1
dull	1
in	1
Orel	1
and	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
circle	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
supposed,	1
of	1
similar	1
interests.	1
	1
But	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
Willarski	1
soon	1
noticed	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
lagged	1
much	1
behind	1
the	1
times,	1
and	1
had	1
sunk,	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
it	1
to	1
himself,	1
into	1
apathy	1
and	1
egotism.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
letting	1
yourself	1
go,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
But	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
Willarski	1
found	1
it	1
pleasanter	1
now	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
formerly	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
every	1
day.	1
To	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
Willarski,	1
it	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
like	1
that	1
himself	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
before.	1
	1
Willarski	1
was	1
a	1
married	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
family,	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
affairs,	1
his	1
wife's	1
affairs,	1
and	1
his	1
official	1
duties.	1
He	1
regarded	1
all	1
these	1
occupations	1
as	1
hindrances	1
to	1
life,	1
and	1
considered	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
contemptible	1
because	1
their	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
family.	1
Military,	1
administrative,	1
political,	1
and	1
masonic	1
interests	1
continually	1
absorbed	1
his	1
attention.	1
And	1
Pierre,	1
without	1
trying	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
other's	1
views	1
and	1
without	1
condemning	1
him,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
quiet,	1
joyful,	1
and	1
amused	1
smile	1
now	1
habitual	1
to	1
him,	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
this	1
strange	1
though	1
very	1
familiar	1
phenomenon.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
feature	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
relations	1
with	1
Willarski,	1
with	1
the	1
princess,	1
with	1
the	1
doctor,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
now	1
met,	1
which	1
gained	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
will.	1
This	1
was	1
his	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
changing	1
a	1
man's	1
convictions	1
by	1
words,	1
and	1
his	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
everyone	1
thinking,	1
feeling,	1
and	1
seeing	1
things	1
each	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
This	1
legitimate	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
each	1
individual	1
which	1
used	1
to	1
excite	1
and	1
irritate	1
Pierre	1
now	1
became	1
a	1
basis	1
of	1
the	1
sympathy	1
he	1
felt	1
for,	1
and	1
the	1
interest	1
he	1
took	1
in,	1
other	1
people.	1
The	1
difference,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
complete	1
contradiction,	1
between	1
men's	1
opinions	1
and	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
between	1
one	1
man	1
and	1
another,	1
pleased	1
him	1
and	1
drew	1
from	1
him	1
an	1
amused	1
and	1
gentle	1
smile.	1
	1
In	1
practical	1
matters	1
Pierre	1
unexpectedly	1
felt	1
within	1
himself	1
a	1
center	1
of	1
gravity	1
he	1
had	1
previously	1
lacked.	1
Formerly	1
all	1
pecuniary	1
questions,	1
especially	1
requests	1
for	1
money	1
to	1
which,	1
as	1
an	1
extremely	1
wealthy	1
man,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
exposed,	1
produced	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
hopeless	1
agitation	1
and	1
perplexity.	1
"To	1
give	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
give?"	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
himself.	1
"I	1
have	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
needs	1
it.	1
But	1
someone	1
else	1
needs	1
it	1
still	1
more.	1
Who	1
needs	1
it	1
most?	1
And	1
perhaps	1
they	1
are	1
both	1
impostors?"	1
In	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
surmises	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
asked	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
give.	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
state	1
of	1
perplexity	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
every	1
question	1
concerning	1
his	1
property,	1
when	1
one	1
person	1
advised	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
another	1
something	1
else.	1
	1
Now	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
felt	1
either	1
doubt	1
or	1
perplexity	1
about	1
these	1
questions.	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
within	1
him	1
a	1
judge	1
who	1
by	1
some	1
rule	1
unknown	1
to	1
him	1
decided	1
what	1
should	1
or	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
indifferent	1
as	1
heretofore	1
to	1
money	1
matters,	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
certain	1
of	1
what	1
ought	1
and	1
what	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
his	1
new	1
judge	1
was	1
when	1
a	1
French	1
prisoner,	1
a	1
colonel,	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
after	1
talking	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
his	1
exploits,	1
concluded	1
by	1
making	1
what	1
amounted	1
to	1
a	1
demand	1
that	1
Pierre	1
should	1
give	1
him	1
four	1
thousand	1
francs	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children.	1
Pierre	1
refused	1
without	1
the	1
least	1
difficulty	1
or	1
effort,	1
and	1
was	1
afterwards	1
surprised	1
how	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
had	1
been	1
what	1
used	1
to	1
appear	1
so	1
insurmountably	1
difficult.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
refused	1
the	1
colonel's	1
demand	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
artifice	1
when	1
leaving	1
Orel,	1
to	1
induce	1
the	1
Italian	1
officer	1
to	1
accept	1
some	1
money	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
in	1
need.	1
A	1
further	1
proof	1
to	1
Pierre	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
more	1
settled	1
outlook	1
on	1
practical	1
matters	1
was	1
furnished	1
by	1
his	1
decision	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
wife's	1
debts	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rebuilding	1
of	1
his	1
houses	1
in	1
and	1
near	1
Moscow.	1
	1
His	1
head	1
steward	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
Orel	1
and	1
Pierre	1
reckoned	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
his	1
diminished	1
income.	1
The	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
had	1
cost	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
steward's	1
calculation,	1
about	1
two	1
million	1
rubles.	1
	1
To	1
console	1
Pierre	1
for	1
these	1
losses	1
the	1
head	1
steward	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
estimate	1
showing	1
that	1
despite	1
these	1
losses	1
his	1
income	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
diminished	1
but	1
would	1
even	1
be	1
increased	1
if	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
wife's	1
debts	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
under	1
no	1
obligation	1
to	1
meet,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
rebuild	1
his	1
Moscow	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
house	1
on	1
his	1
Moscow	1
estate,	1
which	1
had	1
cost	1
him	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
nothing.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
of	1
course	1
that's	1
true,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
smile.	1
"I	1
don't	1
need	1
all	1
that	1
at	1
all.	1
By	1
being	1
ruined	1
I	1
have	1
become	1
much	1
richer."	1
	1
But	1
in	1
January	1
Savelich	1
came	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
there,	1
and	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
estimate	1
an	1
architect	1
had	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
rebuilding	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
country	1
houses,	1
speaking	1
of	1
this	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
settled	1
matter.	1
About	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
received	1
letters	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
other	1
Petersburg	1
acquaintances	1
speaking	1
of	1
his	1
wife's	1
debts.	1
And	1
Pierre	1
decided	1
that	1
the	1
steward's	1
proposals	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
pleased	1
him	1
were	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
settle	1
his	1
wife's	1
affairs	1
and	1
must	1
rebuild	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Why	1
this	1
was	1
necessary	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary.	1
His	1
income	1
would	1
be	1
reduced	1
by	1
three	1
fourths,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
Willarski	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
they	1
agreed	1
to	1
travel	1
together.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
convalescence	1
in	1
Orel	1
Pierre	1
had	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy,	1
freedom,	1
and	1
life;	1
but	1
when	1
during	1
his	1
journey	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
world	1
and	1
saw	1
hundreds	1
of	1
new	1
faces,	1
that	1
feeling	1
was	1
intensified.	1
Throughout	1
his	1
journey	1
he	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
on	1
holiday.	1
Everyone--the	1
stagecoach	1
driver,	1
the	1
post-house	1
overseers,	1
the	1
peasants	1
on	1
the	1
roads	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
villages--had	1
a	1
new	1
significance	1
for	1
him.	1
The	1
presence	1
and	1
remarks	1
of	1
Willarski	1
who	1
continually	1
deplored	1
the	1
ignorance	1
and	1
poverty	1
of	1
Russia	1
and	1
its	1
backwardness	1
compared	1
with	1
Europe	1
only	1
heightened	1
Pierre's	1
pleasure.	1
Where	1
Willarski	1
saw	1
deadness	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
strength	1
and	1
vitality--the	1
strength	1
which	1
in	1
that	1
vast	1
space	1
amid	1
the	1
snows	1
maintained	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
this	1
original,	1
peculiar,	1
and	1
unique	1
people.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
contradict	1
Willarski	1
and	1
even	1
seemed	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
him--an	1
apparent	1
agreement	1
being	1
the	1
simplest	1
way	1
to	1
avoid	1
discussions	1
that	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing--and	1
he	1
smiled	1
joyfully	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
explain	1
why	1
and	1
whither	1
ants	1
whose	1
heap	1
has	1
been	1
destroyed	1
are	1
hurrying:	1
some	1
from	1
the	1
heap	1
dragging	1
bits	1
of	1
rubbish,	1
larvae,	1
and	1
corpses,	1
others	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
heap,	1
or	1
why	1
they	1
jostle,	1
overtake	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
fight,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
equally	1
difficult	1
to	1
explain	1
what	1
caused	1
the	1
Russians	1
after	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
throng	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
Moscow.	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
watch	1
the	1
ants	1
round	1
their	1
ruined	1
heap,	1
the	1
tenacity,	1
energy,	1
and	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
delving	1
insects	1
prove	1
that	1
despite	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
heap,	1
something	1
indestructible,	1
which	1
though	1
intangible	1
is	1
the	1
real	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
colony,	1
still	1
exists;	1
and	1
similarly,	1
though	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
October	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
government	1
and	1
no	1
churches,	1
shrines,	1
riches,	1
or	1
houses--it	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
Moscow	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
August.	1
All	1
was	1
destroyed,	1
except	1
something	1
intangible	1
yet	1
powerful	1
and	1
indestructible.	1
	1
The	1
motives	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
thronged	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
to	1
Moscow	1
after	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
cleared	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
were	1
most	1
diverse	1
and	1
personal,	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
savage	1
and	1
brutal.	1
One	1
motive	1
only	1
they	1
all	1
had	1
in	1
common:	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
Moscow,	1
to	1
apply	1
their	1
activities	1
there.	1
	1
Within	1
a	1
week	1
Moscow	1
already	1
had	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
inhabitants,	1
in	1
a	1
fortnight	1
twenty-five	1
thousand,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
By	1
the	1
autumn	1
of	1
1813	1
the	1
number,	1
ever	1
increasing	1
and	1
increasing,	1
exceeded	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
1812.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
Russians	1
to	1
enter	1
Moscow	1
were	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
of	1
Wintzingerode's	1
detachment,	1
peasants	1
from	1
the	1
adjacent	1
villages,	1
and	1
residents	1
who	1
had	1
fled	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
hiding	1
in	1
its	1
vicinity.	1
The	1
Russians	1
who	1
entered	1
Moscow,	1
finding	1
it	1
plundered,	1
plundered	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
turn.	1
They	1
continued	1
what	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
begun.	1
Trains	1
of	1
peasant	1
carts	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
villages	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
in	1
the	1
ruined	1
houses	1
and	1
the	1
streets.	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
carried	1
off	1
what	1
they	1
could	1
to	1
their	1
camps,	1
and	1
the	1
householders	1
seized	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
find	1
in	1
other	1
houses	1
and	1
moved	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
own,	1
pretending	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
property.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
first	1
plunderers	1
were	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
contingent,	1
and	1
with	1
increasing	1
numbers	1
plundering	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
difficult	1
and	1
assumed	1
more	1
definite	1
forms.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
found	1
Moscow	1
abandoned	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
organizations	1
of	1
regular	1
life,	1
with	1
diverse	1
branches	1
of	1
commerce	1
and	1
craftsmanship,	1
with	1
luxury,	1
and	1
governmental	1
and	1
religious	1
institutions.	1
These	1
forms	1
were	1
lifeless	1
but	1
still	1
existed.	1
There	1
were	1
bazaars,	1
shops,	1
warehouses,	1
market	1
stalls,	1
granaries--for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
still	1
stocked	1
with	1
goods--	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
factories	1
and	1
workshops,	1
palaces	1
and	1
wealthy	1
houses	1
filled	1
with	1
luxuries,	1
hospitals,	1
prisons,	1
government	1
offices,	1
churches,	1
and	1
cathedrals.	1
The	1
longer	1
the	1
French	1
remained	1
the	1
more	1
these	1
forms	1
of	1
town	1
life	1
perished,	1
until	1
finally	1
all	1
was	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
confused,	1
lifeless	1
scene	1
of	1
plunder.	1
	1
The	1
more	1
the	1
plundering	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
continued,	1
the	1
more	1
both	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
its	1
plunderers	1
was	1
destroyed.	1
But	1
plundering	1
by	1
the	1
Russians,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
reoccupation	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
began,	1
had	1
an	1
opposite	1
effect:	1
the	1
longer	1
it	1
continued	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
people	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
more	1
rapidly	1
was	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
its	1
regular	1
life	1
restored.	1
	1
Besides	1
the	1
plunderers,	1
very	1
various	1
people,	1
some	1
drawn	1
by	1
curiosity,	1
some	1
by	1
official	1
duties,	1
some	1
by	1
self-interest--house	1
owners,	1
clergy,	1
officials	1
of	1
all	1
kinds,	1
tradesmen,	1
artisans,	1
and	1
peasants--streamed	1
into	1
Moscow	1
as	1
blood	1
flows	1
to	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
Within	1
a	1
week	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
empty	1
carts	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
plunder	1
were	1
stopped	1
by	1
the	1
authorities	1
and	1
made	1
to	1
cart	1
the	1
corpses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
Other	1
peasants,	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
their	1
comrades'	1
discomfiture,	1
came	1
to	1
town	1
bringing	1
rye,	1
oats,	1
and	1
hay,	1
and	1
beat	1
down	1
one	1
another's	1
prices	1
to	1
below	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
former	1
days.	1
Gangs	1
of	1
carpenters	1
hoping	1
for	1
high	1
pay	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
logs	1
were	1
being	1
hewn,	1
new	1
houses	1
built,	1
and	1
old,	1
charred	1
ones	1
repaired.	1
Tradesmen	1
began	1
trading	1
in	1
booths.	1
Cookshops	1
and	1
taverns	1
were	1
opened	1
in	1
partially	1
burned	1
houses.	1
The	1
clergy	1
resumed	1
the	1
services	1
in	1
many	1
churches	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
burned.	1
Donors	1
contributed	1
Church	1
property	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
stolen.	1
Government	1
clerks	1
set	1
up	1
their	1
baize-	1
covered	1
tables	1
and	1
their	1
pigeonholes	1
of	1
documents	1
in	1
small	1
rooms.	1
The	1
higher	1
authorities	1
and	1
the	1
police	1
organized	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
goods	1
left	1
behind	1
by	1
the	1
French.	1
The	1
owners	1
of	1
houses	1
in	1
which	1
much	1
property	1
had	1
been	1
left,	1
brought	1
there	1
from	1
other	1
houses,	1
complained	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
taking	1
everything	1
to	1
the	1
Faceted	1
Palace	1
in	1
the	1
Kremlin;	1
others	1
insisted	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
gathered	1
things	1
from	1
different	1
houses	1
into	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
house,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unfair	1
to	1
allow	1
its	1
owner	1
to	1
keep	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
there.	1
They	1
abused	1
the	1
police	1
and	1
bribed	1
them,	1
made	1
out	1
estimates	1
at	1
ten	1
times	1
their	1
value	1
for	1
government	1
stores	1
that	1
had	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
demanded	1
relief.	1
And	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
wrote	1
proclamations.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
January	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
stayed	1
in	1
an	1
annex	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
burned.	1
He	1
called	1
on	1
Count	1
Rostopchin	1
and	1
on	1
some	1
acquaintances	1
who	1
were	1
back	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
leave	1
for	1
Petersburg	1
two	1
days	1
later.	1
Everybody	1
was	1
celebrating	1
the	1
victory,	1
everything	1
was	1
bubbling	1
with	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
ruined	1
but	1
reviving	1
city.	1
Everyone	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
Pierre,	1
everyone	1
wished	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
everyone	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
particularly	1
well	1
disposed	1
toward	1
them	1
all,	1
but	1
was	1
now	1
instinctively	1
on	1
his	1
guard	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
binding	1
himself	1
in	1
any	1
way.	1
To	1
all	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
him--	1
whether	1
important	1
or	1
quite	1
trifling--such	1
as:	1
Where	1
would	1
he	1
live?	1
Was	1
he	1
going	1
to	1
rebuild?	1
When	1
was	1
he	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
would	1
he	1
mind	1
taking	1
a	1
parcel	1
for	1
someone?--he	1
replied:	1
"Yes,	1
perhaps,"	1
or,	1
"I	1
think	1
so,"	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
at	1
Kostroma	1
but	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
Natasha	1
seldom	1
occurred	1
to	1
him.	1
If	1
it	1
did	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
pleasant	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
distant	1
past.	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
not	1
only	1
free	1
from	1
social	1
obligations	1
but	1
also	1
from	1
that	1
feeling	1
which,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
aroused	1
in	1
himself.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
Drubetskoys	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
death,	1
sufferings,	1
and	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
often	1
occupied	1
Pierre's	1
thoughts	1
and	1
now	1
recurred	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
fresh	1
vividness.	1
Having	1
heard	1
at	1
dinner	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
living	1
in	1
her	1
house--which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
burned--in	1
Vozdvizhenka	1
Street,	1
he	1
drove	1
that	1
same	1
evening	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
thinking	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
of	1
their	1
friendship,	1
of	1
his	1
various	1
meetings	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
one	1
at	1
Borodino.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
bitter	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
in?	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
disclosed	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
died?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
recalled	1
Karataev	1
and	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
began	1
to	1
compare	1
these	1
two	1
men,	1
so	1
different,	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
similar	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
lived	1
and	1
both	1
died	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
Pierre	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
serious	1
mood.	1
The	1
house	1
had	1
escaped	1
the	1
fire;	1
it	1
showed	1
signs	1
of	1
damage	1
but	1
its	1
general	1
aspect	1
was	1
unchanged.	1
The	1
old	1
footman,	1
who	1
met	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
visitor	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
not	1
disturbed	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
apartments,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
received	1
on	1
Sundays.	1
	1
"Announce	1
me.	1
Perhaps	1
she	1
will	1
see	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
man.	1
"Please	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
portrait	1
gallery."	1
	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
footman	1
returned	1
with	1
Dessalles,	1
who	1
brought	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
Pierre	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
excuse	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
ceremony	1
and	1
come	1
upstairs	1
to	1
her	1
apartment.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
rather	1
low	1
room	1
lit	1
by	1
one	1
candle	1
sat	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
another	1
person	1
dressed	1
in	1
black.	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
always	1
had	1
lady	1
companions,	1
but	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
he	1
never	1
knew	1
or	1
remembered.	1
"This	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
companions,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
dress.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
rose	1
quickly	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
she	1
said,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
altered	1
face	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
"so	1
this	1
is	1
how	1
we	1
meet	1
again.	1
He	1
spoke	1
of	1
you	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
last,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
Pierre	1
to	1
her	1
companion	1
with	1
a	1
shyness	1
that	1
surprised	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
safety.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
piece	1
of	1
good	1
news	1
we	1
had	1
received	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time."	1
	1
Again	1
the	1
princess	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
companion	1
with	1
even	1
more	1
uneasiness	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
add	1
something,	1
but	1
Pierre	1
interrupted	1
her.	1
	1
"Just	1
imagine--I	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
him!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
killed.	1
All	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
heard	1
at	1
second	1
hand	1
from	1
others.	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs....	1
What	1
a	1
strange	1
coincidence!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
rapidly	1
and	1
with	1
animation.	1
He	1
glanced	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
companion's	1
face,	1
saw	1
her	1
attentive	1
and	1
kindly	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
and,	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
talking,	1
felt	1
somehow	1
that	1
this	1
companion	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
dress	1
was	1
a	1
good,	1
kind,	1
excellent	1
creature	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
hinder	1
his	1
conversing	1
freely	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
mentioned	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face	1
expressed	1
still	1
greater	1
embarrassment.	1
She	1
again	1
glanced	1
rapidly	1
from	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
dress	1
and	1
said:	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
not	1
recognize	1
her?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
companion's	1
pale,	1
delicate	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
black	1
eyes	1
and	1
peculiar	1
mouth,	1
and	1
something	1
near	1
to	1
him,	1
long	1
forgotten	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
sweet,	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
those	1
attentive	1
eyes.	1
	1
"But	1
no,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"This	1
stern,	1
thin,	1
pale	1
face	1
that	1
looks	1
so	1
much	1
older!	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
she.	1
It	1
merely	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
her."	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
said,	1
"Natasha!"	1
And	1
with	1
difficulty,	1
effort,	1
and	1
stress,	1
like	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
a	1
door	1
grown	1
rusty	1
on	1
its	1
hinges,	1
a	1
smile	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
attentive	1
eyes,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
opening	1
door	1
came	1
a	1
breath	1
of	1
fragrance	1
which	1
suffused	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
happiness	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
forgotten	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
been	1
thinking--especially	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
It	1
suffused	1
him,	1
seized	1
him,	1
and	1
enveloped	1
him	1
completely.	1
When	1
she	1
smiled	1
doubt	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible,	1
it	1
was	1
Natasha	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
her.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
involuntarily	1
betrayed	1
to	1
her,	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
himself,	1
a	1
secret	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
been	1
unaware.	1
He	1
flushed	1
joyfully	1
yet	1
with	1
painful	1
distress.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
agitation.	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
the	1
more	1
clearly--clearer	1
than	1
any	1
words	1
could	1
have	1
done--did	1
he	1
betray	1
to	1
himself,	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
only	1
the	1
unexpectedness	1
of	1
it,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
again	1
glanced	1
at	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
a	1
still-deeper	1
flush	1
suffused	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
still-stronger	1
agitation	1
of	1
mingled	1
joy	1
and	1
fear	1
seized	1
his	1
soul.	1
He	1
became	1
confused	1
in	1
his	1
speech	1
and	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
notice	1
Natasha	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
there,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
recognize	1
her	1
because	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
since	1
he	1
last	1
saw	1
her	1
was	1
immense.	1
She	1
had	1
grown	1
thin	1
and	1
pale,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
made	1
her	1
unrecognizable;	1
she	1
was	1
unrecognizable	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
entered	1
because	1
on	1
that	1
face	1
whose	1
eyes	1
had	1
always	1
shone	1
with	1
a	1
suppressed	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
life,	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
entered	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
smile:	1
only	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
kindly	1
attentive	1
and	1
sadly	1
interrogative.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
confusion	1
was	1
not	1
reflected	1
by	1
any	1
confusion	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
part,	1
but	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
pleasure	1
that	1
just	1
perceptibly	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
whole	1
face.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
"She	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
me,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"The	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
The	1
countess	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
state;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
Natasha	1
herself	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
doctor.	1
They	1
insisted	1
on	1
her	1
coming	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
family	1
free	1
from	1
sorrow	1
now?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
addressing	1
Natasha.	1
"You	1
know	1
it	1
happened	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
rescued.	1
I	1
saw	1
him.	1
What	1
a	1
delightful	1
boy	1
he	1
was!"	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
her	1
eyes	1
widened	1
and	1
lit	1
up.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
as	1
a	1
consolation?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Nothing!	1
Why	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
splendid	1
boy,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
life,	1
to	1
die?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
live	1
without	1
faith..."	1
remarked	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
that	1
is	1
really	1
true,"	1
Pierre	1
hastily	1
interrupted	1
her.	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
true?"	1
Natasha	1
asked,	1
looking	1
attentively	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
ask	1
why?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"The	1
thought	1
alone	1
of	1
what	1
awaits..."	1
	1
Natasha	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
finish	1
again	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"And	1
because,"	1
Pierre	1
continued,	1
"only	1
one	1
who	1
believes	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
ruling	1
us	1
can	1
bear	1
a	1
loss	1
such	1
as	1
hers	1
and...	1
yours."	1
	1
Natasha	1
had	1
already	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
suddenly	1
stopped.	1
Pierre	1
hurriedly	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
again	1
addressed	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
asking	1
about	1
his	1
friend's	1
last	1
days.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
confusion	1
had	1
now	1
almost	1
vanished,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
freedom	1
had	1
also	1
completely	1
gone.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
his	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
action	1
whose	1
judgment	1
mattered	1
more	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
what	1
impression	1
his	1
words	1
would	1
make	1
on	1
Natasha.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
purposely	1
say	1
things	1
to	1
please	1
her,	1
but	1
whatever	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
he	1
regarded	1
from	1
her	1
standpoint.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary--reluctantly	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
such	1
cases--began	1
telling	1
of	1
the	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
But	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
quivering	1
with	1
emotion,	1
his	1
questions	1
and	1
his	1
eager	1
restless	1
expression,	1
gradually	1
compelled	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
details	1
which	1
she	1
feared	1
to	1
recall	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
sake.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
and	1
so...?"	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
toward	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
and	1
eagerly	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
story.	1
"Yes,	1
yes...	1
so	1
he	1
grew	1
tranquil	1
and	1
softened?	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
sought	1
one	1
thing--to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
good--so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
death.	1
The	1
faults	1
he	1
had--if	1
he	1
had	1
any--were	1
not	1
of	1
his	1
making.	1
So	1
he	1
did	1
soften?...	1
What	1
a	1
happy	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
you	1
again,"	1
he	1
added,	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
Natasha	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears.	1
	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
twitched.	1
She	1
frowned	1
and	1
lowered	1
her	1
eyes	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
She	1
hesitated	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
whether	1
to	1
speak	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
happiness,"	1
she	1
then	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
quiet	1
voice	1
with	1
its	1
deep	1
chest	1
notes.	1
"For	1
me	1
it	1
certainly	1
was	1
happiness."	1
She	1
paused.	1
"And	1
he...	1
he...	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
wishing	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
room...."	1
	1
Natasha's	1
voice	1
broke.	1
She	1
blushed,	1
pressed	1
her	1
clasped	1
hands	1
on	1
her	1
knees,	1
and	1
then	1
controlling	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
evident	1
effort	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
rapidly.	1
	1
"We	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
we	1
started	1
from	1
Moscow.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
ask	1
about	1
him.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
Sonya	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
traveling	1
with	1
us.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
state	1
he	1
was	1
in,	1
all	1
I	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
be	1
with	1
him,"	1
she	1
said,	1
trembling,	1
and	1
breathing	1
quickly.	1
	1
And	1
not	1
letting	1
them	1
interrupt	1
her	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
mentioned	1
to	1
anyone--all	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
during	1
those	1
three	1
weeks	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
and	1
life	1
at	1
Yaroslavl.	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
lips	1
parted	1
and	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her	1
full	1
of	1
tears.	1
As	1
he	1
listened	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
nor	1
of	1
death,	1
nor	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
telling.	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
felt	1
only	1
pity	1
for	1
her,	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
suffering	1
now	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
speaking.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
frowning	1
in	1
her	1
effort	1
to	1
hold	1
back	1
her	1
tears,	1
sat	1
beside	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
heard	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
those	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
and	1
Natasha's	1
love.	1
	1
Evidently	1
Natasha	1
needed	1
to	1
tell	1
that	1
painful	1
yet	1
joyful	1
tale.	1
	1
She	1
spoke,	1
mingling	1
most	1
trifling	1
details	1
with	1
the	1
intimate	1
secrets	1
of	1
her	1
soul,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
finish.	1
Several	1
times	1
she	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
twice.	1
	1
Dessalles'	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
asking	1
whether	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
might	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
night.	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
all--everything,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
quickly	1
just	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
entered,	1
almost	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
was	1
hidden	1
by	1
curtains,	1
struck	1
her	1
head	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
moan	1
either	1
of	1
pain	1
or	1
sorrow.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
through	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
all	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
roused	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
abstraction	1
by	1
drawing	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
nephew	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
of	1
emotional	1
tenderness	1
young	1
Nicholas'	1
face,	1
which	1
resembled	1
his	1
father's,	1
affected	1
Pierre	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
kissed	1
the	1
boy	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
quickly,	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
"No,	1
Natasha	1
and	1
I	1
sometimes	1
don't	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
till	1
after	1
two,	1
so	1
please	1
don't	1
go.	1
I	1
will	1
order	1
supper.	1
Go	1
downstairs,	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
immediately."	1
	1
Before	1
Pierre	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
told	1
him:	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
she	1
has	1
talked	1
of	1
him	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
large,	1
brightly	1
lit	1
dining	1
room;	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
he	1
heard	1
footsteps	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entered	1
with	1
Natasha.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
calm,	1
though	1
a	1
severe	1
and	1
grave	1
expression	1
had	1
again	1
settled	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
They	1
all	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
now	1
experienced	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
awkwardness	1
which	1
usually	1
follows	1
after	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
heartfelt	1
talk.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
conversation,	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
trifles	1
is	1
awkward,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
speak	1
is	1
there	1
and	1
silence	1
seems	1
like	1
affectation.	1
They	1
went	1
silently	1
to	1
table.	1
The	1
footmen	1
drew	1
back	1
the	1
chairs	1
and	1
pushed	1
them	1
up	1
again.	1
Pierre	1
unfolded	1
his	1
cold	1
table	1
napkin	1
and,	1
resolving	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
silence,	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha	1
and	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
They	1
had	1
evidently	1
both	1
formed	1
the	1
same	1
resolution;	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
both	1
shone	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
a	1
confession	1
that	1
besides	1
sorrow	1
life	1
also	1
has	1
joy.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
take	1
vodka,	1
Count?"	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
those	1
words	1
suddenly	1
banished	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
"Now	1
tell	1
us	1
about	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"One	1
hears	1
such	1
improbable	1
wonders	1
about	1
you."	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
mild	1
irony	1
now	1
habitual	1
to	1
him.	1
"They	1
even	1
tell	1
me	1
wonders	1
I	1
myself	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of!	1
Mary	1
Abramovna	1
invited	1
me	1
to	1
her	1
house	1
and	1
kept	1
telling	1
me	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
happened,	1
to	1
me.	1
Stepan	1
Stepanych	1
also	1
instructed	1
me	1
how	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
my	1
experiences.	1
In	1
general	1
I	1
have	1
noticed	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
interesting	1
man	1
(I	1
am	1
an	1
interesting	1
man	1
now);	1
people	1
invite	1
me	1
out	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
myself."	1
	1
Natasha	1
smiled	1
and	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
speaking.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
been	1
told,"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
interrupted	1
her,	1
"that	1
you	1
lost	1
two	1
millions	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Is	1
that	1
true?"	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
before,"	1
returned	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Though	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
now	1
altered	1
by	1
his	1
decision	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
wife's	1
debts	1
and	1
to	1
rebuild	1
his	1
houses,	1
Pierre	1
still	1
maintained	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
"What	1
I	1
have	1
certainly	1
gained	1
is	1
freedom,"	1
he	1
began	1
seriously,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
continue,	1
noticing	1
that	1
this	1
theme	1
was	1
too	1
egotistic.	1
	1
"And	1
are	1
you	1
building?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
Savelich	1
says	1
I	1
must!"	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
death	1
when	1
you	1
decided	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow?"	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
immediately	1
blushed,	1
noticing	1
that	1
her	1
question,	1
following	1
his	1
mention	1
of	1
freedom,	1
ascribed	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
a	1
meaning	1
he	1
had	1
perhaps	1
not	1
intended.	1
	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
evidently	1
not	1
considering	1
awkward	1
the	1
meaning	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
his	1
words.	1
"I	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
Orel	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
how	1
it	1
shocked	1
me.	1
We	1
were	1
not	1
an	1
exemplary	1
couple,"	1
he	1
added	1
quickly,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Natasha	1
and	1
noticing	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
"but	1
her	1
death	1
shocked	1
me	1
terribly.	1
When	1
two	1
people	1
quarrel	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
both	1
in	1
fault,	1
and	1
one's	1
own	1
guilt	1
suddenly	1
becomes	1
terribly	1
serious	1
when	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
alive.	1
And	1
then	1
such	1
a	1
death...	1
without	1
friends	1
and	1
without	1
consolation!	1
I	1
am	1
very,	1
very	1
sorry	1
for	1
her,"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
and	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
notice	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
glad	1
approval	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
face.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
once	1
more	1
an	1
eligible	1
bachelor,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
flushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
When	1
he	1
ventured	1
to	1
glance	1
her	1
way	1
again	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
cold,	1
stern,	1
and	1
he	1
fancied	1
even	1
contemptuous.	1
	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
really	1
see	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
told?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Pierre	1
laughed.	1
	1
"No,	1
not	1
once!	1
Everybody	1
seems	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
being	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
means	1
being	1
Napoleon's	1
guest.	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
I	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
heard	1
nothing	1
about	1
him--I	1
was	1
in	1
much	1
lower	1
company!"	1
	1
Supper	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
who	1
at	1
first	1
declined	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
his	1
captivity	1
was	1
gradually	1
led	1
on	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
"But	1
it's	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
to	1
kill	1
Napoleon?"	1
Natasha	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile.	1
"I	1
guessed	1
it	1
then	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
Sukharev	1
tower,	1
do	1
you	1
remember?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
admitted	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
was	1
gradually	1
led	1
by	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
questions	1
and	1
especially	1
by	1
Natasha's	1
into	1
giving	1
a	1
detailed	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
adventures.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
the	1
amused	1
and	1
mild	1
irony	1
now	1
customary	1
with	1
him	1
toward	1
everybody	1
and	1
especially	1
toward	1
himself,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
horrors	1
and	1
sufferings	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
he	1
was	1
unconsciously	1
carried	1
away	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
with	1
the	1
suppressed	1
emotion	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
re-experiencing	1
in	1
recollection	1
strong	1
impressions	1
he	1
has	1
lived	1
through.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
Pierre	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
In	1
the	1
whole	1
narrative	1
she	1
saw	1
only	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
goodness.	1
Natasha,	1
leaning	1
on	1
her	1
elbow,	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
constantly	1
changing	1
with	1
the	1
narrative,	1
watched	1
Pierre	1
with	1
an	1
attention	1
that	1
never	1
wandered--evidently	1
herself	1
experiencing	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
described.	1
Not	1
only	1
her	1
look,	1
but	1
her	1
exclamations	1
and	1
the	1
brief	1
questions	1
she	1
put,	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
convey.	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
also	1
what	1
he	1
wished	1
to,	1
but	1
could	1
not,	1
express	1
in	1
words.	1
The	1
account	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
of	1
the	1
incident	1
with	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
for	1
protecting	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
arrested	1
was	1
this:	1
"It	1
was	1
an	1
awful	1
sight--children	1
abandoned,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
flames...	1
One	1
was	1
snatched	1
out	1
before	1
my	1
eyes...	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
women	1
who	1
had	1
their	1
things	1
snatched	1
off	1
and	1
their	1
earrings	1
torn	1
out..."	1
he	1
flushed	1
and	1
grew	1
confused.	1
"Then	1
a	1
patrol	1
arrived	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men--all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
looting,	1
that	1
is--were	1
arrested,	1
and	1
I	1
among	1
them."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
you're	1
not	1
telling	1
us	1
everything;	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
did	1
something..."	1
said	1
Natasha	1
and	1
pausing	1
added,	1
"something	1
fine?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
continued.	1
When	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
execution	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
horrible	1
details,	1
but	1
Natasha	1
insisted	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
omit	1
anything.	1
	1
Pierre	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
about	1
Karataev,	1
but	1
paused.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
was	1
pacing	1
the	1
room,	1
Natasha	1
following	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
he	1
added:	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
can't	1
understand	1
what	1
I	1
learned	1
from	1
that	1
illiterate	1
man--that	1
simple	1
fellow."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
go	1
on!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Where	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"They	1
killed	1
him	1
almost	1
before	1
my	1
eyes."	1
	1
And	1
Pierre,	1
his	1
voice	1
trembling	1
continually,	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
retreat,	1
of	1
Karataev's	1
illness	1
and	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
He	1
told	1
of	1
his	1
adventures	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
recalled	1
them.	1
He	1
now,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
meaning	1
in	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
through.	1
Now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
telling	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
Natasha	1
he	1
experienced	1
that	1
pleasure	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
when	1
women	1
listen	1
to	1
him--not	1
clever	1
women	1
who	1
when	1
listening	1
either	1
try	1
to	1
remember	1
what	1
they	1
hear	1
to	1
enrich	1
their	1
minds	1
and	1
when	1
opportunity	1
offers	1
to	1
retell	1
it,	1
or	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
adopt	1
it	1
to	1
some	1
thought	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
and	1
promptly	1
contribute	1
their	1
own	1
clever	1
comments	1
prepared	1
in	1
their	1
little	1
mental	1
workshop--but	1
the	1
pleasure	1
given	1
by	1
real	1
women	1
gifted	1
with	1
a	1
capacity	1
to	1
select	1
and	1
absorb	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
a	1
man	1
shows	1
of	1
himself.	1
Natasha	1
without	1
knowing	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
attention:	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
a	1
word,	1
no	1
single	1
quiver	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
voice,	1
no	1
look,	1
no	1
twitch	1
of	1
a	1
muscle	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
gesture.	1
She	1
caught	1
the	1
unfinished	1
word	1
in	1
its	1
flight	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
open	1
heart,	1
divining	1
the	1
secret	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
Pierre's	1
mental	1
travail.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
understood	1
his	1
story	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
she	1
now	1
saw	1
something	1
else	1
that	1
absorbed	1
all	1
her	1
attention.	1
She	1
saw	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
happiness	1
between	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
filled	1
her	1
heart	1
with	1
gladness.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
three	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
The	1
footmen	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
sad	1
and	1
stern	1
faces	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
candles,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
noticed	1
them.	1
	1
Pierre	1
finished	1
his	1
story.	1
Natasha	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
intently	1
with	1
bright,	1
attentive,	1
and	1
animated	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
something	1
more	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
perhaps	1
left	1
untold.	1
Pierre	1
in	1
shamefaced	1
and	1
happy	1
confusion	1
glanced	1
occasionally	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
next	1
to	1
introduce	1
a	1
fresh	1
subject.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
silent.	1
It	1
occurred	1
to	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
three	1
o'clock	1
and	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed.	1
	1
"People	1
speak	1
of	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
sufferings,"	1
remarked	1
Pierre,	1
"but	1
if	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
I	1
were	1
asked:	1
'Would	1
you	1
rather	1
be	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
before	1
you	1
were	1
taken	1
prisoner,	1
or	1
go	1
through	1
all	1
this	1
again?'	1
then	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
let	1
me	1
again	1
have	1
captivity	1
and	1
horseflesh!	1
We	1
imagine	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
usual	1
ruts	1
all	1
is	1
lost,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
then	1
that	1
what	1
is	1
new	1
and	1
good	1
begins.	1
While	1
there	1
is	1
life	1
there	1
is	1
happiness.	1
There	1
is	1
much,	1
much	1
before	1
us.	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
you,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
she	1
said,	1
answering	1
something	1
quite	1
different.	1
"I	1
too	1
should	1
wish	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
relive	1
it	1
all	1
from	1
the	1
beginning."	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
nothing	1
more,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
true,	1
not	1
true!"	1
cried	1
Pierre.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
being	1
alive	1
and	1
wishing	1
to	1
live--nor	1
you	1
either."	1
	1
Suddenly	1
Natasha	1
bent	1
her	1
head,	1
covered	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
Natasha?"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Nothing,	1
nothing."	1
She	1
smiled	1
at	1
Pierre	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
"Good	1
night!	1
It	1
is	1
time	1
for	1
bed."	1
	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
leave.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
met	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
what	1
Pierre	1
had	1
told	1
them.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
Pierre	1
nor	1
did	1
Natasha	1
speak	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
good	1
night,	1
Mary!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
am	1
often	1
afraid	1
that	1
by	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
him"	1
(she	1
meant	1
Prince	1
Andrew)	1
"for	1
fear	1
of	1
not	1
doing	1
justice	1
to	1
our	1
feelings,	1
we	1
forget	1
him."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
and	1
thereby	1
acknowledged	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
Natasha's	1
remark,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
agreement	1
in	1
words.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
forget?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"It	1
did	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
to	1
tell	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
today.	1
It	1
was	1
hard	1
and	1
painful,	1
but	1
good,	1
very	1
good!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
he	1
really	1
loved	1
him.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
told	1
him...	1
Was	1
it	1
all	1
right?"	1
she	1
added,	1
suddenly	1
blushing.	1
	1
"To	1
tell	1
Pierre?	1
Oh,	1
yes.	1
What	1
a	1
splendid	1
man	1
he	1
is!"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Mary..."	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
mischievous	1
smile	1
such	1
as	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
"he	1
has	1
somehow	1
grown	1
so	1
clean,	1
smooth,	1
and	1
fresh--as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
Russian	1
bath;	1
do	1
you	1
understand?	1
Out	1
of	1
a	1
moral	1
bath.	1
Isn't	1
it	1
true?"	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"He	1
has	1
greatly	1
improved."	1
	1
"With	1
a	1
short	1
coat	1
and	1
his	1
hair	1
cropped;	1
just	1
as	1
if,	1
well,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
bath...	1
Papa	1
used	1
to..."	1
	1
"I	1
understand	1
why	1
he"	1
(Prince	1
Andrew)	1
"liked	1
no	1
one	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
him,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
different.	1
They	1
say	1
men	1
are	1
friends	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
quite	1
different.	1
That	1
must	1
be	1
true.	1
Really	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
unlike	1
him--	1
in	1
everything."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
he's	1
wonderful."	1
	1
"Well,	1
good	1
night,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
mischievous	1
smile	1
lingered	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
there.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
Pierre	1
could	1
fall	1
asleep	1
that	1
night.	1
He	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room,	1
now	1
turning	1
his	1
thoughts	1
on	1
a	1
difficult	1
problem	1
and	1
frowning,	1
now	1
suddenly	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
wincing,	1
and	1
now	1
smiling	1
happily.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
of	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
love,	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
jealous	1
of	1
her	1
past,	1
then	1
reproaching	1
himself	1
for	1
that	1
feeling.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
six	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
he	1
still	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what's	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
if	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
avoided?	1
What's	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
Evidently	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
so,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
hastily	1
undressing	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
bed,	1
happy	1
and	1
agitated	1
but	1
free	1
from	1
hesitation	1
or	1
indecision.	1
	1
"Strange	1
and	1
impossible	1
as	1
such	1
happiness	1
seems,	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
everything	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
man	1
and	1
wife,"	1
he	1
told	1
himself.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
previously	1
Pierre	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
the	1
Friday.	1
When	1
he	1
awoke	1
on	1
the	1
Thursday,	1
Savelich	1
came	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
about	1
packing	1
for	1
the	1
journey.	1
	1
"What,	1
to	1
Petersburg?	1
What	1
is	1
Petersburg?	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
Petersburg?"	1
he	1
asked	1
involuntarily,	1
though	1
only	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
long	1
ago	1
before	1
this	1
happened	1
I	1
did	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg,"	1
he	1
reflected.	1
"Why?	1
But	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
go.	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
fellow	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
how	1
attentive,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
remembers	1
everything,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
looking	1
at	1
Savelich's	1
old	1
face,	1
"and	1
what	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
he	1
has!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
Savelich,	1
do	1
you	1
still	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
accept	1
your	1
freedom?"	1
Pierre	1
asked	1
him.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
freedom	1
to	1
me,	1
your	1
excellency?	1
We	1
lived	1
under	1
the	1
late	1
count--the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
be	1
his!--and	1
we	1
have	1
lived	1
under	1
you	1
too,	1
without	1
ever	1
being	1
wronged."	1
	1
"And	1
your	1
children?"	1
	1
"The	1
children	1
will	1
live	1
just	1
the	1
same.	1
With	1
such	1
masters	1
one	1
can	1
live."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
about	1
my	1
heirs?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"Supposing	1
I	1
suddenly	1
marry...	1
it	1
might	1
happen,"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
an	1
involuntary	1
smile.	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
the	1
liberty,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing."	1
	1
"How	1
easy	1
he	1
thinks	1
it,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"He	1
doesn't	1
know	1
how	1
terrible	1
it	1
is	1
and	1
how	1
dangerous.	1
Too	1
soon	1
or	1
too	1
late...	1
it	1
is	1
terrible!"	1
	1
"So	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
orders?	1
Are	1
you	1
starting	1
tomorrow?"	1
asked	1
Savelich.	1
	1
"No,	1
I'll	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
for	1
a	1
bit.	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
later.	1
You	1
must	1
forgive	1
the	1
trouble	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
you	1
to,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
seeing	1
Savelich	1
smile,	1
he	1
thought:	1
"But	1
how	1
strange	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
now	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
Petersburg	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
settled	1
first	1
of	1
all!	1
But	1
probably	1
he	1
knows	1
it	1
well	1
enough	1
and	1
is	1
only	1
pretending.	1
Shall	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
thinks?"	1
Pierre	1
reflected.	1
"No,	1
another	1
time."	1
	1
At	1
breakfast	1
Pierre	1
told	1
the	1
princess,	1
his	1
cousin,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
there	1
met--"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
Natasha	1
Rostova!"	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
nothing	1
more	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
that	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Anna	1
Semenovna.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
her?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
princess,"	1
she	1
replied.	1
"I	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
arranging	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
young	1
Rostov.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
they	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
utterly	1
ruined."	1
	1
"No;	1
I	1
mean	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
Natasha	1
Rostova?"	1
	1
"I	1
heard	1
about	1
that	1
affair	1
of	1
hers	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
pity."	1
	1
"No,	1
she	1
either	1
doesn't	1
understand	1
or	1
is	1
pretending,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"Better	1
not	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
her	1
either."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
too	1
had	1
prepared	1
provisions	1
for	1
Pierre's	1
journey.	1
	1
"How	1
kind	1
they	1
all	1
are,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"What	1
is	1
surprising	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
trouble	1
about	1
these	1
things	1
now	1
when	1
it	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
them.	1
And	1
all	1
for	1
me!"	1
	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
the	1
Chief	1
of	1
Police	1
came	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
inviting	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
representative	1
to	1
the	1
Faceted	1
Palace	1
to	1
recover	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
owners	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
"And	1
this	1
man	1
too,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
of	1
Police.	1
"What	1
a	1
fine,	1
good-looking	1
officer	1
and	1
how	1
kind.	1
Fancy	1
bothering	1
about	1
such	1
trifles	1
now!	1
And	1
they	1
actually	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
honest	1
and	1
takes	1
bribes.	1
What	1
nonsense!	1
Besides,	1
why	1
shouldn't	1
he	1
take	1
bribes?	1
That's	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
up,	1
and	1
everybody	1
does	1
it.	1
But	1
what	1
a	1
kind,	1
pleasant	1
face	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
smiles	1
as	1
he	1
looks	1
at	1
me."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
past	1
the	1
houses	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
down,	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
those	1
ruins.	1
The	1
picturesqueness	1
of	1
the	1
chimney	1
stacks	1
and	1
tumble-down	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
burned-out	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
stretching	1
out	1
and	1
concealing	1
one	1
another,	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine	1
and	1
the	1
Colosseum.	1
The	1
cabmen	1
he	1
met	1
and	1
their	1
passengers,	1
the	1
carpenters	1
cutting	1
the	1
timber	1
for	1
new	1
houses	1
with	1
axes,	1
the	1
women	1
hawkers,	1
and	1
the	1
shopkeepers,	1
all	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
cheerful	1
beaming	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"Ah,	1
there	1
he	1
is!	1
Let's	1
see	1
what	1
will	1
come	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
At	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
house	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
there	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
and	1
really	1
seen	1
Natasha	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
her.	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
imagined	1
it;	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
find	1
no	1
one	1
there."	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
he	1
felt	1
her	1
presence	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
freedom.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
black	1
dress	1
with	1
soft	1
folds	1
and	1
her	1
hair	1
was	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
yet	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
different.	1
Had	1
she	1
been	1
like	1
this	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
recognize	1
her.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
almost	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
later	1
on	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
fiancee.	1
A	1
bright	1
questioning	1
light	1
shone	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
friendly	1
and	1
strangely	1
roguish	1
expression.	1
	1
Pierre	1
dined	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
there,	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
vespers	1
and	1
Pierre	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
he	1
came	1
early,	1
dined,	1
and	1
stayed	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
Though	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
evidently	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
visitor	1
and	1
though	1
all	1
Pierre's	1
interest	1
was	1
now	1
centered	1
in	1
that	1
house,	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
they	1
had	1
talked	1
over	1
everything	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
passed	1
from	1
one	1
trivial	1
topic	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
broke	1
off.	1
He	1
stayed	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Natasha	1
exchanged	1
glances,	1
evidently	1
wondering	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
go.	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
this	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
go.	1
He	1
felt	1
uneasy	1
and	1
embarrassed,	1
but	1
sat	1
on	1
because	1
he	1
simply	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
leave.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
foreseeing	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
this,	1
rose	1
first,	1
and	1
complaining	1
of	1
a	1
headache	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
night.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
tomorrow?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going,"	1
Pierre	1
replied	1
hastily,	1
in	1
a	1
surprised	1
tone	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
offended.	1
"Yes...	1
no...	1
to	1
Petersburg?	1
Tomorrow--but	1
I	1
won't	1
say	1
good-by	1
yet.	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
round	1
in	1
case	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
commissions	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
he,	1
standing	1
before	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
turning	1
red,	1
but	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
departure.	1
	1
Natasha	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
sank	1
into	1
an	1
armchair,	1
and	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
deep,	1
radiant	1
eyes.	1
The	1
weariness	1
she	1
had	1
plainly	1
shown	1
before	1
had	1
now	1
quite	1
passed	1
off.	1
With	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
long-	1
drawn	1
sigh	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
a	1
lengthy	1
talk.	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Pierre's	1
confusion	1
and	1
awkwardness	1
immediately	1
vanished	1
and	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
eager	1
excitement.	1
He	1
quickly	1
moved	1
an	1
armchair	1
toward	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you,"	1
said	1
he,	1
answering	1
her	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
spoken.	1
"Princess,	1
help	1
me!	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?	1
Can	1
I	1
hope?	1
Princess,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
listen!	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
all.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
her,	1
I	1
know	1
it's	1
impossible	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
now.	1
But	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
brother	1
to	1
her.	1
No,	1
not	1
that,	1
I	1
don't,	1
I	1
can't..."	1
	1
He	1
paused	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
"Well,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
an	1
evident	1
effort	1
at	1
self-control	1
and	1
coherence.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
alone	1
all	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
life	1
without	1
her.	1
I	1
cannot	1
propose	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
present,	1
but	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
she	1
might	1
someday	1
be	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
missing	1
that	1
possibility...	1
that	1
possibility...	1
is	1
terrible.	1
Tell	1
me,	1
can	1
I	1
hope?	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do,	1
dear	1
princess!"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
and	1
touched	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me,"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
say.	1
You	1
are	1
right	1
that	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
love	1
at	1
present..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
stopped.	1
She	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
love	1
was	1
impossible,	1
but	1
she	1
stopped	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
sudden	1
change	1
in	1
Natasha	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
if	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
of	1
his	1
love,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
she	1
wished	1
for.	1
	1
"To	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
wouldn't	1
do,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?"	1
	1
"Leave	1
it	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"I	1
know..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
looking	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Well?...	1
Well?..."	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
loves...	1
will	1
love	1
you,"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
corrected	1
herself.	1
	1
Before	1
her	1
words	1
were	1
out,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
expression	1
seized	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
hand.	1
	1
"What	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
You	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
hope?	1
You	1
think...?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
think	1
so,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Write	1
to	1
her	1
parents,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
her	1
when	1
I	1
can.	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
to	1
happen	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
tells	1
me	1
it	1
will."	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be!	1
How	1
happy	1
I	1
am!	1
But	1
it	1
can't	1
be....	1
How	1
happy	1
I	1
am!	1
No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be!"	1
Pierre	1
kept	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
kissed	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
hands.	1
	1
"Go	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
best.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
to	1
you,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"To	1
Petersburg?	1
Go	1
there?	1
Very	1
well,	1
I'll	1
go.	1
But	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
again	1
tomorrow?"	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Pierre	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
good-by.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
less	1
animated	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
day	1
before;	1
but	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
Pierre	1
sometimes	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
vanishing	1
and	1
that	1
neither	1
he	1
nor	1
she	1
existed	1
any	1
longer,	1
that	1
nothing	1
existed	1
but	1
happiness.	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible?	1
No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be,"	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
at	1
every	1
look,	1
gesture,	1
and	1
word	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
When	1
on	1
saying	1
good-by	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
thin,	1
slender	1
hand,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
holding	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
in	1
his	1
own.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
this	1
hand,	1
that	1
face,	1
those	1
eyes,	1
all	1
this	1
treasure	1
of	1
feminine	1
charm	1
so	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
now,	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
one	1
day	1
be	1
mine	1
forever,	1
as	1
familiar	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
myself?...	1
No,	1
that's	1
impossible!..."	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
Count,"	1
she	1
said	1
aloud.	1
"I	1
shall	1
look	1
forward	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
return,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
And	1
these	1
simple	1
words,	1
her	1
look,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
which	1
accompanied	1
them,	1
formed	1
for	1
two	1
months	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
inexhaustible	1
memories,	1
interpretations,	1
and	1
happy	1
meditations	1
for	1
Pierre.	1
"'I	1
shall	1
look	1
forward	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
return....'	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
how	1
did	1
she	1
say	1
it?	1
Yes,	1
'I	1
shall	1
look	1
forward	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
return.'	1
Oh,	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
am!	1
What	1
is	1
happening	1
to	1
me?	1
How	1
happy	1
I	1
am!"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
soul	1
now	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
what	1
had	1
troubled	1
it	1
during	1
his	1
courtship	1
of	1
Helene.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
repeat	1
to	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
sickening	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
spoken,	1
or	1
say:	1
"Oh,	1
why	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
say	1
that?"	1
and,	1
"Whatever	1
made	1
me	1
say	1
'Je	1
vous	1
aime'?"	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
now	1
repeated	1
in	1
imagination	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
he	1
or	1
Natasha	1
had	1
spoken	1
and	1
pictured	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
smile,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
diminish	1
or	1
add	1
anything,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
repeat	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again.	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
doubt	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
undertaken	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong.	1
Only	1
one	1
terrible	1
doubt	1
sometimes	1
crossed	1
his	1
mind:	1
"Wasn't	1
it	1
all	1
a	1
dream?	1
Isn't	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
mistaken?	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
too	1
conceited	1
and	1
self-	1
confident?	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
this--and	1
suddenly	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
will	1
tell	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
smile	1
and	1
say:	1
'How	1
strange!	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
deluding	1
himself.	1
Doesn't	1
he	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man,	1
just	1
a	1
man,	1
while	1
I...?	1
I	1
am	1
something	1
altogether	1
different	1
and	1
higher.'"	1
	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
doubt	1
often	1
troubling	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
make	1
any	1
plans.	1
The	1
happiness	1
before	1
him	1
appeared	1
so	1
inconceivable	1
that	1
if	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
attain	1
it,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
things.	1
Everything	1
ended	1
with	1
that.	1
	1
A	1
joyful,	1
unexpected	1
frenzy,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
himself	1
incapable,	1
possessed	1
him.	1
The	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
life--not	1
for	1
him	1
alone	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world--seemed	1
to	1
him	1
centered	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
being	1
loved	1
by	1
her.	1
At	1
times	1
everybody	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
occupied	1
with	1
one	1
thing	1
only--his	1
future	1
happiness.	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
other	1
people	1
were	1
all	1
as	1
pleased	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
and	1
merely	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
that	1
pleasure	1
by	1
pretending	1
to	1
be	1
busy	1
with	1
other	1
interests.	1
In	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
gesture	1
he	1
saw	1
allusions	1
to	1
his	1
happiness.	1
He	1
often	1
surprised	1
those	1
he	1
met	1
by	1
his	1
significantly	1
happy	1
looks	1
and	1
smiles	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
express	1
a	1
secret	1
understanding	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
people	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
happiness,	1
he	1
pitied	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
heart	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
desire	1
somehow	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
occupied	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
frivolous	1
trifle	1
unworthy	1
of	1
attention.	1
	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
enter	1
the	1
civil	1
service,	1
or	1
when	1
the	1
war	1
or	1
any	1
general	1
political	1
affairs	1
were	1
discussed	1
on	1
the	1
assumption	1
that	1
everybody's	1
welfare	1
depended	1
on	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
issue	1
of	1
events,	1
he	1
would	1
listen	1
with	1
a	1
mild	1
and	1
pitying	1
smile	1
and	1
surprise	1
people	1
by	1
his	1
strange	1
comments.	1
But	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
saw	1
everybody--both	1
those	1
who,	1
as	1
he	1
imagined,	1
understood	1
the	1
real	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
(that	1
is,	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
feeling)	1
and	1
those	1
unfortunates	1
who	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
it--in	1
the	1
bright	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
emotion	1
that	1
shone	1
within	1
himself,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
any	1
effort	1
saw	1
in	1
everyone	1
he	1
met	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
loved.	1
	1
When	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
affairs	1
and	1
papers	1
of	1
his	1
dead	1
wife,	1
her	1
memory	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
no	1
feeling	1
but	1
pity	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
bliss	1
he	1
now	1
knew.	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
having	1
obtained	1
a	1
new	1
post	1
and	1
some	1
fresh	1
decorations	1
was	1
particularly	1
proud	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
pathetic,	1
kindly	1
old	1
man	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied.	1
	1
Often	1
in	1
afterlife	1
Pierre	1
recalled	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
blissful	1
insanity.	1
All	1
the	1
views	1
he	1
formed	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
circumstances	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
remained	1
true	1
for	1
him	1
always.	1
He	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
not	1
renounce	1
them	1
subsequently,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
or	1
inwardly	1
at	1
variance,	1
he	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
he	1
had	1
held	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
madness	1
and	1
they	1
always	1
proved	1
correct.	1
	1
"I	1
may	1
have	1
appeared	1
strange	1
and	1
queer	1
then,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"but	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
mad	1
as	1
I	1
seemed.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
wiser	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
insight	1
than	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
time,	1
and	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
worth	1
understanding	1
in	1
life,	1
because...	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
happy."	1
	1
Pierre's	1
insanity	1
consisted	1
in	1
not	1
waiting,	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
do,	1
to	1
discover	1
personal	1
attributes	1
which	1
he	1
termed	1
"good	1
qualities"	1
in	1
people	1
before	1
loving	1
them;	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
now	1
overflowing	1
with	1
love,	1
and	1
by	1
loving	1
people	1
without	1
cause	1
he	1
discovered	1
indubitable	1
causes	1
for	1
loving	1
them.	1

CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
After	1
Pierre's	1
departure	1
that	1
first	1
evening,	1
when	1
Natasha	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
gaily	1
mocking	1
smile:	1
"He	1
looks	1
just,	1
yes,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
Russian	1
bath--in	1
a	1
short	1
coat	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hair	1
cropped,"	1
something	1
hidden	1
and	1
unknown	1
to	1
herself,	1
but	1
irrepressible,	1
awoke	1
in	1
Natasha's	1
soul.	1
	1
Everything:	1
her	1
face,	1
walk,	1
look,	1
and	1
voice,	1
was	1
suddenly	1
altered.	1
To	1
her	1
own	1
surprise	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
hope	1
of	1
happiness	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
demanded	1
satisfaction.	1
From	1
that	1
evening	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
no	1
longer	1
complained	1
of	1
her	1
position,	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
feared	1
to	1
make	1
happy	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
She	1
spoke	1
little	1
of	1
Pierre,	1
but	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
mentioned	1
him	1
a	1
long-extinguished	1
light	1
once	1
more	1
kindled	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
curved	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
smile.	1
	1
	1
The	1
change	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
Natasha	1
at	1
first	1
surprised	1
Princess	1
Mary;	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
understood	1
its	1
meaning	1
it	1
grieved	1
her.	1
"Can	1
she	1
have	1
loved	1
my	1
brother	1
so	1
little	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
forget	1
him	1
so	1
soon?"	1
she	1
thought	1
when	1
she	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
change.	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
Natasha	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
vexed	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reproach	1
her.	1
The	1
reawakened	1
power	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
Natasha	1
was	1
so	1
evidently	1
irrepressible	1
and	1
unexpected	1
by	1
her	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
reproach	1
her	1
even	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
Natasha	1
gave	1
herself	1
up	1
so	1
fully	1
and	1
frankly	1
to	1
this	1
new	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
sad,	1
but	1
bright	1
and	1
cheerful.	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
after	1
her	1
nocturnal	1
talk	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
Natasha	1
met	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
threshold.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
spoken?	1
Yes?	1
He	1
has	1
spoken?"	1
she	1
repeated.	1
	1
And	1
a	1
joyful	1
yet	1
pathetic	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
beg	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
her	1
joy	1
settled	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
face.	1
	1
"I	1
wanted	1
to	1
listen	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
tell	1
me."	1
	1
Understandable	1
and	1
touching	1
as	1
the	1
look	1
with	1
which	1
Natasha	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
seemed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
sorry	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
agitation,	1
these	1
words	1
pained	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
She	1
remembered	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
love.	1
	1
"But	1
what's	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
She	1
can't	1
help	1
it,"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
and	1
rather	1
stern	1
look	1
she	1
told	1
Natasha	1
all	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
said.	1
On	1
hearing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
Natasha	1
was	1
astounded.	1
	1
"To	1
Petersburg!"	1
she	1
repeated	1
as	1
if	1
unable	1
to	1
understand.	1
	1
But	1
noticing	1
the	1
grieved	1
expression	1
on	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face	1
she	1
guessed	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
that	1
sadness	1
and	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Mary,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do!	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
bad.	1
Whatever	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
do.	1
Tell	1
me...."	1
	1
"You	1
love	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
whispered	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Then	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
crying?	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
for	1
your	1
sake,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
tears	1
quite	1
forgave	1
Natasha's	1
joy.	1
	1
"It	1
won't	1
be	1
just	1
yet--someday.	1
Think	1
what	1
fun	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
you	1
marry	1
Nicholas!"	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
that.	1
Let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
you."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
awhile.	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg?"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
asked,	1
and	1
hastily	1
replied	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
question.	1
"But	1
no,	1
no,	1
he	1
must...	1
Yes,	1
Mary,	1
He	1
must...."	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Seven	1
years	1
had	1
passed.	1
The	1
storm-tossed	1
sea	1
of	1
European	1
history	1
had	1
subsided	1
within	1
its	1
shores	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
become	1
calm.	1
But	1
the	1
mysterious	1
forces	1
that	1
move	1
humanity	1
(mysterious	1
because	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
their	1
motion	1
are	1
unknown	1
to	1
us)	1
continued	1
to	1
operate.	1
	1
Though	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
history	1
seemed	1
motionless,	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
unceasingly	1
as	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
time.	1
Various	1
groups	1
of	1
people	1
formed	1
and	1
dissolved,	1
the	1
coming	1
formation	1
and	1
dissolution	1
of	1
kingdoms	1
and	1
displacement	1
of	1
peoples	1
was	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
preparation.	1
	1
The	1
sea	1
of	1
history	1
was	1
not	1
driven	1
spasmodically	1
from	1
shore	1
to	1
shore	1
as	1
previously.	1
It	1
was	1
seething	1
in	1
its	1
depths.	1
Historic	1
figures	1
were	1
not	1
borne	1
by	1
the	1
waves	1
from	1
one	1
shore	1
to	1
another	1
as	1
before.	1
They	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
rotate	1
on	1
one	1
spot.	1
The	1
historical	1
figures	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
armies,	1
who	1
formerly	1
reflected	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
masses	1
by	1
ordering	1
wars,	1
campaigns,	1
and	1
battles,	1
now	1
reflected	1
the	1
restless	1
movement	1
by	1
political	1
and	1
diplomatic	1
combinations,	1
laws,	1
and	1
treaties.	1
	1
The	1
historians	1
call	1
this	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
historical	1
figures	1
"the	1
reaction."	1
	1
In	1
dealing	1
with	1
this	1
period	1
they	1
sternly	1
condemn	1
the	1
historical	1
personages	1
who,	1
in	1
their	1
opinion,	1
caused	1
what	1
they	1
describe	1
as	1
the	1
reaction.	1
All	1
the	1
well-known	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
period,	1
from	1
Alexander	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
Photius,	1
Schelling,	1
Fichte,	1
Chateaubriand,	1
and	1
the	1
rest,	1
pass	1
before	1
their	1
stern	1
judgment	1
seat	1
and	1
are	1
acquitted	1
or	1
condemned	1
according	1
to	1
whether	1
they	1
conduced	1
to	1
progress	1
or	1
to	1
reaction.	1
	1
According	1
to	1
their	1
accounts	1
a	1
reaction	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
Russia	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
culprit	1
was	1
Alexander	1
I,	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
who	1
according	1
to	1
them	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
liberal	1
movement	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
being	1
the	1
savior	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
Russian	1
literature	1
now,	1
from	1
schoolboy	1
essayist	1
to	1
learned	1
historian,	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
throw	1
his	1
little	1
stone	1
at	1
Alexander	1
for	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
wrong	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
	1
"He	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
acted	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
In	1
this	1
case	1
he	1
did	1
well	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
badly.	1
He	1
behaved	1
admirably	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
and	1
during	1
1812,	1
but	1
acted	1
badly	1
by	1
giving	1
a	1
constitution	1
to	1
Poland,	1
forming	1
the	1
Holy	1
Alliance,	1
entrusting	1
power	1
to	1
Arakcheev,	1
favoring	1
Golitsyn	1
and	1
mysticism,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
Shishkov	1
and	1
Photius.	1
He	1
also	1
acted	1
badly	1
by	1
concerning	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
active	1
army	1
and	1
disbanding	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment."	1
	1
It	1
would	1
take	1
a	1
dozen	1
pages	1
to	1
enumerate	1
all	1
the	1
reproaches	1
the	1
historians	1
address	1
to	1
him,	1
based	1
on	1
their	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
humanity.	1
	1
What	1
do	1
these	1
reproaches	1
mean?	1
	1
Do	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
actions	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
historians	1
praise	1
Alexander	1
I	1
(the	1
liberal	1
attempts	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
his	1
struggle	1
with	1
Napoleon,	1
the	1
firmness	1
he	1
displayed	1
in	1
1812	1
and	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1813)	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
sources--the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
birth,	1
education,	1
and	1
life--that	1
made	1
his	1
personality	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
actions	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
blame	1
him	1
(the	1
Holy	1
Alliance,	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
Poland,	1
and	1
the	1
reaction	1
of	1
1820	1
and	1
later)	1
also	1
flowed?	1
	1
In	1
what	1
does	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
those	1
reproaches	1
lie?	1
	1
It	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
an	1
historic	1
character	1
like	1
Alexander	1
I,	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
highest	1
possible	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
human	1
power	1
with	1
the	1
blinding	1
light	1
of	1
history	1
focused	1
upon	1
him;	1
a	1
character	1
exposed	1
to	1
those	1
strongest	1
of	1
all	1
influences:	1
the	1
intrigues,	1
flattery,	1
and	1
self-deception	1
inseparable	1
from	1
power;	1
a	1
character	1
who	1
at	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
felt	1
a	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
Europe;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
fictitious	1
but	1
a	1
live	1
character	1
who	1
like	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
his	1
personal	1
habits,	1
passions,	1
and	1
impulses	1
toward	1
goodness,	1
beauty,	1
and	1
truth--that	1
this	1
character--though	1
not	1
lacking	1
in	1
virtue	1
(the	1
historians	1
do	1
not	1
accuse	1
him	1
of	1
that)--had	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
humanity	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago	1
as	1
a	1
present-day	1
professor	1
who	1
from	1
his	1
youth	1
upwards	1
has	1
been	1
occupied	1
with	1
learning:	1
that	1
is,	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
lectures	1
and	1
with	1
taking	1
notes	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
assume	1
that	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago	1
Alexander	1
I	1
was	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
we	1
must	1
inevitably	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
historian	1
who	1
judges	1
Alexander	1
will	1
also	1
after	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
some	1
time	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
humanity.	1
This	1
assumption	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
inevitable	1
because,	1
watching	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
history,	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
every	1
year	1
and	1
with	1
each	1
new	1
writer,	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
mankind	1
changes;	1
so	1
that	1
what	1
once	1
seemed	1
good,	1
ten	1
years	1
later	1
seems	1
bad,	1
and	1
vice	1
versa.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
we	1
find	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
quite	1
contradictory	1
views	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
bad	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
history:	1
some	1
people	1
regard	1
giving	1
a	1
constitution	1
to	1
Poland	1
and	1
forming	1
the	1
Holy	1
Alliance	1
as	1
praiseworthy	1
in	1
Alexander,	1
while	1
others	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
blameworthy.	1
	1
The	1
activity	1
of	1
Alexander	1
or	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
cannot	1
be	1
called	1
useful	1
or	1
harmful,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
useful	1
or	1
harmful.	1
If	1
that	1
activity	1
displeases	1
somebody,	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
his	1
limited	1
understanding	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
good.	1
Whether	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
arms,	1
or	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
other	1
universities,	1
or	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
Poland	1
or	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Russia,	1
or	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
Europe,	1
or	1
a	1
certain	1
kind	1
of	1
European	1
culture	1
called	1
"progress"	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
I	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
besides	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
every	1
historic	1
character	1
has	1
other	1
more	1
general	1
purposes	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
assume	1
that	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
science	1
can	1
harmonize	1
all	1
contradictions	1
and	1
possesses	1
an	1
unchanging	1
standard	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
bad	1
by	1
which	1
to	1
try	1
historic	1
characters	1
and	1
events;	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
that	1
Alexander	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
everything	1
differently;	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
that	1
with	1
guidance	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
blame	1
him	1
and	1
who	1
profess	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
ultimate	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
arranged	1
matters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
program	1
his	1
present	1
accusers	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
him--of	1
nationality,	1
freedom,	1
equality,	1
and	1
progress	1
(these,	1
I	1
think,	1
cover	1
the	1
ground).	1
Let	1
us	1
assume	1
that	1
this	1
program	1
was	1
possible	1
and	1
had	1
then	1
been	1
formulated,	1
and	1
that	1
Alexander	1
had	1
acted	1
on	1
it.	1
What	1
would	1
then	1
have	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
opposed	1
the	1
tendency	1
that	1
then	1
prevailed	1
in	1
the	1
government--an	1
activity	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
historians	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
beneficent?	1
Their	1
activity	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
existed:	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
life,	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
nothing.	1
	1
If	1
we	1
admit	1
that	1
human	1
life	1
can	1
be	1
ruled	1
by	1
reason,	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
destroyed.	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
If	1
we	1
assume	1
as	1
the	1
historians	1
do	1
that	1
great	1
men	1
lead	1
humanity	1
to	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
certain	1
ends--the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Russia	1
or	1
of	1
France,	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
Europe,	1
the	1
diffusion	1
of	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
general	1
progress,	1
or	1
anything	1
else--then	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
history	1
without	1
introducing	1
the	1
conceptions	1
of	1
chance	1
and	1
genius.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
wars	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
Russia,	1
that	1
aim	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
accomplished	1
without	1
all	1
the	1
preceding	1
wars	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
invasion.	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
France,	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
attained	1
without	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
Empire.	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
dissemination	1
of	1
ideas,	1
the	1
printing	1
press	1
could	1
have	1
accomplished	1
that	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
warfare.	1
If	1
the	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
civilization,	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
ways	1
of	1
diffusing	1
civilization	1
more	1
expedient	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
of	1
human	1
lives.	1
	1
Why	1
did	1
it	1
happen	1
in	1
this	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
way?	1
	1
Because	1
it	1
happened	1
so!	1
"Chance	1
created	1
the	1
situation;	1
genius	1
utilized	1
it,"	1
says	1
history.	1
	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
chance?	1
What	1
is	1
genius?	1
	1
The	1
words	1
chance	1
and	1
genius	1
do	1
not	1
denote	1
any	1
really	1
existing	1
thing	1
and	1
therefore	1
cannot	1
be	1
defined.	1
Those	1
words	1
only	1
denote	1
a	1
certain	1
stage	1
of	1
understanding	1
of	1
phenomena.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
why	1
a	1
certain	1
event	1
occurs;	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
know	1
it;	1
so	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
talk	1
about	1
chance.	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
force	1
producing	1
effects	1
beyond	1
the	1
scope	1
of	1
ordinary	1
human	1
agencies;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
this	1
occurs	1
and	1
I	1
talk	1
of	1
genius.	1
	1
To	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
rams,	1
the	1
ram	1
the	1
herdsman	1
drives	1
each	1
evening	1
into	1
a	1
special	1
enclosure	1
to	1
feed	1
and	1
that	1
becomes	1
twice	1
as	1
fat	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
genius.	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
appear	1
an	1
astonishing	1
conjunction	1
of	1
genius	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
extraordinary	1
chances	1
that	1
this	1
ram,	1
who	1
instead	1
of	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
general	1
fold	1
every	1
evening	1
goes	1
into	1
a	1
special	1
enclosure	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
oats--that	1
this	1
very	1
ram,	1
swelling	1
with	1
fat,	1
is	1
killed	1
for	1
meat.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
rams	1
need	1
only	1
cease	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
happens	1
to	1
them	1
happens	1
solely	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
their	1
sheepish	1
aims;	1
they	1
need	1
only	1
admit	1
that	1
what	1
happens	1
to	1
them	1
may	1
also	1
have	1
purposes	1
beyond	1
their	1
ken,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
perceive	1
a	1
unity	1
and	1
coherence	1
in	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
ram	1
that	1
was	1
fattened.	1
Even	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
for	1
what	1
purpose	1
they	1
are	1
fattened,	1
they	1
will	1
at	1
least	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
ram	1
did	1
not	1
happen	1
accidentally,	1
and	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
need	1
the	1
conceptions	1
of	1
chance	1
or	1
genius.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
renouncing	1
our	1
claim	1
to	1
discern	1
a	1
purpose	1
immediately	1
intelligible	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
admitting	1
the	1
ultimate	1
purpose	1
to	1
be	1
beyond	1
our	1
ken,	1
may	1
we	1
discern	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
experiences	1
in	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
historic	1
characters	1
and	1
perceive	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
they	1
produce	1
(incommensurable	1
with	1
ordinary	1
human	1
capabilities),	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
words	1
chance	1
and	1
genius	1
become	1
superfluous.	1
	1
We	1
need	1
only	1
confess	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
convulsions	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
only	1
the	1
facts--that	1
is,	1
the	1
murders,	1
first	1
in	1
France,	1
then	1
in	1
Italy,	1
in	1
Africa,	1
in	1
Prussia,	1
in	1
Austria,	1
in	1
Spain,	1
and	1
in	1
Russia--and	1
that	1
the	1
movements	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
form	1
the	1
essence	1
and	1
purpose	1
of	1
these	1
events,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
shall	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
see	1
exceptional	1
ability	1
and	1
genius	1
in	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
consider	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
like	1
other	1
men,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
chance	1
for	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
those	1
small	1
events	1
which	1
made	1
these	1
people	1
what	1
they	1
were,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
clear	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
small	1
events	1
were	1
inevitable.	1
	1
By	1
discarding	1
a	1
claim	1
to	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
ultimate	1
purpose,	1
we	1
shall	1
clearly	1
perceive	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
one	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
a	1
blossom	1
or	1
seed	1
for	1
any	1
single	1
plant	1
better	1
suited	1
to	1
it	1
than	1
those	1
it	1
produces,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
two	1
people	1
more	1
completely	1
adapted	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
smallest	1
detail	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
fulfill,	1
than	1
Napoleon	1
and	1
Alexander	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
antecedents.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
The	1
fundamental	1
and	1
essential	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
peoples	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east	1
and	1
afterwards	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west.	1
The	1
commencement	1
of	1
that	1
movement	1
was	1
the	1
movement	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
For	1
the	1
peoples	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
warlike	1
movement	1
to	1
Moscow	1
it	1
was	1
necessary:	1
(1)	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
form	1
themselves	1
into	1
a	1
military	1
group	1
of	1
a	1
size	1
able	1
to	1
endure	1
a	1
collision	1
with	1
the	1
warlike	1
military	1
group	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
(2)	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
abandon	1
all	1
established	1
traditions	1
and	1
customs,	1
and	1
(3)	1
that	1
during	1
their	1
military	1
movement	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
at	1
their	1
head	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
justify	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
deceptions,	1
robberies,	1
and	1
murders	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
committed	1
during	1
that	1
movement.	1
	1
And	1
beginning	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution	1
the	1
old	1
inadequately	1
large	1
group	1
was	1
destroyed,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
habits	1
and	1
traditions,	1
and	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
a	1
group	1
was	1
formed	1
of	1
larger	1
dimensions	1
with	1
new	1
customs	1
and	1
traditions,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
produced	1
who	1
would	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
movement	1
and	1
bear	1
the	1
responsibility	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
A	1
man	1
without	1
convictions,	1
without	1
habits,	1
without	1
traditions,	1
without	1
a	1
name,	1
and	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
emerges--by	1
what	1
seem	1
the	1
strangest	1
chances--from	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
seething	1
French	1
parties,	1
and	1
without	1
joining	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
borne	1
forward	1
to	1
a	1
prominent	1
position.	1
	1
The	1
ignorance	1
of	1
his	1
colleagues,	1
the	1
weakness	1
and	1
insignificance	1
of	1
his	1
opponents,	1
the	1
frankness	1
of	1
his	1
falsehoods,	1
and	1
the	1
dazzling	1
and	1
self-	1
confident	1
limitations	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
raise	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
The	1
brilliant	1
qualities	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
sent	1
to	1
Italy,	1
his	1
opponents'	1
reluctance	1
to	1
fight,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
childish	1
audacity	1
and	1
self-	1
confidence	1
secure	1
him	1
military	1
fame.	1
Innumerable	1
so-called	1
chances	1
accompany	1
him	1
everywhere.	1
The	1
disfavor	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
falls	1
with	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
France	1
turns	1
to	1
his	1
advantage.	1
His	1
attempts	1
to	1
avoid	1
his	1
predestined	1
path	1
are	1
unsuccessful:	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
received	1
into	1
the	1
Russian	1
service,	1
and	1
the	1
appointment	1
he	1
seeks	1
in	1
Turkey	1
comes	1
to	1
nothing.	1
During	1
the	1
war	1
in	1
Italy	1
he	1
is	1
several	1
times	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
destruction	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
is	1
saved	1
in	1
an	1
unexpected	1
manner.	1
Owing	1
to	1
various	1
diplomatic	1
considerations	1
the	1
Russian	1
armies--just	1
those	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
destroyed	1
his	1
prestige--do	1
not	1
appear	1
upon	1
the	1
scene	1
till	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
there.	1
	1
On	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
Italy	1
he	1
finds	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
Paris	1
in	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
dissolution	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
it	1
are	1
inevitably	1
wiped	1
out	1
and	1
destroyed.	1
And	1
by	1
chance	1
an	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
dangerous	1
position	1
presents	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
an	1
aimless	1
and	1
senseless	1
expedition	1
to	1
Africa.	1
Again	1
so-called	1
chance	1
accompanies	1
him.	1
Impregnable	1
Malta	1
surrenders	1
without	1
a	1
shot;	1
his	1
most	1
reckless	1
schemes	1
are	1
crowned	1
with	1
success.	1
The	1
enemy's	1
fleet,	1
which	1
subsequently	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
a	1
single	1
boat	1
pass,	1
allows	1
his	1
entire	1
army	1
to	1
elude	1
it.	1
In	1
Africa	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
outrages	1
are	1
committed	1
against	1
the	1
almost	1
unarmed	1
inhabitants.	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
commit	1
these	1
crimes,	1
especially	1
their	1
leader,	1
assure	1
themselves	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
admirable,	1
this	1
is	1
glory--it	1
resembles	1
Caesar	1
and	1
Alexander	1
the	1
Great	1
and	1
is	1
therefore	1
good.	1
	1
This	1
ideal	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
grandeur--which	1
consists	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
considering	1
nothing	1
wrong	1
that	1
one	1
does	1
but	1
in	1
priding	1
oneself	1
on	1
every	1
crime	1
one	1
commits,	1
ascribing	1
to	1
it	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
supernatural	1
significance--that	1
ideal,	1
destined	1
to	1
guide	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
associates,	1
had	1
scope	1
for	1
its	1
development	1
in	1
Africa.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
does	1
succeeds.	1
The	1
plague	1
does	1
not	1
touch	1
him.	1
The	1
cruelty	1
of	1
murdering	1
prisoners	1
is	1
not	1
imputed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
fault.	1
His	1
childishly	1
rash,	1
uncalled-for,	1
and	1
ignoble	1
departure	1
from	1
Africa,	1
leaving	1
his	1
comrades	1
in	1
distress,	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
credit,	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fleet	1
twice	1
lets	1
him	1
slip	1
past.	1
When,	1
intoxicated	1
by	1
the	1
crimes	1
he	1
has	1
committed	1
so	1
successfully,	1
he	1
reaches	1
Paris,	1
the	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
republican	1
government,	1
which	1
a	1
year	1
earlier	1
might	1
have	1
ruined	1
him,	1
has	1
reached	1
its	1
extreme	1
limit,	1
and	1
his	1
presence	1
there	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
newcomer	1
free	1
from	1
party	1
entanglements	1
can	1
only	1
serve	1
to	1
exalt	1
him--and	1
though	1
he	1
himself	1
has	1
no	1
plan,	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
ready	1
for	1
his	1
new	1
role.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
plan,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
everything,	1
but	1
the	1
parties	1
snatched	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
demanded	1
his	1
participation.	1
	1
He	1
alone--with	1
his	1
ideal	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
grandeur	1
developed	1
in	1
Italy	1
and	1
Egypt,	1
his	1
insane	1
self-adulation,	1
his	1
boldness	1
in	1
crime	1
and	1
frankness	1
in	1
lying--he	1
alone	1
could	1
justify	1
what	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
He	1
is	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
awaits	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
almost	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
indecision,	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
a	1
plan,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
mistakes,	1
he	1
is	1
drawn	1
into	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
that	1
aims	1
at	1
seizing	1
power	1
and	1
the	1
conspiracy	1
is	1
crowned	1
with	1
success.	1
	1
He	1
is	1
pushed	1
into	1
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
In	1
alarm	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
flee,	1
considering	1
himself	1
lost.	1
He	1
pretends	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
swoon	1
and	1
says	1
senseless	1
things	1
that	1
should	1
have	1
ruined	1
him.	1
But	1
the	1
once	1
proud	1
and	1
shrewd	1
rulers	1
of	1
France,	1
feeling	1
that	1
their	1
part	1
is	1
played	1
out,	1
are	1
even	1
more	1
bewildered	1
than	1
he,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
the	1
words	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
and	1
retain	1
their	1
power.	1
	1
Chance,	1
millions	1
of	1
chances,	1
give	1
him	1
power,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
agreement	1
co-operate	1
to	1
confirm	1
that	1
power.	1
Chance	1
forms	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
France,	1
who	1
submit	1
to	1
him;	1
chance	1
forms	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
Paul	1
I	1
of	1
Russia	1
who	1
recognizes	1
his	1
government;	1
chance	1
contrives	1
a	1
plot	1
against	1
him	1
which	1
not	1
only	1
fails	1
to	1
harm	1
him	1
but	1
confirms	1
his	1
power.	1
Chance	1
puts	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
causes	1
him	1
to	1
kill	1
him--thereby	1
convincing	1
the	1
mob	1
more	1
forcibly	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
right,	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
might.	1
Chance	1
contrives	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
directs	1
all	1
his	1
efforts	1
to	1
prepare	1
an	1
expedition	1
against	1
England	1
(which	1
would	1
inevitably	1
have	1
ruined	1
him)	1
he	1
never	1
carries	1
out	1
that	1
intention,	1
but	1
unexpectedly	1
falls	1
upon	1
Mack	1
and	1
the	1
Austrians,	1
who	1
surrender	1
without	1
a	1
battle.	1
Chance	1
and	1
genius	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
victory	1
at	1
Austerlitz;	1
and	1
by	1
chance	1
all	1
men,	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
French	1
but	1
all	1
Europe--except	1
England	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
events	1
about	1
to	1
happen--despite	1
their	1
former	1
horror	1
and	1
detestation	1
of	1
his	1
crimes,	1
now	1
recognize	1
his	1
authority,	1
the	1
title	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
ideal	1
of	1
grandeur	1
and	1
glory,	1
which	1
seems	1
excellent	1
and	1
reasonable	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
As	1
if	1
measuring	1
themselves	1
and	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
movement,	1
the	1
western	1
forces	1
push	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
1805,	1
1806,	1
1807,	1
and	1
1809,	1
gaining	1
strength	1
and	1
growing.	1
In	1
1811	1
the	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
that	1
had	1
formed	1
in	1
France	1
unites	1
into	1
one	1
group	1
with	1
the	1
peoples	1
of	1
Central	1
Europe.	1
The	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
justification	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
stands	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
grows	1
with	1
the	1
increased	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
group.	1
During	1
the	1
ten-year	1
preparatory	1
period	1
this	1
man	1
had	1
formed	1
relations	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
crowned	1
heads	1
of	1
Europe.	1
The	1
discredited	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
can	1
oppose	1
no	1
reasonable	1
ideal	1
to	1
the	1
insensate	1
Napoleonic	1
ideal	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
grandeur.	1
One	1
after	1
another	1
they	1
hasten	1
to	1
display	1
their	1
insignificance	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
sends	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
great	1
man's	1
mercy;	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Austria	1
considers	1
it	1
a	1
favor	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
receives	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
Caesars	1
into	1
his	1
bed;	1
the	1
Pope,	1
the	1
guardian	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
nations	1
hold	1
sacred,	1
utilizes	1
religion	1
for	1
the	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
man.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
Napoleon	1
who	1
prepares	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
his	1
role,	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
all	1
those	1
round	1
him	1
who	1
prepare	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
on	1
himself	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
happening	1
and	1
has	1
to	1
happen.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
step,	1
no	1
crime	1
or	1
petty	1
fraud	1
he	1
commits,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
represented	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
deed.	1
The	1
most	1
suitable	1
fete	1
the	1
Germans	1
can	1
devise	1
for	1
him	1
is	1
a	1
celebration	1
of	1
Jena	1
and	1
Auerstadt.	1
Not	1
only	1
is	1
he	1
great,	1
but	1
so	1
are	1
his	1
ancestors,	1
his	1
brothers,	1
his	1
stepsons,	1
and	1
his	1
brothers-in-law.	1
Everything	1
is	1
done	1
to	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1
reason	1
and	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
terrible	1
part.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
ready	1
so	1
too	1
are	1
the	1
forces.	1
	1
The	1
invasion	1
pushes	1
eastward	1
and	1
reaches	1
its	1
final	1
goal--Moscow.	1
That	1
city	1
is	1
taken;	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
suffers	1
heavier	1
losses	1
than	1
the	1
opposing	1
armies	1
had	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
war	1
from	1
Austerlitz	1
to	1
Wagram.	1
But	1
suddenly	1
instead	1
of	1
those	1
chances	1
and	1
that	1
genius	1
which	1
hitherto	1
had	1
so	1
consistently	1
led	1
him	1
by	1
an	1
uninterrupted	1
series	1
of	1
successes	1
to	1
the	1
predestined	1
goal,	1
an	1
innumerable	1
sequence	1
of	1
inverse	1
chances	1
occur--from	1
the	1
cold	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
Borodino	1
to	1
the	1
sparks	1
which	1
set	1
Moscow	1
on	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
frosts--and	1
instead	1
of	1
genius,	1
stupidity	1
and	1
immeasurable	1
baseness	1
become	1
evident.	1
	1
The	1
invaders	1
flee,	1
turn	1
back,	1
flee	1
again,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
chances	1
are	1
now	1
not	1
for	1
Napoleon	1
but	1
always	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
A	1
countermovement	1
is	1
then	1
accomplished	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west	1
with	1
a	1
remarkable	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
preceding	1
movement	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
Attempted	1
drives	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west--similar	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
movements	1
of	1
1805,	1
1807,	1
and	1
1809--precede	1
the	1
great	1
westward	1
movement;	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
coalescence	1
into	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
enormous	1
dimensions;	1
the	1
same	1
adhesion	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Central	1
Europe	1
to	1
the	1
movement;	1
the	1
same	1
hesitation	1
midway,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
increasing	1
rapidity	1
as	1
the	1
goal	1
is	1
approached.	1
	1
Paris,	1
the	1
ultimate	1
goal,	1
is	1
reached.	1
The	1
Napoleonic	1
government	1
and	1
army	1
are	1
destroyed.	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
of	1
any	1
account;	1
all	1
his	1
actions	1
are	1
evidently	1
pitiful	1
and	1
mean,	1
but	1
again	1
an	1
inexplicable	1
chance	1
occurs.	1
The	1
allies	1
detest	1
Napoleon	1
whom	1
they	1
regard	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
sufferings.	1
Deprived	1
of	1
power	1
and	1
authority,	1
his	1
crimes	1
and	1
his	1
craft	1
exposed,	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
appeared	1
to	1
them	1
what	1
he	1
appeared	1
ten	1
years	1
previously	1
and	1
one	1
year	1
later--an	1
outlawed	1
brigand.	1
But	1
by	1
some	1
strange	1
chance	1
no	1
one	1
perceives	1
this.	1
His	1
part	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
ended.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
ten	1
years	1
before	1
and	1
a	1
year	1
later	1
was	1
considered	1
an	1
outlawed	1
brigand	1
is	1
sent	1
to	1
an	1
island	1
two	1
days'	1
sail	1
from	1
France,	1
which	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
is	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
dominion,	1
and	1
guards	1
are	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
money	1
are	1
paid	1
him.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
The	1
flood	1
of	1
nations	1
begins	1
to	1
subside	1
into	1
its	1
normal	1
channels.	1
The	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
movement	1
abate,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
calm	1
surface	1
eddies	1
are	1
formed	1
in	1
which	1
float	1
the	1
diplomatists,	1
who	1
imagine	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
caused	1
the	1
floods	1
to	1
abate.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
smooth	1
sea	1
again	1
suddenly	1
becomes	1
disturbed.	1
The	1
diplomatists	1
think	1
that	1
their	1
disagreements	1
are	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
fresh	1
pressure	1
of	1
natural	1
forces;	1
they	1
anticipate	1
war	1
between	1
their	1
sovereigns;	1
the	1
position	1
seems	1
to	1
them	1
insoluble.	1
But	1
the	1
wave	1
they	1
feel	1
to	1
be	1
rising	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
quarter	1
they	1
expect.	1
It	1
rises	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
as	1
before--Paris.	1
The	1
last	1
backwash	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
occurs:	1
a	1
backwash	1
which	1
serves	1
to	1
solve	1
the	1
apparently	1
insuperable	1
diplomatic	1
difficulties	1
and	1
ends	1
the	1
military	1
movement	1
of	1
that	1
period	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
devastated	1
France	1
returns	1
to	1
France	1
alone,	1
without	1
any	1
conspiracy	1
and	1
without	1
soldiers.	1
Any	1
guard	1
might	1
arrest	1
him,	1
but	1
by	1
strange	1
chance	1
no	1
one	1
does	1
so	1
and	1
all	1
rapturously	1
greet	1
the	1
man	1
they	1
cursed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
will	1
curse	1
again	1
a	1
month	1
later.	1
	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
still	1
needed	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
final	1
collective	1
act.	1
	1
That	1
act	1
is	1
performed.	1
	1
The	1
last	1
role	1
is	1
played.	1
The	1
actor	1
is	1
bidden	1
to	1
disrobe	1
and	1
wash	1
off	1
his	1
powder	1
and	1
paint:	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
wanted	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
And	1
some	1
years	1
pass	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
plays	1
a	1
pitiful	1
comedy	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
solitude	1
on	1
his	1
island,	1
justifying	1
his	1
actions	1
by	1
intrigues	1
and	1
lies	1
when	1
the	1
justification	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
needed,	1
and	1
displaying	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
people	1
had	1
mistaken	1
for	1
strength	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
an	1
unseen	1
hand	1
directed	1
his	1
actions.	1
	1
The	1
manager	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
drama	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
stripped	1
the	1
actor	1
shows	1
him	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
"See	1
what	1
you	1
believed	1
in!	1
This	1
is	1
he!	1
Do	1
you	1
now	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
he	1
but	1
I	1
who	1
moved	1
you?"	1
	1
But	1
dazed	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
movement,	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
before	1
people	1
understood	1
this.	1
	1
Still	1
greater	1
coherence	1
and	1
inevitability	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Alexander	1
I,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
countermovement	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west.	1
	1
What	1
was	1
needed	1
for	1
him	1
who,	1
overshadowing	1
others,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
that	1
movement	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west?	1
	1
What	1
was	1
needed	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
a	1
sympathy	1
with	1
European	1
affairs,	1
but	1
a	1
remote	1
sympathy	1
not	1
dulled	1
by	1
petty	1
interests;	1
a	1
moral	1
superiority	1
over	1
those	1
sovereigns	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
who	1
co-operated	1
with	1
him;	1
a	1
mild	1
and	1
attractive	1
personality;	1
and	1
a	1
personal	1
grievance	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
Alexander	1
I;	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
by	1
innumerable	1
so-called	1
chances	1
in	1
his	1
life:	1
his	1
education,	1
his	1
early	1
liberalism,	1
the	1
advisers	1
who	1
surrounded	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
Austerlitz,	1
and	1
Tilsit,	1
and	1
Erfurt.	1
	1
During	1
the	1
national	1
war	1
he	1
was	1
inactive	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
needed.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
a	1
general	1
European	1
war	1
presented	1
itself	1
he	1
appeared	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
given	1
moment	1
and,	1
uniting	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
Europe,	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
goal.	1
	1
The	1
goal	1
is	1
reached.	1
After	1
the	1
final	1
war	1
of	1
1815	1
Alexander	1
possesses	1
all	1
possible	1
power.	1
How	1
does	1
he	1
use	1
it?	1
	1
Alexander	1
I--the	1
pacifier	1
of	1
Europe,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
from	1
his	1
early	1
years	1
had	1
striven	1
only	1
for	1
his	1
people's	1
welfare,	1
the	1
originator	1
of	1
the	1
liberal	1
innovations	1
in	1
his	1
fatherland--now	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
utmost	1
power	1
and	1
therefore	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
bringing	1
about	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
peoples--at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
exile	1
was	1
drawing	1
up	1
childish	1
and	1
mendacious	1
plans	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
mankind	1
happy	1
had	1
he	1
retained	1
power--Alexander	1
I,	1
having	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
mission	1
and	1
feeling	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
him,	1
suddenly	1
recognizes	1
the	1
insignificance	1
of	1
that	1
supposed	1
power,	1
turns	1
away	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
gives	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
contemptible	1
men	1
whom	1
he	1
despises,	1
saying	1
only:	1
	1
"Not	1
unto	1
us,	1
not	1
unto	1
us,	1
but	1
unto	1
Thy	1
Name!...	1
I	1
too	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
you.	1
Let	1
me	1
live	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
of	1
God."	1
	1
As	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
each	1
atom	1
of	1
ether	1
is	1
a	1
sphere	1
complete	1
in	1
itself,	1
and	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
only	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
too	1
immense	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
comprehend,	1
so	1
each	1
individual	1
has	1
within	1
himself	1
his	1
own	1
aims	1
and	1
yet	1
has	1
them	1
to	1
serve	1
a	1
general	1
purpose	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
man.	1
	1
A	1
bee	1
settling	1
on	1
a	1
flower	1
has	1
stung	1
a	1
child.	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
bees	1
and	1
declares	1
that	1
bees	1
exist	1
to	1
sting	1
people.	1
A	1
poet	1
admires	1
the	1
bee	1
sucking	1
from	1
the	1
chalice	1
of	1
a	1
flower	1
and	1
says	1
it	1
exists	1
to	1
suck	1
the	1
fragrance	1
of	1
flowers.	1
A	1
beekeeper,	1
seeing	1
the	1
bee	1
collect	1
pollen	1
from	1
flowers	1
and	1
carry	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
hive,	1
says	1
that	1
it	1
exists	1
to	1
gather	1
honey.	1
Another	1
beekeeper	1
who	1
has	1
studied	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
hive	1
more	1
closely	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
bee	1
gathers	1
pollen	1
dust	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
young	1
bees	1
and	1
rear	1
a	1
queen,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
exists	1
to	1
perpetuate	1
its	1
race.	1
A	1
botanist	1
notices	1
that	1
the	1
bee	1
flying	1
with	1
the	1
pollen	1
of	1
a	1
male	1
flower	1
to	1
a	1
pistil	1
fertilizes	1
the	1
latter,	1
and	1
sees	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
bee's	1
existence.	1
Another,	1
observing	1
the	1
migration	1
of	1
plants,	1
notices	1
that	1
the	1
bee	1
helps	1
in	1
this	1
work,	1
and	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
lies	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
bee.	1
But	1
the	1
ultimate	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
bee	1
is	1
not	1
exhausted	1
by	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
second,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
processes	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
can	1
discern.	1
The	1
higher	1
the	1
human	1
intellect	1
rises	1
in	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
these	1
purposes,	1
the	1
more	1
obvious	1
it	1
becomes,	1
that	1
the	1
ultimate	1
purpose	1
is	1
beyond	1
our	1
comprehension.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
accessible	1
to	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
bee	1
to	1
other	1
manifestations	1
of	1
life.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
historic	1
characters	1
and	1
nations.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
Natasha's	1
wedding	1
to	1
Bezukhov,	1
which	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
1813,	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
happy	1
event	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Rostovs.	1
Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
died	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
and,	1
as	1
always	1
happens,	1
after	1
the	1
father's	1
death	1
the	1
family	1
group	1
broke	1
up.	1
	1
The	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
year:	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Moscow	1
and	1
the	1
flight	1
from	1
it,	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
Natasha's	1
despair,	1
Petya's	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
countess'	1
grief	1
fell	1
blow	1
after	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
count's	1
head.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
events,	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
old	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
spiritual	1
sense	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
and	1
inviting	1
further	1
blows	1
which	1
would	1
finish	1
him.	1
He	1
seemed	1
now	1
frightened	1
and	1
distraught	1
and	1
now	1
unnaturally	1
animated	1
and	1
enterprising.	1
	1
The	1
arrangements	1
for	1
Natasha's	1
marriage	1
occupied	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
He	1
ordered	1
dinners	1
and	1
suppers	1
and	1
obviously	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
cheerful,	1
but	1
his	1
cheerfulness	1
was	1
not	1
infectious	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be:	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
evoked	1
the	1
compassion	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
and	1
liked	1
him.	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
left,	1
he	1
grew	1
very	1
quiet	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
depression.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
he	1
fell	1
ill	1
and	1
took	1
to	1
his	1
bed.	1
He	1
realized	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
get	1
up	1
again,	1
despite	1
the	1
doctor's	1
encouragement.	1
The	1
countess	1
passed	1
a	1
fortnight	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
by	1
his	1
pillow	1
without	1
undressing.	1
Every	1
time	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
medicine	1
he	1
sobbed	1
and	1
silently	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand.	1
On	1
his	1
last	1
day,	1
sobbing,	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
and	1
his	1
absent	1
son	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
for	1
having	1
dissipated	1
their	1
property--that	1
being	1
the	1
chief	1
fault	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
conscious.	1
After	1
receiving	1
communion	1
and	1
unction	1
he	1
quietly	1
died;	1
and	1
next	1
day	1
a	1
throng	1
of	1
acquaintances	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
pay	1
their	1
last	1
respects	1
to	1
the	1
deceased	1
filled	1
the	1
house	1
rented	1
by	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
All	1
these	1
acquaintances,	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
dined	1
and	1
danced	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
laughed	1
at	1
him,	1
now	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
common	1
feeling	1
of	1
self-reproach	1
and	1
emotion,	1
as	1
if	1
justifying	1
themselves:	1
"Well,	1
whatever	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
worthy	1
man.	1
You	1
don't	1
meet	1
such	1
men	1
nowadays....	1
And	1
which	1
of	1
us	1
has	1
not	1
weaknesses	1
of	1
his	1
own?"	1
	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
when	1
the	1
count's	1
affairs	1
had	1
become	1
so	1
involved	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
he	1
lived	1
another	1
year	1
that	1
he	1
unexpectedly	1
died.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
in	1
Paris	1
when	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
death	1
reached	1
him.	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
resigned	1
his	1
commission,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
accepted	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
affairs	1
became	1
quite	1
obvious	1
a	1
month	1
after	1
his	1
death,	1
surprising	1
everyone	1
by	1
the	1
immense	1
total	1
of	1
small	1
debts	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
suspected.	1
The	1
debts	1
amounted	1
to	1
double	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
property.	1
	1
Friends	1
and	1
relations	1
advised	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
decline	1
the	1
inheritance.	1
But	1
he	1
regarded	1
such	1
a	1
refusal	1
as	1
a	1
slur	1
on	1
his	1
father's	1
memory,	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
sacred,	1
and	1
therefore	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
refusing	1
and	1
accepted	1
the	1
inheritance	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
obligation	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
debts.	1
	1
The	1
creditors	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
silent,	1
restrained	1
by	1
a	1
vague	1
but	1
powerful	1
influence	1
exerted	1
on	1
them	1
while	1
he	1
lived	1
by	1
the	1
count's	1
careless	1
good	1
nature,	1
all	1
proceeded	1
to	1
enforce	1
their	1
claims	1
at	1
once.	1
As	1
always	1
happens	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
rivalry	1
sprang	1
up	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
should	1
get	1
paid	1
first,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
like	1
Mitenka	1
held	1
promissory	1
notes	1
given	1
them	1
as	1
presents	1
now	1
became	1
the	1
most	1
exacting	1
of	1
the	1
creditors.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
allowed	1
no	1
respite	1
and	1
no	1
peace,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
old	1
man--the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
losses	1
(if	1
they	1
were	1
losses)--now	1
remorselessly	1
pursued	1
the	1
young	1
heir	1
who	1
had	1
voluntarily	1
undertaken	1
the	1
debts	1
and	1
was	1
obviously	1
not	1
guilty	1
of	1
contracting	1
them.	1
	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
plans	1
Nicholas	1
tried	1
succeeded;	1
the	1
estate	1
was	1
sold	1
by	1
auction	1
for	1
half	1
its	1
value,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
debts	1
still	1
remained	1
unpaid.	1
Nicholas	1
accepted	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
offered	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
brother-in-	1
law	1
Bezukhov	1
to	1
pay	1
off	1
debts	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
genuinely	1
due	1
for	1
value	1
received.	1
And	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
imprisoned	1
for	1
the	1
remainder,	1
as	1
the	1
creditors	1
threatened,	1
he	1
re-entered	1
the	1
government	1
service.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
rejoin	1
the	1
army	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
colonel	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
vacancy,	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
now	1
clung	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
one	1
hold	1
on	1
life;	1
and	1
so	1
despite	1
his	1
reluctance	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Moscow	1
among	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
before,	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
the	1
civil	1
service,	1
he	1
accepted	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
that	1
service,	1
doffed	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
fond,	1
and	1
moved	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
Sonya	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Sivtsev	1
Vrazhek.	1
	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Pierre	1
were	1
living	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
clear	1
idea	1
of	1
Nicholas'	1
circumstances.	1
Having	1
borrowed	1
money	1
from	1
his	1
brother-in-law,	1
Nicholas	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
wretched	1
condition	1
from	1
him.	1
His	1
position	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
difficult	1
because	1
with	1
his	1
salary	1
of	1
twelve	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
keep	1
himself,	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
had	1
to	1
shield	1
his	1
mother	1
from	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
poverty.	1
The	1
countess	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
of	1
life	1
without	1
the	1
luxurious	1
conditions	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
from	1
childhood	1
and,	1
unable	1
to	1
realize	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
son,	1
kept	1
demanding	1
now	1
a	1
carriage	1
(which	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
keep)	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
a	1
friend,	1
now	1
some	1
expensive	1
article	1
of	1
food	1
for	1
herself,	1
or	1
wine	1
for	1
her	1
son,	1
or	1
money	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
present	1
as	1
a	1
surprise	1
for	1
Natasha	1
or	1
Sonya,	1
or	1
for	1
Nicholas	1
himself.	1
	1
Sonya	1
kept	1
house,	1
attended	1
on	1
her	1
aunt,	1
read	1
to	1
her,	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
whims	1
and	1
secret	1
ill-will,	1
and	1
helped	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
conceal	1
their	1
poverty	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
countess.	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
himself	1
irredeemably	1
indebted	1
to	1
Sonya	1
for	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
greatly	1
admired	1
her	1
patience	1
and	1
devotion,	1
but	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
aloof	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
He	1
seemed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
reproach	1
her	1
for	1
being	1
too	1
perfect,	1
and	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
reproach	1
her	1
with.	1
She	1
had	1
all	1
that	1
people	1
are	1
valued	1
for,	1
but	1
little	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
love	1
her.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
valued	1
her	1
the	1
less	1
he	1
loved	1
her.	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
her	1
at	1
her	1
word	1
when	1
she	1
wrote	1
giving	1
him	1
his	1
freedom	1
and	1
now	1
behaved	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
forgotten	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
be	1
renewed.	1
	1
Nicholas'	1
position	1
became	1
worse	1
and	1
worse.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
putting	1
something	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
salary	1
proved	1
a	1
dream.	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
save	1
anything,	1
but	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
mother's	1
demands	1
he	1
even	1
incurred	1
some	1
small	1
debts.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
situation.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
marrying	1
some	1
rich	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
female	1
relations,	1
was	1
repugnant	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
other	1
way	1
out--his	1
mother's	1
death--	1
never	1
entered	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
and	1
hoped	1
for	1
nothing,	1
and	1
deep	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
experienced	1
a	1
gloomy	1
and	1
stern	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
an	1
uncomplaining	1
endurance	1
of	1
his	1
position.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
avoid	1
his	1
old	1
acquaintances	1
with	1
their	1
commiseration	1
and	1
offensive	1
offers	1
of	1
assistance;	1
he	1
avoided	1
all	1
distraction	1
and	1
recreation,	1
and	1
even	1
at	1
home	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
play	1
cards	1
with	1
his	1
mother,	1
pace	1
silently	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
smoke	1
one	1
pipe	1
after	1
another.	1
He	1
seemed	1
carefully	1
to	1
cherish	1
within	1
himself	1
the	1
gloomy	1
mood	1
which	1
alone	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
endure	1
his	1
position.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
winter	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
From	1
reports	1
current	1
in	1
town	1
she	1
learned	1
how	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
were	1
situated,	1
and	1
how	1
"the	1
son	1
has	1
sacrificed	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
mother,"	1
as	1
people	1
were	1
saying.	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
expected	1
anything	1
else	1
of	1
him,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
herself,	1
feeling	1
a	1
joyous	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him.	1
Remembering	1
her	1
friendly	1
relations	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
almost	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
But	1
remembering	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
Nicholas	1
in	1
Voronezh	1
she	1
was	1
shy	1
about	1
doing	1
so.	1
Making	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
she	1
did	1
however	1
go	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
them	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
after	1
her	1
arrival	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
as	1
the	1
countess'	1
room	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
reached	1
through	1
his.	1
But	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
greeted	1
with	1
pleasure	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
expected,	1
at	1
his	1
first	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
cold,	1
stiff,	1
proud	1
expression	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
on	1
it	1
before.	1
He	1
inquired	1
about	1
her	1
health,	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
having	1
sat	1
there	1
for	1
five	1
minutes	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
room	1
Nicholas	1
met	1
her	1
again,	1
and	1
with	1
marked	1
solemnity	1
and	1
stiffness	1
accompanied	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
To	1
her	1
remarks	1
about	1
his	1
mother's	1
health	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
"What's	1
that	1
to	1
you?	1
Leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace,"	1
his	1
looks	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Why	1
does	1
she	1
come	1
prowling	1
here?	1
What	1
does	1
she	1
want?	1
I	1
can't	1
bear	1
these	1
ladies	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
civilities!"	1
said	1
he	1
aloud	1
in	1
Sonya's	1
presence,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
repress	1
his	1
vexation,	1
after	1
the	1
princess'	1
carriage	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Nicholas,	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
like	1
that?"	1
cried	1
Sonya,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
conceal	1
her	1
delight.	1
"She	1
is	1
so	1
kind	1
and	1
Mamma	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
her!"	1
	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
avoid	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
any	1
more.	1
But	1
after	1
her	1
visit	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
several	1
times	1
a	1
day.	1
	1
She	1
sang	1
her	1
praises,	1
insisted	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
must	1
call	1
on	1
her,	1
expressed	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
often,	1
but	1
yet	1
always	1
became	1
ill-humored	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
her.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
silence	1
when	1
his	1
mother	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
princess,	1
but	1
his	1
silence	1
irritated	1
her.	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
admirable	1
and	1
excellent	1
young	1
woman,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"and	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
call	1
on	1
her.	1
You	1
would	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
seeing	1
somebody,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
dull	1
for	1
you	1
only	1
seeing	1
us."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
want	1
to,	1
Mamma."	1
	1
"You	1
used	1
to	1
want	1
to,	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
don't.	1
Really	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
you,	1
my	1
dear.	1
One	1
day	1
you	1
are	1
dull,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
you	1
refuse	1
to	1
see	1
anyone."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
never	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
dull."	1
	1
"Why,	1
you	1
said	1
yourself	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
even	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
admirable	1
young	1
woman	1
and	1
you	1
always	1
liked	1
her,	1
but	1
now	1
suddenly	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
notion	1
or	1
other	1
in	1
your	1
head.	1
You	1
hide	1
everything	1
from	1
me."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,	1
Mamma."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
were	1
asking	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
disagreeable	1
now--but	1
I	1
only	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
return	1
a	1
call.	1
One	1
would	1
think	1
mere	1
politeness	1
required	1
it....	1
Well,	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
you,	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
won't	1
interfere	1
any	1
more	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
secrets	1
from	1
your	1
mother."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
I'll	1
go	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
it."	1
	1
"It	1
doesn't	1
matter	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
it	1
for	1
your	1
sake."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
sighed,	1
bit	1
his	1
mustache,	1
and	1
laid	1
out	1
the	1
cards	1
for	1
a	1
patience,	1
trying	1
to	1
divert	1
his	1
mother's	1
attention	1
to	1
another	1
topic.	1
	1
The	1
same	1
conversation	1
was	1
repeated	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
that.	1
	1
After	1
her	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
her	1
unexpectedly	1
chilly	1
reception	1
by	1
Nicholas,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
confessed	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
right	1
in	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
call.	1
	1
"I	1
expected	1
nothing	1
else,"	1
she	1
told	1
herself,	1
calling	1
her	1
pride	1
to	1
her	1
aid.	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
old	1
lady,	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
kind	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
under	1
many	1
obligations."	1
	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
pacify	1
herself	1
with	1
these	1
reflections;	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
remorse	1
troubled	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
visit.	1
Though	1
she	1
had	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
again	1
and	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
whole	1
matter,	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
an	1
awkward	1
position.	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
what	1
distressed	1
her,	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
relation	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
His	1
cold,	1
polite	1
manner	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
(she	1
knew	1
that)	1
but	1
it	1
concealed	1
something,	1
and	1
until	1
she	1
could	1
discover	1
what	1
that	1
something	1
was,	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
ease.	1
	1
One	1
day	1
in	1
midwinter	1
when	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
schoolroom	1
attending	1
to	1
her	1
nephew's	1
lessons,	1
she	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
Rostov	1
had	1
called.	1
With	1
a	1
firm	1
resolution	1
not	1
to	1
betray	1
herself	1
and	1
not	1
show	1
her	1
agitation,	1
she	1
sent	1
for	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
Her	1
first	1
glance	1
at	1
Nicholas'	1
face	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
come	1
to	1
fulfill	1
the	1
demands	1
of	1
politeness,	1
and	1
she	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
addressed	1
her.	1
	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
health,	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
friends,	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
war	1
news,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
ten	1
minutes	1
required	1
by	1
propriety	1
had	1
elapsed	1
after	1
which	1
a	1
visitor	1
may	1
rise,	1
Nicholas	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
say	1
good-by.	1
	1
With	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
help	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
maintained	1
the	1
conversation	1
very	1
well,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
moment,	1
just	1
when	1
he	1
rose,	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
what	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
her,	1
and	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
why	1
she	1
alone	1
was	1
granted	1
so	1
little	1
happiness	1
in	1
life,	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
absent-mindedness	1
she	1
sat	1
still,	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
gazing	1
fixedly	1
before	1
her,	1
not	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
risen.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
and,	1
wishing	1
to	1
appear	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
her	1
abstraction,	1
made	1
some	1
remark	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
princess.	1
She	1
still	1
sat	1
motionless	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
suffering	1
on	1
her	1
gentle	1
face.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
vaguely	1
conscious	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
sadness	1
her	1
face	1
expressed.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
and	1
say	1
something	1
pleasant,	1
but	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
Princess!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
She	1
started,	1
flushed,	1
and	1
sighed	1
deeply.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
if	1
waking	1
up.	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
already,	1
Count?	1
Well	1
then,	1
good-by!	1
Oh,	1
but	1
the	1
cushion	1
for	1
the	1
countess!"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
I'll	1
fetch	1
it,"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
They	1
both	1
sat	1
silent,	1
with	1
an	1
occasional	1
glance	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Princess,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
smile,	1
"it	1
doesn't	1
seem	1
long	1
ago	1
since	1
we	1
first	1
met	1
at	1
Bogucharovo,	1
but	1
how	1
much	1
water	1
has	1
flowed	1
since	1
then!	1
In	1
what	1
distress	1
we	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
then,	1
yet	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
much	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
that	1
time...	1
but	1
there's	1
no	1
bringing	1
it	1
back."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
gazed	1
intently	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
luminous	1
ones	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
fathom	1
the	1
hidden	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
which	1
would	1
explain	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
regret	1
the	1
past,	1
Count.	1
As	1
I	1
understand	1
your	1
present	1
life,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
recall	1
it	1
with	1
satisfaction,	1
because	1
the	1
self-sacrifice	1
that	1
fills	1
it	1
now..."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
accept	1
your	1
praise,"	1
he	1
interrupted	1
her	1
hurriedly.	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
continually	1
reproach	1
myself....	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
an	1
interesting	1
or	1
cheerful	1
subject."	1
	1
His	1
face	1
again	1
resumed	1
its	1
former	1
stiff	1
and	1
cold	1
expression.	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
and	1
loved,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
now	1
spoke.	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
this,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"I	1
had	1
come	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
you...	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
your	1
family	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
consider	1
my	1
sympathy	1
misplaced,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
mistaken,"	1
and	1
suddenly	1
her	1
voice	1
trembled.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
why,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
recovering	1
herself,	1
"but	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
different,	1
and..."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
a	1
thousand	1
reasons	1
why,"	1
laying	1
special	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
why.	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Princess,"	1
he	1
added	1
softly.	1
"Sometimes	1
it	1
is	1
hard."	1
	1
"So	1
that's	1
why!	1
That's	1
why!"	1
a	1
voice	1
whispered	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
soul.	1
"No,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
gay,	1
kind,	1
and	1
frank	1
look,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
handsome	1
exterior,	1
that	1
I	1
loved	1
in	1
him.	1
I	1
divined	1
his	1
noble,	1
resolute,	1
self-sacrificing	1
spirit	1
too,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
poor	1
now	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
rich....	1
Yes,	1
that's	1
the	1
only	1
reason....	1
Yes,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
that..."	1
And	1
remembering	1
his	1
former	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
looking	1
now	1
at	1
his	1
kind,	1
sorrowful	1
face,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
understood	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
coldness.	1
	1
"But	1
why,	1
Count,	1
why?"	1
she	1
almost	1
cried,	1
unconsciously	1
moving	1
closer	1
to	1
him.	1
"Why?	1
Tell	1
me.	1
You	1
must	1
tell	1
me!"	1
	1
He	1
was	1
silent.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
your	1
why,	1
Count,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"but	1
it's	1
hard	1
for	1
me...	1
I	1
confess	1
it.	1
For	1
some	1
reason	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
our	1
former	1
friendship.	1
And	1
that	1
hurts	1
me."	1
There	1
were	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
voice.	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
so	1
little	1
happiness	1
in	1
life	1
that	1
every	1
loss	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
bear....	1
Excuse	1
me,	1
good-by!"	1
and	1
suddenly	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
was	1
hurrying	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
trying	1
to	1
stop	1
her.	1
"Princess!"	1
	1
She	1
turned	1
round.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
they	1
gazed	1
silently	1
into	1
one	1
another's	1
eyes--and	1
what	1
had	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
and	1
remote	1
suddenly	1
became	1
possible,	1
inevitable,	1
and	1
very	1
near.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
In	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
1813	1
Nicholas	1
married	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
Sonya.	1
	1
Within	1
four	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
paid	1
off	1
all	1
his	1
remaining	1
debts	1
without	1
selling	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
wife's	1
property,	1
and	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
small	1
inheritance	1
on	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
cousin	1
he	1
paid	1
his	1
debt	1
to	1
Pierre	1
as	1
well.	1
	1
In	1
another	1
three	1
years,	1
by	1
1820,	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
managed	1
his	1
affairs	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
small	1
estate	1
adjoining	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
and	1
was	1
negotiating	1
to	1
buy	1
back	1
Otradnoe--that	1
being	1
his	1
pet	1
dream.	1
	1
Having	1
started	1
farming	1
from	1
necessity,	1
he	1
soon	1
grew	1
so	1
devoted	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
became	1
his	1
favorite	1
and	1
almost	1
his	1
sole	1
occupation.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
a	1
plain	1
farmer:	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
innovations,	1
especially	1
the	1
English	1
ones	1
then	1
coming	1
into	1
vogue.	1
He	1
laughed	1
at	1
theoretical	1
treatises	1
on	1
estate	1
management,	1
disliked	1
factories,	1
the	1
raising	1
of	1
expensive	1
products,	1
and	1
the	1
buying	1
of	1
expensive	1
seed	1
corn,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
hobby	1
of	1
any	1
particular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
estate.	1
He	1
always	1
had	1
before	1
his	1
mind's	1
eye	1
the	1
estate	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
and	1
not	1
any	1
particular	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
chief	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
nitrogen	1
in	1
the	1
soil,	1
nor	1
the	1
oxygen	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
nor	1
manures,	1
nor	1
special	1
plows,	1
but	1
that	1
most	1
important	1
agent	1
by	1
which	1
nitrogen,	1
oxygen,	1
manure,	1
and	1
plow	1
were	1
made	1
effective--	1
the	1
peasant	1
laborer.	1
When	1
Nicholas	1
first	1
began	1
farming	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
understand	1
its	1
different	1
branches,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
serf	1
who	1
especially	1
attracted	1
his	1
attention.	1
The	1
peasant	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
tool,	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
farming	1
and	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
himself.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
watched	1
the	1
serfs,	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
their	1
aims	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
considered	1
good	1
and	1
bad,	1
and	1
only	1
pretended	1
to	1
direct	1
them	1
and	1
give	1
orders	1
while	1
in	1
reality	1
learning	1
from	1
them	1
their	1
methods,	1
their	1
manner	1
of	1
speech,	1
and	1
their	1
judgment	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
bad.	1
Only	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
the	1
peasants'	1
tastes	1
and	1
aspirations,	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
talk	1
their	1
language,	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
hidden	1
meaning	1
of	1
their	1
words,	1
and	1
felt	1
akin	1
to	1
them	1
did	1
he	1
begin	1
boldly	1
to	1
manage	1
his	1
serfs,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
perform	1
toward	1
them	1
the	1
duties	1
demanded	1
of	1
him.	1
And	1
Nicholas'	1
management	1
produced	1
very	1
brilliant	1
results.	1
	1
Guided	1
by	1
some	1
gift	1
of	1
insight,	1
on	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
estates	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
unerringly	1
appointed	1
as	1
bailiff,	1
village	1
elder,	1
and	1
delegate,	1
the	1
very	1
men	1
the	1
serfs	1
would	1
themselves	1
have	1
chosen	1
had	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
choose,	1
and	1
these	1
posts	1
never	1
changed	1
hands.	1
Before	1
analyzing	1
the	1
properties	1
of	1
manure,	1
before	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
debit	1
and	1
credit	1
(as	1
he	1
ironically	1
called	1
it),	1
he	1
found	1
out	1
how	1
many	1
cattle	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
and	1
increased	1
the	1
number	1
by	1
all	1
possible	1
means.	1
He	1
kept	1
the	1
peasant	1
families	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
largest	1
groups	1
possible,	1
not	1
allowing	1
the	1
family	1
groups	1
to	1
divide	1
into	1
separate	1
households.	1
He	1
was	1
hard	1
alike	1
on	1
the	1
lazy,	1
the	1
depraved,	1
and	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
them	1
expelled	1
from	1
the	1
commune.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
careful	1
of	1
the	1
sowing	1
and	1
reaping	1
of	1
the	1
peasants'	1
hay	1
and	1
corn	1
as	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
few	1
landowners	1
had	1
their	1
crops	1
sown	1
and	1
harvested	1
so	1
early	1
and	1
so	1
well,	1
or	1
got	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
return,	1
as	1
did	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
He	1
disliked	1
having	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
domestic	1
serfs--the	1
"drones"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
them--and	1
everyone	1
said	1
he	1
spoiled	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
laxity.	1
When	1
a	1
decision	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
regarding	1
a	1
domestic	1
serf,	1
especially	1
if	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
punished,	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
undecided	1
and	1
consulted	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
domestic	1
serf	1
conscripted	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
land	1
worker	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
without	1
the	1
least	1
hesitation.	1
He	1
never	1
felt	1
any	1
hesitation	1
in	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
peasants.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
every	1
decision	1
would	1
be	1
approved	1
by	1
them	1
all	1
with	1
very	1
few	1
exceptions.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
himself	1
either	1
to	1
be	1
hard	1
on	1
or	1
punish	1
a	1
man,	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
things	1
easy	1
for	1
or	1
reward	1
anyone,	1
merely	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
inclined	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
by	1
what	1
standard	1
he	1
judged	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
or	1
should	1
not	1
do,	1
but	1
the	1
standard	1
was	1
quite	1
firm	1
and	1
definite	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
Often,	1
speaking	1
with	1
vexation	1
of	1
some	1
failure	1
or	1
irregularity,	1
he	1
would	1
say:	1
"What	1
can	1
one	1
do	1
with	1
our	1
Russian	1
peasants?"	1
and	1
imagined	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
them.	1
	1
Yet	1
he	1
loved	1
"our	1
Russian	1
peasants"	1
and	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
had	1
understood	1
and	1
assimilated	1
the	1
one	1
way	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
farming	1
which	1
produced	1
good	1
results.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
this	1
passion	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
and	1
regretted	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
share	1
it;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
joys	1
and	1
vexations	1
he	1
derived	1
from	1
that	1
world,	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
remote	1
and	1
alien.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
particularly	1
animated	1
and	1
happy	1
when,	1
after	1
getting	1
up	1
at	1
daybreak	1
and	1
spending	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
threshing	1
floor,	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
sowing	1
or	1
mowing	1
or	1
reaping	1
to	1
have	1
tea	1
with	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
such	1
admiration	1
and	1
delight	1
of	1
the	1
farming	1
of	1
the	1
thrifty	1
and	1
well-	1
to-do	1
peasant	1
Matthew	1
Ermishin,	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
had	1
carted	1
corn	1
all	1
night;	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
(Nicholas')	1
sheaves	1
were	1
already	1
stacked	1
before	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
his	1
harvest	1
in.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
stepped	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
the	1
veranda	1
and	1
smiled	1
under	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
winked	1
so	1
joyfully,	1
when	1
warm	1
steady	1
rain	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
dry	1
and	1
thirsty	1
shoots	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
oats,	1
or	1
why	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
carried	1
away	1
a	1
threatening	1
cloud	1
during	1
the	1
hay	1
harvest	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
barn,	1
flushed,	1
sunburned,	1
and	1
perspiring,	1
with	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
wormwood	1
and	1
gentian	1
in	1
his	1
hair	1
and,	1
gleefully	1
rubbing	1
his	1
hands,	1
would	1
say:	1
"Well,	1
one	1
more	1
day	1
and	1
my	1
grain	1
and	1
the	1
peasants'	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
under	1
cover."	1
	1
Still	1
less	1
did	1
she	1
understand	1
why	1
he,	1
kindhearted	1
and	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
anticipate	1
her	1
wishes,	1
should	1
become	1
almost	1
desperate	1
when	1
she	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
petition	1
from	1
some	1
peasant	1
men	1
or	1
women	1
who	1
had	1
appealed	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
excused	1
some	1
work;	1
why	1
he,	1
that	1
kind	1
Nicholas,	1
should	1
obstinately	1
refuse	1
her,	1
angrily	1
asking	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
interfere	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
business.	1
She	1
felt	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
world	1
apart,	1
which	1
he	1
loved	1
passionately	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
laws	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
fathomed.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
when,	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
him,	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
work	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
for	1
his	1
serfs,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
vexed	1
and	1
reply:	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least;	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
do	1
that	1
for	1
their	1
good!	1
That's	1
all	1
poetry	1
and	1
old	1
wives'	1
talk--all	1
that	1
doing	1
good	1
to	1
one's	1
neighbor!	1
What	1
I	1
want	1
is	1
that	1
our	1
children	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
begging.	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
our	1
affairs	1
in	1
order	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
alive,	1
that's	1
all.	1
And	1
to	1
do	1
that,	1
order	1
and	1
strictness	1
are	1
essential....	1
That's	1
all	1
about	1
it!"	1
said	1
he,	1
clenching	1
his	1
vigorous	1
fist.	1
"And	1
fairness,	1
of	1
course,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"for	1
if	1
the	1
peasant	1
is	1
naked	1
and	1
hungry	1
and	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
miserable	1
horse,	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
good	1
either	1
for	1
himself	1
or	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
And	1
all	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
was	1
fruitful--probably	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
good	1
to	1
others	1
for	1
virtue's	1
sake.	1
His	1
means	1
increased	1
rapidly;	1
serfs	1
from	1
neighboring	1
estates	1
came	1
to	1
beg	1
him	1
to	1
buy	1
them,	1
and	1
long	1
after	1
his	1
death	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
administration	1
was	1
devoutly	1
preserved	1
among	1
the	1
serfs.	1
"He	1
was	1
a	1
master...	1
the	1
peasants'	1
affairs	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
own.	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
trifled	1
with	1
either--in	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
master!"	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
One	1
matter	1
connected	1
with	1
his	1
management	1
sometimes	1
worried	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
his	1
quick	1
temper	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
hussar	1
habit	1
of	1
making	1
free	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
fists.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
reprehensible	1
in	1
this,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
marriage	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
that	1
form	1
of	1
punishment	1
suddenly	1
changed.	1
	1
Once	1
in	1
summer	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
from	1
Bogucharovo,	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
succeeded	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
when	1
Dron	1
died	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
dishonesty	1
and	1
various	1
irregularities.	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
to	1
question	1
him,	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
elder	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
few	1
replies	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
cries	1
and	1
blows	1
were	1
heard.	1
On	1
returning	1
to	1
lunch	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
bent	1
low	1
over	1
her	1
embroidery	1
frame,	1
and	1
as	1
usual	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
that	1
morning.	1
Among	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
Bogucharovo	1
elder.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
turned	1
red	1
and	1
then	1
pale,	1
but	1
continued	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
head	1
bowed	1
and	1
lips	1
compressed	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
husband	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"Such	1
an	1
insolent	1
scoundrel!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
growing	1
hot	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
recollection	1
of	1
him.	1
"If	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
drunk	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see...	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
Mary?"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
asked.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
hastily	1
looked	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
puckered.	1
	1
"Why,	1
whatever	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
my	1
dearest?"	1
	1
The	1
looks	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
always	1
improved	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
tears.	1
She	1
never	1
cried	1
from	1
pain	1
or	1
vexation,	1
but	1
always	1
from	1
sorrow	1
or	1
pity,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
wept	1
her	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
acquired	1
an	1
irresistible	1
charm.	1
	1
The	1
moment	1
Nicholas	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
restrain	1
herself	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
I	1
saw	1
it...	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame,	1
but	1
why	1
do	1
you...	1
Nicholas!"	1
and	1
she	1
covered	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
said	1
nothing.	1
He	1
flushed	1
crimson,	1
left	1
her	1
side,	1
and	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
understood	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
weeping	1
about,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
at	1
once	1
agree	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
regarded	1
from	1
childhood	1
as	1
quite	1
an	1
everyday	1
event	1
was	1
wrong.	1
"Is	1
it	1
just	1
sentimentality,	1
old	1
wives'	1
tales,	1
or	1
is	1
she	1
right?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
Before	1
he	1
had	1
solved	1
that	1
point	1
he	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
filled	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
pain,	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
realized	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
sinning	1
against	1
himself.	1
	1
"Mary,"	1
he	1
said	1
softly,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
"it	1
will	1
never	1
happen	1
again;	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word.	1
Never,"	1
he	1
repeated	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
like	1
a	1
boy	1
asking	1
for	1
forgiveness.	1
	1
The	1
tears	1
flowed	1
faster	1
still	1
from	1
the	1
countess'	1
eyes.	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it.	1
	1
"Nicholas,	1
when	1
did	1
you	1
break	1
your	1
cameo?"	1
she	1
asked	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
ring	1
with	1
a	1
cameo	1
of	1
Laocoon's	1
head.	1
	1
"Today--it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
affair.	1
Oh,	1
Mary,	1
don't	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
it!"	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
flushed.	1
"I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
it	1
shan't	1
occur	1
again,	1
and	1
let	1
this	1
always	1
be	1
a	1
reminder	1
to	1
me,"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
broken	1
ring.	1
	1
After	1
that,	1
when	1
in	1
discussions	1
with	1
his	1
village	1
elders	1
or	1
stewards	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
fists	1
began	1
to	1
clench,	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
turn	1
the	1
broken	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
would	1
drop	1
his	1
eyes	1
before	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
making	1
him	1
angry.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
forget	1
himself	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
within	1
a	1
twelvemonth,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
confess	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
would	1
again	1
promise	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
really	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
"Mary,	1
you	1
must	1
despise	1
me!"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
"I	1
deserve	1
it."	1
	1
"You	1
should	1
go,	1
go	1
away	1
at	1
once,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
feel	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
control	1
yourself,"	1
she	1
would	1
reply	1
sadly,	1
trying	1
to	1
comfort	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
gentry	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
respected	1
but	1
not	1
liked.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
concern	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
class,	1
and	1
consequently	1
some	1
thought	1
him	1
proud	1
and	1
others	1
thought	1
him	1
stupid.	1
The	1
whole	1
summer,	1
from	1
spring	1
sowing	1
to	1
harvest,	1
he	1
was	1
busy	1
with	1
the	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
farm.	1
In	1
autumn	1
he	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
hunting	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
business-like	1
seriousness--leaving	1
home	1
for	1
a	1
month,	1
or	1
even	1
two,	1
with	1
his	1
hunt.	1
In	1
winter	1
he	1
visited	1
his	1
other	1
villages	1
or	1
spent	1
his	1
time	1
reading.	1
The	1
books	1
he	1
read	1
were	1
chiefly	1
historical,	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
he	1
spent	1
a	1
certain	1
sum	1
every	1
year.	1
He	1
was	1
collecting,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
a	1
serious	1
library,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
read	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
he	1
bought.	1
He	1
would	1
sit	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
air,	1
reading--a	1
task	1
he	1
first	1
imposed	1
upon	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
duty,	1
but	1
which	1
afterwards	1
became	1
a	1
habit	1
affording	1
him	1
a	1
special	1
kind	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
occupied	1
with	1
serious	1
matters.	1
In	1
winter,	1
except	1
for	1
business	1
excursions,	1
he	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
at	1
home	1
making	1
himself	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
entering	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
children's	1
relations	1
with	1
their	1
mother.	1
The	1
harmony	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
grew	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
and	1
he	1
daily	1
discovered	1
fresh	1
spiritual	1
treasures	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
marriage	1
Sonya	1
had	1
lived	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
Before	1
that,	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
told	1
his	1
wife	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
blaming	1
himself	1
and	1
commending	1
her.	1
He	1
had	1
asked	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
be	1
gentle	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
his	1
cousin.	1
She	1
thoroughly	1
realized	1
the	1
wrong	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
Sonya,	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
blame	1
toward	1
her,	1
and	1
imagined	1
that	1
her	1
wealth	1
had	1
influenced	1
Nicholas'	1
choice.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
Sonya	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
her,	1
but	1
often	1
felt	1
ill-will	1
toward	1
her	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
overcome.	1
	1
Once	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
Natasha	1
about	1
Sonya	1
and	1
about	1
her	1
own	1
injustice	1
toward	1
her.	1
	1
"You	1
know,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
"you	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
Gospels	1
a	1
great	1
deal--there	1
is	1
a	1
passage	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
just	1
fits	1
Sonya."	1
	1
"What?"	1
asked	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
surprised.	1
	1
"'To	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
given,	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.'	1
You	1
remember?	1
She	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
not;	1
why,	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
Perhaps	1
she	1
lacks	1
egotism,	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
but	1
from	1
her	1
is	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
everything	1
has	1
been	1
taken	1
away.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
am	1
dreadfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
her.	1
Formerly	1
I	1
very	1
much	1
wanted	1
Nicholas	1
to	1
marry	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
presentiment	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
off.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
sterile	1
flower,	1
you	1
know--like	1
some	1
strawberry	1
blossoms.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
doesn't	1
feel	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
or	1
I	1
would."	1
	1
Though	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
told	1
Natasha	1
that	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
Gospel	1
must	1
be	1
understood	1
differently,	1
yet	1
looking	1
at	1
Sonya	1
she	1
agreed	1
with	1
Natasha's	1
explanation.	1
It	1
really	1
seemed	1
that	1
Sonya	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
her	1
position	1
trying,	1
and	1
had	1
grown	1
quite	1
reconciled	1
to	1
her	1
lot	1
as	1
a	1
sterile	1
flower.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
individuals	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
as	1
a	1
whole.	1
Like	1
a	1
cat,	1
she	1
had	1
attached	1
herself	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
home.	1
She	1
waited	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
petted	1
and	1
spoiled	1
the	1
children,	1
was	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
render	1
the	1
small	1
services	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
gift,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
unconsciously	1
accepted	1
from	1
her	1
with	1
insufficient	1
gratitude.	1
	1
The	1
country	1
seat	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
had	1
been	1
rebuilt,	1
though	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
scale	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
The	1
buildings,	1
begun	1
under	1
straitened	1
circumstances,	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
simple.	1
The	1
immense	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
stone	1
foundations	1
was	1
of	1
wood,	1
plastered	1
only	1
inside.	1
It	1
had	1
bare	1
deal	1
floors	1
and	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
very	1
simple	1
hard	1
sofas,	1
armchairs,	1
tables,	1
and	1
chairs	1
made	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
serf	1
carpenters	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
birchwood.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
spacious	1
and	1
had	1
rooms	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
serfs	1
and	1
apartments	1
for	1
visitors.	1
Whole	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
Bolkonskis'	1
relations	1
sometimes	1
came	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
with	1
sixteen	1
horses	1
and	1
dozens	1
of	1
servants	1
and	1
stayed	1
for	1
months.	1
Besides	1
that,	1
four	1
times	1
a	1
year,	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
days	1
and	1
birthdays	1
of	1
the	1
hosts,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
a	1
hundred	1
visitors	1
would	1
gather	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
life	1
pursued	1
its	1
unbroken	1
routine	1
with	1
its	1
ordinary	1
occupations,	1
and	1
its	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
St.	1
Nicholas,	1
the	1
fifth	1
of	1
December,	1
1820.	1
Natasha	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
at	1
her	1
brother's	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
children	1
since	1
early	1
autumn.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
business	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
for	1
three	1
weeks	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
but	1
had	1
remained	1
there	1
nearly	1
seven	1
weeks	1
and	1
was	1
expected	1
back	1
every	1
minute.	1
	1
Besides	1
the	1
Bezukhov	1
family,	1
Nicholas'	1
old	1
friend	1
the	1
retired	1
General	1
Vasili	1
Dmitrich	1
Denisov	1
was	1
staying	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
this	1
fifth	1
of	1
December.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
sixth,	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
name	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
house	1
would	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
visitors,	1
Nicholas	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
exchange	1
his	1
Tartar	1
tunic	1
for	1
a	1
tail	1
coat,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
narrow	1
boots	1
with	1
pointed	1
toes,	1
and	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
church	1
he	1
had	1
built,	1
and	1
then	1
receive	1
visitors	1
who	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
congratulate	1
him,	1
offer	1
them	1
refreshments,	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
elections	1
of	1
the	1
nobility;	1
but	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
entitled	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
way.	1
He	1
examined	1
the	1
bailiff's	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
Ryazan	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
wife's	1
nephew,	1
wrote	1
two	1
business	1
letters,	1
and	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
granaries,	1
cattle	1
yards	1
and	1
stables	1
before	1
dinner.	1
Having	1
taken	1
precautions	1
against	1
the	1
general	1
drunkenness	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
saint's	1
day,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
without	1
having	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
private	1
talk	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
long	1
table	1
laid	1
for	1
twenty	1
persons,	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
whole	1
household	1
had	1
assembled.	1
At	1
that	1
table	1
were	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
mother's	1
old	1
lady	1
companion	1
Belova,	1
his	1
wife,	1
their	1
three	1
children	1
with	1
their	1
governess	1
and	1
tutor,	1
his	1
wife's	1
nephew	1
with	1
his	1
tutor,	1
Sonya,	1
Denisov,	1
Natasha,	1
her	1
three	1
children,	1
their	1
governess,	1
and	1
old	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
the	1
late	1
prince's	1
architect,	1
who	1
was	1
living	1
on	1
in	1
retirement	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
When	1
her	1
husband	1
took	1
his	1
place	1
she	1
concluded,	1
from	1
the	1
rapid	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
after	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
table	1
napkin	1
he	1
pushed	1
back	1
the	1
tumbler	1
and	1
wineglass	1
standing	1
before	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
humor,	1
as	1
was	1
sometimes	1
the	1
case	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
farm--especially	1
before	1
the	1
soup.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
mood	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
quietly	1
waited	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
soup	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
admit	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
his	1
ill-humor.	1
But	1
today	1
she	1
quite	1
forgot	1
that	1
and	1
was	1
hurt	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
her	1
without	1
any	1
reason,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
unhappy.	1
She	1
asked	1
him	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been.	1
He	1
replied.	1
She	1
again	1
inquired	1
whether	1
everything	1
was	1
going	1
well	1
on	1
the	1
farm.	1
Her	1
unnatural	1
tone	1
made	1
him	1
wince	1
unpleasantly	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
hastily.	1
	1
"Then	1
I'm	1
not	1
mistaken,"	1
thought	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"Why	1
is	1
he	1
cross	1
with	1
me?"	1
She	1
concluded	1
from	1
his	1
tone	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
vexed	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
conversation.	1
She	1
knew	1
her	1
remarks	1
sounded	1
unnatural,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
asking	1
some	1
more	1
questions.	1
	1
Thanks	1
to	1
Denisov	1
the	1
conversation	1
at	1
table	1
soon	1
became	1
general	1
and	1
lively,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
When	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
went	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
thank	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
"You	1
always	1
have	1
such	1
strange	1
fancies!	1
I	1
didn't	1
even	1
think	1
of	1
being	1
angry,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
imply:	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
angry	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
tell	1
you	1
why."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
lived	1
together	1
so	1
happily	1
that	1
even	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
countess,	1
who	1
felt	1
jealous	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
them	1
to	1
disagree,	1
could	1
find	1
nothing	1
to	1
reproach	1
them	1
with;	1
but	1
even	1
they	1
had	1
their	1
moments	1
of	1
antagonism.	1
Occasionally,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
just	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
happiest	1
together,	1
they	1
suddenly	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
estrangement	1
and	1
hostility,	1
which	1
occurred	1
most	1
frequently	1
during	1
Countess	1
Mary's	1
pregnancies,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
"Well,	1
messieurs	1
et	1
mesdames,"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
loudly	1
and	1
with	1
apparent	1
cheerfulness	1
(it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
vex	1
her),	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
my	1
feet	1
since	1
six	1
this	1
morning.	1
Tomorrow	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
suffer,	1
so	1
today	1
I'll	1
go	1
and	1
rest."	1
	1
And	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
sitting	1
room	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"That's	1
always	1
the	1
way,"	1
thought	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"He	1
talks	1
to	1
everyone	1
except	1
me.	1
I	1
see...	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
repulsive	1
to	1
him,	1
especially	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
this	1
condition."	1
She	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
expanded	1
figure	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
at	1
her	1
pale,	1
sallow,	1
emaciated	1
face	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
eyes	1
now	1
looked	1
larger	1
than	1
ever.	1
	1
And	1
everything	1
annoyed	1
her--Denisov's	1
shouting	1
and	1
laughter,	1
Natasha's	1
talk,	1
and	1
especially	1
a	1
quick	1
glance	1
Sonya	1
gave	1
her.	1
	1
Sonya	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
first	1
excuse	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
found	1
for	1
feeling	1
irritated.	1
	1
Having	1
sat	1
awhile	1
with	1
her	1
visitors	1
without	1
understanding	1
anything	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying,	1
she	1
softly	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
The	1
children	1
were	1
playing	1
at	1
"going	1
to	1
Moscow"	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
made	1
of	1
chairs	1
and	1
invited	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them.	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
played	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
little,	1
but	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
his	1
unreasonable	1
crossness	1
worried	1
her.	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and,	1
walking	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
with	1
difficulty,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
small	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
asleep;	1
I'll	1
have	1
an	1
explanation	1
with	1
him,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself.	1
Little	1
Andrew,	1
her	1
eldest	1
boy,	1
imitating	1
his	1
mother,	1
followed	1
her	1
on	1
tiptoe.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
him.	1
	1
"Mary,	1
dear,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
asleep--he	1
was	1
so	1
tired,"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
meeting	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
sitting	1
room	1
(it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
that	1
she	1
crossed	1
her	1
path	1
everywhere).	1
"Andrew	1
may	1
wake	1
him."	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
round,	1
saw	1
little	1
Andrew	1
following	1
her,	1
felt	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
right,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
flushed	1
and	1
with	1
evident	1
difficulty	1
refrained	1
from	1
saying	1
something	1
harsh.	1
She	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
but	1
to	1
avoid	1
obeying	1
Sonya	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Andrew	1
to	1
follow	1
her	1
quietly	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
Sonya	1
went	1
away	1
by	1
another	1
door.	1
From	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
sleeping	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
even	1
breathing,	1
every	1
slightest	1
tone	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
familiar	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
As	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
it	1
she	1
saw	1
before	1
her	1
his	1
smooth	1
handsome	1
forehead,	1
his	1
mustache,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
face,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
slept.	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly	1
moved	1
and	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
little	1
Andrew	1
shouted	1
from	1
outside	1
the	1
door:	1
"Papa!	1
Mamma's	1
standing	1
here!"	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
turned	1
pale	1
with	1
fright	1
and	1
made	1
signs	1
to	1
the	1
boy.	1
He	1
grew	1
silent,	1
and	1
quiet	1
ensued	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
terrible	1
to	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
She	1
knew	1
how	1
Nicholas	1
disliked	1
being	1
waked.	1
Then	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
heard	1
Nicholas	1
clearing	1
his	1
throat	1
again	1
and	1
stirring,	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
said	1
crossly:	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
get	1
a	1
moment's	1
peace....	1
Mary,	1
is	1
that	1
you?	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
bring	1
him	1
here?"	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
look	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
notice...	1
forgive	1
me..."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
coughed	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
boy	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
little	1
black-eyed	1
three-year-old	1
Natasha,	1
her	1
father's	1
pet,	1
having	1
learned	1
from	1
her	1
brother	1
that	1
Papa	1
was	1
asleep	1
and	1
Mamma	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
unobserved	1
by	1
her	1
mother.	1
The	1
dark-eyed	1
little	1
girl	1
boldly	1
opened	1
the	1
creaking	1
door,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
with	1
energetic	1
steps	1
of	1
her	1
sturdy	1
little	1
legs,	1
and	1
having	1
examined	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
asleep	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
her,	1
rose	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
hand	1
which	1
lay	1
under	1
his	1
head.	1
Nicholas	1
turned	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Natasha,	1
Natasha!"	1
came	1
Countess	1
Mary's	1
frightened	1
whisper	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
"Papa	1
wants	1
to	1
sleep."	1
	1
"No,	1
Mamma,	1
he	1
doesn't	1
want	1
to	1
sleep,"	1
said	1
little	1
Natasha	1
with	1
conviction.	1
"He's	1
laughing."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
lowered	1
his	1
legs,	1
rose,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
	1
"Come	1
in,	1
Mary,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
She	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
him	1
following	1
me,"	1
she	1
said	1
timidly.	1
"I	1
just	1
looked	1
in."	1
	1
Holding	1
his	1
little	1
girl	1
with	1
one	1
arm,	1
Nicholas	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
and,	1
seeing	1
her	1
guilty	1
expression,	1
put	1
his	1
other	1
arm	1
around	1
her	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
hair.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
kiss	1
Mamma?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Natasha	1
smiled	1
bashfully.	1
	1
"Again!"	1
she	1
commanded,	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
peremptory	1
gesture	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
kiss.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
cross,"	1
said	1
Nicholas,	1
replying	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
mind.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
how	1
unhappy,	1
how	1
lonely,	1
I	1
feel	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
like	1
that.	1
It	1
always	1
seems	1
to	1
me..."	1
	1
"Mary,	1
don't	1
talk	1
nonsense.	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself!"	1
he	1
said	1
gaily.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
can't	1
love	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
plain...	1
always...	1
and	1
now...	1
in	1
this	1
cond..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
absurd	1
you	1
are!	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
beauty	1
that	1
endears,	1
it's	1
love	1
that	1
makes	1
us	1
see	1
beauty.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
Malvinas	1
and	1
women	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
who	1
are	1
loved	1
for	1
their	1
beauty.	1
But	1
do	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
wife?	1
I	1
don't	1
love	1
her,	1
but...	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
put	1
it.	1
Without	1
you,	1
or	1
when	1
something	1
comes	1
between	1
us	1
like	1
this,	1
I	1
seem	1
lost	1
and	1
can't	1
do	1
anything.	1
Now	1
do	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
finger?	1
I	1
don't	1
love	1
it,	1
but	1
just	1
try	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
off!"	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
myself,	1
but	1
I	1
understand.	1
So	1
you're	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
me?"	1
	1
"Awfully	1
angry!"	1
he	1
said,	1
smiling	1
and	1
getting	1
up.	1
And	1
smoothing	1
his	1
hair	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
pace	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Mary,	1
what	1
I've	1
been	1
thinking?"	1
he	1
began,	1
immediately	1
thinking	1
aloud	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
presence	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
care.	1
A	1
thought	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
belonged	1
to	1
her	1
also.	1
And	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
persuade	1
Pierre	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
them	1
till	1
spring.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
listened	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
finished,	1
made	1
some	1
remark,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
turn	1
began	1
thinking	1
aloud.	1
Her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
about	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
her	1
already,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
French,	1
pointing	1
to	1
little	1
Natasha.	1
"You	1
reproach	1
us	1
women	1
with	1
being	1
illogical.	1
Here	1
is	1
our	1
logic.	1
I	1
say:	1
'Papa	1
wants	1
to	1
sleep!'	1
but	1
she	1
says,	1
'No,	1
he's	1
laughing.'	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
right,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
smile.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes."	1
And	1
Nicholas,	1
taking	1
his	1
little	1
daughter	1
in	1
his	1
strong	1
hand,	1
lifted	1
her	1
high,	1
placed	1
her	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
held	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
legs,	1
and	1
paced	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
her.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
carefree	1
happiness	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
both	1
father	1
and	1
daughter.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
unfair.	1
You	1
are	1
too	1
fond	1
of	1
this	1
one,"	1
his	1
wife	1
whispered	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?...	1
I	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
show..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
pulley	1
and	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
anteroom,	1
as	1
if	1
someone	1
had	1
arrived.	1
	1
"Somebody	1
has	1
come."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
Pierre.	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
see,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
In	1
her	1
absence	1
Nicholas	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
little	1
daughter	1
a	1
gallop	1
round	1
the	1
room.	1
Out	1
of	1
breath,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
laughing	1
child	1
quickly	1
from	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
pressed	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
His	1
capers	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
dancing,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
child's	1
round	1
happy	1
little	1
face	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
like	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
taking	1
her	1
into	1
society	1
and	1
dancing	1
the	1
mazurka	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
old	1
father	1
had	1
danced	1
Daniel	1
Cooper	1
with	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
he,	1
it	1
is	1
he,	1
Nicholas!"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
re-entering	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later.	1
"Now	1
our	1
Natasha	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
life.	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
ecstasy,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
caught	1
it	1
for	1
having	1
stayed	1
away	1
so	1
long.	1
Well,	1
come	1
along	1
now,	1
quick,	1
quick!	1
It's	1
time	1
you	1
two	1
were	1
parted,"	1
she	1
added,	1
looking	1
smilingly	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
clung	1
to	1
her	1
father.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
out	1
holding	1
the	1
child	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
never,	1
never	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
happy,"	1
she	1
whispered	1
to	1
herself.	1
A	1
smile	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
face	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
sighed,	1
and	1
her	1
deep	1
eyes	1
expressed	1
a	1
quiet	1
sadness	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
felt,	1
through	1
her	1
happiness,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
happiness	1
unattainable	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
involuntarily	1
thought	1
at	1
that	1
instant.	1
	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Natasha	1
had	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
spring	1
of	1
1813,	1
and	1
in	1
1820	1
already	1
had	1
three	1
daughters	1
besides	1
a	1
son	1
for	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
longed	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
nursing.	1
She	1
had	1
grown	1
stouter	1
and	1
broader,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
recognize	1
in	1
this	1
robust,	1
motherly	1
woman	1
the	1
slim,	1
lively	1
Natasha	1
of	1
former	1
days.	1
Her	1
features	1
were	1
more	1
defined	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
calm,	1
soft,	1
and	1
serene	1
expression.	1
In	1
her	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
ever-glowing	1
animation	1
that	1
had	1
formerly	1
burned	1
there	1
and	1
constituted	1
its	1
charm.	1
Now	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
body	1
were	1
often	1
all	1
that	1
one	1
saw,	1
and	1
her	1
soul	1
was	1
not	1
visible	1
at	1
all.	1
All	1
that	1
struck	1
the	1
eye	1
was	1
a	1
strong,	1
handsome,	1
and	1
fertile	1
woman.	1
The	1
old	1
fire	1
very	1
rarely	1
kindled	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
now.	1
That	1
happened	1
only	1
when,	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
day,	1
her	1
husband	1
returned	1
home,	1
or	1
a	1
sick	1
child	1
was	1
convalescent,	1
or	1
when	1
she	1
and	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
spoke	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
(she	1
never	1
mentioned	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
who	1
she	1
imagined	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
memory),	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
rare	1
occasions	1
when	1
something	1
happened	1
to	1
induce	1
her	1
to	1
sing,	1
a	1
practice	1
she	1
had	1
quite	1
abandoned	1
since	1
her	1
marriage.	1
At	1
the	1
rare	1
moments	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
fire	1
did	1
kindle	1
in	1
her	1
handsome,	1
fully	1
developed	1
body	1
she	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
attractive	1
than	1
in	1
former	1
days.	1
	1
Since	1
their	1
marriage	1
Natasha	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
lived	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
on	1
their	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
or	1
with	1
her	1
mother,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
in	1
Nicholas'	1
house.	1
The	1
young	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova	1
was	1
not	1
often	1
seen	1
in	1
society,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
met	1
her	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
found	1
her	1
neither	1
attractive	1
nor	1
amiable.	1
Not	1
that	1
Natasha	1
liked	1
solitude--she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
she	1
liked	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
she	1
even	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not--but	1
with	1
her	1
pregnancies,	1
her	1
confinements,	1
the	1
nursing	1
of	1
her	1
children,	1
and	1
sharing	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
life,	1
she	1
had	1
demands	1
on	1
her	1
time	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
satisfied	1
only	1
by	1
renouncing	1
society.	1
All	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
Natasha	1
before	1
her	1
marriage	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
at	1
something	1
extraordinary.	1
Only	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
with	1
her	1
maternal	1
instinct	1
had	1
realized	1
that	1
all	1
Natasha's	1
outbursts	1
had	1
been	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
need	1
of	1
children	1
and	1
a	1
husband--as	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
once	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
Otradnoe	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
fun	1
as	1
in	1
earnest--and	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
now	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
surprise	1
expressed	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
understood	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
she	1
kept	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
known	1
that	1
Natasha	1
would	1
make	1
an	1
exemplary	1
wife	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
"Only	1
she	1
lets	1
her	1
love	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
children	1
overflow	1
all	1
bounds,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
"so	1
that	1
it	1
even	1
becomes	1
absurd."	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
the	1
golden	1
rule	1
advocated	1
by	1
clever	1
folk,	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
French,	1
which	1
says	1
that	1
a	1
girl	1
should	1
not	1
let	1
herself	1
go	1
when	1
she	1
marries,	1
should	1
not	1
neglect	1
her	1
accomplishments,	1
should	1
be	1
even	1
more	1
careful	1
of	1
her	1
appearance	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
unmarried,	1
and	1
should	1
fascinate	1
her	1
husband	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
before	1
he	1
became	1
her	1
husband.	1
Natasha	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
abandoned	1
all	1
her	1
witchery,	1
of	1
which	1
her	1
singing	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
unusually	1
powerful	1
part.	1
She	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
powerfully	1
seductive.	1
She	1
took	1
no	1
pains	1
with	1
her	1
manners	1
or	1
with	1
delicacy	1
of	1
speech,	1
or	1
with	1
her	1
toilet,	1
or	1
to	1
show	1
herself	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
her	1
most	1
becoming	1
attitudes,	1
or	1
to	1
avoid	1
inconveniencing	1
him	1
by	1
being	1
too	1
exacting.	1
She	1
acted	1
in	1
contradiction	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
rules.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
allurements	1
instinct	1
had	1
formerly	1
taught	1
her	1
to	1
use	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
merely	1
ridiculous	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
husband,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
given	1
herself	1
up	1
entirely--that	1
is,	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
soul,	1
leaving	1
no	1
corner	1
of	1
it	1
hidden	1
from	1
him.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
unity	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
not	1
maintained	1
by	1
the	1
poetic	1
feelings	1
that	1
had	1
attracted	1
him	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
by	1
something	1
else--indefinite	1
but	1
firm	1
as	1
the	1
bond	1
between	1
her	1
own	1
body	1
and	1
soul.	1
	1
To	1
fluff	1
out	1
her	1
curls,	1
put	1
on	1
fashionable	1
dresses,	1
and	1
sing	1
romantic	1
songs	1
to	1
fascinate	1
her	1
husband	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
as	1
strange	1
as	1
to	1
adorn	1
herself	1
to	1
attract	1
herself.	1
To	1
adorn	1
herself	1
for	1
others	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
been	1
agreeable--she	1
did	1
not	1
know--but	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
chief	1
reason	1
for	1
devoting	1
no	1
time	1
either	1
to	1
singing,	1
to	1
dress,	1
or	1
to	1
choosing	1
her	1
words	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
really	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
spare	1
for	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
man	1
has	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
becoming	1
completely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
a	1
subject	1
however	1
trivial	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
subject	1
so	1
trivial	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
grow	1
to	1
infinite	1
proportions	1
if	1
one's	1
entire	1
attention	1
is	1
devoted	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
subject	1
which	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
Natasha's	1
attention	1
was	1
her	1
family:	1
that	1
is,	1
her	1
husband	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
belong	1
entirely	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
home,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
bear,	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
nurse,	1
and	1
bring	1
up.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
deeper	1
she	1
penetrated,	1
not	1
with	1
her	1
mind	1
only	1
but	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
soul,	1
her	1
whole	1
being,	1
into	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
absorbed	1
her,	1
the	1
larger	1
did	1
that	1
subject	1
grow	1
and	1
the	1
weaker	1
and	1
more	1
inadequate	1
did	1
her	1
powers	1
appear,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
concentrated	1
them	1
wholly	1
on	1
that	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
accomplish	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
considered	1
necessary.	1
	1
There	1
were	1
then	1
as	1
now	1
conversations	1
and	1
discussions	1
about	1
women's	1
rights,	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
and	1
their	1
freedom	1
and	1
rights,	1
though	1
these	1
themes	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
termed	1
questions	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
now;	1
but	1
these	1
topics	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
uninteresting	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
she	1
positively	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them.	1
	1
These	1
questions,	1
then	1
as	1
now,	1
existed	1
only	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
marriage	1
but	1
the	1
pleasure	1
married	1
people	1
get	1
from	1
one	1
another,	1
that	1
is,	1
only	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
marriage	1
and	1
not	1
its	1
whole	1
significance,	1
which	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
family.	1
	1
Discussions	1
and	1
questions	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
which	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
greatest	1
gratification	1
from	1
one's	1
dinner,	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
now	1
exist	1
for	1
those	1
for	1
whom	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
a	1
dinner	1
is	1
the	1
nourishment	1
it	1
affords;	1
and	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
marriage	1
is	1
the	1
family.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
dinner	1
is	1
to	1
nourish	1
the	1
body,	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
eats	1
two	1
dinners	1
at	1
once	1
may	1
perhaps	1
get	1
more	1
enjoyment	1
but	1
will	1
not	1
attain	1
his	1
purpose,	1
for	1
his	1
stomach	1
will	1
not	1
digest	1
the	1
two	1
dinners.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
marriage	1
is	1
the	1
family,	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
wishes	1
to	1
have	1
many	1
wives	1
or	1
husbands	1
may	1
perhaps	1
obtain	1
much	1
pleasure,	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
family.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
food	1
is	1
nourishment	1
and	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
marriage	1
is	1
the	1
family,	1
the	1
whole	1
question	1
resolves	1
itself	1
into	1
not	1
eating	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
can	1
digest,	1
and	1
not	1
having	1
more	1
wives	1
or	1
husbands	1
than	1
are	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
family--that	1
is,	1
one	1
wife	1
or	1
one	1
husband.	1
Natasha	1
needed	1
a	1
husband.	1
A	1
husband	1
was	1
given	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
family.	1
And	1
she	1
not	1
only	1
saw	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
or	1
better	1
husband,	1
but	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
were	1
intent	1
on	1
serving	1
that	1
husband	1
and	1
family,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
imagining	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
things	1
were	1
different.	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
society	1
in	1
general,	1
but	1
prized	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
her	1
relatives--Countess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
her	1
brother,	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
Sonya.	1
She	1
valued	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
come	1
striding	1
disheveled	1
from	1
the	1
nursery	1
in	1
her	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
and	1
with	1
joyful	1
face	1
show	1
a	1
yellow	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
green	1
stain	1
on	1
baby's	1
napkin,	1
and	1
from	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
reassuring	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
baby	1
was	1
much	1
better.	1
	1
To	1
such	1
an	1
extent	1
had	1
Natasha	1
let	1
herself	1
go	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
she	1
dressed	1
and	1
did	1
her	1
hair,	1
her	1
ill-chosen	1
words,	1
and	1
her	1
jealousy--she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
of	1
the	1
governess,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
woman,	1
pretty	1
or	1
plain-	1
-were	1
habitual	1
subjects	1
of	1
jest	1
to	1
those	1
about	1
her.	1
The	1
general	1
opinion	1
was	1
that	1
Pierre	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
wife's	1
thumb,	1
which	1
was	1
really	1
true.	1
From	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
Natasha	1
had	1
announced	1
her	1
demands.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
greatly	1
surprised	1
by	1
his	1
wife's	1
view,	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
perfectly	1
novel	1
one,	1
that	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
belonged	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
family.	1
His	1
wife's	1
demands	1
astonished	1
him,	1
but	1
they	1
also	1
flattered	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
submitted	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
Pierre's	1
subjection	1
consisted	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
dared	1
not	1
flirt	1
with,	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
speak	1
smilingly	1
to,	1
any	1
other	1
woman;	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
as	1
a	1
pastime,	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
spend	1
money	1
on	1
a	1
whim,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
absent	1
himself	1
for	1
any	1
length	1
of	1
time,	1
except	1
on	1
business--in	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
included	1
his	1
intellectual	1
pursuits,	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
understand	1
but	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
attributed	1
great	1
importance.	1
To	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
this,	1
at	1
home	1
Pierre	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
regulate	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
chose.	1
At	1
home	1
Natasha	1
placed	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
household	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
occupied--that	1
is,	1
was	1
reading	1
or	1
writing	1
in	1
his	1
study.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
but	1
to	1
show	1
a	1
partiality	1
for	1
anything	1
to	1
get	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
liked	1
done	1
always.	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
express	1
a	1
wish	1
and	1
Natasha	1
would	1
jump	1
up	1
and	1
run	1
to	1
fulfill	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
entire	1
household	1
was	1
governed	1
according	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
supposed	1
orders,	1
that	1
is,	1
by	1
his	1
wishes	1
which	1
Natasha	1
tried	1
to	1
guess.	1
Their	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
place	1
of	1
residence,	1
their	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
ties,	1
Natasha's	1
occupations,	1
the	1
children's	1
upbringing,	1
were	1
all	1
selected	1
not	1
merely	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
expressed	1
wishes,	1
but	1
to	1
what	1
Natasha	1
from	1
the	1
thoughts	1
he	1
expressed	1
in	1
conversation	1
supposed	1
his	1
wishes	1
to	1
be.	1
And	1
she	1
deduced	1
the	1
essentials	1
of	1
his	1
wishes	1
quite	1
correctly,	1
and	1
having	1
once	1
arrived	1
at	1
them	1
clung	1
to	1
them	1
tenaciously.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
wanted	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
mind	1
she	1
would	1
fight	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
weapons.	1
	1
Thus	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
trouble	1
ever	1
memorable	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
child	1
who	1
was	1
delicate,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
three	1
times	1
and	1
Natasha	1
fell	1
ill	1
from	1
despair,	1
Pierre	1
one	1
day	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
Rousseau's	1
view,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
quite	1
agreed,	1
that	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
wet	1
nurse	1
is	1
unnatural	1
and	1
harmful.	1
When	1
her	1
next	1
baby	1
was	1
born,	1
despite	1
the	1
opposition	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
the	1
doctors,	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
himself--	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
vigorously	1
opposed	1
to	1
her	1
nursing	1
her	1
baby	1
herself,	1
a	1
thing	1
then	1
unheard	1
of	1
and	1
considered	1
injurious--she	1
insisted	1
on	1
having	1
her	1
own	1
way,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
nursed	1
all	1
her	1
babies	1
herself.	1
	1
It	1
very	1
often	1
happened	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
irritation	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
dispute,	1
but	1
long	1
afterwards	1
Pierre	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
and	1
delight	1
would	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
wife's	1
ideas	1
and	1
actions	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
against	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
argued,	1
but	1
divested	1
of	1
everything	1
superfluous	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
dispute	1
he	1
had	1
added	1
when	1
expressing	1
his	1
opinion.	1
	1
After	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
marriage	1
Pierre	1
had	1
the	1
joyous	1
and	1
firm	1
consciousness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
reflected	1
in	1
his	1
wife.	1
He	1
felt	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
bad	1
within	1
himself	1
inextricably	1
mingled	1
and	1
overlapping.	1
But	1
only	1
what	1
was	1
really	1
good	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
reflected	1
in	1
his	1
wife,	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
good	1
was	1
rejected.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
logical	1
reasoning	1
but	1
was	1
a	1
direct	1
and	1
mysterious	1
reflection.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Two	1
months	1
previously	1
when	1
Pierre	1
was	1
already	1
staying	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Theodore,	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
confer	1
on	1
some	1
important	1
questions	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
discussed	1
there	1
by	1
a	1
society	1
of	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
founders.	1
	1
On	1
reading	1
that	1
letter	1
(she	1
always	1
read	1
her	1
husband's	1
letters)	1
Natasha	1
herself	1
suggested	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
feel	1
his	1
absence	1
very	1
acutely.	1
She	1
attributed	1
immense	1
importance	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
husband's	1
intellectual	1
and	1
abstract	1
interests	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them,	1
and	1
she	1
always	1
dreaded	1
being	1
a	1
hindrance	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
matters.	1
To	1
Pierre's	1
timid	1
look	1
of	1
inquiry	1
after	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
replied	1
by	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
to	1
fix	1
a	1
definite	1
date	1
for	1
his	1
return.	1
He	1
was	1
given	1
four	1
weeks'	1
leave	1
of	1
absence.	1
	1
Ever	1
since	1
that	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
had	1
expired,	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
fortnight	1
before,	1
Natasha	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
constant	1
state	1
of	1
alarm,	1
depression,	1
and	1
irritability.	1
	1
Denisov,	1
now	1
a	1
general	1
on	1
the	1
retired	1
list	1
and	1
much	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
affairs,	1
had	1
arrived	1
during	1
that	1
fortnight.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
Natasha	1
with	1
sorrow	1
and	1
surprise	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
bad	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
once	1
dear.	1
A	1
dull,	1
dejected	1
look,	1
random	1
replies,	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
nursery	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
former	1
enchantress.	1
	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sad	1
and	1
irritable	1
all	1
that	1
time,	1
especially	1
when	1
her	1
mother,	1
her	1
brother,	1
Sonya,	1
or	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
in	1
their	1
efforts	1
to	1
console	1
her	1
tried	1
to	1
excuse	1
Pierre	1
and	1
suggested	1
reasons	1
for	1
his	1
delay	1
in	1
returning.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
nonsense,	1
all	1
rubbish--those	1
discussions	1
which	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
idiotic	1
societies!"	1
Natasha	1
declared	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
affairs	1
in	1
the	1
immense	1
importance	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
firmly	1
believed.	1
	1
And	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
to	1
nurse	1
Petya,	1
her	1
only	1
boy.	1
No	1
one	1
else	1
could	1
tell	1
her	1
anything	1
so	1
comforting	1
or	1
so	1
reasonable	1
as	1
this	1
little	1
three-month-old	1
creature	1
when	1
he	1
lay	1
at	1
her	1
breast	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
snuffling	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
nose.	1
That	1
creature	1
said:	1
"You	1
are	1
angry,	1
you	1
are	1
jealous,	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
out,	1
you	1
are	1
afraid--but	1
here	1
am	1
I!	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
he..."	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
unanswerable.	1
It	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
true.	1
	1
During	1
that	1
fortnight	1
of	1
anxiety	1
Natasha	1
resorted	1
to	1
the	1
baby	1
for	1
comfort	1
so	1
often,	1
and	1
fussed	1
over	1
him	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
she	1
overfed	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
ill.	1
She	1
was	1
terrified	1
by	1
his	1
illness,	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
she	1
needed.	1
While	1
attending	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
bore	1
the	1
anxiety	1
about	1
her	1
husband	1
more	1
easily.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
nursing	1
her	1
boy	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
sleigh	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
nurse--knowing	1
how	1
to	1
please	1
her	1
mistress--	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
inaudibly	1
but	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
face.	1
	1
"Has	1
he	1
come?"	1
Natasha	1
asked	1
quickly	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
afraid	1
to	1
move	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
rouse	1
the	1
dozing	1
baby.	1
	1
"He's	1
come,	1
ma'am,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
nurse.	1
	1
The	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
and	1
her	1
feet	1
involuntarily	1
moved,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
jump	1
up	1
and	1
run	1
out.	1
The	1
baby	1
again	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her.	1
"You're	1
here?"	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying,	1
and	1
again	1
lazily	1
smacked	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
Cautiously	1
withdrawing	1
her	1
breast,	1
Natasha	1
rocked	1
him	1
a	1
little,	1
handed	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
nurse,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
toward	1
the	1
door.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
stopped	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
conscience	1
reproached	1
her	1
for	1
having	1
in	1
her	1
joy	1
left	1
the	1
child	1
too	1
soon,	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
round.	1
The	1
nurse	1
with	1
raised	1
elbows	1
was	1
lifting	1
the	1
infant	1
over	1
the	1
rail	1
of	1
his	1
cot.	1
	1
"Go,	1
ma'am!	1
Don't	1
worry,	1
go!"	1
she	1
whispered,	1
smiling,	1
with	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
familiarity	1
that	1
grows	1
up	1
between	1
a	1
nurse	1
and	1
her	1
mistress.	1
	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
with	1
light	1
footsteps	1
to	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
into	1
the	1
dancing	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
pipe,	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
recognized	1
the	1
old	1
Natasha.	1
A	1
flood	1
of	1
brilliant,	1
joyful	1
light	1
poured	1
from	1
her	1
transfigured	1
face.	1
	1
"He's	1
come!"	1
she	1
exclaimed	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
past,	1
and	1
Denisov	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
delighted	1
that	1
Pierre,	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
care	1
for,	1
had	1
returned.	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
vestibule	1
Natasha	1
saw	1
a	1
tall	1
figure	1
in	1
a	1
fur	1
coat	1
unwinding	1
his	1
scarf.	1
"It's	1
he!	1
It's	1
really	1
he!	1
He	1
has	1
come!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
rushing	1
at	1
him	1
embraced	1
him,	1
pressed	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
breast,	1
and	1
then	1
pushed	1
him	1
back	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
ruddy,	1
happy	1
face,	1
covered	1
with	1
hoarfrost.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
he,	1
happy	1
and	1
contented..."	1
	1
Then	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
suspense	1
she	1
had	1
experienced	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
the	1
joy	1
that	1
had	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
face	1
vanished;	1
she	1
frowned	1
and	1
overwhelmed	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
reproaches	1
and	1
angry	1
words.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
are	1
pleased,	1
you've	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
time....	1
But	1
what	1
about	1
me?	1
You	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
have	1
shown	1
consideration	1
for	1
the	1
children.	1
I	1
am	1
nursing	1
and	1
my	1
milk	1
was	1
spoiled....	1
Petya	1
was	1
at	1
death's	1
door.	1
But	1
you	1
were	1
enjoying	1
yourself.	1
Yes,	1
enjoying..."	1
	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
sooner;	1
he	1
knew	1
this	1
outburst	1
was	1
unseemly	1
and	1
would	1
blow	1
over	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two;	1
above	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
happy.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
smile	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
of	1
doing	1
so.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
piteous,	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
bent	1
down.	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
not,	1
on	1
my	1
honor.	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
Petya?"	1
	1
"All	1
right	1
now.	1
Come	1
along!	1
I	1
wonder	1
you're	1
not	1
ashamed!	1
If	1
only	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
like	1
without	1
you,	1
how	1
I	1
suffered!"	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
well?"	1
	1
"Come,	1
come!"	1
she	1
said,	1
not	1
letting	1
go	1
of	1
his	1
arm.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
rooms.	1
	1
When	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
Pierre	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
holding	1
his	1
baby	1
son,	1
who	1
was	1
again	1
awake,	1
on	1
his	1
huge	1
right	1
palm	1
and	1
dandling	1
him.	1
A	1
blissful	1
bright	1
smile	1
was	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
baby's	1
broad	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
toothless	1
open	1
mouth.	1
The	1
storm	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
over	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
bright,	1
joyous	1
sunshine	1
on	1
Natasha's	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
gazed	1
tenderly	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
child.	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
talked	1
everything	1
well	1
over	1
with	1
Prince	1
Theodore?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
capitally."	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
he	1
holds	1
it	1
up."	1
(She	1
meant	1
the	1
baby's	1
head.)	1
"But	1
how	1
he	1
did	1
frighten	1
me...	1
You've	1
seen	1
the	1
princess?	1
Is	1
it	1
true	1
she's	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
just	1
fancy..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
came	1
in.	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
baby	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
stooped,	1
kissed	1
them,	1
and	1
replied	1
to	1
their	1
inquiries.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
much	1
that	1
was	1
interesting	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
discussed,	1
the	1
baby	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
cap	1
on	1
its	1
unsteady	1
head	1
evidently	1
absorbed	1
all	1
his	1
attention.	1
	1
"How	1
sweet!"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
looking	1
at	1
and	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
baby.	1
"Now,	1
Nicholas,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
"I	1
can't	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
these	1
delicious	1
marvels."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
and	1
can't,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
looking	1
coldly	1
at	1
the	1
baby.	1
"A	1
lump	1
of	1
flesh.	1
Come	1
along,	1
Pierre!"	1
	1
"And	1
yet	1
he's	1
such	1
an	1
affectionate	1
father,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
vindicating	1
her	1
husband,	1
"but	1
only	1
after	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
year	1
old	1
or	1
so..."	1
	1
"Now,	1
Pierre	1
nurses	1
them	1
splendidly,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"He	1
says	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
just	1
made	1
for	1
a	1
baby's	1
seat.	1
Just	1
look!"	1
	1
"Only	1
not	1
for	1
this..."	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
a	1
laugh,	1
and	1
shifting	1
the	1
baby	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
nurse.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
As	1
in	1
every	1
large	1
household,	1
there	1
were	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
several	1
perfectly	1
distinct	1
worlds	1
which	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
harmonious	1
whole,	1
though	1
each	1
retained	1
its	1
own	1
peculiarities	1
and	1
made	1
concessions	1
to	1
the	1
others.	1
Every	1
event,	1
joyful	1
or	1
sad,	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
was	1
important	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
worlds,	1
but	1
each	1
had	1
its	1
own	1
special	1
reasons	1
to	1
rejoice	1
or	1
grieve	1
over	1
that	1
occurrence	1
independently	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
For	1
instance,	1
Pierre's	1
return	1
was	1
a	1
joyful	1
and	1
important	1
event	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so.	1
	1
The	1
servants--the	1
most	1
reliable	1
judges	1
of	1
their	1
masters	1
because	1
they	1
judge	1
not	1
by	1
their	1
conversation	1
or	1
expressions	1
of	1
feeling	1
but	1
by	1
their	1
acts	1
and	1
way	1
of	1
life--were	1
glad	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
return	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
Count	1
Nicholas	1
would	1
cease	1
going	1
every	1
day	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
estate,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
better	1
spirits	1
and	1
temper,	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
receive	1
handsome	1
presents	1
for	1
the	1
holidays.	1
	1
The	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
governesses	1
were	1
glad	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
return	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
drew	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
social	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
as	1
he	1
did.	1
He	1
alone	1
could	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord	1
that	1
ecossaise	1
(his	1
only	1
piece)	1
to	1
which,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
all	1
possible	1
dances	1
could	1
be	1
danced,	1
and	1
they	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
presents	1
for	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
Young	1
Nicholas,	1
now	1
a	1
slim	1
lad	1
of	1
fifteen,	1
delicate	1
and	1
intelligent,	1
with	1
curly	1
light-brown	1
hair	1
and	1
beautiful	1
eyes,	1
was	1
delighted	1
because	1
Uncle	1
Pierre	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
rapturous	1
and	1
passionate	1
affection.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
instilled	1
into	1
him	1
this	1
love	1
for	1
Pierre	1
whom	1
he	1
saw	1
only	1
occasionally.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
utmost	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
love	1
her	1
husband	1
as	1
she	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
did	1
love	1
his	1
uncle,	1
but	1
loved	1
him	1
with	1
just	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
contempt.	1
Pierre,	1
however,	1
he	1
adored.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar	1
or	1
a	1
Knight	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
like	1
his	1
uncle	1
Nicholas;	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
learned,	1
wise,	1
and	1
kind	1
like	1
Pierre.	1
In	1
Pierre's	1
presence	1
his	1
face	1
always	1
shone	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
flushed	1
and	1
was	1
breathless	1
when	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
miss	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
he	1
uttered,	1
and	1
would	1
afterwards,	1
with	1
Dessalles	1
or	1
by	1
himself,	1
recall	1
and	1
reconsider	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
everything	1
Pierre	1
had	1
said.	1
Pierre's	1
past	1
life	1
and	1
his	1
unhappiness	1
prior	1
to	1
1812	1
(of	1
which	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
vague	1
poetic	1
picture	1
from	1
some	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
overheard),	1
his	1
adventures	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
his	1
captivity,	1
Platon	1
Karataev	1
(of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
Pierre),	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
Natasha	1
(of	1
whom	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
also	1
particularly	1
fond),	1
and	1
especially	1
Pierre's	1
friendship	1
with	1
the	1
father	1
whom	1
Nicholas	1
could	1
not	1
remember--all	1
this	1
made	1
Pierre	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
a	1
hero	1
and	1
a	1
saint.	1
	1
From	1
broken	1
remarks	1
about	1
Natasha	1
and	1
his	1
father,	1
from	1
the	1
emotion	1
with	1
which	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
of	1
that	1
dead	1
father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
careful,	1
reverent	1
tenderness	1
with	1
which	1
Natasha	1
spoke	1
of	1
him,	1
the	1
boy,	1
who	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
love	1
is,	1
derived	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
loved	1
Natasha	1
and	1
when	1
dying	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
friend.	1
But	1
the	1
father	1
whom	1
the	1
boy	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
divinity	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
pictured,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
never	1
thought	1
without	1
a	1
swelling	1
heart	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
sadness	1
and	1
rapture.	1
So	1
the	1
boy	1
also	1
was	1
happy	1
that	1
Pierre	1
had	1
arrived.	1
	1
The	1
guests	1
welcomed	1
Pierre	1
because	1
he	1
always	1
helped	1
to	1
enliven	1
and	1
unite	1
any	1
company	1
he	1
was	1
in.	1
	1
The	1
grown-up	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
his	1
wife,	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
back	1
a	1
friend	1
whose	1
presence	1
made	1
life	1
run	1
more	1
smoothly	1
and	1
peacefully.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
ladies	1
were	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
presents	1
he	1
brought	1
them,	1
and	1
especially	1
that	1
Natasha	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
herself	1
again.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
the	1
different	1
outlooks	1
of	1
these	1
various	1
worlds	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
satisfy	1
all	1
their	1
expectations.	1
	1
Though	1
the	1
most	1
absent-minded	1
and	1
forgetful	1
of	1
men,	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
list	1
his	1
wife	1
drew	1
up,	1
had	1
now	1
bought	1
everything,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
his	1
mother--and	1
brother-in-law's	1
commissions,	1
nor	1
the	1
dress	1
material	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
Belova,	1
nor	1
toys	1
for	1
his	1
wife's	1
nephews.	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
marriage	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
should	1
expect	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
to	1
procure	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
undertook	1
to	1
buy,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
aback	1
by	1
her	1
serious	1
annoyance	1
when	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
trip	1
he	1
forgot	1
everything.	1
But	1
in	1
time	1
he	1
grew	1
used	1
to	1
this	1
demand.	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Natasha	1
asked	1
nothing	1
for	1
herself,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
commissions	1
for	1
others	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
offered	1
to	1
undertake	1
them,	1
he	1
now	1
found	1
an	1
unexpected	1
and	1
childlike	1
pleasure	1
in	1
this	1
purchase	1
of	1
presents	1
for	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
never	1
forgot	1
anything.	1
If	1
he	1
now	1
incurred	1
Natasha's	1
censure	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
for	1
buying	1
too	1
many	1
and	1
too	1
expensive	1
things.	1
To	1
her	1
other	1
defects	1
(as	1
most	1
people	1
thought	1
them,	1
but	1
which	1
to	1
Pierre	1
were	1
qualities)	1
of	1
untidiness	1
and	1
neglect	1
of	1
herself,	1
she	1
now	1
added	1
stinginess.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Pierre	1
began	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
family	1
man	1
on	1
a	1
footing	1
entailing	1
heavy	1
expenditure,	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
that	1
he	1
spent	1
only	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
affairs--which	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
disorder	1
of	1
late,	1
chiefly	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
wife's	1
debts--had	1
begun	1
to	1
improve.	1
	1
Life	1
was	1
cheaper	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
circumscribed:	1
that	1
most	1
expensive	1
luxury,	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
changed	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
his	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
wish	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
settled	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
till	1
death	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
change	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
so	1
that	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
proved	1
economical.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
merry,	1
smiling	1
face	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sorting	1
his	1
purchases.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
this?"	1
said	1
he,	1
unrolling	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
stuff	1
like	1
a	1
shopman.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
on	1
her	1
lap,	1
turned	1
her	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
swiftly	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
showed	1
her.	1
	1
"That's	1
for	1
Belova?	1
Excellent!"	1
She	1
felt	1
the	1
quality	1
of	1
the	1
material.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
ruble	1
an	1
arshin,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
price.	1
	1
"Too	1
dear!"	1
Natasha	1
remarked.	1
"How	1
pleased	1
the	1
children	1
will	1
be	1
and	1
Mamma	1
too!	1
Only	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
bought	1
me	1
this,"	1
she	1
added,	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
as	1
she	1
gazed	1
admiringly	1
at	1
a	1
gold	1
comb	1
set	1
with	1
pearls,	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
then	1
just	1
coming	1
into	1
fashion.	1
	1
"Adele	1
tempted	1
me:	1
she	1
kept	1
on	1
telling	1
me	1
to	1
buy	1
it,"	1
returned	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"When	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
wear	1
it?"	1
and	1
Natasha	1
stuck	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
coil	1
of	1
hair.	1
"When	1
I	1
take	1
little	1
Masha	1
into	1
society?	1
Perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
fashionable	1
again	1
by	1
then.	1
Well,	1
let's	1
go	1
now."	1
	1
And	1
collecting	1
the	1
presents	1
they	1
went	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
countess'	1
rooms.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
companion	1
Belova,	1
playing	1
grand-	1
patience	1
as	1
usual,	1
when	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Natasha	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
parcels	1
under	1
their	1
arms.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
now	1
over	1
sixty,	1
was	1
quite	1
gray,	1
and	1
wore	1
a	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
frill	1
that	1
surrounded	1
her	1
face.	1
Her	1
face	1
had	1
shriveled,	1
her	1
upper	1
lip	1
had	1
sunk	1
in,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
dim.	1
	1
After	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
husband	1
in	1
such	1
rapid	1
succession,	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
a	1
being	1
accidentally	1
forgotten	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
left	1
without	1
aim	1
or	1
object	1
for	1
her	1
existence.	1
She	1
ate,	1
drank,	1
slept,	1
or	1
kept	1
awake,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
live.	1
Life	1
gave	1
her	1
no	1
new	1
impressions.	1
She	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
from	1
life	1
but	1
tranquillity,	1
and	1
that	1
tranquillity	1
only	1
death	1
could	1
give	1
her.	1
But	1
until	1
death	1
came	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
living,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
use	1
her	1
vital	1
forces.	1
A	1
peculiarity	1
one	1
sees	1
in	1
very	1
young	1
children	1
and	1
very	1
old	1
people	1
was	1
particularly	1
evident	1
in	1
her.	1
Her	1
life	1
had	1
no	1
external	1
aims--only	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
exercise	1
her	1
various	1
functions	1
and	1
inclinations	1
was	1
apparent.	1
She	1
had	1
to	1
eat,	1
sleep,	1
think,	1
speak,	1
weep,	1
work,	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
her	1
anger,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
merely	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
stomach,	1
a	1
brain,	1
muscles,	1
nerves,	1
and	1
a	1
liver.	1
She	1
did	1
these	1
things	1
not	1
under	1
any	1
external	1
impulse	1
as	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
vigor	1
of	1
life	1
do,	1
when	1
behind	1
the	1
purpose	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
strive	1
that	1
of	1
exercising	1
their	1
functions	1
remains	1
unnoticed.	1
She	1
talked	1
only	1
because	1
she	1
physically	1
needed	1
to	1
exercise	1
her	1
tongue	1
and	1
lungs.	1
She	1
cried	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
does,	1
because	1
her	1
nose	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
cleared,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
What	1
for	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
full	1
vigor	1
is	1
an	1
aim	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
evidently	1
merely	1
a	1
pretext.	1
	1
Thus	1
in	1
the	1
morning--especially	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
eaten	1
anything	1
rich	1
the	1
day	1
before--she	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
of	1
being	1
angry	1
and	1
would	1
choose	1
as	1
the	1
handiest	1
pretext	1
Belova's	1
deafness.	1
	1
She	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
tone	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
a	1
little	1
warmer	1
today,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
she	1
would	1
murmur.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
Belova	1
replied:	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
they've	1
come,"	1
she	1
would	1
mutter	1
angrily:	1
"O	1
Lord!	1
How	1
stupid	1
and	1
deaf	1
she	1
is!"	1
	1
Another	1
pretext	1
would	1
be	1
her	1
snuff,	1
which	1
would	1
seem	1
too	1
dry	1
or	1
too	1
damp	1
or	1
not	1
rubbed	1
fine	1
enough.	1
After	1
these	1
fits	1
of	1
irritability	1
her	1
face	1
would	1
grow	1
yellow,	1
and	1
her	1
maids	1
knew	1
by	1
infallible	1
symptoms	1
when	1
Belova	1
would	1
again	1
be	1
deaf,	1
the	1
snuff	1
damp,	1
and	1
the	1
countess'	1
face	1
yellow.	1
Just	1
as	1
she	1
needed	1
to	1
work	1
off	1
her	1
spleen	1
so	1
she	1
had	1
sometimes	1
to	1
exercise	1
her	1
still-existing	1
faculty	1
of	1
thinking--and	1
the	1
pretext	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
patience.	1
When	1
she	1
needed	1
to	1
cry,	1
the	1
deceased	1
count	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
pretext.	1
When	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
agitated,	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
health	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
pretext,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
speak	1
spitefully,	1
the	1
pretext	1
would	1
be	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
When	1
her	1
vocal	1
organs	1
needed	1
exercise,	1
which	1
was	1
usually	1
toward	1
seven	1
o'clock	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
an	1
after-dinner	1
rest	1
in	1
a	1
darkened	1
room,	1
the	1
pretext	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
retelling	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
stories	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
audience.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
lady's	1
condition	1
was	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
household	1
though	1
no	1
one	1
ever	1
spoke	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
made	1
every	1
possible	1
effort	1
to	1
satisfy	1
her	1
needs.	1
Only	1
by	1
a	1
rare	1
glance	1
exchanged	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
smile	1
between	1
Nicholas,	1
Pierre,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
was	1
the	1
common	1
understanding	1
of	1
her	1
condition	1
expressed.	1
	1
But	1
those	1
glances	1
expressed	1
something	1
more:	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
played	1
her	1
part	1
in	1
life,	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
now	1
saw	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
whole	1
self,	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
become	1
like	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
her,	1
to	1
restrain	1
themselves	1
for	1
this	1
once	1
precious	1
being	1
formerly	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
themselves,	1
but	1
now	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied.	1
"Memento	1
mori,"	1
said	1
these	1
glances.	1
	1
Only	1
the	1
really	1
heartless,	1
the	1
stupid	1
ones	1
of	1
that	1
household,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
failed	1
to	1
understand	1
this	1
and	1
avoided	1
her.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
When	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
customary	1
states	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
needed	1
the	1
mental	1
exertion	1
of	1
playing	1
patience,	1
and	1
so--though	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
she	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
always	1
used	1
when	1
Pierre	1
or	1
her	1
son	1
returned	1
after	1
an	1
absence:	1
"High	1
time,	1
my	1
dear,	1
high	1
time!	1
We	1
were	1
all	1
weary	1
of	1
waiting	1
for	1
you.	1
Well,	1
thank	1
God!"	1
and	1
received	1
her	1
presents	1
with	1
another	1
customary	1
remark:	1
"It's	1
not	1
the	1
gift	1
that's	1
precious,	1
my	1
dear,	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
an	1
old	1
woman..."--yet	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
pleased	1
by	1
Pierre's	1
arrival	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
when	1
it	1
diverted	1
her	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
unfinished	1
game.	1
	1
She	1
finished	1
her	1
game	1
of	1
patience	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
examined	1
the	1
presents.	1
They	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
box	1
for	1
cards,	1
of	1
splendid	1
workmanship,	1
a	1
bright-	1
blue	1
Sevres	1
tea	1
cup	1
with	1
shepherdesses	1
depicted	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
lid,	1
and	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
the	1
count's	1
portrait	1
on	1
the	1
lid	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
had	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
miniaturist	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
long	1
wished	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
box,	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
cry	1
just	1
then	1
she	1
glanced	1
indifferently	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
attention	1
chiefly	1
to	1
the	1
box	1
for	1
cards.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
have	1
cheered	1
me	1
up,"	1
said	1
she	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did.	1
"But	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
brought	1
yourself	1
back--for	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
anything	1
like	1
it,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
your	1
wife	1
a	1
scolding!	1
What	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her?	1
She	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
mad	1
woman	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
away.	1
Doesn't	1
see	1
anything,	1
doesn't	1
remember	1
anything,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
repeating	1
her	1
usual	1
phrases.	1
"Look,	1
Anna	1
Timofeevna,"	1
she	1
added	1
to	1
her	1
companion,	1
"see	1
what	1
a	1
box	1
for	1
cards	1
my	1
son	1
has	1
brought	1
us!"	1
	1
Belova	1
admired	1
the	1
presents	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
her	1
dress	1
material.	1
	1
Though	1
Pierre,	1
Natasha,	1
Nicholas,	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Denisov	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
discuss	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
countess--not	1
that	1
anything	1
was	1
hidden	1
from	1
her,	1
but	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
dropped	1
so	1
far	1
behindhand	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
they	1
begun	1
to	1
converse	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
answer	1
inopportune	1
questions	1
and	1
to	1
repeat	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
her	1
many	1
times:	1
that	1
so-and-so	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
so-and-so	1
was	1
married,	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
again	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
remember--yet	1
they	1
sat	1
at	1
tea	1
round	1
the	1
samovar	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
from	1
habit,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
answered	1
the	1
countess'	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
aged	1
and	1
whether	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
Alexeevna	1
had	1
sent	1
greetings	1
and	1
still	1
thought	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
other	1
matters	1
that	1
interested	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
indifferent.	1
	1
Conversation	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
interesting	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
yet	1
unavoidable,	1
continued	1
all	1
through	1
teatime.	1
All	1
the	1
grown-up	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
assembled	1
near	1
the	1
round	1
tea	1
table	1
at	1
which	1
Sonya	1
presided	1
beside	1
the	1
samovar.	1
The	1
children	1
with	1
their	1
tutors	1
and	1
governesses	1
had	1
had	1
tea	1
and	1
their	1
voices	1
were	1
audible	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
At	1
tea	1
all	1
sat	1
in	1
their	1
accustomed	1
places:	1
Nicholas	1
beside	1
the	1
stove	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
table	1
where	1
his	1
tea	1
was	1
handed	1
to	1
him;	1
Milka,	1
the	1
old	1
gray	1
borzoi	1
bitch	1
(daughter	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Milka),	1
with	1
a	1
quite	1
gray	1
face	1
and	1
large	1
black	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
more	1
prominent	1
than	1
ever,	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
armchair	1
beside	1
him;	1
Denisov,	1
whose	1
curly	1
hair,	1
mustache,	1
and	1
whiskers	1
had	1
turned	1
half	1
gray,	1
sat	1
beside	1
countess	1
Mary	1
with	1
his	1
general's	1
tunic	1
unbuttoned;	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
between	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
countess.	1
He	1
spoke	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
might	1
interest	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
understand.	1
He	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
external	1
social	1
events	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
formed	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
her	1
contemporaries	1
and	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
a	1
real,	1
living,	1
and	1
distinct	1
group,	1
but	1
who	1
were	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
scattered	1
about	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
like	1
herself	1
were	1
garnering	1
the	1
last	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
harvests	1
they	1
had	1
sown	1
in	1
earlier	1
years.	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
those	1
contemporaries	1
of	1
hers	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
serious	1
and	1
real	1
society.	1
Natasha	1
saw	1
by	1
Pierre's	1
animation	1
that	1
his	1
visit	1
had	1
been	1
interesting	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
but	1
dare	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
countess.	1
Denisov,	1
not	1
being	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
Pierre's	1
caution	1
and	1
being,	1
as	1
a	1
malcontent,	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
occurring	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
kept	1
urging	1
Pierre	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
about	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
Semenovsk	1
regiment,	1
then	1
about	1
Arakcheev,	1
and	1
then	1
about	1
the	1
Bible	1
Society.	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
Pierre	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Natasha	1
always	1
brought	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Prince	1
Ivan	1
and	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
Alexeevna.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
idiocy--Gossner	1
and	1
Tatawinova?"	1
Denisov	1
asked.	1
"Is	1
that	1
weally	1
still	1
going	1
on?"	1
	1
	1
"Going	1
on?"	1
Pierre	1
exclaimed.	1
"Why	1
more	1
than	1
ever!	1
The	1
Bible	1
Society	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
government	1
now!"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
that,	1
mon	1
cher	1
ami?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess,	1
who	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
tea	1
and	1
evidently	1
needed	1
a	1
pretext	1
for	1
being	1
angry	1
after	1
her	1
meal.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
saying	1
about	1
the	1
government?	1
I	1
don't	1
understand."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know,	1
Maman,"	1
Nicholas	1
interposed,	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
translate	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
mother's	1
language,	1
"Prince	1
Alexander	1
Golitsyn	1
has	1
founded	1
a	1
society	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
has	1
great	1
influence,	1
they	1
say."	1
	1
"Arakcheev	1
and	1
Golitsyn,"	1
incautiously	1
remarked	1
Pierre,	1
"are	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
government!	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
government!	1
They	1
see	1
treason	1
everywhere	1
and	1
are	1
afraid	1
of	1
everything."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
Prince	1
Alexander	1
to	1
blame?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
estimable	1
man.	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
Mary	1
Antonovna's,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone;	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
offended	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
remained	1
silent,	1
she	1
went	1
on:	1
"Nowadays	1
everyone	1
finds	1
fault.	1
A	1
Gospel	1
Society!	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
harm	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
that?"	1
and	1
she	1
rose	1
(everybody	1
else	1
got	1
up	1
too)	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
severe	1
expression	1
sailed	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
The	1
melancholy	1
silence	1
that	1
followed	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
children's	1
voices	1
and	1
laughter	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
Evidently	1
some	1
jolly	1
excitement	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
there.	1
	1
"Finished,	1
finished!"	1
little	1
Natasha's	1
gleeful	1
yell	1
rose	1
above	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
Pierre	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
(Natasha	1
he	1
never	1
lost	1
sight	1
of)	1
and	1
smiled	1
happily.	1
	1
"That's	1
delightful	1
music!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"It	1
means	1
that	1
Anna	1
Makarovna	1
has	1
finished	1
her	1
stocking,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I'll	1
go	1
and	1
see,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
jumping	1
up.	1
"You	1
know,"	1
he	1
added,	1
stopping	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
"why	1
I'm	1
especially	1
fond	1
of	1
that	1
music?	1
It	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
tells	1
me	1
all	1
is	1
well.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
driving	1
here	1
today,	1
the	1
nearer	1
I	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
more	1
anxious	1
I	1
grew.	1
As	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
anteroom	1
I	1
heard	1
Andrusha's	1
peals	1
of	1
laughter	1
and	1
that	1
meant	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
well."	1
	1
"I	1
know!	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
feeling,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"But	1
I	1
mustn't	1
go	1
there--	1
those	1
stockings	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
surprise	1
for	1
me."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
and	1
laughter	1
grew	1
still	1
louder.	1
	1
"Come,	1
Anna	1
Makarovna,"	1
Pierre's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
saying,	1
"come	1
here	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
'One,	1
two,'	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
'three'...	1
You	1
stand	1
here,	1
and	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
arms--well	1
now!	1
One,	1
two!..."	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
a	1
silence	1
followed:	1
"three!"	1
and	1
a	1
rapturously	1
breathless	1
cry	1
of	1
children's	1
voices	1
filled	1
the	1
room.	1
"Two,	1
two!"	1
they	1
shouted.	1
	1
This	1
meant	1
two	1
stockings,	1
which	1
by	1
a	1
secret	1
process	1
known	1
only	1
to	1
herself	1
Anna	1
Makarovna	1
used	1
to	1
knit	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
needles,	1
and	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
ready,	1
she	1
always	1
triumphantly	1
drew,	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
the	1
children's	1
presence.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
children	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
night.	1
They	1
kissed	1
everyone,	1
the	1
tutors	1
and	1
governesses	1
made	1
their	1
bows,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out.	1
Only	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
his	1
tutor	1
remained.	1
Dessalles	1
whispered	1
to	1
the	1
boy	1
to	1
come	1
downstairs.	1
	1
"No,	1
Monsieur	1
Dessalles,	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
my	1
aunt	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
stay,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"Ma	1
tante,	1
please	1
let	1
me	1
stay,"	1
said	1
he,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
aunt.	1
	1
His	1
face	1
expressed	1
entreaty,	1
agitation,	1
and	1
ecstasy.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"When	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
he	1
can't	1
tear	1
himself	1
away,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
directly,	1
Monsieur	1
Dessalles.	1
Good	1
night!"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
giving	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
Swiss	1
tutor,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"You	1
and	1
I	1
haven't	1
seen	1
anything	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
yet...	1
How	1
like	1
he	1
is	1
growing,	1
Mary!"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Like	1
my	1
father?"	1
asked	1
the	1
boy,	1
flushing	1
crimson	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
bright,	1
ecstatic	1
eyes.	1
	1
Pierre	1
nodded,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
saying	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
interrupted.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
sat	1
down	1
doing	1
woolwork;	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
husband.	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Denisov	1
rose,	1
asked	1
for	1
their	1
pipes,	1
smoked,	1
went	1
to	1
fetch	1
more	1
tea	1
from	1
Sonya--who	1
sat	1
weary	1
but	1
resolute	1
at	1
the	1
samovar--and	1
questioned	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
curly-	1
headed,	1
delicate	1
boy	1
sat	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes	1
unnoticed	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
starting	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
muttering	1
something	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
evidently	1
experiencing	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
powerful	1
emotion	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
curly	1
head,	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
neck	1
exposed	1
by	1
his	1
turn-down	1
collar,	1
toward	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Pierre	1
sat.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
contemporary	1
gossip	1
about	1
those	1
in	1
power,	1
in	1
which	1
most	1
people	1
see	1
the	1
chief	1
interest	1
of	1
home	1
politics.	1
Denisov,	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
government	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
disappointments	1
in	1
the	1
service,	1
heard	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
done	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
stupid,	1
and	1
made	1
forcible	1
and	1
sharp	1
comments	1
on	1
what	1
Pierre	1
told	1
them.	1
	1
"One	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
German--now	1
one	1
must	1
dance	1
with	1
Tatawinova	1
and	1
Madame	1
Kwudener,	1
and	1
wead	1
Ecka'tshausen	1
and	1
the	1
bwethwen.	1
Oh,	1
they	1
should	1
let	1
that	1
fine	1
fellow	1
Bonaparte	1
loose--he'd	1
knock	1
all	1
this	1
nonsense	1
out	1
of	1
them!	1
Fancy	1
giving	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
Semenov	1
wegiment	1
to	1
a	1
fellow	1
like	1
that	1
Schwa'tz!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
though	1
free	1
from	1
Denisov's	1
readiness	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
everything,	1
also	1
thought	1
that	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
and	1
weighty	1
matter,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
A	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
Minister	1
of	1
This	1
and	1
B	1
Governor	1
General	1
of	1
That,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
said	1
so-and-so	1
and	1
this	1
minister	1
so-and-so,	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
very	1
important.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
to	1
question	1
Pierre.	1
The	1
questions	1
put	1
by	1
these	1
two	1
kept	1
the	1
conversation	1
from	1
changing	1
its	1
ordinary	1
character	1
of	1
gossip	1
about	1
the	1
higher	1
government	1
circles.	1
	1
But	1
Natasha,	1
knowing	1
all	1
her	1
husband's	1
ways	1
and	1
ideas,	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
wishing	1
but	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
divert	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
another	1
channel	1
and	1
express	1
his	1
own	1
deeply	1
felt	1
idea	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
consult	1
with	1
his	1
new	1
friend	1
Prince	1
Theodore,	1
and	1
she	1
helped	1
him	1
by	1
asking	1
how	1
his	1
affairs	1
with	1
Prince	1
Theodore	1
had	1
gone.	1
	1
"What	1
was	1
it	1
about?"	1
asked	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Always	1
the	1
same	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
listeners.	1
"Everybody	1
sees	1
that	1
things	1
are	1
going	1
so	1
badly	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
all	1
decent	1
men	1
to	1
counteract	1
it	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
can."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
decent	1
men	1
do?"	1
Nicholas	1
inquired,	1
frowning	1
slightly.	1
"What	1
can	1
be	1
done?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
this..."	1
	1
"Come	1
into	1
my	1
study,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
fetched	1
to	1
nurse	1
her	1
baby,	1
now	1
heard	1
the	1
nurse	1
calling	1
her	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery.	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
followed	1
her.	1
The	1
men	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
followed	1
them	1
unnoticed	1
by	1
his	1
uncle	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
shady	1
corner	1
by	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
do?"	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Always	1
some	1
fantastic	1
schemes,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Why	1
this,"	1
began	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
sitting	1
down	1
but	1
pacing	1
the	1
room,	1
sometimes	1
stopping	1
short,	1
gesticulating,	1
and	1
lisping:	1
"the	1
position	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
is	1
this:	1
the	1
Emperor	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
into	1
anything.	1
He	1
has	1
abandoned	1
himself	1
altogether	1
to	1
this	1
mysticism"	1
(Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
tolerate	1
mysticism	1
in	1
anyone	1
now).	1
"He	1
seeks	1
only	1
for	1
peace,	1
and	1
only	1
these	1
people	1
sans	1
foi	1
ni	1
loi	1
*	1
can	1
give	1
it	1
him--people	1
who	1
recklessly	1
hack	1
at	1
and	1
strangle	1
everything--Magnitski,	1
Arakcheev,	1
and	1
tutti	1
quanti....	1
You	1
will	1
agree	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
estates	1
yourself	1
but	1
only	1
wanted	1
a	1
quiet	1
life,	1
the	1
harsher	1
your	1
steward	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
readily	1
your	1
object	1
might	1
be	1
attained,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
	1

Without	1
faith	1
or	1
law.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
does	1
that	1
lead	1
up	1
to?"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Well,	1
everything	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
ruin!	1
Robbery	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
courts,	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
nothing	1
but	1
flogging,	1
drilling,	1
and	1
Military	1
Settlements;	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
tortured,	1
enlightenment	1
is	1
suppressed.	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
honest	1
is	1
crushed!	1
Everyone	1
sees	1
that	1
this	1
cannot	1
go	1
on.	1
Everything	1
is	1
strained	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
certainly	1
break,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
(as	1
those	1
who	1
examine	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
any	1
government	1
have	1
always	1
said	1
since	1
governments	1
began).	1
"I	1
told	1
them	1
just	1
one	1
thing	1
in	1
Petersburg."	1
	1
"Told	1
whom?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know	1
whom,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
a	1
meaning	1
glance	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows.	1
"Prince	1
Theodore	1
and	1
all	1
those.	1
To	1
encourage	1
culture	1
and	1
philanthropy	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
of	1
course.	1
The	1
aim	1
is	1
excellent	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
circumstances	1
something	1
else	1
is	1
needed."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Nicholas	1
noticed	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
nephew.	1
His	1
face	1
darkened	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
boy.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
here?"	1
	1
"Why?	1
Let	1
him	1
be,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
taking	1
Nicholas	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
continuing.	1
"That	1
is	1
not	1
enough,	1
I	1
told	1
them.	1
Something	1
else	1
is	1
needed.	1
When	1
you	1
stand	1
expecting	1
the	1
overstrained	1
string	1
to	1
snap	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
when	1
everyone	1
is	1
expecting	1
the	1
inevitable	1
catastrophe,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
possible	1
must	1
join	1
hands	1
as	1
closely	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
to	1
withstand	1
the	1
general	1
calamity.	1
Everything	1
that	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
strong	1
is	1
being	1
enticed	1
away	1
and	1
depraved.	1
One	1
is	1
lured	1
by	1
women,	1
another	1
by	1
honors,	1
a	1
third	1
by	1
ambition	1
or	1
money,	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
that	1
camp.	1
No	1
independent	1
men,	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
or	1
I,	1
are	1
left.	1
What	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
widen	1
the	1
scope	1
of	1
our	1
society,	1
let	1
the	1
mot	1
d'ordre	1
be	1
not	1
virtue	1
alone	1
but	1
independence	1
and	1
action	1
as	1
well!"	1
	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
nephew,	1
irritably	1
pushed	1
up	1
an	1
armchair,	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
coughing	1
discontentedly	1
and	1
frowning	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
"But	1
action	1
with	1
what	1
aim?"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"And	1
what	1
position	1
will	1
you	1
adopt	1
toward	1
the	1
government?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
assistants.	1
The	1
society	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
secret	1
if	1
the	1
government	1
allows	1
it.	1
Not	1
merely	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
hostile	1
to	1
government,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
society	1
of	1
true	1
conservatives--a	1
society	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
meaning	1
of	1
that	1
word.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
prevent	1
some	1
Pugachev	1
or	1
other	1
from	1
killing	1
my	1
children	1
and	1
yours,	1
and	1
Arakcheev	1
from	1
sending	1
me	1
off	1
to	1
some	1
Military	1
Settlement.	1
We	1
join	1
hands	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
safety."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
it's	1
a	1
secret	1
society	1
and	1
therefore	1
a	1
hostile	1
and	1
harmful	1
one	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
cause	1
harm."	1
	1
"Why?	1
Did	1
the	1
Tugendbund	1
which	1
saved	1
Europe"	1
(they	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
venture	1
to	1
suggest	1
that	1
Russia	1
had	1
saved	1
Europe)	1
"do	1
any	1
harm?	1
The	1
Tugendbund	1
is	1
an	1
alliance	1
of	1
virtue:	1
it	1
is	1
love,	1
mutual	1
help...	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
Christ	1
preached	1
on	1
the	1
Cross."	1
	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
during	1
the	1
conversation,	1
looked	1
joyfully	1
at	1
her	1
husband.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
that	1
pleased	1
her--that	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
interest	1
her,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
extremely	1
simple	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
it	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
(it	1
seemed	1
so	1
to	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
sprang	1
from	1
Pierre's	1
whole	1
soul),	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
animated	1
and	1
enthusiastic	1
appearance	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
glad.	1
	1
The	1
boy	1
with	1
the	1
thin	1
neck	1
stretching	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
turn-down	1
collar--	1
whom	1
everyone	1
had	1
forgotten--gazed	1
at	1
Pierre	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
rapturous	1
joy.	1
Every	1
word	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
burned	1
into	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
nervous	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
broke	1
the	1
sealing	1
wax	1
and	1
quill	1
pens	1
his	1
hands	1
came	1
upon	1
on	1
his	1
uncle's	1
table.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
you	1
suppose;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
German	1
Tugendbund	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
proposing."	1
	1
"No,	1
my	1
fwiend!	1
The	1
Tugendbund	1
is	1
all	1
vewy	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
sausage	1
eaters,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it	1
and	1
can't	1
even	1
pwonounce	1
it,"	1
interposed	1
Denisov	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
resolute	1
voice.	1
"I	1
agwee	1
that	1
evewything	1
here	1
is	1
wotten	1
and	1
howwible,	1
but	1
the	1
Tugendbund	1
I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
If	1
we're	1
not	1
satisfied,	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
a	1
bunt	1
of	1
our	1
own.	1
That's	1
all	1
wight.	1
Je	1
suis	1
vot'e	1
homme!"	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"I'm	1
your	1
man."	1
	1
Pierre	1
smiled,	1
Natasha	1
began	1
to	1
laugh,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
knitted	1
his	1
brows	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
began	1
proving	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
prospect	1
of	1
any	1
great	1
change	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
danger	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
existed	1
only	1
in	1
his	1
imagination.	1
Pierre	1
maintained	1
the	1
contrary,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
mental	1
faculties	1
were	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
resourceful,	1
Nicholas	1
felt	1
himself	1
cornered.	1
This	1
made	1
him	1
still	1
angrier,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
fully	1
convinced,	1
not	1
by	1
reasoning	1
but	1
by	1
something	1
within	1
him	1
stronger	1
than	1
reason,	1
of	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
his	1
opinion.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
this,"	1
he	1
said,	1
rising	1
and	1
trying	1
with	1
nervously	1
twitching	1
fingers	1
to	1
prop	1
up	1
his	1
pipe	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
but	1
finally	1
abandoning	1
the	1
attempt.	1
"I	1
can't	1
prove	1
it	1
to	1
you.	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
everything	1
here	1
is	1
rotten	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
overthrow	1
is	1
coming:	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
it.	1
But	1
you	1
also	1
say	1
that	1
our	1
oath	1
of	1
allegiance	1
is	1
a	1
conditional	1
matter,	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
I	1
reply:	1
'You	1
are	1
my	1
best	1
friend,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
formed	1
a	1
secret	1
society	1
and	1
began	1
working	1
against	1
the	1
government-	1
-be	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
may--I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
government.	1
And	1
if	1
Arakcheev	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
lead	1
a	1
squadron	1
against	1
you	1
and	1
cut	1
you	1
down,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
hesitate	1
an	1
instant,	1
but	1
should	1
do	1
it.'	1
And	1
you	1
may	1
argue	1
about	1
that	1
as	1
you	1
like!"	1
	1
An	1
awkward	1
silence	1
followed	1
these	1
words.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
speak,	1
defending	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
attacking	1
her	1
brother.	1
Her	1
defense	1
was	1
weak	1
and	1
inapt	1
but	1
she	1
attained	1
her	1
object.	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
resumed,	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
unpleasantly	1
hostile	1
tone	1
of	1
Nicholas'	1
last	1
remark.	1
	1
When	1
they	1
all	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
supper,	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
pale	1
and	1
with	1
shining,	1
radiant	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Uncle	1
Pierre,	1
you...	1
no...	1
If	1
Papa	1
were	1
alive...	1
would	1
he	1
agree	1
with	1
you?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
And	1
Pierre	1
suddenly	1
realized	1
what	1
a	1
special,	1
independent,	1
complex,	1
and	1
powerful	1
process	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
boy	1
during	1
that	1
conversation,	1
and	1
remembering	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
regretted	1
that	1
the	1
lad	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
him.	1
He	1
had,	1
however,	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
answer.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
think	1
so,"	1
he	1
said	1
reluctantly,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
study.	1
	1
The	1
lad	1
looked	1
down	1
and	1
seemed	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
to	1
notice	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
flushed	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Uncle,	1
forgive	1
me,	1
I	1
did	1
that...	1
unintentionally,"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
broken	1
sealing	1
wax	1
and	1
pens.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
started	1
angrily.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,"	1
he	1
said,	1
throwing	1
the	1
bits	1
under	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
And	1
evidently	1
suppressing	1
his	1
vexation	1
with	1
difficulty,	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
boy.	1
	1
"You	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
at	1
all,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
at	1
supper	1
was	1
not	1
about	1
politics	1
or	1
societies,	1
but	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
Nicholas	1
liked	1
best--recollections	1
of	1
1812.	1
Denisov	1
started	1
these	1
and	1
Pierre	1
was	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
and	1
amusing	1
about	1
them.	1
The	1
family	1
separated	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
friendly	1
terms.	1
	1
After	1
supper	1
Nicholas,	1
having	1
undressed	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
given	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
steward	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
him,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
wife	1
still	1
at	1
her	1
table,	1
writing.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
writing,	1
Mary?"	1
Nicholas	1
asked.	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
blushed.	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
writing	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
or	1
approved	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
She	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
conceal	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
writing	1
from	1
him,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
had	1
surprised	1
her	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
	1
"A	1
diary,	1
Nicholas,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
handing	1
him	1
a	1
blue	1
exercise	1
book	1
filled	1
with	1
her	1
firm,	1
bold	1
writing.	1
	1
"A	1
diary?"	1
Nicholas	1
repeated	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
irony,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
book.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
December	1
4.	1
Today	1
when	1
Andrusha	1
(her	1
eldest	1
boy)	1
woke	1
up	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Louise	1
sent	1
for	1
me.	1
He	1
was	1
naughty	1
and	1
obstinate.	1
I	1
tried	1
threats,	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
grew	1
angrier.	1
Then	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
hand:	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
alone	1
and	1
began	1
with	1
nurse's	1
help	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
other	1
children	1
up,	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
him.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
silent,	1
as	1
if	1
astonished,	1
then	1
he	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
bed,	1
ran	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
shirt,	1
and	1
sobbed	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
calm	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
what	1
troubled	1
him	1
most	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
grieved	1
me.	1
Afterwards	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
ticket,	1
he	1
again	1
began	1
crying	1
piteously	1
and	1
kissing	1
me.	1
One	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
tenderness.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
a	1
'ticket'?"	1
Nicholas	1
inquired.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
begun	1
giving	1
the	1
elder	1
ones	1
marks	1
every	1
evening,	1
showing	1
how	1
they	1
have	1
behaved."	1
	1
Nicholas	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
that	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
turn	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
and	1
read.	1
In	1
the	1
diary	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
children's	1
lives	1
that	1
seemed	1
noteworthy	1
to	1
their	1
mother	1
as	1
showing	1
their	1
characters	1
or	1
suggesting	1
general	1
reflections	1
on	1
educational	1
methods.	1
They	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
quite	1
insignificant	1
trifles,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
mother	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
father	1
either,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
read	1
this	1
diary	1
about	1
his	1
children	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
	1
Under	1
the	1
date	1
"5"	1
was	1
entered:	1
	1
Mitya	1
was	1
naughty	1
at	1
table.	1
Papa	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
pudding.	1
He	1
had	1
none,	1
but	1
looked	1
so	1
unhappily	1
and	1
greedily	1
at	1
the	1
others	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
eating!	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
punishment	1
by	1
depriving	1
children	1
of	1
sweets	1
only	1
develops	1
their	1
greediness.	1
Must	1
tell	1
Nicholas	1
this.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
wife.	1
The	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
questioningly:	1
would	1
he	1
approve	1
or	1
disapprove	1
of	1
her	1
diary?	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
approval	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
his	1
admiration	1
for	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
so	1
pedantically,	1
thought	1
Nicholas,	1
or	1
even	1
done	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
this	1
untiring,	1
continual	1
spiritual	1
effort	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
sole	1
aim	1
was	1
the	1
children's	1
moral	1
welfare	1
delighted	1
him.	1
Had	1
Nicholas	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
analyze	1
his	1
feelings	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
steady,	1
tender,	1
and	1
proud	1
love	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
rested	1
on	1
his	1
feeling	1
of	1
wonder	1
at	1
her	1
spirituality	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
lofty	1
moral	1
world,	1
almost	1
beyond	1
his	1
reach,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
her	1
being.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
intelligence	1
and	1
goodness,	1
recognized	1
his	1
own	1
insignificance	1
beside	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
spiritual	1
world,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
that	1
she	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
soul	1
not	1
only	1
belonged	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
was	1
part	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
"I	1
quite,	1
quite	1
approve,	1
my	1
dearest!"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
look,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
he	1
added:	1
"And	1
I	1
behaved	1
badly	1
today.	1
You	1
weren't	1
in	1
the	1
study.	1
We	1
began	1
disputing--Pierre	1
and	1
I--and	1
I	1
lost	1
my	1
temper.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
impossible:	1
such	1
a	1
child!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
him	1
if	1
Natasha	1
didn't	1
keep	1
him	1
in	1
hand....	1
Have	1
you	1
any	1
idea	1
why	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Petersburg?	1
They	1
have	1
formed..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"Natasha	1
told	1
me."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
know,"	1
Nicholas	1
went	1
on,	1
growing	1
hot	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
recollection	1
of	1
their	1
discussion,	1
"he	1
wanted	1
to	1
convince	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
every	1
honest	1
man's	1
duty	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
oath	1
of	1
allegiance	1
and	1
duty...	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
you	1
weren't	1
there.	1
They	1
all	1
fell	1
on	1
me--Denisov	1
and	1
Natasha...	1
Natasha	1
is	1
absurd.	1
How	1
she	1
rules	1
over	1
him!	1
And	1
yet	1
there	1
need	1
only	1
be	1
a	1
discussion	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
words	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
but	1
only	1
repeats	1
his	1
sayings..."	1
added	1
Nicholas,	1
yielding	1
to	1
that	1
irresistible	1
inclination	1
which	1
tempts	1
us	1
to	1
judge	1
those	1
nearest	1
and	1
dearest	1
to	1
us.	1
He	1
forgot	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
about	1
Natasha	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
applied	1
word	1
for	1
word	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
noticed	1
that,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
duty	1
and	1
the	1
oath	1
were	1
above	1
everything,	1
he	1
started	1
proving	1
goodness	1
knows	1
what!	1
A	1
pity	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
there--what	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
said?"	1
	1
"As	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
you	1
were	1
quite	1
right,	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
Natasha	1
so.	1
Pierre	1
says	1
everybody	1
is	1
suffering,	1
tortured,	1
and	1
being	1
corrupted,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
our	1
duty	1
to	1
help	1
our	1
neighbor.	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
is	1
right	1
there,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary,	1
"but	1
he	1
forgets	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
other	1
duties	1
nearer	1
to	1
us,	1
duties	1
indicated	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
God	1
Himself,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
we	1
might	1
expose	1
ourselves	1
to	1
risks	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
risk	1
our	1
children."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
it!	1
That's	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
him,"	1
put	1
in	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
fancied	1
he	1
really	1
had	1
said	1
it.	1
"But	1
they	1
insisted	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
view:	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
neighbor	1
and	1
Christianity--and	1
all	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
young	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
my	1
study	1
and	1
broke	1
all	1
my	1
things."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Nicholas,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
often	1
troubled	1
about	1
little	1
Nicholas,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"He	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
exceptional	1
boy.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
neglect	1
him	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
my	1
own:	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
children	1
and	1
relations	1
while	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
one.	1
He	1
is	1
constantly	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
thoughts."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
need	1
reproach	1
yourself	1
on	1
his	1
account.	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
fondest	1
mother	1
could	1
do	1
for	1
her	1
son	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
and	1
are	1
doing	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
lad,	1
a	1
fine	1
lad!	1
This	1
evening	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
Pierre	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
trance,	1
and	1
fancy--as	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
in	1
to	1
supper	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
everything	1
on	1
my	1
table	1
to	1
bits,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
himself	1
at	1
once!	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
an	1
untruth.	1
A	1
fine	1
lad,	1
a	1
fine	1
lad!"	1
repeated	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
at	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
but	1
was	1
always	1
anxious	1
to	1
recognize	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
lad.	1
	1
"Still,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
mother,"	1
said	1
Countess	1
Mary.	1
"I	1
feel	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
it	1
troubles	1
me.	1
A	1
wonderful	1
boy,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
dreadfully	1
afraid	1
for	1
him.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
companions."	1
	1
"Well	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
for	1
long.	1
Next	1
summer	1
I'll	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
Petersburg,"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"Yes,	1
Pierre	1
always	1
was	1
a	1
dreamer	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
be,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
talk	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
which	1
had	1
evidently	1
disturbed	1
him.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
mine	1
what	1
goes	1
on	1
there--	1
whether	1
Arakcheev	1
is	1
bad,	1
and	1
all	1
that?	1
What	1
business	1
was	1
it	1
of	1
mine	1
when	1
I	1
married	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
deep	1
in	1
debt	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
threatened	1
with	1
prison,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
mother	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
or	1
understand	1
it?	1
And	1
then	1
there	1
are	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
our	1
affairs.	1
Is	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
pleasure	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
farm	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
from	1
morning	1
to	1
night?	1
No,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
must	1
work	1
to	1
comfort	1
my	1
mother,	1
to	1
repay	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
children	1
such	1
beggars	1
as	1
I	1
was."	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
alone	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
attached	1
too	1
much	1
importance	1
to	1
these	1
matters.	1
But	1
she	1
knew	1
she	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
useless	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
She	1
only	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it.	1
He	1
took	1
this	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
approval	1
and	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
reflection	1
continued	1
to	1
think	1
aloud.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Mary,	1
today	1
Elias	1
Mitrofanych"	1
(this	1
was	1
his	1
overseer)	1
"came	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
Tambov	1
estate	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
they	1
are	1
already	1
offering	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
for	1
the	1
forest."	1
	1
And	1
with	1
an	1
eager	1
face	1
Nicholas	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
repurchasing	1
Otradnoe	1
before	1
long,	1
and	1
added:	1
"Another	1
ten	1
years	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
leave	1
the	1
children...	1
in	1
an	1
excellent	1
position."	1
	1
Countess	1
Mary	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
her.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
aloud	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
he	1
would	1
sometimes	1
ask	1
her	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
saying,	1
and	1
be	1
vexed	1
if	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
something	1
else.	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
force	1
herself	1
to	1
attend,	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
her	1
at	1
all.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
think,	1
but	1
felt,	1
about	1
something	1
different.	1
She	1
felt	1
a	1
submissive	1
tender	1
love	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
would	1
never	1
understand	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
understood,	1
and	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
still	1
stronger	1
and	1
added	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
passionate	1
tenderness.	1
Besides	1
this	1
feeling	1
which	1
absorbed	1
her	1
altogether	1
and	1
hindered	1
her	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
plans,	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
flitted	1
through	1
her	1
mind.	1
She	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
nephew.	1
Her	1
husband's	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
boy's	1
agitation	1
while	1
Pierre	1
was	1
speaking	1
struck	1
her	1
forcibly,	1
and	1
various	1
traits	1
of	1
his	1
gentle,	1
sensitive	1
character	1
recurred	1
to	1
her	1
mind;	1
and	1
while	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
nephew	1
she	1
thought	1
also	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
children.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
compare	1
them	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
compared	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
felt	1
with	1
regret	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
lacking	1
in	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
young	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
Sometimes	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
this	1
difference	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
their	1
ages,	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
blame	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
promised	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
do	1
better	1
and	1
to	1
accomplish	1
the	1
impossible--in	1
this	1
life	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
husband,	1
her	1
children,	1
little	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
neighbors,	1
as	1
Christ	1
loved	1
mankind.	1
Countess	1
Mary's	1
soul	1
always	1
strove	1
toward	1
the	1
infinite,	1
the	1
eternal,	1
and	1
the	1
absolute,	1
and	1
could	1
therefore	1
never	1
be	1
at	1
peace.	1
A	1
stern	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
lofty,	1
secret	1
suffering	1
of	1
a	1
soul	1
burdened	1
by	1
the	1
body	1
appeared	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
Nicholas	1
gazed	1
at	1
her.	1
"O	1
God!	1
What	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
us	1
if	1
she	1
dies,	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
fear	1
when	1
her	1
face	1
is	1
like	1
that?"	1
thought	1
he,	1
and	1
placing	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
icon	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
his	1
evening	1
prayers.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
left	1
alone,	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
as	1
only	1
a	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
can	1
talk,	1
that	1
is,	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
clearness	1
and	1
rapidity,	1
understanding	1
and	1
expressing	1
each	1
other's	1
thoughts	1
in	1
ways	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
rules	1
of	1
logic,	1
without	1
premises,	1
deductions,	1
or	1
conclusions,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
quite	1
peculiar	1
way.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
talk	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
for	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
surest	1
sign	1
of	1
something	1
being	1
wrong	1
between	1
them	1
if	1
Pierre	1
followed	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
logical	1
reasoning.	1
When	1
he	1
began	1
proving	1
anything,	1
or	1
talking	1
argumentatively	1
and	1
calmly	1
and	1
she,	1
led	1
on	1
by	1
his	1
example,	1
began	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
a	1
quarrel.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
and	1
Natasha	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
wide-	1
open	1
happy	1
eyes,	1
and	1
quickly	1
seizing	1
his	1
head	1
pressed	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
bosom,	1
saying:	1
"Now	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
mine,	1
mine!	1
You	1
won't	1
escape!"--from	1
that	1
moment	1
this	1
conversation	1
began,	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
logic	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
them	1
because	1
quite	1
different	1
subjects	1
were	1
talked	1
about	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
This	1
simultaneous	1
discussion	1
of	1
many	1
topics	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
a	1
clear	1
understanding	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
the	1
surest	1
sign	1
that	1
they	1
fully	1
understood	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
when	1
all	1
is	1
uncertain,	1
unreasoning,	1
and	1
contradictory,	1
except	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
guides	1
the	1
dream,	1
so	1
in	1
this	1
intercourse	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
laws	1
of	1
reason,	1
the	1
words	1
themselves	1
were	1
not	1
consecutive	1
and	1
clear	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
prompted	1
them.	1
	1
Natasha	1
spoke	1
to	1
Pierre	1
about	1
her	1
brother's	1
life	1
and	1
doings,	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
and	1
lacked	1
life	1
during	1
his	1
own	1
absence,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
fonder	1
than	1
ever	1
of	1
Mary,	1
and	1
how	1
Mary	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
better	1
than	1
herself.	1
In	1
saying	1
this	1
Natasha	1
was	1
sincere	1
in	1
acknowledging	1
Mary's	1
superiority,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
by	1
saying	1
it	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
demand	1
on	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
should,	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
prefer	1
her	1
to	1
Mary	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
other	1
women,	1
and	1
that	1
now,	1
especially	1
after	1
having	1
seen	1
many	1
women	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
he	1
should	1
tell	1
her	1
so	1
afresh.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
answering	1
Natasha's	1
words,	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
intolerable	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
meet	1
ladies	1
at	1
dinners	1
and	1
balls	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
quite	1
lost	1
the	1
knack	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
ladies,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"It	1
was	1
simply	1
dull.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
busy."	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
on:	1
	1
"Mary	1
is	1
so	1
splendid,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"How	1
she	1
understands	1
children!	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
saw	1
straight	1
into	1
their	1
souls.	1
Yesterday,	1
for	1
instance,	1
Mitya	1
was	1
naughty..."	1
	1
"How	1
like	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
is,"	1
Pierre	1
interjected.	1
	1
Natasha	1
knew	1
why	1
he	1
mentioned	1
Mitya's	1
likeness	1
to	1
Nicholas:	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
his	1
dispute	1
with	1
his	1
brother-in-law	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
Natasha	1
thought	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"Nicholas	1
has	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
never	1
agreeing	1
with	1
anything	1
not	1
generally	1
accepted.	1
But	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
value	1
what	1
opens	1
up	1
a	1
fresh	1
line,"	1
said	1
she,	1
repeating	1
words	1
Pierre	1
had	1
once	1
uttered.	1
	1
"No,	1
the	1
chief	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
ideas	1
and	1
discussions	1
are	1
an	1
amusement--almost	1
a	1
pastime,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"For	1
instance,	1
he	1
is	1
collecting	1
a	1
library	1
and	1
has	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
not	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
new	1
book	1
till	1
he	1
has	1
read	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
bought--Sismondi	1
and	1
Rousseau	1
and	1
Montesquieu,"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"You	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
I..."	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
soften	1
down	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said;	1
but	1
Natasha	1
interrupted	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
unnecessary.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
say	1
ideas	1
are	1
an	1
amusement	1
to	1
him...."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
nothing	1
else	1
is	1
serious.	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
saw	1
everyone	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
When	1
I	1
am	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
thought,	1
all	1
else	1
is	1
mere	1
amusement."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
I'm	1
so	1
sorry	1
I	1
wasn't	1
there	1
when	1
you	1
met	1
the	1
children,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Which	1
was	1
most	1
delighted?	1
Lisa,	1
I'm	1
sure."	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
Pierre	1
replied,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
"Nicholas	1
says	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
think.	1
But	1
I	1
can't	1
help	1
it.	1
Besides,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
felt	1
(I	1
can	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
you)	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
pieces	1
without	1
me--everyone	1
was	1
pulling	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
But	1
I	1
succeeded	1
in	1
uniting	1
them	1
all;	1
and	1
then	1
my	1
idea	1
is	1
so	1
clear	1
and	1
simple.	1
You	1
see,	1
I	1
don't	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
oppose	1
this	1
and	1
that.	1
We	1
may	1
be	1
mistaken.	1
What	1
I	1
say	1
is:	1
'Join	1
hands,	1
you	1
who	1
love	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
but	1
one	1
banner--that	1
of	1
active	1
virtue.'	1
Prince	1
Sergey	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
and	1
clever."	1
	1
Natasha	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
idea,	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
disconcerted	1
her.	1
"Can	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
important	1
and	1
necessary	1
to	1
society	1
be	1
also	1
my	1
husband?	1
How	1
did	1
this	1
happen?"	1
She	1
wished	1
to	1
express	1
this	1
doubt	1
to	1
him.	1
"Now	1
who	1
could	1
decide	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
cleverer	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
others?"	1
she	1
asked	1
herself,	1
and	1
passed	1
in	1
review	1
all	1
those	1
whom	1
Pierre	1
most	1
respected.	1
Judging	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
respected	1
so	1
highly	1
as	1
Platon	1
Karataev.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
about?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"About	1
Platon	1
Karataev.	1
Would	1
he	1
have	1
approved	1
of	1
you	1
now,	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
question.	1
He	1
understood	1
his	1
wife's	1
line	1
of	1
thought.	1
	1
"Platon	1
Karataev?"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
and	1
pondered,	1
evidently	1
sincerely	1
trying	1
to	1
imagine	1
Karataev's	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
"He	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
understood...	1
yet	1
perhaps	1
he	1
would."	1
	1
"I	1
love	1
you	1
awfully!"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
said.	1
"Awfully,	1
awfully!"	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
approved,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
after	1
reflection.	1
"What	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
approved	1
of	1
is	1
our	1
family	1
life.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
find	1
seemliness,	1
happiness,	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
everything,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
proud	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
us.	1
There	1
now--you	1
talk	1
of	1
my	1
absence,	1
but	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
believe	1
what	1
a	1
special	1
feeling	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
you	1
after	1
a	1
separation...."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
should	1
think..."	1
Natasha	1
began.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
that.	1
I	1
never	1
leave	1
off	1
loving	1
you.	1
And	1
one	1
couldn't	1
love	1
more,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
something	1
special....	1
Yes,	1
of	1
course-"	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
because	1
their	1
eyes	1
meeting	1
said	1
the	1
rest.	1
	1
"What	1
nonsense	1
it	1
is,"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
"about	1
honeymoons,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
is	1
at	1
first!	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all.	1
If	1
only	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
away!	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
quarreled?	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
my	1
fault.	1
Always	1
mine.	1
And	1
what	1
we	1
quarreled	1
about--I	1
don't	1
even	1
remember!"	1
	1
"Always	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Jealo..."	1
	1
"Don't	1
say	1
it!	1
I	1
can't	1
bear	1
it!"	1
Natasha	1
cried,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
coldly	1
and	1
vindictively.	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
her?"	1
she	1
added,	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
	1
"No,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
have	1
recognized	1
her."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
do	1
you	1
know?	1
While	1
you	1
were	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
you,"	1
Natasha	1
began,	1
evidently	1
anxious	1
to	1
disperse	1
the	1
cloud	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
them.	1
"You	1
are	1
as	1
like	1
him	1
as	1
two	1
peas--like	1
the	1
boy."	1
(She	1
meant	1
her	1
little	1
son.)	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him....	1
The	1
milk's	1
come....	1
But	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
you."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
they	1
both	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
Pierre	1
began	1
with	1
self-	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
enthusiasm,	1
Natasha	1
with	1
a	1
quiet,	1
happy	1
smile.	1
Having	1
interrupted	1
one	1
another	1
they	1
both	1
stopped	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
continue.	1
	1
"No.	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
say?	1
Go	1
on,	1
go	1
on."	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
go	1
on,	1
I	1
was	1
talking	1
nonsense,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Pierre	1
finished	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
begun.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
sequel	1
to	1
his	1
complacent	1
reflections	1
on	1
his	1
success	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
chosen	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
new	1
direction	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Russian	1
society	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
ideas	1
that	1
have	1
great	1
results	1
are	1
always	1
simple	1
ones.	1
My	1
whole	1
idea	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
vicious	1
people	1
are	1
united	1
and	1
constitute	1
a	1
power,	1
then	1
honest	1
folk	1
must	1
do	1
the	1
same.	1
Now	1
that's	1
simple	1
enough."	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
were	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
say?"	1
	1
"I?	1
Only	1
nonsense."	1
	1
"But	1
all	1
the	1
same?"	1
	1
"Oh	1
nothing,	1
only	1
a	1
trifle,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
smilingly	1
still	1
more	1
brightly.	1
"I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
Petya:	1
today	1
nurse	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
laughed,	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
me.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
hiding.	1
Awfully	1
sweet!	1
There,	1
now	1
he's	1
crying.	1
Well,	1
good-by!"	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
downstairs	1
in	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski's	1
bedroom	1
a	1
little	1
lamp	1
was	1
burning	1
as	1
usual.	1
(The	1
boy	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
cure	1
him	1
of	1
it.)	1
Dessalles	1
slept	1
propped	1
up	1
on	1
four	1
pillows	1
and	1
his	1
Roman	1
nose	1
emitted	1
sounds	1
of	1
rhythmic	1
snoring.	1
Little	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
waked	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
perspiration,	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
and	1
gazed	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes.	1
He	1
had	1
awaked	1
from	1
a	1
terrible	1
dream.	1
He	1
had	1
dreamed	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Uncle	1
Pierre,	1
wearing	1
helmets	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
depicted	1
in	1
his	1
Plutarch,	1
were	1
leading	1
a	1
huge	1
army.	1
The	1
army	1
was	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
white	1
slanting	1
lines	1
that	1
filled	1
the	1
air	1
like	1
the	1
cobwebs	1
that	1
float	1
about	1
in	1
autumn	1
and	1
which	1
Dessalles	1
called	1
les	1
fils	1
de	1
la	1
Vierge.	1
In	1
front	1
was	1
Glory,	1
which	1
was	1
similar	1
to	1
those	1
threads	1
but	1
rather	1
thicker.	1
He	1
and	1
Pierre	1
were	1
borne	1
along	1
lightly	1
and	1
joyously,	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
their	1
goal.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
threads	1
that	1
moved	1
them	1
began	1
to	1
slacken	1
and	1
become	1
entangled	1
and	1
it	1
grew	1
difficult	1
to	1
move.	1
And	1
Uncle	1
Nicholas	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
stern	1
and	1
threatening	1
attitude.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
done	1
this?"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
some	1
broken	1
sealing	1
wax	1
and	1
pens.	1
"I	1
loved	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
orders	1
from	1
Arakcheev	1
and	1
will	1
kill	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
you	1
who	1
moves	1
forward."	1
Little	1
Nicholas	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Pierre	1
but	1
Pierre	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there.	1
In	1
his	1
place	1
was	1
his	1
father--	1
Prince	1
Andrew--and	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
neither	1
shape	1
nor	1
form,	1
but	1
he	1
existed,	1
and	1
when	1
little	1
Nicholas	1
perceived	1
him	1
he	1
grew	1
faint	1
with	1
love:	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
powerless,	1
limp,	1
and	1
formless.	1
His	1
father	1
caressed	1
and	1
pitied	1
him.	1
But	1
Uncle	1
Nicholas	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
them.	1
Terror	1
seized	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
he	1
awoke.	1
	1
"My	1
father!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
(Though	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
good	1
portraits	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
Nicholas	1
never	1
imagined	1
him	1
in	1
human	1
form.)	1
"My	1
father	1
has	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
caressed	1
me.	1
He	1
approved	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
Uncle	1
Pierre.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
may	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
Mucius	1
Scaevola	1
burned	1
his	1
hand.	1
Why	1
should	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
happen	1
to	1
me?	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
learn.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
learn.	1
But	1
someday	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
finished	1
learning,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
something.	1
I	1
only	1
pray	1
God	1
that	1
something	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
me	1
such	1
as	1
happened	1
to	1
Plutarch's	1
men,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
act	1
as	1
they	1
did.	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
better.	1
Everyone	1
shall	1
know	1
me,	1
love	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
delighted	1
with	1
me!"	1
And	1
suddenly	1
his	1
bosom	1
heaved	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
ill?"	1
he	1
heard	1
Dessalles'	1
voice	1
asking.	1
	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
lay	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
pillow.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
kind	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
him!"	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
Dessalles.	1
"But	1
Uncle	1
Pierre!	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
wonderful	1
man	1
he	1
is!	1
And	1
my	1
father?	1
Oh,	1
Father,	1
Father!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
which	1
even	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
satisfied...."	1
	1

EPILOGUE	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
History	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
nations	1
and	1
of	1
humanity.	1
To	1
seize	1
and	1
put	1
into	1
words,	1
to	1
describe	1
directly	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
humanity	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
nation,	1
appears	1
impossible.	1
	1
The	1
ancient	1
historians	1
all	1
employed	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
method	1
to	1
describe	1
and	1
seize	1
the	1
apparently	1
elusive--the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
people.	1
They	1
described	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
individuals	1
who	1
ruled	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
regarded	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
as	1
representing	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
nation.	1
	1
The	1
question:	1
how	1
did	1
individuals	1
make	1
nations	1
act	1
as	1
they	1
wished	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
these	1
individuals	1
themselves	1
guided?	1
the	1
ancients	1
met	1
by	1
recognizing	1
a	1
divinity	1
which	1
subjected	1
the	1
nations	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
chosen	1
man,	1
and	1
guided	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
that	1
chosen	1
man	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
accomplish	1
ends	1
that	1
were	1
predestined.	1
	1
For	1
the	1
ancients	1
these	1
questions	1
were	1
solved	1
by	1
a	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
participation	1
of	1
the	1
Deity	1
in	1
human	1
affairs.	1
	1
Modern	1
history,	1
in	1
theory,	1
rejects	1
both	1
these	1
principles.	1
	1
It	1
would	1
seem	1
that	1
having	1
rejected	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
in	1
man's	1
subjection	1
to	1
the	1
Deity	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
predetermined	1
aim	1
toward	1
which	1
nations	1
are	1
led,	1
modern	1
history	1
should	1
study	1
not	1
the	1
manifestations	1
of	1
power	1
but	1
the	1
causes	1
that	1
produce	1
it.	1
But	1
modern	1
history	1
has	1
not	1
done	1
this.	1
Having	1
in	1
theory	1
rejected	1
the	1
view	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
ancients,	1
it	1
still	1
follows	1
them	1
in	1
practice.	1
	1
Instead	1
of	1
men	1
endowed	1
with	1
divine	1
authority	1
and	1
directly	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
modern	1
history	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
either	1
heroes	1
endowed	1
with	1
extraordinary,	1
superhuman	1
capacities,	1
or	1
simply	1
men	1
of	1
very	1
various	1
kinds,	1
from	1
monarchs	1
to	1
journalists,	1
who	1
lead	1
the	1
masses.	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
divinely	1
appointed	1
aims	1
of	1
the	1
Jewish,	1
Greek,	1
or	1
Roman	1
nations,	1
which	1
ancient	1
historians	1
regarded	1
as	1
representing	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
humanity,	1
modern	1
history	1
has	1
postulated	1
its	1
own	1
aims--the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
German,	1
or	1
English	1
people,	1
or,	1
in	1
its	1
highest	1
abstraction,	1
the	1
welfare	1
and	1
civilization	1
of	1
humanity	1
in	1
general,	1
by	1
which	1
is	1
usually	1
meant	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
occupying	1
a	1
small	1
northwesterly	1
portion	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
continent.	1
	1
Modern	1
history	1
has	1
rejected	1
the	1
beliefs	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
without	1
replacing	1
them	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
conception,	1
and	1
the	1
logic	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
has	1
obliged	1
the	1
historians,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
apparently	1
rejected	1
the	1
divine	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
and	1
the	1
"fate"	1
of	1
the	1
ancients,	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
same	1
conclusion	1
by	1
another	1
road,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
recognize	1
(1)	1
nations	1
guided	1
by	1
individual	1
men,	1
and	1
(2)	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
known	1
aim	1
to	1
which	1
these	1
nations	1
and	1
humanity	1
at	1
large	1
are	1
tending.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
modern	1
historians	1
from	1
Gibbon	1
to	1
Buckle,	1
despite	1
their	1
seeming	1
disagreements	1
and	1
the	1
apparent	1
novelty	1
of	1
their	1
outlooks,	1
lie	1
those	1
two	1
old,	1
unavoidable	1
assumptions.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
the	1
historian	1
describes	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
individuals	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
have	1
directed	1
humanity	1
(one	1
historian	1
considers	1
only	1
monarchs,	1
generals,	1
and	1
ministers	1
as	1
being	1
such	1
men,	1
while	1
another	1
includes	1
also	1
orators,	1
learned	1
men,	1
reformers,	1
philosophers,	1
and	1
poets).	1
Secondly,	1
it	1
is	1
assumed	1
that	1
the	1
goal	1
toward	1
which	1
humanity	1
is	1
being	1
led	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
historians:	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
this	1
goal	1
is	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
Roman,	1
Spanish,	1
or	1
French	1
realm;	1
to	1
another	1
it	1
is	1
liberty,	1
equality,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
kind	1
of	1
civilization	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
called	1
Europe.	1
	1
In	1
1789	1
a	1
ferment	1
arises	1
in	1
Paris;	1
it	1
grows,	1
spreads,	1
and	1
is	1
expressed	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
peoples	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
Several	1
times	1
it	1
moves	1
eastward	1
and	1
collides	1
with	1
a	1
countermovement	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
westward.	1
In	1
1812	1
it	1
reaches	1
its	1
extreme	1
limit,	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
remarkable	1
symmetry,	1
a	1
countermovement	1
occurs	1
from	1
east	1
to	1
west,	1
attracting	1
to	1
it,	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
had	1
done,	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
middle	1
Europe.	1
The	1
counter	1
movement	1
reaches	1
the	1
starting	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
in	1
the	1
west--Paris--and	1
subsides.	1
	1
During	1
that	1
twenty-year	1
period	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
fields	1
were	1
left	1
untilled,	1
houses	1
were	1
burned,	1
trade	1
changed	1
its	1
direction,	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
migrated,	1
were	1
impoverished,	1
or	1
were	1
enriched,	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
Christian	1
men	1
professing	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
love	1
of	1
their	1
fellows	1
slew	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
What	1
does	1
all	1
this	1
mean?	1
Why	1
did	1
it	1
happen?	1
What	1
made	1
those	1
people	1
burn	1
houses	1
and	1
slay	1
their	1
fellow	1
men?	1
What	1
were	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
these	1
events?	1
What	1
force	1
made	1
men	1
act	1
so?	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
instinctive,	1
plain,	1
and	1
most	1
legitimate	1
questions	1
humanity	1
asks	1
itself	1
when	1
it	1
encounters	1
the	1
monuments	1
and	1
tradition	1
of	1
that	1
period.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
the	1
common	1
sense	1
of	1
mankind	1
turns	1
to	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
history,	1
whose	1
aim	1
is	1
to	1
enable	1
nations	1
and	1
humanity	1
to	1
know	1
themselves.	1
	1
If	1
history	1
had	1
retained	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
God,	1
to	1
reward	1
or	1
punish	1
his	1
people,	1
gave	1
Napoleon	1
power	1
and	1
directed	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
ends,	1
and	1
that	1
reply	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
clear	1
and	1
complete.	1
One	1
might	1
believe	1
or	1
disbelieve	1
in	1
the	1
divine	1
significance	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
but	1
for	1
anyone	1
believing	1
in	1
it	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
nothing	1
unintelligible	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
that	1
period,	1
nor	1
would	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
any	1
contradictions.	1
	1
But	1
modern	1
history	1
cannot	1
give	1
that	1
reply.	1
Science	1
does	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
direct	1
participation	1
of	1
the	1
Deity	1
in	1
human	1
affairs,	1
and	1
therefore	1
history	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
other	1
answers.	1
	1
Modern	1
history	1
replying	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
says:	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
this	1
movement	1
means,	1
what	1
caused	1
it,	1
and	1
what	1
force	1
produced	1
these	1
events?	1
Then	1
listen:	1
	1
"Louis	1
XIV	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
proud	1
and	1
self-confident	1
man;	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
mistresses	1
and	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
ministers	1
and	1
he	1
ruled	1
France	1
badly.	1
His	1
descendants	1
were	1
weak	1
men	1
and	1
they	1
too	1
ruled	1
France	1
badly.	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
favorites	1
and	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
mistresses.	1
Moreover,	1
certain	1
men	1
wrote	1
some	1
books	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen	1
men	1
in	1
Paris	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
all	1
men	1
being	1
free	1
and	1
equal.	1
This	1
caused	1
people	1
all	1
over	1
France	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
slash	1
at	1
and	1
drown	1
one	1
another.	1
They	1
killed	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
people.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
France	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
genius--Napoleon.	1
He	1
conquered	1
everybody	1
everywhere--that	1
is,	1
he	1
killed	1
many	1
people	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
genius.	1
And	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
kill	1
Africans,	1
and	1
killed	1
them	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
cunning	1
and	1
wise	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
France	1
he	1
ordered	1
everybody	1
to	1
obey	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
obeyed	1
him.	1
Having	1
become	1
an	1
Emperor	1
he	1
again	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
kill	1
people	1
in	1
Italy,	1
Austria,	1
and	1
Prussia.	1
And	1
there	1
too	1
he	1
killed	1
a	1
great	1
many.	1
In	1
Russia	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
Emperor,	1
Alexander,	1
who	1
decided	1
to	1
restore	1
order	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
therefore	1
fought	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
In	1
1807	1
he	1
suddenly	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
in	1
1811	1
they	1
again	1
quarreled	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
killing	1
many	1
people.	1
Napoleon	1
led	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
into	1
Russia	1
and	1
captured	1
Moscow;	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
ran	1
away	1
from	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,	1
helped	1
by	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
Stein	1
and	1
others,	1
united	1
Europe	1
to	1
arm	1
against	1
the	1
disturber	1
of	1
its	1
peace.	1
All	1
Napoleon's	1
allies	1
suddenly	1
became	1
his	1
enemies	1
and	1
their	1
forces	1
advanced	1
against	1
the	1
fresh	1
forces	1
he	1
raised.	1
The	1
Allies	1
defeated	1
Napoleon,	1
entered	1
Paris,	1
forced	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
abdicate,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Elba,	1
not	1
depriving	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
Emperor	1
and	1
showing	1
him	1
every	1
respect,	1
though	1
five	1
years	1
before	1
and	1
one	1
year	1
later	1
they	1
all	1
regarded	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
outlaw	1
and	1
a	1
brigand.	1
Then	1
Louis	1
XVIII,	1
who	1
till	1
then	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
laughingstock	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
the	1
Allies,	1
began	1
to	1
reign.	1
And	1
Napoleon,	1
shedding	1
tears	1
before	1
his	1
Old	1
Guards,	1
renounced	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
exile.	1
Then	1
the	1
skillful	1
statesmen	1
and	1
diplomatists	1
(especially	1
Talleyrand,	1
who	1
managed	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
chair	1
before	1
anyone	1
else	1
and	1
thereby	1
extended	1
the	1
frontiers	1
of	1
France)	1
talked	1
in	1
Vienna	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
conversations	1
made	1
the	1
nations	1
happy	1
or	1
unhappy.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
diplomatists	1
and	1
monarchs	1
nearly	1
quarreled	1
and	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
again	1
ordering	1
their	1
armies	1
to	1
kill	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
Napoleon	1
arrived	1
in	1
France	1
with	1
a	1
battalion,	1
and	1
the	1
French,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
hating	1
him,	1
immediately	1
all	1
submitted	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
the	1
Allied	1
monarchs	1
were	1
angry	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
French	1
once	1
more.	1
And	1
they	1
defeated	1
the	1
genius	1
Napoleon	1
and,	1
suddenly	1
recognizing	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brigand,	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
St.	1
Helena.	1
And	1
the	1
exile,	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
beloved	1
France	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
his	1
heart,	1
died	1
a	1
lingering	1
death	1
on	1
that	1
rock	1
and	1
bequeathed	1
his	1
great	1
deeds	1
to	1
posterity.	1
But	1
in	1
Europe	1
a	1
reaction	1
occurred	1
and	1
the	1
sovereigns	1
once	1
again	1
all	1
began	1
to	1
oppress	1
their	1
subjects."	1
	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
mistake	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
ironic--a	1
caricature	1
of	1
the	1
historical	1
accounts.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
mild	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
contradictory	1
replies,	1
not	1
meeting	1
the	1
questions,	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
historians	1
give,	1
from	1
the	1
compilers	1
of	1
memoirs	1
and	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
separate	1
states	1
to	1
the	1
writers	1
of	1
general	1
histories	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
histories	1
of	1
the	1
culture	1
of	1
that	1
period.	1
	1
The	1
strangeness	1
and	1
absurdity	1
of	1
these	1
replies	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
modern	1
history,	1
like	1
a	1
deaf	1
man,	1
answers	1
questions	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
asked.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
history	1
be	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
peoples,	1
the	1
first	1
question--in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
will	1
be	1
incomprehensible--is:	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
that	1
moves	1
peoples?	1
To	1
this,	1
modern	1
history	1
laboriously	1
replies	1
either	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
genius,	1
or	1
that	1
Louis	1
XIV	1
was	1
very	1
proud,	1
or	1
that	1
certain	1
writers	1
wrote	1
certain	1
books.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
mankind	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
was	1
asked.	1
All	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
interesting	1
if	1
we	1
recognized	1
a	1
divine	1
power	1
based	1
on	1
itself	1
and	1
always	1
consistently	1
directing	1
its	1
nations	1
through	1
Napoleons,	1
Louis-es,	1
and	1
writers;	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
such	1
a	1
power,	1
and	1
therefore	1
before	1
speaking	1
about	1
Napoleons,	1
Louis-es,	1
and	1
authors,	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
shown	1
the	1
connection	1
existing	1
between	1
these	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
If	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
divine	1
power	1
some	1
other	1
force	1
has	1
appeared,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
explained	1
in	1
what	1
this	1
new	1
force	1
consists,	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
history	1
lies	1
precisely	1
in	1
that	1
force.	1
	1
History	1
seems	1
to	1
assume	1
that	1
this	1
force	1
is	1
self-evident	1
and	1
known	1
to	1
everyone.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
every	1
desire	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
known,	1
anyone	1
reading	1
many	1
historical	1
works	1
cannot	1
help	1
doubting	1
whether	1
this	1
new	1
force,	1
so	1
variously	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
historians	1
themselves,	1
is	1
really	1
quite	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
everybody.	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
What	1
force	1
moves	1
the	1
nations?	1
	1
Biographical	1
historians	1
and	1
historians	1
of	1
separate	1
nations	1
understand	1
this	1
force	1
as	1
a	1
power	1
inherent	1
in	1
heroes	1
and	1
rulers.	1
In	1
their	1
narration	1
events	1
occur	1
solely	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
Napoleon,	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
or	1
in	1
general	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
they	1
describe.	1
The	1
answers	1
given	1
by	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
historian	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
what	1
force	1
causes	1
events	1
to	1
happen	1
are	1
satisfactory	1
only	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
historian	1
to	1
each	1
event.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
historians	1
of	1
different	1
nationalities	1
and	1
tendencies	1
begin	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
same	1
event,	1
the	1
replies	1
they	1
give	1
immediately	1
lose	1
all	1
meaning,	1
for	1
this	1
force	1
is	1
understood	1
by	1
them	1
all	1
not	1
only	1
differently	1
but	1
often	1
in	1
quite	1
contradictory	1
ways.	1
One	1
historian	1
says	1
that	1
an	1
event	1
was	1
produced	1
by	1
Napoleon's	1
power,	1
another	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
produced	1
by	1
Alexander's,	1
a	1
third	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
person.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
historians	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
contradict	1
each	1
other	1
even	1
in	1
their	1
statement	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
some	1
particular	1
person	1
was	1
based.	1
Thiers,	1
a	1
Bonapartist,	1
says	1
that	1
Napoleon's	1
power	1
was	1
based	1
on	1
his	1
virtue	1
and	1
genius.	1
Lanfrey,	1
a	1
Republican,	1
says	1
it	1
was	1
based	1
on	1
his	1
trickery	1
and	1
deception	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
So	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
this	1
class,	1
by	1
mutually	1
destroying	1
one	1
another's	1
positions,	1
destroy	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
which	1
produces	1
events,	1
and	1
furnish	1
no	1
reply	1
to	1
history's	1
essential	1
question.	1
	1
Writers	1
of	1
universal	1
history	1
who	1
deal	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
seem	1
to	1
recognize	1
how	1
erroneous	1
is	1
the	1
specialist	1
historians'	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
which	1
produces	1
events.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
recognize	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
power	1
inherent	1
in	1
heroes	1
and	1
rulers,	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
resultant	1
of	1
a	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
variously	1
directed	1
forces.	1
In	1
describing	1
a	1
war	1
or	1
the	1
subjugation	1
of	1
a	1
people,	1
a	1
general	1
historian	1
looks	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
interaction	1
of	1
many	1
persons	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
According	1
to	1
this	1
view	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
historical	1
personages,	1
represented	1
as	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
many	1
forces,	1
can	1
no	1
longer,	1
it	1
would	1
seem,	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
that	1
itself	1
produces	1
events.	1
Yet	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
universal	1
historians	1
still	1
employ	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
power	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
that	1
itself	1
produces	1
events,	1
and	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
their	1
cause.	1
In	1
their	1
exposition,	1
an	1
historic	1
character	1
is	1
first	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
his	1
time,	1
and	1
his	1
power	1
only	1
the	1
resultant	1
of	1
various	1
forces,	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
power	1
is	1
itself	1
a	1
force	1
producing	1
events.	1
Gervinus,	1
Schlosser,	1
and	1
others,	1
for	1
instance,	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
prove	1
Napoleon	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
product	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
of	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
1789	1
and	1
so	1
forth,	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
plainly	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
were	1
simply	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
misdirected	1
will,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
ideas	1
of	1
1789	1
were	1
arrested	1
in	1
their	1
development	1
by	1
Napoleon's	1
caprice.	1
The	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
temper	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
produced	1
Napoleon's	1
power.	1
But	1
Napoleon's	1
power	1
suppressed	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
temper	1
of	1
the	1
age.	1
	1
This	1
curious	1
contradiction	1
is	1
not	1
accidental.	1
Not	1
only	1
does	1
it	1
occur	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
but	1
the	1
universal	1
historians'	1
accounts	1
are	1
all	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
such	1
contradictions.	1
This	1
contradiction	1
occurs	1
because	1
after	1
entering	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
analysis	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
stop	1
halfway.	1
	1
To	1
find	1
component	1
forces	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
composite	1
or	1
resultant	1
force,	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
components	1
must	1
equal	1
the	1
resultant.	1
This	1
condition	1
is	1
never	1
observed	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
historians,	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
resultant	1
forces	1
they	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
admit,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
insufficient	1
components,	1
another	1
unexplained	1
force	1
affecting	1
the	1
resultant	1
action.	1
	1
Specialist	1
historians	1
describing	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1813	1
or	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
plainly	1
assert	1
that	1
these	1
events	1
were	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Alexander.	1
But	1
the	1
universal	1
historian	1
Gervinus,	1
refuting	1
this	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
specialist	1
historian,	1
tries	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1813	1
and	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
were	1
due	1
to	1
other	1
things	1
beside	1
Alexander's	1
will--such	1
as	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
Stein,	1
Metternich,	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
Talleyrand,	1
Fichte,	1
Chateaubriand,	1
and	1
others.	1
The	1
historian	1
evidently	1
decomposes	1
Alexander's	1
power	1
into	1
the	1
components:	1
Talleyrand,	1
Chateaubriand,	1
and	1
the	1
rest--but	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
components,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
interactions	1
of	1
Chateaubriand,	1
Talleyrand,	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
and	1
the	1
others,	1
evidently	1
does	1
not	1
equal	1
the	1
resultant,	1
namely	1
the	1
phenomenon	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
Frenchmen	1
submitting	1
to	1
the	1
Bourbons.	1
That	1
Chateaubriand,	1
Madame	1
de	1
Stael,	1
and	1
others	1
spoke	1
certain	1
words	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
only	1
affected	1
their	1
mutual	1
relations	1
but	1
does	1
not	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
submission	1
of	1
millions.	1
And	1
therefore	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
from	1
these	1
relations	1
of	1
theirs	1
the	1
submission	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
people	1
resulted--that	1
is,	1
how	1
component	1
forces	1
equal	1
to	1
one	1
A	1
gave	1
a	1
resultant	1
equal	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
A--the	1
historian	1
is	1
again	1
obliged	1
to	1
fall	1
back	1
on	1
power--the	1
force	1
he	1
had	1
denied--and	1
to	1
recognize	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
resultant	1
of	1
the	1
forces,	1
that	1
is,	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
admit	1
an	1
unexplained	1
force	1
acting	1
on	1
the	1
resultant.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
do,	1
and	1
consequently	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
contradict	1
the	1
specialist	1
historians	1
but	1
contradict	1
themselves.	1
	1
Peasants	1
having	1
no	1
clear	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
rain,	1
say,	1
according	1
to	1
whether	1
they	1
want	1
rain	1
or	1
fine	1
weather:	1
"The	1
wind	1
has	1
blown	1
the	1
clouds	1
away,"	1
or,	1
"The	1
wind	1
has	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
clouds."	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
sometimes,	1
when	1
it	1
pleases	1
them	1
and	1
fits	1
in	1
with	1
their	1
theory,	1
say	1
that	1
power	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
sometimes,	1
when	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
prove	1
something	1
else,	1
say	1
that	1
power	1
produces	1
events.	1
	1
A	1
third	1
class	1
of	1
historians--the	1
so-called	1
historians	1
of	1
culture--	1
following	1
the	1
path	1
laid	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
who	1
sometimes	1
accept	1
writers	1
and	1
ladies	1
as	1
forces	1
producing	1
events--again	1
take	1
that	1
force	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
quite	1
different.	1
They	1
see	1
it	1
in	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
culture--in	1
mental	1
activity.	1
	1
The	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
are	1
quite	1
consistent	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
their	1
progenitors,	1
the	1
writers	1
of	1
universal	1
histories,	1
for	1
if	1
historical	1
events	1
may	1
be	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
certain	1
persons	1
treated	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
ways,	1
why	1
not	1
explain	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
people	1
wrote	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
books?	1
Of	1
the	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
indications	1
accompanying	1
every	1
vital	1
phenomenon,	1
these	1
historians	1
select	1
the	1
indication	1
of	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
indication	1
is	1
the	1
cause.	1
But	1
despite	1
their	1
endeavors	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
events	1
lies	1
in	1
intellectual	1
activity,	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
stretch	1
can	1
one	1
admit	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
connection	1
between	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
and	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
peoples,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
can	1
one	1
admit	1
that	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
controls	1
people's	1
actions,	1
for	1
that	1
view	1
is	1
not	1
confirmed	1
by	1
such	1
facts	1
as	1
the	1
very	1
cruel	1
murders	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
equality	1
of	1
man,	1
or	1
the	1
very	1
cruel	1
wars	1
and	1
executions	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
love.	1
	1
But	1
even	1
admitting	1
as	1
correct	1
all	1
the	1
cunningly	1
devised	1
arguments	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
histories	1
are	1
filled--admitting	1
that	1
nations	1
are	1
governed	1
by	1
some	1
undefined	1
force	1
called	1
an	1
idea--history's	1
essential	1
question	1
still	1
remains	1
unanswered,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
power	1
of	1
monarchs	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
advisers	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
introduced	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
historians,	1
another,	1
newer	1
force--the	1
idea--is	1
added,	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
which	1
with	1
the	1
masses	1
needs	1
explanation.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
had	1
power	1
and	1
so	1
events	1
occurred;	1
with	1
some	1
effort	1
one	1
may	1
even	1
conceive	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
together	1
with	1
other	1
influences	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
an	1
event;	1
but	1
how	1
a	1
book,	1
Le	1
Contrat	1
Social,	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
making	1
Frenchmen	1
begin	1
to	1
drown	1
one	1
another	1
cannot	1
be	1
understood	1
without	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
causal	1
nexus	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
force	1
with	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
Undoubtedly	1
some	1
relation	1
exists	1
between	1
all	1
who	1
live	1
contemporaneously,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
their	1
historical	1
movements,	1
just	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
connection	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
between	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
humanity	1
and	1
commerce,	1
handicraft,	1
gardening,	1
or	1
anything	1
else	1
you	1
please.	1
But	1
why	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
is	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
or	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
historical	1
movement	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
understand.	1
Only	1
the	1
following	1
considerations	1
can	1
have	1
led	1
the	1
historians	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
conclusion:	1
(1)	1
that	1
history	1
is	1
written	1
by	1
learned	1
men,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
natural	1
and	1
agreeable	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
their	1
class	1
supplies	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
all	1
humanity,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
similar	1
belief	1
is	1
natural	1
and	1
agreeable	1
to	1
traders,	1
agriculturists,	1
and	1
soldiers	1
(if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
express	1
it,	1
that	1
is	1
merely	1
because	1
traders	1
and	1
soldiers	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
history),	1
and	1
(2)	1
that	1
spiritual	1
activity,	1
enlightenment,	1
civilization,	1
culture,	1
ideas,	1
are	1
all	1
indistinct,	1
indefinite	1
conceptions	1
under	1
whose	1
banner	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
use	1
words	1
having	1
a	1
still	1
less	1
definite	1
meaning,	1
and	1
which	1
can	1
therefore	1
be	1
readily	1
introduced	1
into	1
any	1
theory.	1
	1
But	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
intrinsic	1
quality	1
of	1
histories	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
(which	1
may	1
possibly	1
even	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
someone	1
for	1
something)	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
culture,	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
general	1
histories	1
tend	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
approximate,	1
are	1
significant	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
after	1
seriously	1
and	1
minutely	1
examining	1
various	1
religious,	1
philosophic,	1
and	1
political	1
doctrines	1
as	1
causes	1
of	1
events,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
describe	1
an	1
actual	1
historic	1
event	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812	1
for	1
instance,	1
they	1
involuntarily	1
describe	1
it	1
as	1
resulting	1
from	1
an	1
exercise	1
of	1
power--and	1
say	1
plainly	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
will.	1
Speaking	1
so,	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
involuntarily	1
contradict	1
themselves,	1
and	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
force	1
they	1
have	1
devised	1
does	1
not	1
account	1
for	1
what	1
happens	1
in	1
history,	1
and	1
that	1
history	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
explained	1
by	1
introducing	1
a	1
power	1
which	1
they	1
apparently	1
do	1
not	1
recognize.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
A	1
locomotive	1
is	1
moving.	1
Someone	1
asks:	1
"What	1
moves	1
it?"	1
A	1
peasant	1
says	1
the	1
devil	1
moves	1
it.	1
Another	1
man	1
says	1
the	1
locomotive	1
moves	1
because	1
its	1
wheels	1
go	1
round.	1
A	1
third	1
asserts	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
its	1
movement	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
smoke	1
which	1
the	1
wind	1
carries	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
peasant	1
is	1
irrefutable.	1
He	1
has	1
devised	1
a	1
complete	1
explanation.	1
To	1
refute	1
him	1
someone	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
devil,	1
or	1
another	1
peasant	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
devil	1
but	1
a	1
German,	1
who	1
moves	1
the	1
locomotive.	1
Only	1
then,	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
contradiction,	1
will	1
they	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
both	1
wrong.	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
refutes	1
himself,	1
for	1
having	1
once	1
begun	1
to	1
analyze	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
explain	1
further	1
why	1
the	1
wheels	1
go	1
round;	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
has	1
reached	1
the	1
ultimate	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
locomotive	1
in	1
the	1
pressure	1
of	1
steam	1
in	1
the	1
boiler,	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
stop	1
in	1
his	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
cause.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
explains	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
locomotive	1
by	1
the	1
smoke	1
that	1
is	1
carried	1
back	1
has	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
wheels	1
do	1
not	1
supply	1
an	1
explanation	1
and	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
first	1
sign	1
that	1
occurs	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
turn	1
has	1
offered	1
that	1
as	1
an	1
explanation.	1
	1
The	1
only	1
conception	1
that	1
can	1
explain	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
locomotive	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
force	1
commensurate	1
with	1
the	1
movement	1
observed.	1
	1
The	1
only	1
conception	1
that	1
can	1
explain	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
some	1
force	1
commensurate	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples.	1
	1
Yet	1
to	1
supply	1
this	1
conception	1
various	1
historians	1
take	1
forces	1
of	1
different	1
kinds,	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
incommensurate	1
with	1
the	1
movement	1
observed.	1
Some	1
see	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
directly	1
inherent	1
in	1
heroes,	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
sees	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
the	1
locomotive;	1
others	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
resulting	1
from	1
several	1
other	1
forces,	1
like	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
wheels;	1
others	1
again	1
as	1
an	1
intellectual	1
influence,	1
like	1
the	1
smoke	1
that	1
is	1
blown	1
away.	1
	1
So	1
long	1
as	1
histories	1
are	1
written	1
of	1
separate	1
individuals,	1
whether	1
Caesars,	1
Alexanders,	1
Luthers,	1
or	1
Voltaires,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
all,	1
absolutely	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
an	1
event,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity	1
without	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
force	1
compelling	1
men	1
to	1
direct	1
their	1
activity	1
toward	1
a	1
certain	1
end.	1
And	1
the	1
only	1
such	1
conception	1
known	1
to	1
historians	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
power.	1
	1
This	1
conception	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
handle	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
material	1
of	1
history,	1
as	1
at	1
present	1
expounded,	1
can	1
be	1
dealt	1
with,	1
and	1
anyone	1
who	1
breaks	1
that	1
handle	1
off,	1
as	1
Buckle	1
did,	1
without	1
finding	1
some	1
other	1
method	1
of	1
treating	1
historical	1
material,	1
merely	1
deprives	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
possible	1
way	1
of	1
dealing	1
with	1
it.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
power	1
as	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
historical	1
events	1
is	1
best	1
demonstrated	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
historians	1
and	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
themselves,	1
for	1
they	1
professedly	1
reject	1
that	1
conception	1
but	1
inevitably	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
every	1
step.	1
	1
In	1
dealing	1
with	1
humanity's	1
inquiry,	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
history	1
up	1
to	1
now	1
is	1
like	1
money	1
in	1
circulation--paper	1
money	1
and	1
coin.	1
The	1
biographies	1
and	1
special	1
national	1
histories	1
are	1
like	1
paper	1
money.	1
They	1
can	1
be	1
used	1
and	1
can	1
circulate	1
and	1
fulfill	1
their	1
purpose	1
without	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
even	1
advantageously,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
asks	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
security	1
behind	1
them.	1
You	1
need	1
only	1
forget	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
heroes	1
produces	1
events,	1
and	1
such	1
histories	1
as	1
Thiers'	1
will	1
be	1
interesting	1
and	1
instructive	1
and	1
may	1
perhaps	1
even	1
possess	1
a	1
tinge	1
of	1
poetry.	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
doubts	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
value	1
of	1
paper	1
money	1
arise	1
either	1
because,	1
being	1
easy	1
to	1
make,	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
gets	1
made	1
or	1
because	1
people	1
try	1
to	1
exchange	1
it	1
for	1
gold,	1
so	1
also	1
doubts	1
concerning	1
the	1
real	1
value	1
of	1
such	1
histories	1
arise	1
either	1
because	1
too	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
written	1
or	1
because	1
in	1
his	1
simplicity	1
of	1
heart	1
someone	1
inquires:	1
by	1
what	1
force	1
did	1
Napoleon	1
do	1
this?--that	1
is,	1
wants	1
to	1
exchange	1
the	1
current	1
paper	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
real	1
gold	1
of	1
actual	1
comprehension.	1
	1
The	1
writers	1
of	1
universal	1
histories	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
culture	1
are	1
like	1
people	1
who,	1
recognizing	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
paper	1
money,	1
decide	1
to	1
substitute	1
for	1
it	1
money	1
made	1
of	1
metal	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
specific	1
gravity	1
of	1
gold.	1
It	1
may	1
indeed	1
make	1
jingling	1
coin,	1
but	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that.	1
Paper	1
money	1
may	1
deceive	1
the	1
ignorant,	1
but	1
nobody	1
is	1
deceived	1
by	1
tokens	1
of	1
base	1
metal	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
value	1
but	1
merely	1
jingle.	1
As	1
gold	1
is	1
gold	1
only	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
serviceable	1
not	1
merely	1
for	1
exchange	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
use,	1
so	1
universal	1
historians	1
will	1
be	1
valuable	1
only	1
when	1
they	1
can	1
reply	1
to	1
history's	1
essential	1
question:	1
what	1
is	1
power?	1
The	1
universal	1
historians	1
give	1
contradictory	1
replies	1
to	1
that	1
question,	1
while	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
culture	1
evade	1
it	1
and	1
answer	1
something	1
quite	1
different.	1
And	1
as	1
counters	1
of	1
imitation	1
gold	1
can	1
be	1
used	1
only	1
among	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
agree	1
to	1
accept	1
them	1
as	1
gold,	1
or	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
gold,	1
so	1
universal	1
historians	1
and	1
historians	1
of	1
culture,	1
not	1
answering	1
humanity's	1
essential	1
question,	1
serve	1
as	1
currency	1
for	1
some	1
purposes	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
only	1
in	1
universities	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
readers	1
who	1
have	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
"serious	1
reading."	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Having	1
abandoned	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
divine	1
subjection	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
nation	1
to	1
some	1
chosen	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
subjection	1
of	1
that	1
man's	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
Deity,	1
history	1
cannot	1
without	1
contradictions	1
take	1
a	1
single	1
step	1
till	1
it	1
has	1
chosen	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
things:	1
either	1
a	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
intervention	1
of	1
the	1
Deity	1
in	1
human	1
affairs	1
or	1
a	1
definite	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
producing	1
historical	1
events	1
and	1
termed	1
"power."	1
	1
A	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
impossible,	1
the	1
belief	1
has	1
been	1
destroyed;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
explain	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
power.	1
	1
Napoleon	1
ordered	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
war.	1
We	1
are	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
that	1
idea	1
and	1
have	1
become	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
question:	1
why	1
did	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
go	1
to	1
fight	1
when	1
Napoleon	1
uttered	1
certain	1
words,	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
senseless.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
so	1
what	1
he	1
ordered	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
This	1
reply	1
is	1
quite	1
satisfactory	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
God.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
admit	1
that,	1
it	1
becomes	1
essential	1
to	1
determine	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
power	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
over	1
others.	1
	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
direct	1
physical	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
over	1
a	1
weak	1
one--	1
a	1
domination	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
application	1
or	1
threat	1
of	1
physical	1
force,	1
like	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Hercules;	1
nor	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
moral	1
force,	1
as	1
in	1
their	1
simplicity	1
some	1
historians	1
think	1
who	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
leading	1
figures	1
in	1
history	1
are	1
heroes,	1
that	1
is,	1
men	1
gifted	1
with	1
a	1
special	1
strength	1
of	1
soul	1
and	1
mind	1
called	1
genius.	1
This	1
power	1
cannot	1
be	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
predominance	1
of	1
moral	1
strength,	1
for,	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
heroes	1
such	1
as	1
Napoleon	1
about	1
whose	1
moral	1
qualities	1
opinions	1
differ	1
widely,	1
history	1
shows	1
us	1
that	1
neither	1
a	1
Louis	1
XI	1
nor	1
a	1
Metternich,	1
who	1
ruled	1
over	1
millions	1
of	1
people,	1
had	1
any	1
particular	1
moral	1
qualities,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
were	1
generally	1
morally	1
weaker	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
millions	1
they	1
ruled	1
over.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
power	1
lies	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
physical	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
moral	1
qualities	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
possesses	1
it,	1
it	1
must	1
evidently	1
be	1
looked	1
for	1
elsewhere--in	1
the	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
wields	1
the	1
power.	1
	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
power	1
is	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
jurisprudence,	1
that	1
exchange	1
bank	1
of	1
history	1
which	1
offers	1
to	1
exchange	1
history's	1
understanding	1
of	1
power	1
for	1
true	1
gold.	1
	1
Power	1
is	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
transferred,	1
by	1
expressed	1
or	1
tacit	1
consent,	1
to	1
their	1
chosen	1
rulers.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
domain	1
of	1
jurisprudence,	1
which	1
consists	1
of	1
discussions	1
of	1
how	1
a	1
state	1
and	1
power	1
might	1
be	1
arranged	1
were	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
arranged,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
clear;	1
but	1
when	1
applied	1
to	1
history	1
that	1
definition	1
of	1
power	1
needs	1
explanation.	1
	1
The	1
science	1
of	1
jurisprudence	1
regards	1
the	1
state	1
and	1
power	1
as	1
the	1
ancients	1
regarded	1
fire--namely,	1
as	1
something	1
existing	1
absolutely.	1
But	1
for	1
history,	1
the	1
state	1
and	1
power	1
are	1
merely	1
phenomena,	1
just	1
as	1
for	1
modern	1
physics	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
element	1
but	1
a	1
phenomenon.	1
	1
From	1
this	1
fundamental	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
view	1
held	1
by	1
history	1
and	1
that	1
held	1
by	1
jurisprudence,	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
jurisprudence	1
can	1
tell	1
minutely	1
how	1
in	1
its	1
opinion	1
power	1
should	1
be	1
constituted	1
and	1
what	1
power--	1
existing	1
immutably	1
outside	1
time--is,	1
but	1
to	1
history's	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
mutations	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
time	1
it	1
can	1
answer	1
nothing.	1
	1
If	1
power	1
be	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
transferred	1
to	1
their	1
ruler,	1
was	1
Pugachev	1
a	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people?	1
If	1
not,	1
then	1
why	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
I?	1
Why	1
was	1
Napoleon	1
III	1
a	1
criminal	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
at	1
Boulogne,	1
and	1
why,	1
later	1
on,	1
were	1
those	1
criminals	1
whom	1
he	1
arrested?	1
	1
Do	1
palace	1
revolutions--in	1
which	1
sometimes	1
only	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
people	1
take	1
part--transfer	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
ruler?	1
In	1
international	1
relations,	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
transferred	1
to	1
their	1
conqueror?	1
Was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine	1
transferred	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
1806?	1
Was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
transferred	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
1809,	1
when	1
our	1
army	1
in	1
alliance	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
went	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
Austrians?	1
	1
To	1
these	1
questions	1
three	1
answers	1
are	1
possible:	1
	1
Either	1
to	1
assume	1
(1)	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
always	1
unconditionally	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
ruler	1
or	1
rulers	1
they	1
have	1
chosen,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
every	1
emergence	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
power,	1
every	1
struggle	1
against	1
the	1
power	1
once	1
appointed,	1
should	1
be	1
absolutely	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
infringement	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
power;	1
or	1
(2)	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
rulers	1
conditionally,	1
under	1
definite	1
and	1
known	1
conditions,	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
all	1
limitations,	1
conflicts,	1
and	1
even	1
destructions	1
of	1
power	1
result	1
from	1
a	1
nonobservance	1
by	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
under	1
which	1
their	1
power	1
was	1
entrusted	1
to	1
them;	1
or	1
(3)	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
delegated	1
to	1
the	1
rulers	1
conditionally,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
conditions	1
are	1
unknown	1
and	1
indefinite,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
several	1
authorities,	1
their	1
struggles	1
and	1
their	1
falls,	1
result	1
solely	1
from	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
fulfillment	1
by	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
these	1
unknown	1
conditions	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
transferred	1
from	1
some	1
people	1
to	1
others.	1
	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
three	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
historians	1
do	1
explain	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
their	1
rulers.	1
	1
Some	1
historians--those	1
biographical	1
and	1
specialist	1
historians	1
already	1
referred	1
to--in	1
their	1
simplicity	1
failing	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
power,	1
seem	1
to	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
unconditionally	1
transferred	1
to	1
historical	1
persons,	1
and	1
therefore	1
when	1
describing	1
some	1
single	1
state	1
they	1
assume	1
that	1
particular	1
power	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
absolute	1
and	1
real	1
power,	1
and	1
that	1
any	1
other	1
force	1
opposing	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
power	1
but	1
a	1
violation	1
of	1
power--mere	1
violence.	1
	1
Their	1
theory,	1
suitable	1
for	1
primitive	1
and	1
peaceful	1
periods	1
of	1
history,	1
has	1
the	1
inconvenience--in	1
application	1
to	1
complex	1
and	1
stormy	1
periods	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
nations	1
during	1
which	1
various	1
powers	1
arise	1
simultaneously	1
and	1
struggle	1
with	1
one	1
another--that	1
a	1
Legitimist	1
historian	1
will	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
National	1
Convention,	1
the	1
Directory,	1
and	1
Bonaparte	1
were	1
mere	1
infringers	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
power,	1
while	1
a	1
Republican	1
and	1
a	1
Bonapartist	1
will	1
prove:	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
the	1
Convention	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
the	1
Empire	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
power,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
violations	1
of	1
power.	1
Evidently	1
the	1
explanations	1
furnished	1
by	1
these	1
historians	1
being	1
mutually	1
contradictory	1
can	1
only	1
satisfy	1
young	1
children.	1
	1
Recognizing	1
the	1
falsity	1
of	1
this	1
view	1
of	1
history,	1
another	1
set	1
of	1
historians	1
say	1
that	1
power	1
rests	1
on	1
a	1
conditional	1
delegation	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
their	1
rulers,	1
and	1
that	1
historical	1
leaders	1
have	1
power	1
only	1
conditionally	1
on	1
carrying	1
out	1
the	1
program	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
has	1
by	1
tacit	1
agreement	1
prescribed	1
to	1
them.	1
But	1
what	1
this	1
program	1
consists	1
in	1
these	1
historians	1
do	1
not	1
say,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
they	1
continually	1
contradict	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Each	1
historian,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
what	1
constitutes	1
a	1
nation's	1
progress,	1
looks	1
for	1
these	1
conditions	1
in	1
the	1
greatness,	1
wealth,	1
freedom,	1
or	1
enlightenment	1
of	1
citizens	1
of	1
France	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
country.	1
But	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
the	1
historians'	1
contradictions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
this	1
program-	1
-or	1
even	1
admitting	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
general	1
program	1
of	1
these	1
conditions	1
exists--the	1
facts	1
of	1
history	1
almost	1
always	1
contradict	1
that	1
theory.	1
If	1
the	1
conditions	1
under	1
which	1
power	1
is	1
entrusted	1
consist	1
in	1
the	1
wealth,	1
freedom,	1
and	1
enlightenment	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
Louis	1
XIV	1
and	1
Ivan	1
the	1
Terrible	1
end	1
their	1
reigns	1
tranquilly,	1
while	1
Louis	1
XVI	1
and	1
Charles	1
I	1
are	1
executed	1
by	1
their	1
people?	1
To	1
this	1
question	1
historians	1
reply	1
that	1
Louis	1
XIV's	1
activity,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
program,	1
reacted	1
on	1
Louis	1
XVI.	1
But	1
why	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
react	1
on	1
Louis	1
XIV	1
or	1
on	1
Louis	1
XV--why	1
should	1
it	1
react	1
just	1
on	1
Louis	1
XVI?	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
limit	1
for	1
such	1
reactions?	1
To	1
these	1
questions	1
there	1
are	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
answers.	1
Equally	1
little	1
does	1
this	1
view	1
explain	1
why	1
for	1
several	1
centuries	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
is	1
not	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
certain	1
rulers	1
and	1
their	1
heirs,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
during	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
fifty	1
years	1
is	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Convention,	1
to	1
the	1
Directory,	1
to	1
Napoleon,	1
to	1
Alexander,	1
to	1
Louis	1
XVIII,	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
again,	1
to	1
Charles	1
X,	1
to	1
Louis	1
Philippe,	1
to	1
a	1
Republican	1
government,	1
and	1
to	1
Napoleon	1
III.	1
When	1
explaining	1
these	1
rapid	1
transfers	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will	1
from	1
one	1
individual	1
to	1
another,	1
especially	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
international	1
relations,	1
conquests,	1
and	1
alliances,	1
the	1
historians	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
transfers	1
are	1
not	1
normal	1
delegations	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will	1
but	1
are	1
accidents	1
dependent	1
on	1
cunning,	1
on	1
mistakes,	1
on	1
craft,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
a	1
diplomatist,	1
a	1
ruler,	1
or	1
a	1
party	1
leader.	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
history--civil	1
wars,	1
revolutions,	1
and	1
conquests--are	1
presented	1
by	1
these	1
historians	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
free	1
transferences	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will,	1
but	1
as	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
ill-directed	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
more	1
individuals,	1
that	1
is,	1
once	1
again,	1
as	1
usurpations	1
of	1
power.	1
And	1
so	1
these	1
historians	1
also	1
see	1
and	1
admit	1
historical	1
events	1
which	1
are	1
exceptions	1
to	1
the	1
theory.	1
	1
These	1
historians	1
resemble	1
a	1
botanist	1
who,	1
having	1
noticed	1
that	1
some	1
plants	1
grow	1
from	1
seeds	1
producing	1
two	1
cotyledons,	1
should	1
insist	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
grows	1
does	1
so	1
by	1
sprouting	1
into	1
two	1
leaves,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
palm,	1
the	1
mushroom,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
oak,	1
which	1
blossom	1
into	1
full	1
growth	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
resemble	1
two	1
leaves,	1
are	1
deviations	1
from	1
the	1
theory.	1
	1
Historians	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
class	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
transferred	1
to	1
historic	1
personages	1
conditionally,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
conditions	1
are	1
unknown	1
to	1
us.	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
historical	1
personages	1
have	1
power	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
fulfill	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
delegated	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
But	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
if	1
the	1
force	1
that	1
moves	1
nations	1
lies	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
historic	1
leaders	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
nations	1
themselves,	1
what	1
significance	1
have	1
those	1
leaders?	1
	1
The	1
leaders,	1
these	1
historians	1
tell	1
us,	1
express	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
leaders	1
represents	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
But	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
the	1
question	1
arises	1
whether	1
all	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
leaders	1
serves	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will	1
or	1
only	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
leaders	1
serves	1
as	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will,	1
as	1
some	1
historians	1
suppose,	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
scandals	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
biographies	1
of	1
a	1
Napoleon	1
or	1
a	1
Catherine	1
serve	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
which	1
is	1
evident	1
nonsense;	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
some	1
particular	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
an	1
historical	1
leader	1
which	1
serves	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
people's	1
life,	1
as	1
other	1
so-called	1
"philosophical"	1
historians	1
believe,	1
then	1
to	1
determine	1
which	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
a	1
leader	1
expresses	1
the	1
nation's	1
life,	1
we	1
have	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
nation's	1
life	1
consists.	1
	1
Met	1
by	1
this	1
difficulty	1
historians	1
of	1
that	1
class	1
devise	1
some	1
most	1
obscure,	1
impalpable,	1
and	1
general	1
abstraction	1
which	1
can	1
cover	1
all	1
conceivable	1
occurrences,	1
and	1
declare	1
this	1
abstraction	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
humanity's	1
movement.	1
The	1
most	1
usual	1
generalizations	1
adopted	1
by	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
historians	1
are:	1
freedom,	1
equality,	1
enlightenment,	1
progress,	1
civilization,	1
and	1
culture.	1
Postulating	1
some	1
generalization	1
as	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
humanity,	1
the	1
historians	1
study	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
of	1
monuments	1
have	1
remained:	1
kings,	1
ministers,	1
generals,	1
authors,	1
reformers,	1
popes,	1
and	1
journalists,	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
to	1
which	1
in	1
their	1
opinion	1
these	1
persons	1
have	1
promoted	1
or	1
hindered	1
that	1
abstraction.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
humanity	1
does	1
consist	1
in	1
freedom,	1
equality,	1
enlightenment,	1
or	1
civilization,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
rulers	1
and	1
enlighteners	1
of	1
humanity	1
is	1
only	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
arbitrary	1
assumption	1
that	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
always	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
noticed,	1
it	1
happens	1
that	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
millions	1
who	1
migrate,	1
burn	1
houses,	1
abandon	1
agriculture,	1
and	1
destroy	1
one	1
another	1
never	1
is	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
some	1
dozen	1
people	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
burn	1
houses,	1
practice	1
agriculture,	1
or	1
slay	1
their	1
fellow	1
creatures.	1
	1
History	1
proves	1
this	1
at	1
every	1
turn.	1
Is	1
the	1
ferment	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century	1
and	1
their	1
drive	1
eastward	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
Louis	1
XIV,	1
XV,	1
and	1
XVI,	1
their	1
mistresses	1
and	1
ministers,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
Napoleon,	1
Rousseau,	1
Diderot,	1
Beaumarchais,	1
and	1
others?	1
	1
Is	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
eastward	1
to	1
Kazan	1
and	1
Siberia	1
expressed	1
by	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
morbid	1
character	1
of	1
Ivan	1
the	1
Terrible	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
correspondence	1
with	1
Kurbski?	1
	1
Is	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
Crusades	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
Godfreys	1
and	1
the	1
Louis-es	1
and	1
their	1
ladies?	1
For	1
us	1
that	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east,	1
without	1
leaders,	1
with	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
vagrants,	1
and	1
with	1
Peter	1
the	1
Hermit,	1
remains	1
incomprehensible.	1
And	1
yet	1
more	1
incomprehensible	1
is	1
the	1
cessation	1
of	1
that	1
movement	1
when	1
a	1
rational	1
and	1
sacred	1
aim	1
for	1
the	1
Crusade--the	1
deliverance	1
of	1
Jerusalem--had	1
been	1
clearly	1
defined	1
by	1
historic	1
leaders.	1
Popes,	1
kings,	1
and	1
knights	1
incited	1
the	1
peoples	1
to	1
free	1
the	1
Holy	1
Land;	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
go,	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
cause	1
which	1
had	1
previously	1
impelled	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
no	1
longer	1
existed.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
Godfreys	1
and	1
the	1
Minnesingers	1
can	1
evidently	1
not	1
cover	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
peoples.	1
And	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
Godfreys	1
and	1
the	1
Minnesingers	1
has	1
remained	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Godfreys	1
and	1
Minnesingers,	1
but	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
and	1
their	1
impulses	1
has	1
remained	1
unknown.	1
	1
Still	1
less	1
does	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
authors	1
and	1
reformers	1
explain	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
peoples.	1
	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
culture	1
explains	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
impulses	1
and	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
writer	1
or	1
a	1
reformer.	1
We	1
learn	1
that	1
Luther	1
had	1
a	1
hot	1
temper	1
and	1
said	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
things;	1
we	1
learn	1
that	1
Rousseau	1
was	1
suspicious	1
and	1
wrote	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
books;	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
learn	1
why	1
after	1
the	1
Reformation	1
the	1
peoples	1
massacred	1
one	1
another,	1
nor	1
why	1
during	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution	1
they	1
guillotined	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
If	1
we	1
unite	1
both	1
these	1
kinds	1
of	1
history,	1
as	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
newest	1
historians,	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
monarchs	1
and	1
writers,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
peoples.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
The	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
is	1
not	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
men,	1
for	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
those	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
found.	1
The	1
theory	1
that	1
this	1
connection	1
is	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
to	1
certain	1
historical	1
personages	1
is	1
an	1
hypothesis	1
unconfirmed	1
by	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
The	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
historic	1
persons	1
may	1
perhaps	1
explain	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
domain	1
of	1
jurisprudence	1
and	1
be	1
essential	1
for	1
its	1
purposes,	1
but	1
in	1
its	1
application	1
to	1
history,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
revolutions,	1
conquests,	1
or	1
civil	1
wars	1
occur--that	1
is,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
history	1
begins--that	1
theory	1
explains	1
nothing.	1
	1
The	1
theory	1
seems	1
irrefutable	1
just	1
because	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will	1
cannot	1
be	1
verified,	1
for	1
it	1
never	1
occurred.	1
	1
Whatever	1
happens	1
and	1
whoever	1
may	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
affairs,	1
the	1
theory	1
can	1
always	1
say	1
that	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
person	1
took	1
the	1
lead	1
because	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
was	1
transferred	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
replies	1
this	1
theory	1
gives	1
to	1
historical	1
questions	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
replies	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
watching	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
and	1
paying	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
varying	1
quality	1
of	1
the	1
pasturage	1
in	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
driving	1
of	1
the	1
herdsman,	1
should	1
attribute	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
herd	1
takes	1
to	1
what	1
animal	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
its	1
head.	1
	1
"The	1
herd	1
goes	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
because	1
the	1
animal	1
in	1
front	1
leads	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
animals	1
is	1
vested	1
in	1
that	1
leader."	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
historians	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
say--those	1
who	1
assume	1
the	1
unconditional	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
will.	1
	1
"If	1
the	1
animals	1
leading	1
the	1
herd	1
change,	1
this	1
happens	1
because	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
animals	1
is	1
transferred	1
from	1
one	1
leader	1
to	1
another,	1
according	1
to	1
whether	1
the	1
animal	1
is	1
or	1
is	1
not	1
leading	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
selected	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
herd."	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
reply	1
historians	1
who	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
delegated	1
to	1
rulers	1
under	1
conditions	1
which	1
they	1
regard	1
as	1
known.	1
(With	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
observation	1
it	1
often	1
happens	1
that	1
the	1
observer,	1
influenced	1
by	1
the	1
direction	1
he	1
himself	1
prefers,	1
regards	1
those	1
as	1
leaders	1
who,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
people's	1
change	1
of	1
direction,	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
front,	1
but	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
rear.)	1
	1
"If	1
the	1
animals	1
in	1
front	1
are	1
continually	1
changing	1
and	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
is	1
constantly	1
altered,	1
this	1
is	1
because	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
follow	1
a	1
given	1
direction	1
the	1
animals	1
transfer	1
their	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
animals	1
that	1
have	1
attracted	1
our	1
attention,	1
and	1
to	1
study	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
herd	1
we	1
must	1
watch	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
prominent	1
animals	1
moving	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
herd."	1
So	1
say	1
the	1
third	1
class	1
of	1
historians	1
who	1
regard	1
all	1
historical	1
persons,	1
from	1
monarchs	1
to	1
journalists,	1
as	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
their	1
age.	1
	1
The	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
transference	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
historic	1
persons	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
paraphrase--a	1
restatement	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
other	1
words.	1
	1
What	1
causes	1
historical	1
events?	1
Power.	1
What	1
is	1
power?	1
Power	1
is	1
the	1
collective	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
transferred	1
to	1
one	1
person.	1
Under	1
what	1
condition	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
delegated	1
to	1
one	1
person?	1
On	1
condition	1
that	1
that	1
person	1
expresses	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
people.	1
That	1
is,	1
power	1
is	1
power:	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
power	1
is	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
human	1
knowledge	1
were	1
confined	1
to	1
abstract	1
reasoning,	1
then	1
having	1
subjected	1
to	1
criticism	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
"power"	1
that	1
juridical	1
science	1
gives	1
us,	1
humanity	1
would	1
conclude	1
that	1
power	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
has	1
no	1
real	1
existence.	1
But	1
to	1
understand	1
phenomena	1
man	1
has,	1
besides	1
abstract	1
reasoning,	1
experience	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
verifies	1
his	1
reflections.	1
And	1
experience	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
power	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
word	1
but	1
an	1
actually	1
existing	1
phenomenon.	1
	1
Not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
no	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
collective	1
activity	1
of	1
men	1
can	1
do	1
without	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
power,	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
power	1
is	1
proved	1
both	1
by	1
history	1
and	1
by	1
observing	1
contemporary	1
events.	1
	1
Whenever	1
an	1
event	1
occurs	1
a	1
man	1
appears	1
or	1
men	1
appear,	1
by	1
whose	1
will	1
the	1
event	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
place.	1
Napoleon	1
III	1
issues	1
a	1
decree	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
go	1
to	1
Mexico.	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
and	1
Bismarck	1
issue	1
decrees	1
and	1
an	1
army	1
enters	1
Bohemia.	1
Napoleon	1
I	1
issues	1
a	1
decree	1
and	1
an	1
army	1
enters	1
Russia.	1
Alexander	1
I	1
gives	1
a	1
command	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
Bourbons.	1
Experience	1
shows	1
us	1
that	1
whatever	1
event	1
occurs	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
of	1
several	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
decreed	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
historians,	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
habit	1
of	1
acknowledging	1
divine	1
intervention	1
in	1
human	1
affairs,	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
someone	1
endowed	1
with	1
power,	1
but	1
that	1
supposition	1
is	1
not	1
confirmed	1
either	1
by	1
reason	1
or	1
by	1
experience.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
reflection	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
will--	1
his	1
words--are	1
only	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
activity	1
expressed	1
in	1
an	1
event,	1
as	1
for	1
instance	1
in	1
a	1
war	1
or	1
a	1
revolution,	1
and	1
so	1
without	1
assuming	1
an	1
incomprehensible,	1
supernatural	1
force--a	1
miracle--one	1
cannot	1
admit	1
that	1
words	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
immediate	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
men.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
admitted	1
that	1
words	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
events,	1
history	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
historical	1
personages	1
does	1
not	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
produce	1
any	1
effect,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
their	1
commands	1
are	1
often	1
not	1
executed,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
the	1
very	1
opposite	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
order	1
occurs.	1
	1
Without	1
admitting	1
divine	1
intervention	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
humanity	1
we	1
cannot	1
regard	1
"power"	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
events.	1
	1
Power,	1
from	1
the	1
standpoint	1
of	1
experience,	1
is	1
merely	1
the	1
relation	1
that	1
exists	1
between	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
someone's	1
will	1
and	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
that	1
will	1
by	1
others.	1
	1
To	1
explain	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
that	1
relationship	1
we	1
must	1
first	1
establish	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
will,	1
referring	1
it	1
to	1
man	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
Deity.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
Deity	1
issues	1
a	1
command,	1
expresses	1
His	1
will,	1
as	1
ancient	1
history	1
tells	1
us,	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
will	1
is	1
independent	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
caused	1
by	1
anything,	1
for	1
the	1
Divinity	1
is	1
not	1
controlled	1
by	1
an	1
event.	1
But	1
speaking	1
of	1
commands	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
men	1
acting	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
commands	1
with	1
events	1
we	1
must	1
restore:	1
(1)	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
takes	1
place:	1
the	1
continuity	1
of	1
movement	1
in	1
time	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
commands,	1
and	1
(2)	1
the	1
inevitability	1
of	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
person	1
commanding	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
execute	1
his	1
command.	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Only	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Deity,	1
not	1
dependent	1
on	1
time,	1
can	1
relate	1
to	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
events	1
occurring	1
over	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
years	1
or	1
centuries,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
Deity,	1
independent	1
of	1
everything,	1
can	1
by	1
His	1
sole	1
will	1
determine	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
humanity's	1
movement;	1
but	1
man	1
acts	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
himself	1
takes	1
part	1
in	1
what	1
occurs.	1
	1
Reinstating	1
the	1
first	1
condition	1
omitted,	1
that	1
of	1
time,	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
no	1
command	1
can	1
be	1
executed	1
without	1
some	1
preceding	1
order	1
having	1
been	1
given	1
rendering	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
command	1
possible.	1
	1
No	1
command	1
ever	1
appears	1
spontaneously,	1
or	1
itself	1
covers	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
occurrences;	1
but	1
each	1
command	1
follows	1
from	1
another,	1
and	1
never	1
refers	1
to	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
events	1
but	1
always	1
to	1
one	1
moment	1
only	1
of	1
an	1
event.	1
	1
When,	1
for	1
instance,	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
ordered	1
armies	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
war,	1
we	1
combine	1
in	1
one	1
simultaneous	1
expression	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
consecutive	1
commands	1
dependent	1
one	1
on	1
another.	1
Napoleon	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
commanded	1
an	1
invasion	1
of	1
Russia	1
and	1
never	1
did	1
so.	1
Today	1
he	1
ordered	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
papers	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
to	1
Vienna,	1
to	1
Berlin,	1
and	1
to	1
Petersburg;	1
tomorrow	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
decrees	1
and	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
the	1
fleet,	1
the	1
commissariat,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
and	1
so	1
on--millions	1
of	1
commands,	1
which	1
formed	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
corresponding	1
to	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
events	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
French	1
armies	1
into	1
Russia.	1
	1
If	1
throughout	1
his	1
reign	1
Napoleon	1
gave	1
commands	1
concerning	1
an	1
invasion	1
of	1
England	1
and	1
expended	1
on	1
no	1
other	1
undertaking	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
and	1
effort,	1
and	1
yet	1
during	1
his	1
whole	1
reign	1
never	1
once	1
attempted	1
to	1
execute	1
that	1
design	1
but	1
undertook	1
an	1
expedition	1
into	1
Russia,	1
with	1
which	1
country	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
desirable	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
alliance	1
(a	1
conviction	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
expressed)--this	1
came	1
about	1
because	1
his	1
commands	1
did	1
not	1
correspond	1
to	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
case,	1
but	1
did	1
so	1
correspond	1
in	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
For	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
certainly	1
executed,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
order	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
executed.	1
But	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
can	1
and	1
what	1
cannot	1
be	1
executed	1
is	1
impossible,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
invasion	1
of	1
Russia	1
in	1
which	1
millions	1
participated,	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
simplest	1
event,	1
for	1
in	1
either	1
case	1
millions	1
of	1
obstacles	1
may	1
arise	1
to	1
prevent	1
its	1
execution.	1
Every	1
order	1
executed	1
is	1
always	1
one	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
unexecuted.	1
All	1
the	1
impossible	1
orders	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
remain	1
unexecuted.	1
Only	1
the	1
possible	1
ones	1
get	1
linked	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
consecutive	1
series	1
of	1
commands	1
corresponding	1
to	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
are	1
executed.	1
	1
Our	1
false	1
conception	1
that	1
an	1
event	1
is	1
caused	1
by	1
a	1
command	1
which	1
precedes	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
event	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
others	1
those	1
few	1
commands	1
which	1
were	1
consistent	1
with	1
that	1
event	1
have	1
been	1
executed,	1
we	1
forget	1
about	1
the	1
others	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
executed	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be.	1
Apart	1
from	1
that,	1
the	1
chief	1
source	1
of	1
our	1
error	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
historical	1
accounts	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
innumerable,	1
diverse,	1
and	1
petty	1
events,	1
such	1
for	1
instance	1
as	1
all	1
those	1
which	1
led	1
the	1
French	1
armies	1
to	1
Russia,	1
is	1
generalized	1
into	1
one	1
event	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
produced	1
by	1
that	1
series	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
corresponding	1
with	1
this	1
generalization	1
the	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
commands	1
is	1
also	1
generalized	1
into	1
a	1
single	1
expression	1
of	1
will.	1
	1
We	1
say	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
wished	1
to	1
invade	1
Russia	1
and	1
invaded	1
it.	1
In	1
reality	1
in	1
all	1
Napoleon's	1
activity	1
we	1
never	1
find	1
anything	1
resembling	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
wish,	1
but	1
find	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
orders,	1
or	1
expressions	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
very	1
variously	1
and	1
indefinitely	1
directed.	1
Amid	1
a	1
long	1
series	1
of	1
unexecuted	1
orders	1
of	1
Napoleon's	1
one	1
series,	1
for	1
the	1
campaign	1
of	1
1812,	1
was	1
carried	1
out--not	1
because	1
those	1
orders	1
differed	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
unexecuted	1
orders	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
coincided	1
with	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
that	1
led	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
into	1
Russia;	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
stencil	1
work	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
figure	1
comes	1
out	1
not	1
because	1
the	1
color	1
was	1
laid	1
on	1
from	1
this	1
side	1
or	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
but	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
laid	1
on	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
over	1
the	1
figure	1
cut	1
in	1
the	1
stencil.	1
	1
So	1
that	1
examining	1
the	1
relation	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
commands	1
to	1
the	1
events,	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
a	1
command	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
event,	1
but	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
definite	1
dependence	1
exists	1
between	1
the	1
two.	1
	1
To	1
understand	1
in	1
what	1
this	1
dependence	1
consists	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
reinstate	1
another	1
omitted	1
condition	1
of	1
every	1
command	1
proceeding	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
Deity	1
but	1
from	1
a	1
man,	1
which	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
gives	1
the	1
command	1
himself	1
takes	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
event.	1
	1
This	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
to	1
those	1
he	1
commands	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
power.	1
This	1
relation	1
consists	1
in	1
the	1
following:	1
	1
For	1
common	1
action	1
people	1
always	1
unite	1
in	1
certain	1
combinations,	1
in	1
which	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
the	1
aims	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
action,	1
the	1
relation	1
between	1
those	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
Men	1
uniting	1
in	1
these	1
combinations	1
always	1
assume	1
such	1
relations	1
toward	1
one	1
another	1
that	1
the	1
larger	1
number	1
take	1
a	1
more	1
direct	1
share,	1
and	1
the	1
smaller	1
number	1
a	1
less	1
direct	1
share,	1
in	1
the	1
collective	1
action	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
combined.	1
	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
combinations	1
in	1
which	1
men	1
unite	1
for	1
collective	1
action	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
striking	1
and	1
definite	1
examples	1
is	1
an	1
army.	1
	1
Every	1
army	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
lower	1
grades	1
of	1
the	1
service--the	1
rank	1
and	1
file--of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
the	1
greatest	1
number;	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
higher	1
military	1
rank--corporals	1
and	1
noncommissioned	1
officers	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
fewer,	1
and	1
of	1
still-higher	1
officers	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
still	1
fewer,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
military	1
command	1
which	1
is	1
concentrated	1
in	1
one	1
person.	1
	1
A	1
military	1
organization	1
may	1
be	1
quite	1
correctly	1
compared	1
to	1
a	1
cone,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
base	1
with	1
the	1
largest	1
diameter	1
consists	1
of	1
the	1
rank	1
and	1
file;	1
the	1
next	1
higher	1
and	1
smaller	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
cone	1
consists	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
higher	1
grades	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
apex,	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
which	1
will	1
represent	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
most,	1
form	1
the	1
lower	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
cone	1
and	1
its	1
base.	1
The	1
soldier	1
himself	1
does	1
the	1
stabbing,	1
hacking,	1
burning,	1
and	1
pillaging,	1
and	1
always	1
receives	1
orders	1
for	1
these	1
actions	1
from	1
men	1
above	1
him;	1
he	1
himself	1
never	1
gives	1
an	1
order.	1
The	1
noncommissioned	1
officers	1
(of	1
whom	1
there	1
are	1
fewer)	1
perform	1
the	1
action	1
itself	1
less	1
frequently	1
than	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
but	1
they	1
already	1
give	1
commands.	1
An	1
officer	1
still	1
less	1
often	1
acts	1
directly	1
himself,	1
but	1
commands	1
still	1
more	1
frequently.	1
A	1
general	1
does	1
nothing	1
but	1
command	1
the	1
troops,	1
indicates	1
the	1
objective,	1
and	1
hardly	1
ever	1
uses	1
a	1
weapon	1
himself.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
never	1
takes	1
direct	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
itself,	1
but	1
only	1
gives	1
general	1
orders	1
concerning	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
troops.	1
A	1
similar	1
relation	1
of	1
people	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
every	1
combination	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
common	1
activity--in	1
agriculture,	1
trade,	1
and	1
every	1
administration.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
without	1
particularly	1
analyzing	1
all	1
the	1
contiguous	1
sections	1
of	1
a	1
cone	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
an	1
army,	1
or	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
positions	1
in	1
any	1
administrative	1
or	1
public	1
business	1
whatever	1
from	1
the	1
lowest	1
to	1
the	1
highest,	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
law	1
by	1
which	1
men,	1
to	1
take	1
associated	1
action,	1
combine	1
in	1
such	1
relations	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
directly	1
they	1
participate	1
in	1
performing	1
the	1
action	1
the	1
less	1
they	1
can	1
command	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
numerous	1
they	1
are,	1
while	1
the	1
less	1
their	1
direct	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
itself,	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
command	1
and	1
the	1
fewer	1
of	1
them	1
there	1
are;	1
rising	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
lowest	1
ranks	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
top,	1
who	1
takes	1
the	1
least	1
direct	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
directs	1
his	1
activity	1
chiefly	1
to	1
commanding.	1
	1
This	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
command	1
to	1
those	1
they	1
command	1
is	1
what	1
constitutes	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
conception	1
called	1
power.	1
	1
Having	1
restored	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
time	1
under	1
which	1
all	1
events	1
occur,	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
a	1
command	1
is	1
executed	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
related	1
to	1
a	1
corresponding	1
series	1
of	1
events.	1
Restoring	1
the	1
essential	1
condition	1
of	1
relation	1
between	1
those	1
who	1
command	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
execute,	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
those	1
who	1
command	1
take	1
the	1
smallest	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
itself	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
activity	1
is	1
exclusively	1
directed	1
to	1
commanding.	1

When	1
an	1
event	1
is	1
taking	1
place	1
people	1
express	1
their	1
opinions	1
and	1
wishes	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
event	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
collective	1
activity	1
of	1
many	1
people,	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
opinions	1
or	1
wishes	1
expressed	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
if	1
but	1
approximately.	1
When	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
opinions	1
expressed	1
is	1
fulfilled,	1
that	1
opinion	1
gets	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
event	1
as	1
a	1
command	1
preceding	1
it.	1
	1
Men	1
are	1
hauling	1
a	1
log.	1
Each	1
of	1
them	1
expresses	1
his	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
and	1
where	1
to	1
haul	1
it.	1
They	1
haul	1
the	1
log	1
away,	1
and	1
it	1
happens	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
done	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said.	1
He	1
ordered	1
it.	1
There	1
we	1
have	1
command	1
and	1
power	1
in	1
their	1
primary	1
form.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
worked	1
most	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing,	1
or	1
reflect	1
on	1
or	1
command	1
what	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
common	1
activity;	1
while	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
commanded	1
more	1
would	1
evidently	1
work	1
less	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
greater	1
verbal	1
activity.	1
	1
When	1
some	1
larger	1
concourse	1
of	1
men	1
direct	1
their	1
activity	1
to	1
a	1
common	1
aim	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
yet	1
sharper	1
division	1
of	1
those	1
who,	1
because	1
their	1
activity	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
directing	1
and	1
commanding,	1
take	1
less	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
work.	1
	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
works	1
alone	1
he	1
always	1
has	1
a	1
certain	1
set	1
of	1
reflections	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
him	1
directed	1
his	1
past	1
activity,	1
justify	1
his	1
present	1
activity,	1
and	1
guide	1
him	1
in	1
planning	1
his	1
future	1
actions.	1
Just	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
concourse	1
of	1
people,	1
allowing	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
direct	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
activity	1
to	1
devise	1
considerations,	1
justifications,	1
and	1
surmises	1
concerning	1
their	1
collective	1
activity.	1
	1
For	1
reasons	1
known	1
or	1
unknown	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
French	1
began	1
to	1
drown	1
and	1
kill	1
one	1
another.	1
And	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
its	1
justification	1
appears	1
in	1
people's	1
belief	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
France,	1
for	1
liberty,	1
and	1
for	1
equality.	1
People	1
ceased	1
to	1
kill	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
this	1
event	1
was	1
accompanied	1
by	1
its	1
justification	1
in	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
a	1
centralization	1
of	1
power,	1
resistance	1
to	1
Europe,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Men	1
went	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
killing	1
their	1
fellow	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
event	1
was	1
accompanied	1
by	1
phrases	1
about	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
France,	1
the	1
baseness	1
of	1
England,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
History	1
shows	1
us	1
that	1
these	1
justifications	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
have	1
no	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
are	1
all	1
contradictory,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
killing	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
recognizing	1
his	1
rights,	1
and	1
the	1
killing	1
of	1
millions	1
in	1
Russia	1
for	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
England.	1
But	1
these	1
justifications	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
necessary	1
significance	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
day.	1
	1
These	1
justifications	1
release	1
those	1
who	1
produce	1
the	1
events	1
from	1
moral	1
responsibility.	1
These	1
temporary	1
aims	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
broom	1
fixed	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
locomotive	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
snow	1
from	1
the	1
rails	1
in	1
front:	1
they	1
clear	1
men's	1
moral	1
responsibilities	1
from	1
their	1
path.	1
	1
Without	1
such	1
justification	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
simplest	1
question	1
that	1
presents	1
itself	1
when	1
examining	1
each	1
historical	1
event.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
commit	1
collective	1
crimes--make	1
war,	1
commit	1
murder,	1
and	1
so	1
on?	1
	1
With	1
the	1
present	1
complex	1
forms	1
of	1
political	1
and	1
social	1
life	1
in	1
Europe	1
can	1
any	1
event	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
prescribed,	1
decreed,	1
or	1
ordered	1
by	1
monarchs,	1
ministers,	1
parliaments,	1
or	1
newspapers	1
be	1
imagined?	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
collective	1
action	1
which	1
cannot	1
find	1
its	1
justification	1
in	1
political	1
unity,	1
in	1
patriotism,	1
in	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power,	1
or	1
in	1
civilization?	1
So	1
that	1
every	1
event	1
that	1
occurs	1
inevitably	1
coincides	1
with	1
some	1
expressed	1
wish	1
and,	1
receiving	1
a	1
justification,	1
presents	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
or	1
of	1
several	1
men.	1
	1
In	1
whatever	1
direction	1
a	1
ship	1
moves,	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
it	1
cuts	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
noticeable	1
ahead	1
of	1
it.	1
To	1
those	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
those	1
waves	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
perceptible	1
motion.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
watching	1
closely	1
moment	1
by	1
moment	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
that	1
flow	1
and	1
comparing	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
do	1
we	1
convince	1
ourselves	1
that	1
every	1
bit	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
forward	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
led	1
into	1
error	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
we	1
ourselves	1
were	1
imperceptibly	1
moving.	1
	1
We	1
see	1
the	1
same	1
if	1
we	1
watch	1
moment	1
by	1
moment	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
historical	1
characters	1
(that	1
is,	1
re-establish	1
the	1
inevitable	1
condition	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
occurs--the	1
continuity	1
of	1
movement	1
in	1
time)	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
essential	1
connection	1
of	1
historical	1
persons	1
with	1
the	1
masses.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
ship	1
moves	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
wave	1
ahead	1
of	1
it,	1
when	1
it	1
turns	1
frequently	1
the	1
wave	1
ahead	1
of	1
it	1
also	1
turns	1
frequently.	1
But	1
wherever	1
it	1
may	1
turn	1
there	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
wave	1
anticipating	1
its	1
movement.	1
	1
Whatever	1
happens	1
it	1
always	1
appears	1
that	1
just	1
that	1
event	1
was	1
foreseen	1
and	1
decreed.	1
Wherever	1
the	1
ship	1
may	1
go,	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
water	1
which	1
neither	1
directs	1
nor	1
increases	1
its	1
movement	1
foams	1
ahead	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
move	1
of	1
itself	1
but	1
to	1
govern	1
the	1
ship's	1
movement	1
also.	1
	1
Examining	1
only	1
those	1
expressions	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
historical	1
persons	1
which,	1
as	1
commands,	1
were	1
related	1
to	1
events,	1
historians	1
have	1
assumed	1
that	1
the	1
events	1
depended	1
on	1
those	1
commands.	1
But	1
examining	1
the	1
events	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
connection	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
historical	1
persons	1
stood	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
orders	1
were	1
dependent	1
on	1
events.	1
The	1
incontestable	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
deduction	1
is	1
that,	1
however	1
many	1
commands	1
were	1
issued,	1
the	1
event	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
unless	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
causes	1
for	1
it,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
an	1
event	1
occurs--be	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
may--	1
then	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
continually	1
expressed	1
wishes	1
of	1
different	1
people	1
some	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
found	1
which	1
by	1
their	1
meaning	1
and	1
their	1
time	1
of	1
utterance	1
are	1
related	1
as	1
commands	1
to	1
the	1
events.	1
	1
Arriving	1
at	1
this	1
conclusion	1
we	1
can	1
reply	1
directly	1
and	1
positively	1
to	1
these	1
two	1
essential	1
questions	1
of	1
history:	1
	1
(1)	1
What	1
is	1
power?	1
	1
(2)	1
What	1
force	1
produces	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
nations?	1
	1
(1)	1
Power	1
is	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
a	1
given	1
person	1
to	1
other	1
individuals,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
more	1
this	1
person	1
expresses	1
opinions,	1
predictions,	1
and	1
justifications	1
of	1
the	1
collective	1
action	1
that	1
is	1
performed,	1
the	1
less	1
is	1
his	1
participation	1
in	1
that	1
action.	1
	1
(2)	1
The	1
movement	1
of	1
nations	1
is	1
caused	1
not	1
by	1
power,	1
nor	1
by	1
intellectual	1
activity,	1
nor	1
even	1
by	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
as	1
historians	1
have	1
supposed,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
participate	1
in	1
the	1
events,	1
and	1
who	1
always	1
combine	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
those	1
taking	1
the	1
largest	1
direct	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
take	1
on	1
themselves	1
the	1
least	1
responsibility	1
and	1
vice	1
versa.	1
	1
Morally	1
the	1
wielder	1
of	1
power	1
appears	1
to	1
cause	1
the	1
event;	1
physically	1
it	1
is	1
those	1
who	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
power.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
moral	1
activity	1
is	1
inconceivable	1
without	1
the	1
physical,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
is	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
the	1
two.	1
	1
Or	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
cause	1
is	1
inapplicable	1
to	1
the	1
phenomena	1
we	1
are	1
examining.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
analysis	1
we	1
reach	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
infinity--that	1
final	1
limit	1
to	1
which	1
in	1
every	1
domain	1
of	1
thought	1
man's	1
reason	1
arrives	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
subject.	1
Electricity	1
produces	1
heat,	1
heat	1
produces	1
electricity.	1
Atoms	1
attract	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
atoms	1
repel	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Speaking	1
of	1
the	1
interaction	1
of	1
heat	1
and	1
electricity	1
and	1
of	1
atoms,	1
we	1
cannot	1
say	1
why	1
this	1
occurs,	1
and	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
inconceivable	1
otherwise,	1
because	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
law.	1
The	1
same	1
applies	1
to	1
historical	1
events.	1
Why	1
war	1
and	1
revolution	1
occur	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
We	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
action,	1
people	1
combine	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
formation	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
all	1
take	1
part,	1
and	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
so	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
unthinkable	1
otherwise,	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
law.	1

CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
If	1
history	1
dealt	1
only	1
with	1
external	1
phenomena,	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
this	1
simple	1
and	1
obvious	1
law	1
would	1
suffice	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
finished	1
our	1
argument.	1
But	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
history	1
relates	1
to	1
man.	1
A	1
particle	1
of	1
matter	1
cannot	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
attraction	1
or	1
repulsion	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
law	1
is	1
untrue,	1
but	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
history,	1
says	1
plainly:	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
and	1
am	1
therefore	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will,	1
though	1
unexpressed,	1
is	1
felt	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
All	1
seriously	1
thinking	1
historians	1
have	1
involuntarily	1
encountered	1
this	1
question.	1
All	1
the	1
contradictions	1
and	1
obscurities	1
of	1
history	1
and	1
the	1
false	1
path	1
historical	1
science	1
has	1
followed	1
are	1
due	1
solely	1
to	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
that	1
question.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
were	1
free,	1
that	1
is,	1
if	1
each	1
man	1
could	1
act	1
as	1
he	1
pleased,	1
all	1
history	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
disconnected	1
incidents.	1
	1
If	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
even	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
million	1
could	1
act	1
freely,	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
he	1
chose,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
one	1
single	1
free	1
act	1
of	1
that	1
man's	1
in	1
violation	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
governing	1
human	1
action	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
any	1
laws	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
humanity.	1
	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
single	1
law	1
governing	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
men,	1
free	1
will	1
cannot	1
exist,	1
for	1
then	1
man's	1
will	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
that	1
law.	1
	1
In	1
this	1
contradiction	1
lies	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
free	1
will,	1
which	1
from	1
most	1
ancient	1
times	1
has	1
occupied	1
the	1
best	1
human	1
minds	1
and	1
from	1
most	1
ancient	1
times	1
has	1
been	1
presented	1
in	1
its	1
whole	1
tremendous	1
significance.	1
	1
The	1
problem	1
is	1
that	1
regarding	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
observation	1
from	1
whatever	1
point	1
of	1
view--theological,	1
historical,	1
ethical,	1
or	1
philosophic--we	1
find	1
a	1
general	1
law	1
of	1
necessity	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
(like	1
all	1
that	1
exists)	1
is	1
subject.	1
But	1
regarding	1
him	1
from	1
within	1
ourselves	1
as	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
conscious	1
of,	1
we	1
feel	1
ourselves	1
to	1
be	1
free.	1
	1
This	1
consciousness	1
is	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
self-cognition	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
and	1
independent	1
of	1
reason.	1
Through	1
his	1
reason	1
man	1
observes	1
himself,	1
but	1
only	1
through	1
consciousness	1
does	1
he	1
know	1
himself.	1
	1
Apart	1
from	1
consciousness	1
of	1
self	1
no	1
observation	1
or	1
application	1
of	1
reason	1
is	1
conceivable.	1
	1
To	1
understand,	1
observe,	1
and	1
draw	1
conclusions,	1
man	1
must	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
living.	1
A	1
man	1
is	1
only	1
conscious	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
living	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
wills,	1
that	1
is,	1
is	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
volition.	1
But	1
his	1
will--which	1
forms	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
his	1
life--man	1
recognizes	1
(and	1
can	1
but	1
recognize)	1
as	1
free.	1
	1
If,	1
observing	1
himself,	1
man	1
sees	1
that	1
his	1
will	1
is	1
always	1
directed	1
by	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
law	1
(whether	1
he	1
observes	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
taking	1
food,	1
using	1
his	1
brain,	1
or	1
anything	1
else)	1
he	1
cannot	1
recognize	1
this	1
never-	1
varying	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
otherwise	1
than	1
as	1
a	1
limitation	1
of	1
it.	1
Were	1
it	1
not	1
free	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
limited.	1
A	1
man's	1
will	1
seems	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
limited	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
except	1
as	1
free.	1
	1
You	1
say:	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
free.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
lifted	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
fall.	1
Everyone	1
understands	1
that	1
this	1
illogical	1
reply	1
is	1
an	1
irrefutable	1
demonstration	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
That	1
reply	1
is	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
reason.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
separate	1
and	1
independent	1
source	1
of	1
self-consciousness	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
reasoning	1
and	1
to	1
experience,	1
but	1
in	1
fact	1
such	1
subjection	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
and	1
is	1
inconceivable.	1
	1
A	1
series	1
of	1
experiments	1
and	1
arguments	1
proves	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
he,	1
as	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
observation,	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
certain	1
laws,	1
and	1
man	1
submits	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
never	1
resists	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
gravity	1
or	1
impermeability	1
once	1
he	1
has	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
series	1
of	1
experiments	1
and	1
arguments	1
proves	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
complete	1
freedom	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
conscious	1
in	1
himself	1
is	1
impossible,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
every	1
action	1
depends	1
on	1
his	1
organization,	1
his	1
character,	1
and	1
the	1
motives	1
acting	1
upon	1
him;	1
yet	1
man	1
never	1
submits	1
to	1
the	1
deductions	1
of	1
these	1
experiments	1
and	1
arguments.	1
Having	1
learned	1
from	1
experiment	1
and	1
argument	1
that	1
a	1
stone	1
falls	1
downwards,	1
a	1
man	1
indubitably	1
believes	1
this	1
and	1
always	1
expects	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
learned	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
But	1
learning	1
just	1
as	1
certainly	1
that	1
his	1
will	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
laws,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
believe	1
this.	1
	1
However	1
often	1
experiment	1
and	1
reasoning	1
may	1
show	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
conditions	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
character	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
before,	1
yet	1
when	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
conditions	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
character	1
he	1
approaches	1
for	1
the	1
thousandth	1
time	1
the	1
action	1
that	1
always	1
ends	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
he	1
feels	1
as	1
certainly	1
convinced	1
as	1
before	1
the	1
experiment	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
act	1
as	1
he	1
pleases.	1
Every	1
man,	1
savage	1
or	1
sage,	1
however	1
incontestably	1
reason	1
and	1
experiment	1
may	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
two	1
different	1
courses	1
of	1
action	1
in	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
conditions,	1
feels	1
that	1
without	1
this	1
irrational	1
conception	1
(which	1
constitutes	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
freedom)	1
he	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
life.	1
He	1
feels	1
that	1
however	1
impossible	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
it	1
is	1
so,	1
for	1
without	1
this	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
not	1
only	1
would	1
he	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
life,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
moment.	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
live,	1
because	1
all	1
man's	1
efforts,	1
all	1
his	1
impulses	1
to	1
life,	1
are	1
only	1
efforts	1
to	1
increase	1
freedom.	1
Wealth	1
and	1
poverty,	1
fame	1
and	1
obscurity,	1
power	1
and	1
subordination,	1
strength	1
and	1
weakness,	1
health	1
and	1
disease,	1
culture	1
and	1
ignorance,	1
work	1
and	1
leisure,	1
repletion	1
and	1
hunger,	1
virtue	1
and	1
vice,	1
are	1
only	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
degrees	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
A	1
man	1
having	1
no	1
freedom	1
cannot	1
be	1
conceived	1
of	1
except	1
as	1
deprived	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
If	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
appears	1
to	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
senseless	1
contradiction	1
like	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
performing	1
two	1
actions	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
of	1
time,	1
or	1
of	1
an	1
effect	1
without	1
a	1
cause,	1
that	1
only	1
proves	1
that	1
consciousness	1
is	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
reason.	1
	1
This	1
unshakable,	1
irrefutable	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom,	1
uncontrolled	1
by	1
experiment	1
or	1
argument,	1
recognized	1
by	1
all	1
thinkers	1
and	1
felt	1
by	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception,	1
this	1
consciousness	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
possible	1
constitutes	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
	1
Man	1
is	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
an	1
all-powerful,	1
all-good,	1
and	1
all-seeing	1
God.	1
What	1
is	1
sin,	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
which	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
man's	1
freedom?	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
theology.	1
	1
The	1
actions	1
of	1
men	1
are	1
subject	1
to	1
general	1
immutable	1
laws	1
expressed	1
in	1
statistics.	1
What	1
is	1
man's	1
responsibility	1
to	1
society,	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
which	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom?	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
jurisprudence.	1
	1
Man's	1
actions	1
proceed	1
from	1
his	1
innate	1
character	1
and	1
the	1
motives	1
acting	1
upon	1
him.	1
What	1
is	1
conscience	1
and	1
the	1
perception	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
in	1
actions	1
that	1
follows	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom?	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
ethics.	1
	1
Man	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
life	1
of	1
humanity	1
appears	1
subject	1
to	1
laws	1
which	1
determine	1
that	1
life.	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
apart	1
from	1
that	1
connection	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
free.	1
How	1
should	1
the	1
past	1
life	1
of	1
nations	1
and	1
of	1
humanity	1
be	1
regarded--as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
free,	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
constrained,	1
activity	1
of	1
man?	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
history.	1
	1
Only	1
in	1
our	1
self-confident	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
popularization	1
of	1
knowledge--	1
thanks	1
to	1
that	1
most	1
powerful	1
engine	1
of	1
ignorance,	1
the	1
diffusion	1
of	1
printed	1
matter--has	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
will	1
been	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
question	1
itself	1
cannot	1
exist.	1
In	1
our	1
time	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
so-called	1
advanced	1
people--that	1
is,	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
ignoramuses--have	1
taken	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
naturalists	1
who	1
deal	1
with	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
problem.	1
	1
They	1
say	1
and	1
write	1
and	1
print	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
freedom	1
do	1
not	1
exist,	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
expressed	1
by	1
muscular	1
movements	1
and	1
muscular	1
movements	1
are	1
conditioned	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
nerves;	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
free	1
will	1
do	1
not	1
exist	1
because	1
at	1
an	1
unknown	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
we	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
apes.	1
They	1
say	1
this,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
suspecting	1
that	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
ago	1
that	1
same	1
law	1
of	1
necessity	1
which	1
with	1
such	1
ardor	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
trying	1
to	1
prove	1
by	1
physiology	1
and	1
comparative	1
zoology	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
acknowledged	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
religions	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
thinkers,	1
but	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
denied.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
is	1
merely	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
an	1
instrument	1
for	1
the	1
illumination	1
of	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
it.	1
For	1
the	1
fact	1
that,	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
observation,	1
reason	1
and	1
the	1
will	1
are	1
merely	1
secretions	1
of	1
the	1
brain,	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
following	1
the	1
general	1
law	1
may	1
have	1
developed	1
from	1
lower	1
animals	1
at	1
some	1
unknown	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
only	1
explains	1
from	1
a	1
fresh	1
side	1
the	1
truth	1
admitted	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
ago	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
religious	1
and	1
philosophic	1
theories--that	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
reason	1
man	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
necessity;	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
advance	1
by	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
which	1
has	1
another,	1
opposite,	1
side,	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
If	1
men	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
apes	1
at	1
an	1
unknown	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
that	1
is	1
as	1
comprehensible	1
as	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
from	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
earth	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
(in	1
the	1
first	1
case	1
the	1
unknown	1
quantity	1
is	1
the	1
time,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
origin);	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
man's	1
consciousness	1
of	1
freedom	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
reconciled	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
necessity	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
subject	1
cannot	1
be	1
solved	1
by	1
comparative	1
physiology	1
and	1
zoology,	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
frog,	1
a	1
rabbit,	1
or	1
an	1
ape,	1
we	1
can	1
observe	1
only	1
the	1
muscular	1
nervous	1
activity,	1
but	1
in	1
man	1
we	1
observe	1
consciousness	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
muscular	1
and	1
nervous	1
activity.	1
	1
The	1
naturalists	1
and	1
their	1
followers,	1
thinking	1
they	1
can	1
solve	1
this	1
question,	1
are	1
like	1
plasterers	1
set	1
to	1
plaster	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
a	1
church	1
who,	1
availing	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
superintendent	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
should	1
in	1
an	1
access	1
of	1
zeal	1
plaster	1
over	1
the	1
windows,	1
icons,	1
woodwork,	1
and	1
still	1
unbuttressed	1
walls,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
delighted	1
that	1
from	1
their	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
as	1
plasterers,	1
everything	1
is	1
now	1
so	1
smooth	1
and	1
regular.	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
For	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
or	1
inevitability,	1
history	1
has	1
this	1
advantage	1
over	1
other	1
branches	1
of	1
knowledge	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
dealt	1
with,	1
that	1
for	1
history	1
this	1
question	1
does	1
not	1
refer	1
to	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
but	1
its	1
manifestation	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
under	1
certain	1
conditions.	1
	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
question,	1
history	1
stands	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
sciences	1
as	1
experimental	1
science	1
stands	1
to	1
abstract	1
science.	1
	1
The	1
subject	1
for	1
history	1
is	1
not	1
man's	1
will	1
itself	1
but	1
our	1
presentation	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
for	1
history,	1
the	1
insoluble	1
mystery	1
presented	1
by	1
the	1
incompatibility	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
inevitability	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
as	1
it	1
does	1
for	1
theology,	1
ethics,	1
and	1
philosophy.	1
History	1
surveys	1
a	1
presentation	1
of	1
man's	1
life	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
contradictions	1
has	1
already	1
taken	1
place.	1
	1
In	1
actual	1
life	1
each	1
historic	1
event,	1
each	1
human	1
action,	1
is	1
very	1
clearly	1
and	1
definitely	1
understood	1
without	1
any	1
sense	1
of	1
contradiction,	1
although	1
each	1
event	1
presents	1
itself	1
as	1
partly	1
free	1
and	1
partly	1
compulsory.	1
	1
To	1
solve	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
freedom	1
and	1
necessity	1
are	1
combined	1
and	1
what	1
constitutes	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
conceptions,	1
the	1
philosophy	1
of	1
history	1
can	1
and	1
should	1
follow	1
a	1
path	1
contrary	1
to	1
that	1
taken	1
by	1
other	1
sciences.	1
Instead	1
of	1
first	1
defining	1
the	1
conceptions	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
then	1
ranging	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
life	1
under	1
those	1
definitions,	1
history	1
should	1
deduce	1
a	1
definition	1
of	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
immense	1
quantity	1
of	1
phenomena	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
cognizant	1
and	1
that	1
always	1
appear	1
dependent	1
on	1
these	1
two	1
elements.	1
	1
Whatever	1
presentation	1
of	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
many	1
men	1
or	1
of	1
an	1
individual	1
we	1
may	1
consider,	1
we	1
always	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
partly	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
partly	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
	1
Whether	1
we	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
migration	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
and	1
the	1
incursions	1
of	1
the	1
barbarians,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
Napoleon	1
III,	1
or	1
of	1
someone's	1
action	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
in	1
choosing	1
one	1
direction	1
out	1
of	1
several	1
for	1
his	1
walk,	1
we	1
are	1
unconscious	1
of	1
any	1
contradiction.	1
The	1
degree	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability	1
governing	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
is	1
clearly	1
defined	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
Our	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
freedom	1
often	1
varies	1
according	1
to	1
differences	1
in	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
regard	1
the	1
event,	1
but	1
every	1
human	1
action	1
appears	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
a	1
certain	1
combination	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability.	1
In	1
every	1
action	1
we	1
examine	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
certain	1
measure	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
measure	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
And	1
always	1
the	1
more	1
freedom	1
we	1
see	1
in	1
any	1
action	1
the	1
less	1
inevitability	1
do	1
we	1
perceive,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
inevitability	1
the	1
less	1
freedom.	1
	1
The	1
proportion	1
of	1
freedom	1
to	1
inevitability	1
decreases	1
and	1
increases	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
action	1
is	1
regarded,	1
but	1
their	1
relation	1
is	1
always	1
one	1
of	1
inverse	1
proportion.	1
	1
A	1
sinking	1
man	1
who	1
clutches	1
at	1
another	1
and	1
drowns	1
him;	1
or	1
a	1
hungry	1
mother	1
exhausted	1
by	1
feeding	1
her	1
baby,	1
who	1
steals	1
some	1
food;	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
trained	1
to	1
discipline	1
who	1
on	1
duty	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
kills	1
a	1
defenseless	1
man--	1
seem	1
less	1
guilty,	1
that	1
is,	1
less	1
free	1
and	1
more	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
necessity,	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
knows	1
the	1
circumstances	1
in	1
which	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
placed,	1
and	1
more	1
free	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
himself	1
drowning,	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
hungry,	1
that	1
the	1
soldier	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ranks,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Similarly	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
committed	1
a	1
murder	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
and	1
has	1
since	1
lived	1
peaceably	1
and	1
harmlessly	1
in	1
society	1
seems	1
less	1
guilty	1
and	1
his	1
action	1
more	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
considers	1
his	1
action	1
after	1
twenty	1
years	1
have	1
elapsed	1
than	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
examined	1
it	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
committed.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
every	1
action	1
of	1
an	1
insane,	1
intoxicated,	1
or	1
highly	1
excited	1
man	1
appears	1
less	1
free	1
and	1
more	1
inevitable	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
knows	1
the	1
mental	1
condition	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
committed	1
the	1
action,	1
and	1
seems	1
more	1
free	1
and	1
less	1
inevitable	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
it.	1
In	1
all	1
these	1
cases	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
is	1
increased	1
or	1
diminished	1
and	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
compulsion	1
is	1
correspondingly	1
decreased	1
or	1
increased,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
action	1
is	1
regarded.	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
necessity	1
the	1
smaller	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
vice	1
versa.	1
	1
Religion,	1
the	1
common	1
sense	1
of	1
mankind,	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
jurisprudence,	1
and	1
history	1
itself	1
understand	1
alike	1
this	1
relation	1
between	1
necessity	1
and	1
freedom.	1
	1
All	1
cases	1
without	1
exception	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
necessity	1
is	1
increased	1
and	1
diminished	1
depend	1
on	1
three	1
considerations:	1
	1
(1)	1
The	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
commits	1
the	1
deeds.	1
	1
(2)	1
His	1
relation	1
to	1
time.	1
	1
(3)	1
His	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
causes	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
action.	1
	1
The	1
first	1
consideration	1
is	1
the	1
clearness	1
of	1
our	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
clearness	1
of	1
our	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
definite	1
position	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
everything	1
coexisting	1
with	1
him.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
it	1
evident	1
that	1
a	1
drowning	1
man	1
is	1
less	1
free	1
and	1
more	1
subject	1
to	1
necessity	1
than	1
one	1
standing	1
on	1
dry	1
ground,	1
and	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
closely	1
connected	1
with	1
others	1
in	1
a	1
thickly	1
populated	1
district,	1
or	1
of	1
one	1
bound	1
by	1
family,	1
official,	1
or	1
business	1
duties,	1
seem	1
certainly	1
less	1
free	1
and	1
more	1
subject	1
to	1
necessity	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
living	1
in	1
solitude	1
and	1
seclusion.	1
	1
If	1
we	1
consider	1
a	1
man	1
alone,	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
everything	1
around	1
him,	1
each	1
action	1
of	1
his	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
free.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
see	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
anything	1
around	1
him,	1
if	1
we	1
see	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
anything	1
whatever--	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
speaks	1
to	1
him,	1
a	1
book	1
he	1
reads,	1
the	1
work	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
engaged,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
he	1
breathes	1
or	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
falls	1
on	1
the	1
things	1
about	1
him--we	1
see	1
that	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
circumstances	1
has	1
an	1
influence	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
controls	1
at	1
least	1
some	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
activity.	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
we	1
perceive	1
of	1
these	1
influences	1
the	1
more	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
his	1
freedom	1
diminishes	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
that	1
weighs	1
on	1
him	1
increases.	1
	1
The	1
second	1
consideration	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
evident	1
time	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
clearness	1
of	1
our	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
the	1
man's	1
action	1
occupies	1
in	1
time.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
ground	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
man,	1
resulting	1
in	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race,	1
appear	1
evidently	1
less	1
free	1
than	1
a	1
man's	1
entry	1
into	1
marriage	1
today.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
activity	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
lived	1
centuries	1
ago	1
and	1
are	1
connected	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
time	1
cannot	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
free	1
as	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
contemporary,	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
still	1
unknown	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
The	1
degree	1
of	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
or	1
inevitability	1
depends	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
on	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
lapse	1
of	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
our	1
judgment	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
If	1
I	1
examine	1
an	1
act	1
I	1
performed	1
a	1
moment	1
ago	1
in	1
approximately	1
the	1
same	1
circumstances	1
as	1
those	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
now,	1
my	1
action	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
undoubtedly	1
free.	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
examine	1
an	1
act	1
performed	1
a	1
month	1
ago,	1
then	1
being	1
in	1
different	1
circumstances,	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
recognizing	1
that	1
if	1
that	1
act	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
committed	1
much	1
that	1
resulted	1
from	1
it--good,	1
agreeable,	1
and	1
even	1
essential--would	1
not	1
have	1
taken	1
place.	1
If	1
I	1
reflect	1
on	1
an	1
action	1
still	1
more	1
remote,	1
ten	1
years	1
ago	1
or	1
more,	1
then	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
my	1
action	1
are	1
still	1
plainer	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
find	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
imagine	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
that	1
action	1
not	1
been	1
performed.	1
The	1
farther	1
I	1
go	1
back	1
in	1
memory,	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
the	1
farther	1
I	1
go	1
forward	1
in	1
my	1
judgment,	1
the	1
more	1
doubtful	1
becomes	1
my	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
my	1
action.	1
	1
In	1
history	1
we	1
find	1
a	1
very	1
similar	1
progress	1
of	1
conviction	1
concerning	1
the	1
part	1
played	1
by	1
free	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
affairs	1
of	1
humanity.	1
A	1
contemporary	1
event	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
indubitably	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
known	1
participants,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
remote	1
event	1
we	1
already	1
see	1
its	1
inevitable	1
results	1
which	1
prevent	1
our	1
considering	1
anything	1
else	1
possible.	1
And	1
the	1
farther	1
we	1
go	1
back	1
in	1
examining	1
events	1
the	1
less	1
arbitrary	1
do	1
they	1
appear.	1
	1
The	1
Austro-Prussian	1
war	1
appears	1
to	1
us	1
undoubtedly	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
crafty	1
conduct	1
of	1
Bismarck,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
The	1
Napoleonic	1
wars	1
still	1
seem	1
to	1
us,	1
though	1
already	1
questionably,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
their	1
heroes'	1
will.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
Crusades	1
we	1
already	1
see	1
an	1
event	1
occupying	1
its	1
definite	1
place	1
in	1
history	1
and	1
without	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
the	1
modern	1
history	1
of	1
Europe,	1
though	1
to	1
the	1
chroniclers	1
of	1
the	1
Crusades	1
that	1
event	1
appeared	1
as	1
merely	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
certain	1
people.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
migration	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
enter	1
anyone's	1
head	1
today	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
renovation	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
world	1
depended	1
on	1
Attila's	1
caprice.	1
The	1
farther	1
back	1
in	1
history	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
our	1
observation	1
lies,	1
the	1
more	1
doubtful	1
does	1
the	1
free	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
become	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
manifest	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
consideration	1
is	1
the	1
degree	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
apprehend	1
that	1
endless	1
chain	1
of	1
causation	1
inevitably	1
demanded	1
by	1
reason,	1
in	1
which	1
each	1
phenomenon	1
comprehended,	1
and	1
therefore	1
man's	1
every	1
action,	1
must	1
have	1
its	1
definite	1
place	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
gone	1
before	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
what	1
will	1
follow.	1
	1
The	1
better	1
we	1
are	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
physiological,	1
psychological,	1
and	1
historical	1
laws	1
deduced	1
by	1
observation	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
man	1
is	1
controlled,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
correctly	1
we	1
perceive	1
the	1
physiological,	1
psychological,	1
and	1
historical	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
action,	1
and	1
the	1
simpler	1
the	1
action	1
we	1
are	1
observing	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
complex	1
the	1
character	1
and	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
question,	1
the	1
more	1
subject	1
to	1
inevitability	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
free	1
do	1
our	1
actions	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
others	1
appear.	1
	1
When	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
understand	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
an	1
action,	1
whether	1
a	1
crime,	1
a	1
good	1
action,	1
or	1
even	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
simply	1
nonmoral,	1
we	1
ascribe	1
a	1
greater	1
amount	1
of	1
freedom	1
to	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
crime	1
we	1
most	1
urgently	1
demand	1
the	1
punishment	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
act;	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
virtuous	1
act	1
we	1
rate	1
its	1
merit	1
most	1
highly.	1
In	1
an	1
indifferent	1
case	1
we	1
recognize	1
in	1
it	1
more	1
individuality,	1
originality,	1
and	1
independence.	1
But	1
if	1
even	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
act	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
recognize	1
a	1
certain	1
element	1
of	1
necessity	1
and	1
are	1
less	1
insistent	1
on	1
punishment	1
for	1
the	1
crime,	1
or	1
the	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
virtuous	1
act,	1
or	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
apparently	1
original	1
action.	1
That	1
a	1
criminal	1
was	1
reared	1
among	1
male	1
factors	1
mitigates	1
his	1
fault	1
in	1
our	1
eyes.	1
The	1
self-sacrifice	1
of	1
a	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
or	1
self-sacrifice	1
with	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
reward,	1
is	1
more	1
comprehensible	1
than	1
gratuitous	1
self-sacrifice,	1
and	1
therefore	1
seems	1
less	1
deserving	1
of	1
sympathy	1
and	1
less	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
free	1
will.	1
The	1
founder	1
of	1
a	1
sect	1
or	1
party,	1
or	1
an	1
inventor,	1
impresses	1
us	1
less	1
when	1
we	1
know	1
how	1
or	1
by	1
what	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
his	1
activity.	1
If	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
large	1
range	1
of	1
examples,	1
if	1
our	1
observation	1
is	1
constantly	1
directed	1
to	1
seeking	1
the	1
correlation	1
of	1
cause	1
and	1
effect	1
in	1
people's	1
actions,	1
their	1
actions	1
appear	1
to	1
us	1
more	1
under	1
compulsion	1
and	1
less	1
free	1
the	1
more	1
correctly	1
we	1
connect	1
the	1
effects	1
with	1
the	1
causes.	1
If	1
we	1
examined	1
simple	1
actions	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
such	1
actions	1
under	1
observation,	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
their	1
inevitability	1
would	1
be	1
still	1
greater.	1
The	1
dishonest	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
dishonest	1
father,	1
the	1
misconduct	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
bad	1
company,	1
a	1
drunkard's	1
relapse	1
into	1
drunkenness,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
are	1
actions	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
us	1
less	1
free	1
the	1
better	1
we	1
understand	1
their	1
cause.	1
If	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
actions	1
we	1
are	1
considering	1
is	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
stage	1
of	1
mental	1
development,	1
like	1
a	1
child,	1
a	1
madman,	1
or	1
a	1
simpleton--then,	1
knowing	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
character	1
and	1
intelligence	1
in	1
question,	1
we	1
see	1
so	1
large	1
an	1
element	1
of	1
necessity	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
free	1
will	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
prompting	1
the	1
action	1
we	1
can	1
foretell	1
the	1
result.	1
	1
On	1
these	1
three	1
considerations	1
alone	1
is	1
based	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
irresponsibility	1
for	1
crimes	1
and	1
the	1
extenuating	1
circumstances	1
admitted	1
by	1
all	1
legislative	1
codes.	1
The	1
responsibility	1
appears	1
greater	1
or	1
less	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
placed	1
whose	1
action	1
is	1
being	1
judged,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
interval	1
of	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
its	1
investigation,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
causes	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
action.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Thus	1
our	1
conception	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
inevitability	1
gradually	1
diminishes	1
or	1
increases	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
remoteness	1
of	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
or	1
lesser	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
causes	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
contemplate	1
a	1
man's	1
life.	1
	1
So	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
examine	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
is	1
well	1
known,	1
where	1
the	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
its	1
examination	1
is	1
great,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
are	1
most	1
accessible,	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
maximum	1
of	1
inevitability	1
and	1
a	1
minimum	1
of	1
free	1
will.	1
If	1
we	1
examine	1
a	1
man	1
little	1
dependent	1
on	1
external	1
conditions,	1
whose	1
action	1
was	1
performed	1
very	1
recently,	1
and	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
whose	1
action	1
are	1
beyond	1
our	1
ken,	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
minimum	1
of	1
inevitability	1
and	1
a	1
maximum	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
In	1
neither	1
case--however	1
we	1
may	1
change	1
our	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
however	1
plain	1
we	1
may	1
make	1
to	1
ourselves	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
however	1
inaccessible	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
us,	1
however	1
long	1
or	1
short	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
however	1
intelligible	1
or	1
incomprehensible	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
may	1
be--can	1
we	1
ever	1
conceive	1
either	1
complete	1
freedom	1
or	1
complete	1
necessity.	1
	1
(1)	1
To	1
whatever	1
degree	1
we	1
may	1
imagine	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
exempt	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
we	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
space.	1
Every	1
human	1
action	1
is	1
inevitably	1
conditioned	1
by	1
what	1
surrounds	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
I	1
lift	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
fall.	1
My	1
action	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
free;	1
but	1
asking	1
myself	1
whether	1
I	1
could	1
raise	1
my	1
arm	1
in	1
every	1
direction,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
raised	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
least	1
obstruction	1
to	1
that	1
action	1
either	1
from	1
things	1
around	1
me	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
body.	1
I	1
chose	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
possible	1
directions	1
because	1
in	1
it	1
there	1
were	1
fewest	1
obstacles.	1
For	1
my	1
action	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
encounter	1
no	1
obstacles.	1
To	1
conceive	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
free	1
we	1
must	1
imagine	1
him	1
outside	1
space,	1
which	1
is	1
evidently	1
impossible.	1
	1
(2)	1
However	1
much	1
we	1
approximate	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
judgment	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
deed,	1
we	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
time.	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
examine	1
an	1
action	1
committed	1
a	1
second	1
ago	1
I	1
must	1
still	1
recognize	1
it	1
as	1
not	1
being	1
free,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
irrevocably	1
linked	1
to	1
the	1
moment	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
committed.	1
Can	1
I	1
lift	1
my	1
arm?	1
I	1
lift	1
it,	1
but	1
ask	1
myself:	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
abstained	1
from	1
lifting	1
my	1
arm	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
has	1
already	1
passed?	1
To	1
convince	1
myself	1
of	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
lift	1
it	1
the	1
next	1
moment.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
now	1
abstaining	1
from	1
doing	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
when	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
question.	1
Time	1
has	1
gone	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
detain,	1
the	1
arm	1
I	1
then	1
lifted	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
the	1
arm	1
I	1
now	1
refrain	1
from	1
lifting,	1
nor	1
is	1
the	1
air	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
lifted	1
it	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
now	1
surrounds	1
me.	1
The	1
moment	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
was	1
made	1
is	1
irrevocable,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
only	1
one	1
movement,	1
and	1
whatever	1
movement	1
I	1
made	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one.	1
That	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
lift	1
my	1
arm	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
does	1
not	1
prove	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
abstained	1
from	1
lifting	1
it	1
then.	1
And	1
since	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
only	1
one	1
movement	1
at	1
that	1
single	1
moment	1
of	1
time,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
any	1
other.	1
To	1
imagine	1
it	1
as	1
free,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
imagine	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
present,	1
on	1
the	1
boundary	1
between	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
future--that	1
is,	1
outside	1
time,	1
which	1
is	1
impossible.	1
	1
(3)	1
However	1
much	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
understanding	1
the	1
causes	1
may	1
be	1
increased,	1
we	1
never	1
reach	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
complete	1
freedom,	1
that	1
is,	1
an	1
absence	1
of	1
cause.	1
However	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
us	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
will	1
in	1
any	1
action,	1
our	1
own	1
or	1
another's,	1
the	1
first	1
demand	1
of	1
reason	1
is	1
the	1
assumption	1
of	1
and	1
search	1
for	1
a	1
cause,	1
for	1
without	1
a	1
cause	1
no	1
phenomenon	1
is	1
conceivable.	1
I	1
raise	1
my	1
arm	1
to	1
perform	1
an	1
action	1
independently	1
of	1
any	1
cause,	1
but	1
my	1
wish	1
to	1
perform	1
an	1
action	1
without	1
a	1
cause	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
action.	1
	1
But	1
even	1
if--imagining	1
a	1
man	1
quite	1
exempt	1
from	1
all	1
influences,	1
examining	1
only	1
his	1
momentary	1
action	1
in	1
the	1
present,	1
unevoked	1
by	1
any	1
cause--we	1
were	1
to	1
admit	1
so	1
infinitely	1
small	1
a	1
remainder	1
of	1
inevitability	1
as	1
equaled	1
zero,	1
we	1
should	1
even	1
then	1
not	1
have	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
complete	1
freedom	1
in	1
man,	1
for	1
a	1
being	1
uninfluenced	1
by	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
standing	1
outside	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
independent	1
of	1
cause,	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
imagine	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
quite	1
devoid	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
entirely	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
	1
(1)	1
However	1
we	1
may	1
increase	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
space	1
in	1
which	1
man	1
is	1
situated,	1
that	1
knowledge	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
complete,	1
for	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
conditions	1
is	1
as	1
infinite	1
as	1
the	1
infinity	1
of	1
space.	1
And	1
therefore	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
conditions	1
influencing	1
men	1
are	1
defined,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
complete	1
inevitability	1
but	1
a	1
certain	1
measure	1
of	1
freedom	1
remains.	1
	1
(2)	1
However	1
we	1
may	1
prolong	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
action	1
we	1
are	1
examining	1
and	1
the	1
judgment	1
upon	1
it,	1
that	1
period	1
will	1
be	1
finite,	1
while	1
time	1
is	1
infinite,	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
too	1
there	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
absolute	1
inevitability.	1
	1
(3)	1
However	1
accessible	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
causation	1
of	1
any	1
action,	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
know	1
the	1
whole	1
chain	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
endless,	1
and	1
so	1
again	1
we	1
never	1
reach	1
absolute	1
inevitability.	1
	1
But	1
besides	1
this,	1
even	1
if,	1
admitting	1
the	1
remaining	1
minimum	1
of	1
freedom	1
to	1
equal	1
zero,	1
we	1
assumed	1
in	1
some	1
given	1
case--as	1
for	1
instance	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
dying	1
man,	1
an	1
unborn	1
babe,	1
or	1
an	1
idiot--complete	1
absence	1
of	1
freedom,	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
we	1
should	1
destroy	1
the	1
very	1
conception	1
of	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
we	1
are	1
examining,	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
freedom	1
there	1
is	1
also	1
no	1
man.	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
subject	1
solely	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability	1
without	1
any	1
element	1
of	1
freedom	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
impossible	1
as	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
completely	1
free	1
action.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
to	1
imagine	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
entirely	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability	1
without	1
any	1
freedom,	1
we	1
must	1
assume	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
an	1
infinite	1
number	1
of	1
space	1
relations,	1
an	1
infinitely	1
long	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
and	1
an	1
infinite	1
series	1
of	1
causes.	1
	1
To	1
imagine	1
a	1
man	1
perfectly	1
free	1
and	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
we	1
must	1
imagine	1
him	1
all	1
alone,	1
beyond	1
space,	1
beyond	1
time,	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
dependence	1
on	1
cause.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
case,	1
if	1
inevitability	1
were	1
possible	1
without	1
freedom	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
reached	1
a	1
definition	1
of	1
inevitability	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability	1
itself,	1
that	1
is,	1
a	1
mere	1
form	1
without	1
content.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
case,	1
if	1
freedom	1
were	1
possible	1
without	1
inevitability	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
arrived	1
at	1
unconditioned	1
freedom	1
beyond	1
space,	1
time,	1
and	1
cause,	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
unconditioned	1
and	1
unlimited	1
would	1
be	1
nothing,	1
or	1
mere	1
content	1
without	1
form.	1
	1
We	1
should	1
in	1
fact	1
have	1
reached	1
those	1
two	1
fundamentals	1
of	1
which	1
man's	1
whole	1
outlook	1
on	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
constructed--the	1
incomprehensible	1
essence	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
laws	1
defining	1
that	1
essence.	1
	1
Reason	1
says:	1
(1)	1
space	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
matter	1
that	1
give	1
it	1
visibility	1
is	1
infinite,	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
imagined	1
otherwise.	1
(2)	1
Time	1
is	1
infinite	1
motion	1
without	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
rest	1
and	1
is	1
unthinkable	1
otherwise.	1
(3)	1
The	1
connection	1
between	1
cause	1
and	1
effect	1
has	1
no	1
beginning	1
and	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
end.	1
	1
Consciousness	1
says:	1
(1)	1
I	1
alone	1
am,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
exists	1
is	1
but	1
me,	1
consequently	1
I	1
include	1
space.	1
(2)	1
I	1
measure	1
flowing	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
fixed	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
in	1
which	1
alone	1
I	1
am	1
conscious	1
of	1
myself	1
as	1
living,	1
consequently	1
I	1
am	1
outside	1
time.	1
(3)	1
I	1
am	1
beyond	1
cause,	1
for	1
I	1
feel	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
every	1
manifestation	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
Reason	1
gives	1
expression	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability.	1
Consciousness	1
gives	1
expression	1
to	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
freedom.	1
	1
Freedom	1
not	1
limited	1
by	1
anything	1
is	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
life,	1
in	1
man's	1
consciousness.	1
Inevitability	1
without	1
content	1
is	1
man's	1
reason	1
in	1
its	1
three	1
forms.	1
	1
Freedom	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
examined.	1
Inevitability	1
is	1
what	1
examines.	1
Freedom	1
is	1
the	1
content.	1
Inevitability	1
is	1
the	1
form.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
separating	1
the	1
two	1
sources	1
of	1
cognition,	1
related	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
form	1
to	1
content,	1
do	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
mutually	1
exclusive	1
and	1
separately	1
incomprehensible	1
conceptions	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
inevitability.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
uniting	1
them	1
do	1
we	1
get	1
a	1
clear	1
conception	1
of	1
man's	1
life.	1
	1
Apart	1
from	1
these	1
two	1
concepts	1
which	1
in	1
their	1
union	1
mutually	1
define	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
form	1
and	1
content,	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
possible.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
certain	1
relation	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
to	1
inevitability,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
consciousness	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason.	1
	1
All	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
of	1
nature	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
certain	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
nature	1
to	1
inevitability,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason.	1
	1
The	1
great	1
natural	1
forces	1
lie	1
outside	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
them;	1
we	1
call	1
those	1
forces	1
gravitation,	1
inertia,	1
electricity,	1
animal	1
force,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
man	1
and	1
we	1
call	1
that	1
freedom.	1
	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
gravitation,	1
incomprehensible	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
felt	1
by	1
every	1
man,	1
is	1
understood	1
by	1
us	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
subject	1
(from	1
the	1
first	1
knowledge	1
that	1
all	1
bodies	1
have	1
weight,	1
up	1
to	1
Newton's	1
law),	1
so	1
too	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
free	1
will,	1
incomprehensible	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
of	1
which	1
everyone	1
is	1
conscious,	1
is	1
intelligible	1
to	1
us	1
only	1
in	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
subject	1
(from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
dies,	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
complex	1
economic	1
and	1
historic	1
laws).	1
	1
All	1
knowledge	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
bringing	1
of	1
this	1
essence	1
of	1
life	1
under	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason.	1
	1
Man's	1
free	1
will	1
differs	1
from	1
every	1
other	1
force	1
in	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
directly	1
conscious	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
reason	1
it	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
differs	1
from	1
any	1
other	1
force.	1
The	1
forces	1
of	1
gravitation,	1
electricity,	1
or	1
chemical	1
affinity	1
are	1
only	1
distinguished	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
differently	1
defined	1
by	1
reason.	1
Just	1
so	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
is	1
distinguished	1
by	1
reason	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
forces	1
of	1
nature	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
definition	1
reason	1
gives	1
it.	1
Freedom,	1
apart	1
from	1
necessity,	1
that	1
is,	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason	1
that	1
define	1
it,	1
differs	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
from	1
gravitation,	1
or	1
heat,	1
or	1
the	1
force	1
that	1
makes	1
things	1
grow;	1
for	1
reason,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
momentary	1
undefinable	1
sensation	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
undefinable	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
moving	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies,	1
the	1
undefinable	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
heat	1
and	1
electricity,	1
or	1
of	1
chemical	1
affinity,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
vital	1
force,	1
forms	1
the	1
content	1
of	1
astronomy,	1
physics,	1
chemistry,	1
botany,	1
zoology,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
does	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
form	1
the	1
content	1
of	1
history.	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
every	1
science	1
is	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
this	1
unknown	1
essence	1
of	1
life	1
while	1
that	1
essence	1
itself	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
metaphysics,	1
even	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
in	1
human	1
beings	1
in	1
space,	1
in	1
time,	1
and	1
in	1
dependence	1
on	1
cause	1
forms	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
history,	1
while	1
free	1
will	1
itself	1
is	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
metaphysics.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
experimental	1
sciences	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
we	1
call	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
what	1
is	1
unknown	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
call	1
vital	1
force.	1
Vital	1
force	1
is	1
only	1
an	1
expression	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
remainder	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
So	1
also	1
in	1
history	1
what	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
call	1
laws	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
what	1
is	1
unknown	1
we	1
call	1
free	1
will.	1
Free	1
will	1
is	1
for	1
history	1
only	1
an	1
expression	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
remainder	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
human	1
life.	1

CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
History	1
examines	1
the	1
manifestations	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
in	1
dependence	1
on	1
cause,	1
that	1
is,	1
it	1
defines	1
this	1
freedom	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
reason,	1
and	1
so	1
history	1
is	1
a	1
science	1
only	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
this	1
free	1
will	1
is	1
defined	1
by	1
those	1
laws.	1
	1
The	1
recognition	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
as	1
something	1
capable	1
of	1
influencing	1
historical	1
events,	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
laws,	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
history	1
as	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
force	1
moving	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
astronomy.	1
	1
That	1
assumption	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
laws,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
any	1
science	1
whatever.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
even	1
a	1
single	1
body	1
moving	1
freely,	1
then	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
Kepler	1
and	1
Newton	1
are	1
negatived	1
and	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
any	1
longer	1
exists.	1
If	1
any	1
single	1
action	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
free	1
will,	1
then	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
historical	1
law	1
can	1
exist,	1
nor	1
any	1
conception	1
of	1
historical	1
events.	1
	1
For	1
history,	1
lines	1
exist	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
human	1
wills,	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
unknown	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
man's	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
moves	1
in	1
space,	1
time,	1
and	1
dependence	1
on	1
cause.	1
	1
The	1
more	1
this	1
field	1
of	1
motion	1
spreads	1
out	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
the	1
more	1
evident	1
are	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
that	1
movement.	1
To	1
discover	1
and	1
define	1
those	1
laws	1
is	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
history.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
standpoint	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
history	1
now	1
regards	1
its	1
subject	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
it	1
now	1
follows,	1
seeking	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
man's	1
freewill,	1
a	1
scientific	1
enunciation	1
of	1
those	1
laws	1
is	1
impossible,	1
for	1
however	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
may	1
be	1
restricted,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
recognize	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
force	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
law,	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
law	1
becomes	1
impossible.	1
	1
Only	1
by	1
reducing	1
this	1
element	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
infinitesimal,	1
that	1
is,	1
by	1
regarding	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
infinitely	1
small	1
quantity,	1
can	1
we	1
convince	1
ourselves	1
of	1
the	1
absolute	1
inaccessibility	1
of	1
the	1
causes,	1
and	1
then	1
instead	1
of	1
seeking	1
causes,	1
history	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
laws	1
as	1
its	1
problem.	1
	1
The	1
search	1
for	1
these	1
laws	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
begun	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
methods	1
of	1
thought	1
which	1
history	1
must	1
adopt	1
are	1
being	1
worked	1
out	1
simultaneously	1
with	1
the	1
self-destruction	1
toward	1
which--ever	1
dissecting	1
and	1
dissecting	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
phenomena--the	1
old	1
method	1
of	1
history	1
is	1
moving.	1
	1
All	1
human	1
sciences	1
have	1
traveled	1
along	1
that	1
path.	1
Arriving	1
at	1
infinitesimals,	1
mathematics,	1
the	1
most	1
exact	1
of	1
sciences,	1
abandons	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
analysis	1
and	1
enters	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
process	1
of	1
the	1
integration	1
of	1
unknown,	1
infinitely	1
small,	1
quantities.	1
Abandoning	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
cause,	1
mathematics	1
seeks	1
law,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
property	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
unknown,	1
infinitely	1
small,	1
elements.	1
	1
In	1
another	1
form	1
but	1
along	1
the	1
same	1
path	1
of	1
reflection	1
the	1
other	1
sciences	1
have	1
proceeded.	1
When	1
Newton	1
enunciated	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
gravity	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
or	1
the	1
earth	1
had	1
a	1
property	1
of	1
attraction;	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
bodies	1
from	1
the	1
largest	1
to	1
the	1
smallest	1
have	1
the	1
property	1
of	1
attracting	1
one	1
another,	1
that	1
is,	1
leaving	1
aside	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
bodies,	1
he	1
expressed	1
the	1
property	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
bodies	1
from	1
the	1
infinitely	1
large	1
to	1
the	1
infinitely	1
small.	1
The	1
same	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences:	1
leaving	1
aside	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
cause,	1
they	1
seek	1
for	1
laws.	1
History	1
stands	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
path.	1
And	1
if	1
history	1
has	1
for	1
its	1
object	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
of	1
humanity	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
narration	1
of	1
episodes	1
in	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
individuals,	1
it	1
too,	1
setting	1
aside	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
cause,	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
laws	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
inseparably	1
interconnected	1
infinitesimal	1
elements	1
of	1
free	1
will.	1

CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Copernicus	1
was	1
discovered	1
and	1
proved,	1
the	1
mere	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
sun	1
but	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
moves	1
sufficed	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
whole	1
cosmography	1
of	1
the	1
ancients.	1
By	1
disproving	1
that	1
law	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
old	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
bodies,	1
but	1
without	1
disproving	1
it,	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
impossible	1
to	1
continue	1
studying	1
the	1
Ptolemaic	1
worlds.	1
But	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Copernicus	1
the	1
Ptolemaic	1
worlds	1
were	1
still	1
studied	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
said	1
and	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
births	1
or	1
of	1
crimes	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
mathematical	1
laws,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
government	1
is	1
determined	1
by	1
certain	1
geographical	1
and	1
economic	1
conditions,	1
and	1
that	1
certain	1
relations	1
of	1
population	1
to	1
soil	1
produce	1
migrations	1
of	1
peoples,	1
the	1
foundations	1
on	1
which	1
history	1
had	1
been	1
built	1
were	1
destroyed	1
in	1
their	1
essence.	1
	1
By	1
refuting	1
these	1
new	1
laws	1
the	1
former	1
view	1
of	1
history	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
retained;	1
but	1
without	1
refuting	1
them	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
impossible	1
to	1
continue	1
studying	1
historic	1
events	1
as	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
man's	1
free	1
will.	1
For	1
if	1
a	1
certain	1
mode	1
of	1
government	1
was	1
established	1
or	1
certain	1
migrations	1
of	1
peoples	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
geographic,	1
ethnographic,	1
or	1
economic	1
conditions,	1
then	1
the	1
free	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
individuals	1
who	1
appear	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
established	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
government	1
or	1
occasioned	1
the	1
migrations	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
cause.	1
	1
And	1
yet	1
the	1
former	1
history	1
continues	1
to	1
be	1
studied	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
statistics,	1
geography,	1
political	1
economy,	1
comparative	1
philology,	1
and	1
geology,	1
which	1
directly	1
contradict	1
its	1
assumptions.	1
	1
The	1
struggle	1
between	1
the	1
old	1
views	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
was	1
long	1
and	1
stubbornly	1
fought	1
out	1
in	1
physical	1
philosophy.	1
Theology	1
stood	1
on	1
guard	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
views	1
and	1
accused	1
the	1
new	1
of	1
violating	1
revelation.	1
But	1
when	1
truth	1
conquered,	1
theology	1
established	1
itself	1
just	1
as	1
firmly	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
foundation.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
prolonged	1
and	1
stubborn	1
is	1
the	1
struggle	1
now	1
proceeding	1
between	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
conception	1
of	1
history,	1
and	1
theology	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
stands	1
on	1
guard	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
view,	1
and	1
accuses	1
the	1
new	1
view	1
of	1
subverting	1
revelation.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
one	1
case	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
the	1
struggle	1
provokes	1
passion	1
and	1
stifles	1
truth.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
there	1
is	1
fear	1
and	1
regret	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
edifice	1
constructed	1
through	1
the	1
ages,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
the	1
passion	1
for	1
destruction.	1
	1
To	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
rising	1
truths	1
of	1
physical	1
philosophy,	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
admitted	1
that	1
truth	1
it	1
would	1
destroy	1
faith	1
in	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
firmament,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
miracle	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun.	1
To	1
the	1
defenders	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
Copernicus	1
and	1
Newton,	1
to	1
Voltaire	1
for	1
example,	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
astronomy	1
destroyed	1
religion,	1
and	1
he	1
utilized	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
gravitation	1
as	1
a	1
weapon	1
against	1
religion.	1
	1
Just	1
so	1
it	1
now	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
admit	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
soul,	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
institutions	1
of	1
state	1
and	1
church	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
built	1
up	1
on	1
those	1
conceptions.	1
	1
So	1
too,	1
like	1
Voltaire	1
in	1
his	1
time,	1
uninvited	1
defenders	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability	1
today	1
use	1
that	1
law	1
as	1
a	1
weapon	1
against	1
religion,	1
though	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
inevitability	1
in	1
history,	1
like	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Copernicus	1
in	1
astronomy,	1
far	1
from	1
destroying,	1
even	1
strengthens	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
institutions	1
of	1
state	1
and	1
church	1
are	1
erected.	1
	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
astronomy	1
then,	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
history	1
now,	1
the	1
whole	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
is	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
recognition	1
or	1
nonrecognition	1
of	1
something	1
absolute,	1
serving	1
as	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
visible	1
phenomena.	1
In	1
astronomy	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
immovability	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
in	1
history	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
personality--free	1
will.	1
	1
As	1
with	1
astronomy	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
recognizing	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
lay	1
in	1
abandoning	1
the	1
immediate	1
sensation	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
fixity	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
planets,	1
so	1
in	1
history	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
recognizing	1
the	1
subjection	1
of	1
personality	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
space,	1
time,	1
and	1
cause	1
lies	1
in	1
renouncing	1
the	1
direct	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
one's	1
own	1
personality.	1
But	1
as	1
in	1
astronomy	1
the	1
new	1
view	1
said:	1
"It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
by	1
admitting	1
its	1
immobility	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
absurdity,	1
while	1
by	1
admitting	1
its	1
motion	1
(which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
feel)	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
laws,"	1
so	1
also	1
in	1
history	1
the	1
new	1
view	1
says:	1
"It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
our	1
dependence,	1
but	1
by	1
admitting	1
our	1
free	1
will	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
absurdity,	1
while	1
by	1
admitting	1
our	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
external	1
world,	1
on	1
time,	1
and	1
on	1
cause,	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
laws."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
case	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
renounce	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
an	1
unreal	1
immobility	1
in	1
space	1
and	1
to	1
recognize	1
a	1
motion	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
feel;	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
similarly	1
necessary	1
to	1
renounce	1
a	1
freedom	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
exist,	1
and	1
to	1
recognize	1
a	1
dependence	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
conscious.	1
