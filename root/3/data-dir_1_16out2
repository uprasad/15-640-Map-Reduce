undressing	1
he	1
into	1

free	1
from	1

seems,	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
everything	1
that	1
and	1
I	1
be	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
himself.	1
few	1
days	1
previously	1
Pierre	1
had	1
decided	1
go	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
awoke	1
came	1
ask	1
Petersburg?	1
is	1
Petersburg?	1
is	1
Petersburg?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
before	1
I	1
some	1
reason	1
go	1
he	1
"Why?	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
a	1

how	1
and	1
how	1
he	1

just	1
With	1
one	1
what	1
"Supposing	1

he	1
involuntary	1
I	1
take	1
your	1
excellency,	1
be	1
a	1

he	1
thinks	1
thought	1
how	1
terrible	1
is	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
terrible!"	1
what	1
your	1
Are	1
you	1
starting	1
tomorrow?"	1
asked	1
I'll	1
a	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
later.	1
must	1
trouble	1
I	1
you	1
and	1
smile,	1
he	1
thought:	1
how	1
strange	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
that	1
now	1
is	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
settled	1
all!	1
he	1
knows	1
well	1

is	1
I	1
a	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
thinks?"	1
Pierre	1
At	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
met--"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
Rostova!"	1
The	1
seemed	1
nothing	1

than	1
he	1

was	1
a	1
pity."	1

The	1
had	1
provisions	1
they	1
all	1
thought	1
is	1
surprising	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
trouble	1
now	1

all	1
me!"	1
came	1
a	1
representative	1
Palace	1
that	1
be	1
that	1
day.	1
man	1
thought	1
into	1
a	1
officer	1
and	1
how	1
now!	1
they	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
honest	1
and	1
he	1
take	1
bribes?	1
That's	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
and	1
does	1
what	1
a	1
kind,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
he	1
Pierre	1
Princess	1
he	1
drove	1
houses	1
that	1
had	1
down,	1
he	1
was	1
those	1
The	1
and	1
walls	1
burned-out	1
stretching	1
and	1
concealing	1
one	1
another,	1
Rhine	1
and	1
The	1
he	1
and	1
cutting	1
houses	1
women	1
and	1
all	1
cheerful	1
that	1
seemed	1
say:	1
"Ah,	1
he	1
is!	1
what	1
At	1
Princess	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
doubtful	1
he	1
had	1
night	1
before	1
and	1
seen	1
and	1
I	1
imagined	1
it;	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
room	1
before	1
he	1
felt	1
her	1
being	1

and	1
her	1
was	1

before,	1
was	1

roguish	1
Pierre	1

and	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
going	1
vespers	1
and	1
Pierre	1
left	1
Next	1
he	1
came	1
early,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
evidently	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
everything	1
and	1
conversation	1
from	1
one	1
and	1
off.	1
so	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
evidently	1
he	1
Pierre	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
felt	1
and	1
embarrassed,	1
but	1
sat	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
up	1
and	1
take	1
Princess	1
foreseeing	1
this,	1
and	1
complaining	1
a	1
you	1
going	1
Petersburg	1
tomorrow?"	1
I	1
not	1
Pierre	1
a	1

Petersburg?	1
I	1
good-by	1
I	1
call	1

now	1
off.	1
With	1
a	1
and	1
sigh	1
seemed	1
be	1
a	1
left	1
room	1
confusion	1
and	1
and	1
replaced	1
excitement.	1
toward	1
Princess	1
I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
her	1
had	1
spoken.	1
I	1
do?	1
Can	1
I	1
dear	1
I	1
I	1
I	1
not	1
I	1

I	1
want	1
be	1
a	1
not	1
I	1
I	1
paused	1
and	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
I	1
but	1
I	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
all	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
her	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
without	1
I	1
propose	1
her	1
present,	1
but	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
be	1
wife	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
be	1
missing	1
that	1
possibility...	1
that	1
possibility...	1
is	1
terrible.	1
I	1
what	1
I	1
dear	1
he	1
a	1
and	1
her	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
answered	1
Princess	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
that	1
speak	1
her	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
stopped.	1
was	1
going	1
that	1

impossible,	1

because	1
had	1
seen	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
that	1
not	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
Pierre	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
very	1
thing	1
for.	1
"To	1
speak	1
her	1
now	1
wouldn't	1
do,"	1
all	1
what	1
I	1
Princess	1
Pierre	1
was	1
into	1
Princess	1
eyes.	1
he	1
said.	1
that	1
loves...	1
you,"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
Before	1
her	1
words	1
out,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
up	1
and	1
a	1
Princess	1
hand.	1

I	1
think...?"	1
I	1
so,"	1
Princess	1

a	1
her	1
and	1
me.	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
I	1

said.	1
"To	1
Petersburg?	1
I'll	1
I	1
tomorrow?"	1
Next	1
Pierre	1
came	1
good-by.	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
had	1
before;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
her	1

aloud.	1

CHAPTER	1
was	1
nothing	1

all	1
like	1
what	1
had	1
Helene.	1
not	1
a	1
shame	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
say:	1

contrary,	1
he	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
and	1
detail	1
her	1
and	1
smile,	1
and	1
not	1
diminish	1

and	1
again.	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
