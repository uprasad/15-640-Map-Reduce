Still	1

came	1
across	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
man	1
could	1
be	1

without	1
any	1
premeditation	1
Prince	1
took	1
gain	1
confidence,	1
intimate	1

angrily	1
her	1

be	1
provocatively	1
happy."	1
what	1
nonsense	1
all	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
saying!"	1
thought	1
a	1
glancing	1
faces	1
"That's	1
and	1
that	1
society	1
had	1
a	1
and	1
handsome	1
young	1

one	1
dominated	1
everything	1

all	1
affected	1
news	1
was	1
not	1
and	1
was	1
evidently	1
but	1
even	1
waiting	1

seemed	1
feel	1
this,	1
and	1
they	1
forgot	1
duties	1
they	1
beautiful	1
her	1
radiant	1
and	1
broad,	1
and	1
seemed	1
very	1
candles	1
was	1
those	1
two	1
faces	1
alone.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
pleased	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
him.	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
man	1

not	1

hear,	1
understand	1
anything	1
Only	1
now	1
and	1
and	1
from	1
unexpectedly	1
is	1
all	1
he	1
thought.	1
how	1
has	1
all	1
happened?	1
I	1
that	1

because	1
everyone,	1

that	1
I	1
I	1
disappoint	1
how	1
be?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
but	1
certainly	1
happen!"	1
thought	1
glancing	1
those	1
eyes.	1
Or	1
he	1
suddenly	1
feel	1
he	1
not	1
felt	1
attract	1
attention	1

be	1
a	1
man	1
plain	1
be	1
a	1
Paris	1

always	1
is	1
and	1
must	1
be	1

consoled	1
himself.	1
besides,	1
what	1
I	1
I	1
traveled	1
from	1
Prince	1
was	1
I	1
not	1
I	1
played	1
her	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
her	1
and	1
drove	1

was	1
her	1

seeing,	1
her	1
her	1
her	1
movements,	1
her	1
suddenly	1
that	1
was	1
not	1

he	1
was	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
they	1
all	1
so	1
and	1
he	1
chest,	1
raise	1
and	1
he	1
a	1
familiar	1
something	1
a	1
second	1
Pierre	1
was	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said.	1
you	1
you	1
last	1
from	1
Prince	1
a	1
absent-minded	1
you	1
dear	1
Prince	1
and	1
Pierre	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
and	1
Helene.	1
what	1
it,	1
you	1
all	1
thought	1
It's	1
and	1
he	1
gentle	1
childlike	1
smile,	1
and	1
"When	1
you	1
from	1
Prince	1
who	1
want	1
settle	1
a	1
one	1
trifles?"	1
thought	1
from	1
he	1
a	1
Pierre	1
partner	1
into	1
drawing	1
The	1
some	1
without	1
Helene.	1
Some,	1
distract	1
her	1
from	1
occupation,	1
came	1
up	1
her	1
a	1
and	1
go	1
away,	1
let	1
her	1
them	1
off.	1
The	1
diplomatist	1
a	1
silence	1
he	1
left	1
drawing	1
happiness.	1
The	1
old	1
grumbled	1
wife	1
asked	1
how	1
old	1
fool,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
Princess	1

beautiful	1
I	1
you,"	1
Anna	1
old	1
kissing	1
her	1

longer."	1
The	1
old	1
not	1

was	1
her	1
happiness.	1
While	1
Pierre	1

little	1
drawing	1
room	1
they	1
had	1
before,	1
last	1
six	1
but	1
had	1
never	1

he	1
felt	1
that	1
was	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
up	1

take	1
step.	1
felt	1
he	1

"This	1

some	1
him.	1
"This	1

But,	1
he	1

so	1
strange	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
severity	1
and	1
he	1
down,	1
and	1
affectionately.	1
he	1
asked,	1
instantly	1

her	1
habitual	1
tenderness	1
natural	1

now	1
there's	1
Dolokhov	1

came	1

"Why	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
'Je	1

he	1
kept	1
himself.	1
he	1
had	1
tenth	1

undressing	1
he	1
into	1

free	1
from	1

seems,	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
everything	1
that	1
and	1
I	1
be	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
himself.	1
few	1
days	1
previously	1
Pierre	1
had	1
decided	1
go	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
awoke	1
came	1
ask	1
Petersburg?	1
is	1
Petersburg?	1
is	1
Petersburg?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself.	1
before	1
I	1
some	1
reason	1
go	1
he	1
"Why?	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
a	1

him.	1
"What's	1

your	1

count--the	1

just	1
With	1
one	1
what	1
"Supposing	1

I	1
take	1
your	1
excellency,	1

a	1

he	1
thinks	1
thought	1
how	1
terrible	1
is	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
terrible!"	1
what	1
your	1
Are	1
you	1
starting	1
tomorrow?"	1
asked	1
I'll	1
a	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
later.	1
must	1
trouble	1
I	1
you	1
and	1
smile,	1
he	1
thought:	1
how	1
strange	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
that	1
now	1
is	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
settled	1
all!	1
he	1
knows	1
well	1

is	1
I	1
a	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
thinks?"	1
Pierre	1
At	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
met--"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
Rostova!"	1
The	1
seemed	1
nothing	1

than	1

was	1
a	1
pity."	1

The	1
had	1
provisions	1
they	1
all	1
thought	1
is	1
surprising	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
trouble	1
now	1

all	1
me!"	1
came	1
a	1
representative	1
Palace	1
that	1
be	1
that	1
day.	1
man	1
thought	1
into	1
a	1
officer	1
and	1
how	1
now!	1
they	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
honest	1
and	1
he	1
take	1
bribes?	1
That's	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
and	1
does	1
what	1
a	1
kind,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
he	1
Pierre	1
Princess	1
he	1
drove	1
houses	1
that	1
had	1
down,	1
he	1
was	1
those	1
The	1
and	1
walls	1
burned-out	1
stretching	1
and	1
concealing	1
one	1
another,	1
Rhine	1
and	1
The	1
he	1
and	1
cutting	1
houses	1
women	1
and	1
all	1
cheerful	1
that	1
seemed	1
say:	1
"Ah,	1
he	1
is!	1
what	1
At	1
Princess	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
doubtful	1
he	1
had	1
night	1
before	1
and	1
seen	1
and	1
I	1
imagined	1
it;	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
room	1
before	1
he	1
felt	1
her	1
being	1

and	1
her	1
was	1
way	1
before,	1
was	1
like	1

roguish	1
Pierre	1
them	1
and	1
but	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
going	1
vespers	1
and	1
Pierre	1
left	1
Next	1
he	1
came	1
early,	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
evidently	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
everything	1
and	1
conversation	1
from	1
one	1
and	1
off.	1
so	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
evidently	1
he	1
Pierre	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
felt	1
and	1
embarrassed,	1
but	1
sat	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
up	1
and	1
take	1
Princess	1
foreseeing	1
this,	1
and	1
complaining	1
a	1
you	1
going	1
Petersburg	1
tomorrow?"	1
I	1
not	1
Pierre	1
a	1

Petersburg?	1
I	1
good-by	1
I	1
call	1

plainly	1
shown	1
before	1

now	1
off.	1
With	1
a	1
and	1
sigh	1
seemed	1
be	1
a	1
left	1
room	1
confusion	1
and	1
and	1
replaced	1
excitement.	1
toward	1
Princess	1
I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
her	1
had	1
spoken.	1
I	1
do?	1
Can	1
I	1
dear	1
I	1
I	1
I	1
not	1
I	1
speak	1
I	1
want	1
be	1
a	1
not	1
I	1
I	1
paused	1
and	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
I	1
but	1
I	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
all	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
her	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
without	1
I	1
propose	1
her	1
present,	1
but	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
be	1
wife	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
be	1
missing	1
that	1
possibility...	1
that	1
possibility...	1
is	1
terrible.	1
I	1
what	1
I	1
dear	1
he	1
a	1
and	1
her	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
answered	1
Princess	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
that	1
speak	1
her	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
stopped.	1
was	1
going	1
that	1
speak	1
was	1
impossible,	1
but	1
because	1
had	1
seen	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
that	1
not	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
Pierre	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
very	1
thing	1
for.	1
"To	1
speak	1
her	1
now	1
wouldn't	1
do,"	1
all	1
what	1
I	1
Princess	1
Pierre	1
was	1
into	1
Princess	1
eyes.	1
he	1
said.	1
that	1
loves...	1
you,"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
Before	1
her	1
words	1
out,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
up	1
and	1
a	1
Princess	1
hand.	1
makes	1
you	1
so?	1
I	1
think...?"	1
I	1
so,"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
a	1
her	1
and	1
me.	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
I	1

said.	1
"To	1
Petersburg?	1
I'll	1
I	1
tomorrow?"	1
Next	1
Pierre	1
came	1
good-by.	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
had	1
before;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
her	1

aloud.	1
shall	1
very	1
your	1

her	1
look,	1
and	1
her	1

Yes,	1

Yes,	1

CHAPTER	1
was	1
nothing	1
soul	1
now	1
all	1
like	1
what	1
had	1
Helene.	1
not	1
a	1
shame	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
say:	1
I	1
not	1
'Je	1
aime'?"	1
contrary,	1
he	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
and	1
detail	1
her	1
and	1
smile,	1
and	1
not	1
diminish	1
but	1
and	1
again.	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
a	1
mind	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
was	1
wrong.	1
Only	1
one	1
terrible	1
"Wasn't	1
all	1
a	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
mistaken?	1
I	1
not	1
and	1

I	1
something	1

The	1
before	1
so	1
inconceivable	1
that	1

could	1
it,	1
be	1
all	1

joyful,	1

him.	1
The	1
