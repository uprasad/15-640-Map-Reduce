Then	1
were	1
the	1
king's	1
scribes	1
called	1
on	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
written	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Haman	1
had	1
commanded	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
lieutenants,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
governors	1
that	1
were	1
over	1
every	1
province,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
every	1
people	1
of	1
every	1
province	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
thereof,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
people	1
after	1
their	1
language;	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
was	1
it	1
written,	1
and	1
sealed	1
with	1
the	1
king's	1
ring.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
the	1
letters	1
were	1
sent	1
by	1
posts	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
provinces,	1
to	1
destroy,	1
to	1
kill,	1
and	1
to	1
cause	1
to	1
perish,	1
all	1
Jews,	1
both	1
young	1
and	1
old,	1
little	1
children	1
and	1
women,	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
even	1
upon	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
twelfth	1
month,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
month	1
Adar,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
prey.	1
	1
3:14	1
The	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
writing	1
for	1
a	1
commandment	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
in	1
every	1
province	1
was	1
published	1
unto	1
all	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
ready	1
against	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
3:15	1
The	1
posts	1
went	1
out,	1
being	1
hastened	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment,	1
and	1
the	1
decree	1
was	1
given	1
in	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
Haman	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
drink;	1
but	1
the	1
city	1
Shushan	1
was	1
perplexed.	1
	1
4:1	1
When	1
Mordecai	1
perceived	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
done,	1
Mordecai	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
sackcloth	1
with	1
ashes,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
a	1
bitter	1
cry;	1
4:2	1
And	1
came	1
even	1
before	1
the	1
king's	1
gate:	1
for	1
none	1
might	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
gate	1
clothed	1
with	1
sackcloth.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
in	1
every	1
province,	1
whithersoever	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
and	1
his	1
decree	1
came,	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
mourning	1
among	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
fasting,	1
and	1
weeping,	1
and	1
wailing;	1
and	1
many	1
lay	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
4:4	1
So	1
Esther's	1
maids	1
and	1
her	1
chamberlains	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
her.	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
queen	1
exceedingly	1
grieved;	1
and	1
she	1
sent	1
raiment	1
to	1
clothe	1
Mordecai,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
sackcloth	1
from	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
received	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
called	1
Esther	1
for	1
Hatach,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlains,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
appointed	1
to	1
attend	1
upon	1
her,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
commandment	1
to	1
Mordecai,	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
why	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
4:6	1
So	1
Hatach	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
Mordecai	1
unto	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
king's	1
gate.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
Mordecai	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
Haman	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
pay	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
treasuries	1
for	1
the	1
Jews,	1
to	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
4:8	1
Also	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
writing	1
of	1
the	1
decree	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
at	1
Shushan	1
to	1
destroy	1
them,	1
to	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
Esther,	1
and	1
to	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
charge	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
to	1
make	1
supplication	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
request	1
before	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
people.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
Hatach	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
Esther	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Mordecai.	1
	1
4:10	1
Again	1
Esther	1
spake	1
unto	1
Hatach,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
commandment	1
unto	1
Mordecai;	1
4:11	1
All	1
the	1
king's	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
provinces,	1
do	1
know,	1
that	1
whosoever,	1
whether	1
man	1
or	1
women,	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
court,	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
called,	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
law	1
of	1
his	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
except	1
such	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
hold	1
out	1
the	1
golden	1
sceptre,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
live:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
called	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
these	1
thirty	1
days.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
to	1
Mordecai	1
Esther's	1
words.	1
	1
4:13	1
Then	1
Mordecai	1
commanded	1
to	1
answer	1
Esther,	1
Think	1
not	1
with	1
thyself	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
escape	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
altogether	1
holdest	1
thy	1
peace	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
then	1
shall	1
there	1
enlargement	1
and	1
deliverance	1
arise	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
from	1
another	1
place;	1
but	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
father's	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
and	1
who	1
knoweth	1
whether	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
as	1
this?	1
4:15	1
Then	1
Esther	1
bade	1
them	1
return	1
Mordecai	1
this	1
answer,	1
4:16	1
Go,	1
gather	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
are	1
present	1
in	1
Shushan,	1
and	1
fast	1
ye	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
three	1
days,	1
night	1
or	1
day:	1
I	1
also	1
and	1
my	1
maidens	1
will	1
fast	1
likewise;	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
perish,	1
I	1
perish.	1
	1
4:17	1
So	1
Mordecai	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Esther	1
had	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
5:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
that	1
Esther	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
royal	1
apparel,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
inner	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
king's	1
house:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
royal	1
throne	1
in	1
the	1
royal	1
house,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
court,	1
that	1
she	1
obtained	1
favour	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
held	1
out	1
to	1
Esther	1
the	1
golden	1
sceptre	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
So	1
Esther	1
drew	1
near,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
sceptre.	1
	1
5:3	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou,	1
queen	1
Esther?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
request?	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
given	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
Esther	1
answered,	1
If	1
it	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
let	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
Haman	1
come	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
banquet	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
5:5	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Cause	1
Haman	1
to	1
make	1
haste,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
as	1
Esther	1
hath	1
said.	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
Haman	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
banquet	1
that	1
Esther	1
had	1
prepared.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Esther	1
at	1
the	1
banquet	1
of	1
wine,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
petition?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
granted	1
thee:	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
request?	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
performed.	1
	1
5:7	1
Then	1
answered	1
Esther,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
petition	1
and	1
my	1
request	1
is;	1
5:8	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
please	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
grant	1
my	1
petition,	1
and	1
to	1
perform	1
my	1
request,	1
let	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
Haman	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
banquet	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
prepare	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
morrow	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
said.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
went	1
Haman	1
forth	1
that	1
day	1
joyful	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
glad	1
heart:	1
but	1
when	1
Haman	1
saw	1
Mordecai	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
gate,	1
that	1
he	1
stood	1
not	1
up,	1
nor	1
moved	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
indignation	1
against	1
Mordecai.	1
	1
5:10	1
Nevertheless	1
Haman	1
refrained	1
himself:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
home,	1
he	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
Zeresh	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
Haman	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
riches,	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
children,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
wherein	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
promoted	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
advanced	1
him	1
above	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
5:12	1
Haman	1
said	1
moreover,	1
Yea,	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen	1
did	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
come	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
unto	1
the	1
banquet	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
but	1
myself;	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
am	1
I	1
invited	1
unto	1
her	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
5:13	1
Yet	1
all	1
this	1
availeth	1
me	1
nothing,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
Mordecai	1
the	1
Jew	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
king's	1
gate.	1
	1
5:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Zeresh	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
friends	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
a	1
gallows	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
fifty	1
cubits	1
high,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
speak	1
thou	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
Mordecai	1
may	1
be	1
hanged	1
thereon:	1
then	1
go	1
thou	1
in	1
merrily	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
unto	1
the	1
banquet.	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
pleased	1
Haman;	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
the	1
gallows	1
to	1
be	1
made.	1
	1
6:1	1
On	1
that	1
night	1
could	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
sleep,	1
and	1
he	1
commanded	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
records	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
read	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
written,	1
that	1
Mordecai	1
had	1
told	1
of	1
Bigthana	1
and	1
Teresh,	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlains,	1
the	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
What	1
honour	1
and	1
dignity	1
hath	1
been	1
done	1
to	1
Mordecai	1
for	1
this?	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king's	1
servants	1
that	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
done	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
court?	1
Now	1
Haman	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
outward	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
hang	1
Mordecai	1
on	1
the	1
gallows	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
the	1
king's	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
Haman	1
standeth	1
in	1
the	1
court.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Let	1
him	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
6:6	1
So	1
Haman	1
came	1
in.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
delighteth	1
to	1
honour?	1
Now	1
Haman	1
thought	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
To	1
whom	1
would	1
the	1
king	1
delight	1
to	1
do	1
honour	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
myself?	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
Haman	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
delighteth	1
to	1
honour,	1
6:8	1
Let	1
the	1
royal	1
apparel	1
be	1
brought	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
useth	1
to	1
wear,	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
rideth	1
upon,	1
and	1
the	1
crown	1
royal	1
which	1
is	1
set	1
upon	1
his	1
head:	1
6:9	1
And	1
let	1
this	1
apparel	1
and	1
horse	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
most	1
noble	1
princes,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
array	1
the	1
man	1
withal	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
delighteth	1
to	1
honour,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
on	1
horseback	1
through	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
before	1
him,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
delighteth	1
to	1
honour.	1
	1
6:10	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
Haman,	1
Make	1
haste,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
apparel	1
and	1
the	1
horse,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
and	1
do	1
even	1
so	1
to	1
Mordecai	1
the	1
Jew,	1
that	1
sitteth	1
at	1
the	1
king's	1
gate:	1
let	1
nothing	1
fail	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
took	1
Haman	1
the	1
apparel	1
and	1
the	1
horse,	1
and	1
arrayed	1
Mordecai,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
on	1
horseback	1
through	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
before	1
him,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
delighteth	1
to	1
honour.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
Mordecai	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
gate.	1
But	1
Haman	1
hasted	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
mourning,	1
and	1
having	1
his	1
head	1
covered.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
Haman	1
told	1
Zeresh	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
friends	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
had	1
befallen	1
him.	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
wise	1
men	1
and	1
Zeresh	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
Mordecai	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
before	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
begun	1
to	1
fall,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
but	1
shalt	1
surely	1
fall	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
yet	1
talking	1
with	1
him,	1
came	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlains,	1
and	1
hasted	1
to	1
bring	1
Haman	1
unto	1
the	1
banquet	1
that	1
Esther	1
had	1
prepared.	1
	1
7:1	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
Haman	1
came	1
to	1
banquet	1
with	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
again	1
unto	1
Esther	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
banquet	1
of	1
wine,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
petition,	1
queen	1
Esther?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
granted	1
thee:	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
request?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
performed,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
7:3	1
Then	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
O	1
king,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
please	1
the	1
king,	1
let	1
my	1
life	1
be	1
given	1
me	1
at	1
my	1
petition,	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
at	1
my	1
request:	1
7:4	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
sold,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people,	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
to	1
be	1
slain,	1
and	1
to	1
perish.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
bondmen	1
and	1
bondwomen,	1
I	1
had	1
held	1
my	1
tongue,	1
although	1
the	1
enemy	1
could	1
not	1
countervail	1
the	1
king's	1
damage.	1
	1
7:5	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen,	1
Who	1
is	1
he,	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
he,	1
that	1
durst	1
presume	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
do	1
so?	1
7:6	1
And	1
Esther	1
said,	1
The	1
adversary	1
and	1
enemy	1
is	1
this	1
wicked	1
Haman.	1
Then	1
Haman	1
was	1
afraid	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
queen.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
banquet	1
of	1
wine	1
in	1
his	1
wrath	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
garden:	1
and	1
Haman	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
make	1
request	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen;	1
for	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
evil	1
determined	1
against	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
7:8	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
returned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
palace	1
garden	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
banquet	1
of	1
wine;	1
and	1
Haman	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
the	1
bed	1
whereon	1
Esther	1
was.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king,	1
Will	1
he	1
force	1
the	1
queen	1
also	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
house?	1
As	1
the	1
word	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
king's	1
mouth,	1
they	1
covered	1
Haman's	1
face.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
Harbonah,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chamberlains,	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold	1
also,	1
the	1
gallows	1
fifty	1
cubits	1
high,	1
which	1
Haman	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
Mordecai,	1
who	1
spoken	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
king,	1
standeth	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Haman.	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Hang	1
him	1
thereon.	1
	1
7:10	1
So	1
they	1
hanged	1
Haman	1
on	1
the	1
gallows	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
Mordecai.	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
king's	1
wrath	1
pacified.	1
	1
8:1	1
On	1
that	1
day	1
did	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
give	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Haman	1
the	1
Jews'	1
enemy	1
unto	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen.	1
And	1
Mordecai	1
came	1
before	1
the	1
king;	1
for	1
Esther	1
had	1
told	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
ring,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
Haman,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
Mordecai.	1
And	1
Esther	1
set	1
Mordecai	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Haman.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
Esther	1
spake	1
yet	1
again	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
with	1
tears	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
mischief	1
of	1
Haman	1
the	1
Agagite,	1
and	1
his	1
device	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
devised	1
against	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
8:4	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
held	1
out	1
the	1
golden	1
sceptre	1
toward	1
Esther.	1
So	1
Esther	1
arose,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
8:5	1
And	1
said,	1
If	1
it	1
please	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
favour	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
seem	1
right	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
I	1
be	1
pleasing	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
written	1
to	1
reverse	1
the	1
letters	1
devised	1
by	1
Haman	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hammedatha	1
the	1
Agagite,	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
provinces:	1
8:6	1
For	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
endure	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
my	1
people?	1
or	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
endure	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
my	1
kindred?	1
	1
8:7	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
said	1
unto	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen	1
and	1
to	1
Mordecai	1
the	1
Jew,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
Esther	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Haman,	1
and	1
him	1
they	1
have	1
hanged	1
upon	1
the	1
gallows,	1
because	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
8:8	1
Write	1
ye	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
Jews,	1
as	1
it	1
liketh	1
you,	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
name,	1
and	1
seal	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
king's	1
ring:	1
for	1
the	1
writing	1
which	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
name,	1
and	1
sealed	1
with	1
the	1
king's	1
ring,	1
may	1
no	1
man	1
reverse.	1
	1
8:9	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
king's	1
scribes	1
called	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
month	1
Sivan,	1
on	1
the	1
three	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
thereof;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Mordecai	1
commanded	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
lieutenants,	1
and	1
the	1
deputies	1
and	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
provinces	1
which	1
are	1
from	1
India	1
unto	1
Ethiopia,	1
an	1
hundred	1
twenty	1
and	1
seven	1
provinces,	1
unto	1
every	1
province	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
thereof,	1
and	1
unto	1
every	1
people	1
after	1
their	1
language,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
writing,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
language.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
in	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus'	1
name,	1
and	1
sealed	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
king's	1
ring,	1
and	1
sent	1
letters	1
by	1
posts	1
on	1
horseback,	1
and	1
riders	1
on	1
mules,	1
camels,	1
and	1
young	1
dromedaries:	1
8:11	1
Wherein	1
the	1
king	1
granted	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
to	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
for	1
their	1
life,	1
to	1
destroy,	1
to	1
slay	1
and	1
to	1
cause	1
to	1
perish,	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
province	1
that	1
would	1
assault	1
them,	1
both	1
little	1
ones	1
and	1
women,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
prey,	1
8:12	1
Upon	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
king	1
Ahasuerus,	1
namely,	1
upon	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
twelfth	1
month,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
month	1
Adar.	1
	1
8:13	1
The	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
writing	1
for	1
a	1
commandment	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
in	1
every	1
province	1
was	1
published	1
unto	1
all	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
should	1
be	1
ready	1
against	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
avenge	1
themselves	1
on	1
their	1
enemies.	1
	1
8:14	1
So	1
the	1
posts	1
that	1
rode	1
upon	1
mules	1
and	1
camels	1
went	1
out,	1
being	1
hastened	1
and	1
pressed	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment.	1
And	1
the	1
decree	1
was	1
given	1
at	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
Mordecai	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
royal	1
apparel	1
of	1
blue	1
and	1
white,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
crown	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
garment	1
of	1
fine	1
linen	1
and	1
purple:	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Shushan	1
rejoiced	1
and	1
was	1
glad.	1
	1
8:16	1
The	1
Jews	1
had	1
light,	1
and	1
gladness,	1
and	1
joy,	1
and	1
honour.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
in	1
every	1
province,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
whithersoever	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
and	1
his	1
decree	1
came,	1
the	1
Jews	1
had	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness,	1
a	1
feast	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
day.	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
became	1
Jews;	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
fell	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
9:1	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
month,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
month	1
Adar,	1
on	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
same,	1
when	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
and	1
his	1
decree	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
execution,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
hoped	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
them,	1
(though	1
it	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
contrary,	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
had	1
rule	1
over	1
them	1
that	1
hated	1
them;)	1
9:2	1
The	1
Jews	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
in	1
their	1
cities	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus,	1
to	1
lay	1
hand	1
on	1
such	1
as	1
sought	1
their	1
hurt:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
withstand	1
them;	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
them	1
fell	1
upon	1
all	1
people.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
and	1
the	1
lieutenants,	1
and	1
the	1
deputies,	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
helped	1
the	1
Jews;	1
because	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
Mordecai	1
fell	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
9:4	1
For	1
Mordecai	1
was	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
his	1
fame	1
went	1
out	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
provinces:	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
Mordecai	1
waxed	1
greater	1
and	1
greater.	1
	1
9:5	1
Thus	1
the	1
Jews	1
smote	1
all	1
their	1
enemies	1
with	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
slaughter,	1
and	1
destruction,	1
and	1
did	1
what	1
they	1
would	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
hated	1
them.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
in	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace	1
the	1
Jews	1
slew	1
and	1
destroyed	1
five	1
hundred	1
men.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
Parshandatha,	1
and	1
Dalphon,	1
and	1
Aspatha,	1
9:8	1
And	1
Poratha,	1
and	1
Adalia,	1
and	1
Aridatha,	1
9:9	1
And	1
Parmashta,	1
and	1
Arisai,	1
and	1
Aridai,	1
and	1
Vajezatha,	1
9:10	1
The	1
ten	1
sons	1
of	1
Haman	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hammedatha,	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
slew	1
they;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
spoil	1
laid	1
they	1
not	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
9:11	1
On	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
in	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace	1
was	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen,	1
The	1
Jews	1
have	1
slain	1
and	1
destroyed	1
five	1
hundred	1
men	1
in	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
the	1
ten	1
sons	1
of	1
Haman;	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
provinces?	1
now	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
petition?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
granted	1
thee:	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
request	1
further?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
9:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Esther,	1
If	1
it	1
please	1
the	1
king,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
granted	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Shushan	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
morrow	1
also	1
according	1
unto	1
this	1
day's	1
decree,	1
and	1
let	1
Haman's	1
ten	1
sons	1
be	1
hanged	1
upon	1
the	1
gallows.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
it	1
so	1
to	1
be	1
done:	1
and	1
the	1
decree	1
was	1
given	1
at	1
Shushan;	1
and	1
they	1
hanged	1
Haman's	1
ten	1
sons.	1
	1
9:15	1
For	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Shushan	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Adar,	1
and	1
slew	1
three	1
hundred	1
men	1
at	1
Shushan;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
prey	1
they	1
laid	1
not	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
9:16	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
Jews	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
provinces	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
stood	1
for	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
had	1
rest	1
from	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
slew	1
of	1
their	1
foes	1
seventy	1
and	1
five	1
thousand,	1
but	1
they	1
laid	1
not	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
prey,	1
9:17	1
On	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Adar;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
rested	1
they,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
feasting	1
and	1
gladness.	1
	1
9:18	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
Shushan	1
assembled	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
day	1
thereof,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
thereof;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
they	1
rested,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
feasting	1
and	1
gladness.	1
	1
9:19	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
the	1
villages,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
unwalled	1
towns,	1
made	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Adar	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
gladness	1
and	1
feasting,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
day,	1
and	1
of	1
sending	1
portions	1
one	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
Mordecai	1
wrote	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
sent	1
letters	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus,	1
both	1
nigh	1
and	1
far,	1
9:21	1
To	1
stablish	1
this	1
among	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Adar,	1
and	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
same,	1
yearly,	1
9:22	1
As	1
the	1
days	1
wherein	1
the	1
Jews	1
rested	1
from	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
the	1
month	1
which	1
was	1
turned	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
sorrow	1
to	1
joy,	1
and	1
from	1
mourning	1
into	1
a	1
good	1
day:	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
them	1
days	1
of	1
feasting	1
and	1
joy,	1
and	1
of	1
sending	1
portions	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
gifts	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
the	1
Jews	1
undertook	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
begun,	1
and	1
as	1
Mordecai	1
had	1
written	1
unto	1
them;	1
9:24	1
Because	1
Haman	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hammedatha,	1
the	1
Agagite,	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Jews,	1
had	1
devised	1
against	1
the	1
Jews	1
to	1
destroy	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
cast	1
Pur,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
lot,	1
to	1
consume	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
them;	1
9:25	1
But	1
when	1
Esther	1
came	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
he	1
commanded	1
by	1
letters	1
that	1
his	1
wicked	1
device,	1
which	1
he	1
devised	1
against	1
the	1
Jews,	1
should	1
return	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
should	1
be	1
hanged	1
on	1
the	1
gallows.	1
	1
9:26	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
called	1
these	1
days	1
Purim	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Pur.	1
	1
Therefore	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
letter,	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter,	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
unto	1
them,	1
9:27	1
The	1
Jews	1
ordained,	1
and	1
took	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
seed,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
joined	1
themselves	1
unto	1
them,	1
so	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
fail,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
keep	1
these	1
two	1
days	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
writing,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
appointed	1
time	1
every	1
year;	1
9:28	1
And	1
that	1
these	1
days	1
should	1
be	1
remembered	1
and	1
kept	1
throughout	1
every	1
generation,	1
every	1
family,	1
every	1
province,	1
and	1
every	1
city;	1
and	1
that	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
Purim	1
should	1
not	1
fail	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Jews,	1
nor	1
the	1
memorial	1
of	1
them	1
perish	1
from	1
their	1
seed.	1
	1
9:29	1
Then	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Abihail,	1
and	1
Mordecai	1
the	1
Jew,	1
wrote	1
with	1
all	1
authority,	1
to	1
confirm	1
this	1
second	1
letter	1
of	1
Purim.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
letters	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
Jews,	1
to	1
the	1
hundred	1
twenty	1
and	1
seven	1
provinces	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Ahasuerus,	1
with	1
words	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
truth,	1
9:31	1
To	1
confirm	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
Purim	1
in	1
their	1
times	1
appointed,	1
according	1
as	1
Mordecai	1
the	1
Jew	1
and	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen	1
had	1
enjoined	1
them,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
decreed	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
seed,	1
the	1
matters	1
of	1
the	1
fastings	1
and	1
their	1
cry.	1
	1
9:32	1
And	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
Esther	1
confirmed	1
these	1
matters	1
of	1
Purim;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
laid	1
a	1
tribute	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
might,	1
and	1
the	1
declaration	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Mordecai,	1
whereunto	1
the	1
king	1
advanced	1
him,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Media	1
and	1
Persia?	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
Mordecai	1
the	1
Jew	1
was	1
next	1
unto	1
king	1
Ahasuerus,	1
and	1
great	1
among	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
accepted	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
brethren,	1
seeking	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
speaking	1
peace	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
seed.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Job	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Uz,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Job;	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
was	1
perfect	1
and	1
upright,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feared	1
God,	1
and	1
eschewed	1
evil.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
him	1
seven	1
sons	1
and	1
three	1
daughters.	1
	1
1:3	1
His	1
substance	1
also	1
was	1
seven	1
thousand	1
sheep,	1
and	1
three	1
thousand	1
camels,	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
she	1
asses,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
household;	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
his	1
sons	1
went	1
and	1
feasted	1
in	1
their	1
houses,	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
day;	1
and	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
their	1
three	1
sisters	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
feasting	1
were	1
gone	1
about,	1
that	1
Job	1
sent	1
and	1
sanctified	1
them,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
all:	1
for	1
Job	1
said,	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
my	1
sons	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
cursed	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
Thus	1
did	1
Job	1
continually.	1
	1
1:6	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
present	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Satan	1
came	1
also	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
Whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
Then	1
Satan	1
answered	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
From	1
going	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
from	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
considered	1
my	1
servant	1
Job,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
a	1
perfect	1
and	1
an	1
upright	1
man,	1
one	1
that	1
feareth	1
God,	1
and	1
escheweth	1
evil?	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
Satan	1
answered	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
Doth	1
Job	1
fear	1
God	1
for	1
nought?	1
	1
1:10	1
Hast	1
not	1
thou	1
made	1
an	1
hedge	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
about	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
about	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
on	1
every	1
side?	1
thou	1
hast	1
blessed	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
his	1
substance	1
is	1
increased	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
1:11	1
But	1
put	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
now,	1
and	1
touch	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
curse	1
thee	1
to	1
thy	1
face.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
Behold,	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
power;	1
only	1
upon	1
himself	1
put	1
not	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand.	1
So	1
Satan	1
went	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
were	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
wine	1
in	1
their	1
eldest	1
brother's	1
house:	1
1:14	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
messenger	1
unto	1
Job,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
oxen	1
were	1
plowing,	1
and	1
the	1
asses	1
feeding	1
beside	1
them:	1
1:15	1
And	1
the	1
Sabeans	1
fell	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
away;	1
yea,	1
they	1
have	1
slain	1
the	1
servants	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
am	1
escaped	1
alone	1
to	1
tell	1
thee.	1
	1
1:16	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
speaking,	1
there	1
came	1
also	1
another,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
fire	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
fallen	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
hath	1
burned	1
up	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
consumed	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
am	1
escaped	1
alone	1
to	1
tell	1
thee.	1
	1
1:17	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
speaking,	1
there	1
came	1
also	1
another,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
Chaldeans	1
made	1
out	1
three	1
bands,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
camels,	1
and	1
have	1
carried	1
them	1
away,	1
yea,	1
and	1
slain	1
the	1
servants	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
am	1
escaped	1
alone	1
to	1
tell	1
thee.	1
	1
1:18	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
speaking,	1
there	1
came	1
also	1
another,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
were	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
wine	1
in	1
their	1
eldest	1
brother's	1
house:	1
1:19	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
wind	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
dead;	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
am	1
escaped	1
alone	1
to	1
tell	1
thee.	1
	1
1:20	1
Then	1
Job	1
arose,	1
and	1
rent	1
his	1
mantle,	1
and	1
shaved	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
worshipped,	1
1:21	1
And	1
said,	1
Naked	1
came	1
I	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
and	1
naked	1
shall	1
I	1
return	1
thither:	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
taken	1
away;	1
blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:22	1
In	1
all	1
this	1
Job	1
sinned	1
not,	1
nor	1
charged	1
God	1
foolishly.	1
	1
2:1	1
Again	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
present	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Satan	1
came	1
also	1
among	1
them	1
to	1
present	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
From	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
And	1
Satan	1
answered	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
From	1
going	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
from	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
considered	1
my	1
servant	1
Job,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
a	1
perfect	1
and	1
an	1
upright	1
man,	1
one	1
that	1
feareth	1
God,	1
and	1
escheweth	1
evil?	1
and	1
still	1
he	1
holdeth	1
fast	1
his	1
integrity,	1
although	1
thou	1
movedst	1
me	1
against	1
him,	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
without	1
cause.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
Satan	1
answered	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
Skin	1
for	1
skin,	1
yea,	1
all	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
hath	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
for	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
put	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
now,	1
and	1
touch	1
his	1
bone	1
and	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
curse	1
thee	1
to	1
thy	1
face.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
hand;	1
but	1
save	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
2:7	1
So	1
went	1
Satan	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
smote	1
Job	1
with	1
sore	1
boils	1
from	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
his	1
foot	1
unto	1
his	1
crown.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
a	1
potsherd	1
to	1
scrape	1
himself	1
withal;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
ashes.	1
	1
2:9	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dost	1
thou	1
still	1
retain	1
thine	1
integrity?	1
	1
curse	1
God,	1
and	1
die.	1
	1
2:10	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
speakest	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
foolish	1
women	1
speaketh.	1
What?	1
shall	1
we	1
receive	1
good	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
receive	1
evil?	1
In	1
all	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
Job	1
sin	1
with	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
2:11	1
Now	1
when	1
Job's	1
three	1
friends	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
that	1
was	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
they	1
came	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
place;	1
Eliphaz	1
the	1
Temanite,	1
and	1
Bildad	1
the	1
Shuhite,	1
and	1
Zophar	1
the	1
Naamathite:	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
appointment	1
together	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
mourn	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
comfort	1
him.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
knew	1
him	1
not,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept;	1
and	1
they	1
rent	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
mantle,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
dust	1
upon	1
their	1
heads	1
toward	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:13	1
So	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
seven	1
days	1
and	1
seven	1
nights,	1
and	1
none	1
spake	1
a	1
word	1
unto	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
grief	1
was	1
very	1
great.	1
	1
3:1	1
After	1
this	1
opened	1
Job	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
cursed	1
his	1
day.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
Job	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
3:3	1
Let	1
the	1
day	1
perish	1
wherein	1
I	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
child	1
conceived.	1
	1
3:4	1
Let	1
that	1
day	1
be	1
darkness;	1
let	1
not	1
God	1
regard	1
it	1
from	1
above,	1
neither	1
let	1
the	1
light	1
shine	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
3:5	1
Let	1
darkness	1
and	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
stain	1
it;	1
let	1
a	1
cloud	1
dwell	1
upon	1
it;	1
let	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
terrify	1
it.	1
	1
3:6	1
As	1
for	1
that	1
night,	1
let	1
darkness	1
seize	1
upon	1
it;	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
year,	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
months.	1
	1
3:7	1
Lo,	1
let	1
that	1
night	1
be	1
solitary,	1
let	1
no	1
joyful	1
voice	1
come	1
therein.	1
	1
3:8	1
Let	1
them	1
curse	1
it	1
that	1
curse	1
the	1
day,	1
who	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
their	1
mourning.	1
	1
3:9	1
Let	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
twilight	1
thereof	1
be	1
dark;	1
let	1
it	1
look	1
for	1
light,	1
but	1
have	1
none;	1
neither	1
let	1
it	1
see	1
the	1
dawning	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
3:10	1
Because	1
it	1
shut	1
not	1
up	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
nor	1
hid	1
sorrow	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
3:11	1
Why	1
died	1
I	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
womb?	1
why	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
ghost	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
belly?	1
	1
3:12	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
knees	1
prevent	1
me?	1
or	1
why	1
the	1
breasts	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
suck?	1
	1
3:13	1
For	1
now	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
lain	1
still	1
and	1
been	1
quiet,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
slept:	1
then	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
at	1
rest,	1
3:14	1
With	1
kings	1
and	1
counsellors	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
build	1
desolate	1
places	1
for	1
themselves;	1
3:15	1
Or	1
with	1
princes	1
that	1
had	1
gold,	1
who	1
filled	1
their	1
houses	1
with	1
silver:	1
3:16	1
Or	1
as	1
an	1
hidden	1
untimely	1
birth	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been;	1
as	1
infants	1
which	1
never	1
saw	1
light.	1
	1
3:17	1
There	1
the	1
wicked	1
cease	1
from	1
troubling;	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
weary	1
be	1
at	1
rest.	1
	1
3:18	1
There	1
the	1
prisoners	1
rest	1
together;	1
they	1
hear	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor.	1
	1
3:19	1
The	1
small	1
and	1
great	1
are	1
there;	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
3:20	1
Wherefore	1
is	1
light	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
misery,	1
and	1
life	1
unto	1
the	1
bitter	1
in	1
soul;	1
3:21	1
Which	1
long	1
for	1
death,	1
but	1
it	1
cometh	1
not;	1
and	1
dig	1
for	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
for	1
hid	1
treasures;	1
3:22	1
Which	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
are	1
glad,	1
when	1
they	1
can	1
find	1
the	1
grave?	1
	1
3:23	1
Why	1
is	1
light	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
way	1
is	1
hid,	1
and	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
hedged	1
in?	1
3:24	1
For	1
my	1
sighing	1
cometh	1
before	1
I	1
eat,	1
and	1
my	1
roarings	1
are	1
poured	1
out	1
like	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
3:25	1
For	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
greatly	1
feared	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
3:26	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
safety,	1
neither	1
had	1
I	1
rest,	1
neither	1
was	1
I	1
quiet;	1
yet	1
trouble	1
came.	1
	1
4:1	1
Then	1
Eliphaz	1
the	1
Temanite	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
4:2	1
If	1
we	1
assay	1
to	1
commune	1
with	1
thee,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
grieved?	1
but	1
who	1
can	1
withhold	1
himself	1
from	1
speaking?	1
	1
4:3	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
instructed	1
many,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
strengthened	1
the	1
weak	1
hands.	1
	1
4:4	1
Thy	1
words	1
have	1
upholden	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
falling,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
strengthened	1
the	1
feeble	1
knees.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
faintest;	1
it	1
toucheth	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
troubled.	1
	1
4:6	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
thy	1
fear,	1
thy	1
confidence,	1
thy	1
hope,	1
and	1
the	1
uprightness	1
of	1
thy	1
ways?	1
	1
4:7	1
Remember,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
who	1
ever	1
perished,	1
being	1
innocent?	1
or	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
righteous	1
cut	1
off?	1
	1
4:8	1
Even	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
they	1
that	1
plow	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
sow	1
wickedness,	1
reap	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
4:9	1
By	1
the	1
blast	1
of	1
God	1
they	1
perish,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
nostrils	1
are	1
they	1
consumed.	1
	1
4:10	1
The	1
roaring	1
of	1
the	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lions,	1
are	1
broken.	1
	1
4:11	1
The	1
old	1
lion	1
perisheth	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
prey,	1
and	1
the	1
stout	1
lion's	1
whelps	1
are	1
scattered	1
abroad.	1
	1
4:12	1
Now	1
a	1
thing	1
was	1
secretly	1
brought	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
mine	1
ear	1
received	1
a	1
little	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:13	1
In	1
thoughts	1
from	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
when	1
deep	1
sleep	1
falleth	1
on	1
men,	1
4:14	1
Fear	1
came	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
trembling,	1
which	1
made	1
all	1
my	1
bones	1
to	1
shake.	1
	1
4:15	1
Then	1
a	1
spirit	1
passed	1
before	1
my	1
face;	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
my	1
flesh	1
stood	1
up:	1
4:16	1
It	1
stood	1
still,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
discern	1
the	1
form	1
thereof:	1
an	1
image	1
was	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
there	1
was	1
silence,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
4:17	1
Shall	1
mortal	1
man	1
be	1
more	1
just	1
than	1
God?	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
more	1
pure	1
than	1
his	1
maker?	1
	1
4:18	1
Behold,	1
he	1
put	1
no	1
trust	1
in	1
his	1
servants;	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
he	1
charged	1
with	1
folly:	1
4:19	1
How	1
much	1
less	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
houses	1
of	1
clay,	1
whose	1
foundation	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
dust,	1
which	1
are	1
crushed	1
before	1
the	1
moth?	1
	1
4:20	1
They	1
are	1
destroyed	1
from	1
morning	1
to	1
evening:	1
they	1
perish	1
for	1
ever	1
without	1
any	1
regarding	1
it.	1
	1
4:21	1
Doth	1
not	1
their	1
excellency	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
them	1
go	1
away?	1
they	1
die,	1
even	1
without	1
wisdom.	1
	1
5:1	1
Call	1
now,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
that	1
will	1
answer	1
thee;	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
wilt	1
thou	1
turn?	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
wrath	1
killeth	1
the	1
foolish	1
man,	1
and	1
envy	1
slayeth	1
the	1
silly	1
one.	1
	1
5:3	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
foolish	1
taking	1
root:	1
but	1
suddenly	1
I	1
cursed	1
his	1
habitation.	1
	1
5:4	1
His	1
children	1
are	1
far	1
from	1
safety,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
crushed	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
to	1
deliver	1
them.	1
	1
5:5	1
Whose	1
harvest	1
the	1
hungry	1
eateth	1
up,	1
and	1
taketh	1
it	1
even	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thorns,	1
and	1
the	1
robber	1
swalloweth	1
up	1
their	1
substance.	1
	1
5:6	1
Although	1
affliction	1
cometh	1
not	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
neither	1
doth	1
trouble	1
spring	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground;	1
5:7	1
Yet	1
man	1
is	1
born	1
unto	1
trouble,	1
as	1
the	1
sparks	1
fly	1
upward.	1
	1
5:8	1
I	1
would	1
seek	1
unto	1
God,	1
and	1
unto	1
God	1
would	1
I	1
commit	1
my	1
cause:	1
5:9	1
Which	1
doeth	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
unsearchable;	1
marvellous	1
things	1
without	1
number:	1
5:10	1
Who	1
giveth	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
sendeth	1
waters	1
upon	1
the	1
fields:	1
5:11	1
To	1
set	1
up	1
on	1
high	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
low;	1
that	1
those	1
which	1
mourn	1
may	1
be	1
exalted	1
to	1
safety.	1
	1
5:12	1
He	1
disappointeth	1
the	1
devices	1
of	1
the	1
crafty,	1
so	1
that	1
their	1
hands	1
cannot	1
perform	1
their	1
enterprise.	1
	1
5:13	1
He	1
taketh	1
the	1
wise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
craftiness:	1
and	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
froward	1
is	1
carried	1
headlong.	1
	1
5:14	1
They	1
meet	1
with	1
darkness	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time,	1
and	1
grope	1
in	1
the	1
noonday	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
he	1
saveth	1
the	1
poor	1
from	1
the	1
sword,	1
from	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
5:16	1
So	1
the	1
poor	1
hath	1
hope,	1
and	1
iniquity	1
stoppeth	1
her	1
mouth.	1
	1
5:17	1
Behold,	1
happy	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
God	1
correcteth:	1
therefore	1
despise	1
not	1
thou	1
the	1
chastening	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty:	1
5:18	1
For	1
he	1
maketh	1
sore,	1
and	1
bindeth	1
up:	1
he	1
woundeth,	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
make	1
whole.	1
	1
5:19	1
He	1
shall	1
deliver	1
thee	1
in	1
six	1
troubles:	1
yea,	1
in	1
seven	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
evil	1
touch	1
thee.	1
	1
5:20	1
In	1
famine	1
he	1
shall	1
redeem	1
thee	1
from	1
death:	1
and	1
in	1
war	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
5:21	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
scourge	1
of	1
the	1
tongue:	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
destruction	1
when	1
it	1
cometh.	1
	1
5:22	1
At	1
destruction	1
and	1
famine	1
thou	1
shalt	1
laugh:	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:23	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
in	1
league	1
with	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
thy	1
tabernacle	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
peace;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
visit	1
thy	1
habitation,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
sin.	1
	1
5:25	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
also	1
that	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
great,	1
and	1
thine	1
offspring	1
as	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:26	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
to	1
thy	1
grave	1
in	1
a	1
full	1
age,	1
like	1
as	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
corn	1
cometh	1
in	1
in	1
his	1
season.	1
	1
5:27	1
Lo	1
this,	1
we	1
have	1
searched	1
it,	1
so	1
it	1
is;	1
hear	1
it,	1
and	1
know	1
thou	1
it	1
for	1
thy	1
good.	1
	1
6:1	1
But	1
Job	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
6:2	1
Oh	1
that	1
my	1
grief	1
were	1
throughly	1
weighed,	1
and	1
my	1
calamity	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
balances	1
together!	1
	1
6:3	1
For	1
now	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
heavier	1
than	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
therefore	1
my	1
words	1
are	1
swallowed	1
up.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
the	1
arrows	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty	1
are	1
within	1
me,	1
the	1
poison	1
whereof	1
drinketh	1
up	1
my	1
spirit:	1
the	1
terrors	1
of	1
God	1
do	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
6:5	1
Doth	1
the	1
wild	1
ass	1
bray	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
grass?	1
or	1
loweth	1
the	1
ox	1
over	1
his	1
fodder?	1
	1
6:6	1
Can	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
unsavoury	1
be	1
eaten	1
without	1
salt?	1
or	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
taste	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
of	1
an	1
egg?	1
	1
6:7	1
The	1
things	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
refused	1
to	1
touch	1
are	1
as	1
my	1
sorrowful	1
meat.	1
	1
6:8	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
my	1
request;	1
and	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
grant	1
me	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
long	1
for!	1
	1
6:9	1
Even	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
please	1
God	1
to	1
destroy	1
me;	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
loose	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
cut	1
me	1
off!	1
	1
6:10	1
Then	1
should	1
I	1
yet	1
have	1
comfort;	1
yea,	1
I	1
would	1
harden	1
myself	1
in	1
sorrow:	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
spare;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
concealed	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One.	1
	1
6:11	1
What	1
is	1
my	1
strength,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
hope?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
mine	1
end,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
prolong	1
my	1
life?	1
	1
6:12	1
Is	1
my	1
strength	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
stones?	1
or	1
is	1
my	1
flesh	1
of	1
brass?	1
	1
6:13	1
Is	1
not	1
my	1
help	1
in	1
me?	1
and	1
is	1
wisdom	1
driven	1
quite	1
from	1
me?	1
	1
6:14	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
afflicted	1
pity	1
should	1
be	1
shewed	1
from	1
his	1
friend;	1
but	1
he	1
forsaketh	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty.	1
	1
6:15	1
My	1
brethren	1
have	1
dealt	1
deceitfully	1
as	1
a	1
brook,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
brooks	1
they	1
pass	1
away;	1
6:16	1
Which	1
are	1
blackish	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
ice,	1
and	1
wherein	1
the	1
snow	1
is	1
hid:	1
6:17	1
What	1
time	1
they	1
wax	1
warm,	1
they	1
vanish:	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
hot,	1
they	1
are	1
consumed	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
place.	1
	1
6:18	1
The	1
paths	1
of	1
their	1
way	1
are	1
turned	1
aside;	1
they	1
go	1
to	1
nothing,	1
and	1
perish.	1
	1
6:19	1
The	1
troops	1
of	1
Tema	1
looked,	1
the	1
companies	1
of	1
Sheba	1
waited	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
6:20	1
They	1
were	1
confounded	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
hoped;	1
they	1
came	1
thither,	1
and	1
were	1
ashamed.	1
	1
6:21	1
For	1
now	1
ye	1
are	1
nothing;	1
ye	1
see	1
my	1
casting	1
down,	1
and	1
are	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:22	1
Did	1
I	1
say,	1
Bring	1
unto	1
me?	1
or,	1
Give	1
a	1
reward	1
for	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
substance?	1
	1
6:23	1
Or,	1
Deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
enemy's	1
hand?	1
or,	1
Redeem	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
mighty?	1
	1
6:24	1
Teach	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hold	1
my	1
tongue:	1
and	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
wherein	1
I	1
have	1
erred.	1
	1
6:25	1
How	1
forcible	1
are	1
right	1
words!	1
but	1
what	1
doth	1
your	1
arguing	1
reprove?	1
6:26	1
Do	1
ye	1
imagine	1
to	1
reprove	1
words,	1
and	1
the	1
speeches	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
desperate,	1
which	1
are	1
as	1
wind?	1
	1
6:27	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
overwhelm	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
ye	1
dig	1
a	1
pit	1
for	1
your	1
friend.	1
	1
6:28	1
Now	1
therefore	1
be	1
content,	1
look	1
upon	1
me;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
lie.	1
	1
6:29	1
Return,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
iniquity;	1
yea,	1
return	1
again,	1
my	1
righteousness	1
is	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
6:30	1
Is	1
there	1
iniquity	1
in	1
my	1
tongue?	1
cannot	1
my	1
taste	1
discern	1
perverse	1
things?	1
	1
7:1	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
an	1
appointed	1
time	1
to	1
man	1
upon	1
earth?	1
are	1
not	1
his	1
days	1
also	1
like	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
an	1
hireling?	1
	1
7:2	1
As	1
a	1
servant	1
earnestly	1
desireth	1
the	1
shadow,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
hireling	1
looketh	1
for	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
his	1
work:	1
7:3	1
So	1
am	1
I	1
made	1
to	1
possess	1
months	1
of	1
vanity,	1
and	1
wearisome	1
nights	1
are	1
appointed	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
7:4	1
When	1
I	1
lie	1
down,	1
I	1
say,	1
When	1
shall	1
I	1
arise,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
be	1
gone?	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
tossings	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
unto	1
the	1
dawning	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
7:5	1
My	1
flesh	1
is	1
clothed	1
with	1
worms	1
and	1
clods	1
of	1
dust;	1
my	1
skin	1
is	1
broken,	1
and	1
become	1
loathsome.	1
	1
7:6	1
My	1
days	1
are	1
swifter	1
than	1
a	1
weaver's	1
shuttle,	1
and	1
are	1
spent	1
without	1
hope.	1
	1
7:7	1
O	1
remember	1
that	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
wind:	1
mine	1
eye	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
see	1
good.	1
	1
7:8	1
The	1
eye	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
seen	1
me	1
shall	1
see	1
me	1
no	1
more:	1
thine	1
eyes	1
are	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
7:9	1
As	1
the	1
cloud	1
is	1
consumed	1
and	1
vanisheth	1
away:	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
7:10	1
He	1
shall	1
return	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
neither	1
shall	1
his	1
place	1
know	1
him	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
7:11	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
refrain	1
my	1
mouth;	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
my	1
spirit;	1
I	1
will	1
complain	1
in	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
7:12	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
sea,	1
or	1
a	1
whale,	1
that	1
thou	1
settest	1
a	1
watch	1
over	1
me?	1
	1
7:13	1
When	1
I	1
say,	1
My	1
bed	1
shall	1
comfort	1
me,	1
my	1
couch	1
shall	1
ease	1
my	1
complaints;	1
7:14	1
Then	1
thou	1
scarest	1
me	1
with	1
dreams,	1
and	1
terrifiest	1
me	1
through	1
visions:	1
7:15	1
So	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
chooseth	1
strangling,	1
and	1
death	1
rather	1
than	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
loathe	1
it;	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
live	1
alway:	1
let	1
me	1
alone;	1
for	1
my	1
days	1
are	1
vanity.	1
	1
7:17	1
What	1
is	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
magnify	1
him?	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
upon	1
him?	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
visit	1
him	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
try	1
him	1
every	1
moment?	1
	1
7:19	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
me,	1
nor	1
let	1
me	1
alone	1
till	1
I	1
swallow	1
down	1
my	1
spittle?	1
	1
7:20	1
I	1
have	1
sinned;	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
preserver	1
of	1
men?	1
	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
set	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
mark	1
against	1
thee,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
myself?	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
pardon	1
my	1
transgression,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
iniquity?	1
for	1
now	1
shall	1
I	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
dust;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
seek	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be.	1
	1
8:1	1
Then	1
answered	1
Bildad	1
the	1
Shuhite,	1
and	1
said,	1
8:2	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
speak	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
strong	1
wind?	1
	1
8:3	1
Doth	1
God	1
pervert	1
judgment?	1
or	1
doth	1
the	1
Almighty	1
pervert	1
justice?	1
	1
8:4	1
If	1
thy	1
children	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
have	1
cast	1
them	1
away	1
for	1
their	1
transgression;	1
8:5	1
If	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
seek	1
unto	1
God	1
betimes,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
supplication	1
to	1
the	1
Almighty;	1
8:6	1
If	1
thou	1
wert	1
pure	1
and	1
upright;	1
surely	1
now	1
he	1
would	1
awake	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
prosperous.	1
	1
8:7	1
Though	1
thy	1
beginning	1
was	1
small,	1
yet	1
thy	1
latter	1
end	1
should	1
greatly	1
increase.	1
	1
8:8	1
For	1
enquire,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
age,	1
and	1
prepare	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
search	1
of	1
their	1
fathers:	1
8:9	1
(For	1
we	1
are	1
but	1
of	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
know	1
nothing,	1
because	1
our	1
days	1
upon	1
earth	1
are	1
a	1
shadow:)	1
8:10	1
Shall	1
not	1
they	1
teach	1
thee,	1
and	1
tell	1
thee,	1
and	1
utter	1
words	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
heart?	1
	1
8:11	1
Can	1
the	1
rush	1
grow	1
up	1
without	1
mire?	1
can	1
the	1
flag	1
grow	1
without	1
water?	1
	1
8:12	1
Whilst	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
greenness,	1
and	1
not	1
cut	1
down,	1
it	1
withereth	1
before	1
any	1
other	1
herb.	1
	1
8:13	1
So	1
are	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
forget	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
hypocrite's	1
hope	1
shall	1
perish:	1
8:14	1
Whose	1
hope	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
whose	1
trust	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
spider's	1
web.	1
	1
8:15	1
He	1
shall	1
lean	1
upon	1
his	1
house,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
he	1
shall	1
hold	1
it	1
fast,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
endure.	1
	1
8:16	1
He	1
is	1
green	1
before	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
his	1
branch	1
shooteth	1
forth	1
in	1
his	1
garden.	1
	1
8:17	1
His	1
roots	1
are	1
wrapped	1
about	1
the	1
heap,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
stones.	1
	1
8:18	1
If	1
he	1
destroy	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
place,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
deny	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
thee.	1
	1
8:19	1
Behold,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
others	1
grow.	1
	1
8:20	1
Behold,	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
cast	1
away	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
help	1
the	1
evil	1
doers:	1
8:21	1
Till	1
he	1
fill	1
thy	1
mouth	1
with	1
laughing,	1
and	1
thy	1
lips	1
with	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
8:22	1
They	1
that	1
hate	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
shame;	1
and	1
the	1
dwelling	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
nought.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
Job	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
9:2	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
of	1
a	1
truth:	1
but	1
how	1
should	1
man	1
be	1
just	1
with	1
God?	1
	1
9:3	1
If	1
he	1
will	1
contend	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
cannot	1
answer	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
thousand.	1
	1
9:4	1
He	1
is	1
wise	1
in	1
heart,	1
and	1
mighty	1
in	1
strength:	1
who	1
hath	1
hardened	1
himself	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
hath	1
prospered?	1
	1
9:5	1
Which	1
removeth	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
they	1
know	1
not:	1
which	1
overturneth	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
anger.	1
	1
9:6	1
Which	1
shaketh	1
the	1
earth	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
pillars	1
thereof	1
tremble.	1
	1
9:7	1
Which	1
commandeth	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
it	1
riseth	1
not;	1
and	1
sealeth	1
up	1
the	1
stars.	1
	1
9:8	1
Which	1
alone	1
spreadeth	1
out	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
treadeth	1
upon	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
9:9	1
Which	1
maketh	1
Arcturus,	1
Orion,	1
and	1
Pleiades,	1
and	1
the	1
chambers	1
of	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
9:10	1
Which	1
doeth	1
great	1
things	1
past	1
finding	1
out;	1
yea,	1
and	1
wonders	1
without	1
number.	1
	1
9:11	1
Lo,	1
he	1
goeth	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
not:	1
he	1
passeth	1
on	1
also,	1
but	1
I	1
perceive	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
9:12	1
Behold,	1
he	1
taketh	1
away,	1
who	1
can	1
hinder	1
him?	1
who	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
doest	1
thou?	1
	1
9:13	1
If	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
withdraw	1
his	1
anger,	1
the	1
proud	1
helpers	1
do	1
stoop	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
9:14	1
How	1
much	1
less	1
shall	1
I	1
answer	1
him,	1
and	1
choose	1
out	1
my	1
words	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
9:15	1
Whom,	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
righteous,	1
yet	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
answer,	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
make	1
supplication	1
to	1
my	1
judge.	1
	1
9:16	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
called,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
answered	1
me;	1
yet	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
he	1
breaketh	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
tempest,	1
and	1
multiplieth	1
my	1
wounds	1
without	1
cause.	1
	1
9:18	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
breath,	1
but	1
filleth	1
me	1
with	1
bitterness.	1
	1
9:19	1
If	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
strength,	1
lo,	1
he	1
is	1
strong:	1
and	1
if	1
of	1
judgment,	1
who	1
shall	1
set	1
me	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
plead?	1
	1
9:20	1
If	1
I	1
justify	1
myself,	1
mine	1
own	1
mouth	1
shall	1
condemn	1
me:	1
if	1
I	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
perfect,	1
it	1
shall	1
also	1
prove	1
me	1
perverse.	1
	1
9:21	1
Though	1
I	1
were	1
perfect,	1
yet	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
know	1
my	1
soul:	1
I	1
would	1
despise	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
9:22	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
thing,	1
therefore	1
I	1
said	1
it,	1
He	1
destroyeth	1
the	1
perfect	1
and	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
9:23	1
If	1
the	1
scourge	1
slay	1
suddenly,	1
he	1
will	1
laugh	1
at	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
the	1
innocent.	1
	1
9:24	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
he	1
covereth	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
thereof;	1
if	1
not,	1
where,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
he?	1
	1
9:25	1
Now	1
my	1
days	1
are	1
swifter	1
than	1
a	1
post:	1
they	1
flee	1
away,	1
they	1
see	1
no	1
good.	1
	1
9:26	1
They	1
are	1
passed	1
away	1
as	1
the	1
swift	1
ships:	1
as	1
the	1
eagle	1
that	1
hasteth	1
to	1
the	1
prey.	1
	1
9:27	1
If	1
I	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
forget	1
my	1
complaint,	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
off	1
my	1
heaviness,	1
and	1
comfort	1
myself:	1
9:28	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
sorrows,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
hold	1
me	1
innocent.	1
	1
9:29	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
wicked,	1
why	1
then	1
labour	1
I	1
in	1
vain?	1
	1
9:30	1
If	1
I	1
wash	1
myself	1
with	1
snow	1
water,	1
and	1
make	1
my	1
hands	1
never	1
so	1
clean;	1
9:31	1
Yet	1
shalt	1
thou	1
plunge	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
ditch,	1
and	1
mine	1
own	1
clothes	1
shall	1
abhor	1
me.	1
	1
9:32	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
answer	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
come	1
together	1
in	1
judgment.	1
	1
9:33	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
daysman	1
betwixt	1
us,	1
that	1
might	1
lay	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
us	1
both.	1
	1
9:34	1
Let	1
him	1
take	1
his	1
rod	1
away	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
his	1
fear	1
terrify	1
me:	1
9:35	1
Then	1
would	1
I	1
speak,	1
and	1
not	1
fear	1
him;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
10:1	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
weary	1
of	1
my	1
life;	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
my	1
complaint	1
upon	1
myself;	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
10:2	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
God,	1
Do	1
not	1
condemn	1
me;	1
shew	1
me	1
wherefore	1
thou	1
contendest	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
10:3	1
Is	1
it	1
good	1
unto	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
oppress,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
despise	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hands,	1
and	1
shine	1
upon	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
wicked?	1
	1
10:4	1
Hast	1
thou	1
eyes	1
of	1
flesh?	1
or	1
seest	1
thou	1
as	1
man	1
seeth?	1
	1
10:5	1
Are	1
thy	1
days	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
man?	1
are	1
thy	1
years	1
as	1
man's	1
days,	1
10:6	1
That	1
thou	1
enquirest	1
after	1
mine	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
searchest	1
after	1
my	1
sin?	1
	1
10:7	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
wicked;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
can	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
10:8	1
Thine	1
hands	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
and	1
fashioned	1
me	1
together	1
round	1
about;	1
yet	1
thou	1
dost	1
destroy	1
me.	1
	1
10:9	1
Remember,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
clay;	1
and	1
wilt	1
thou	1
bring	1
me	1
into	1
dust	1
again?	1
	1
10:10	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
poured	1
me	1
out	1
as	1
milk,	1
and	1
curdled	1
me	1
like	1
cheese?	1
	1
10:11	1
Thou	1
hast	1
clothed	1
me	1
with	1
skin	1
and	1
flesh,	1
and	1
hast	1
fenced	1
me	1
with	1
bones	1
and	1
sinews.	1
	1
10:12	1
Thou	1
hast	1
granted	1
me	1
life	1
and	1
favour,	1
and	1
thy	1
visitation	1
hath	1
preserved	1
my	1
spirit.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
hast	1
thou	1
hid	1
in	1
thine	1
heart:	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
10:14	1
If	1
I	1
sin,	1
then	1
thou	1
markest	1
me,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
acquit	1
me	1
from	1
mine	1
iniquity.	1
	1
10:15	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
wicked,	1
woe	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
righteous,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
my	1
head.	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
confusion;	1
therefore	1
see	1
thou	1
mine	1
affliction;	1
10:16	1
For	1
it	1
increaseth.	1
Thou	1
huntest	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
fierce	1
lion:	1
and	1
again	1
thou	1
shewest	1
thyself	1
marvellous	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
10:17	1
Thou	1
renewest	1
thy	1
witnesses	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
increasest	1
thine	1
indignation	1
upon	1
me;	1
changes	1
and	1
war	1
are	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
10:18	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
brought	1
me	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
womb?	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
and	1
no	1
eye	1
had	1
seen	1
me!	1
	1
10:19	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been;	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
carried	1
from	1
the	1
womb	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
10:20	1
Are	1
not	1
my	1
days	1
few?	1
cease	1
then,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
alone,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
comfort	1
a	1
little,	1
10:21	1
Before	1
I	1
go	1
whence	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
return,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death;	1
10:22	1
A	1
land	1
of	1
darkness,	1
as	1
darkness	1
itself;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
without	1
any	1
order,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
light	1
is	1
as	1
darkness.	1
	1
11:1	1
Then	1
answered	1
Zophar	1
the	1
Naamathite,	1
and	1
said,	1
11:2	1
Should	1
not	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
words	1
be	1
answered?	1
and	1
should	1
a	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
talk	1
be	1
justified?	1
	1
11:3	1
Should	1
thy	1
lies	1
make	1
men	1
hold	1
their	1
peace?	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
mockest,	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
make	1
thee	1
ashamed?	1
	1
11:4	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
My	1
doctrine	1
is	1
pure,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
clean	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
11:5	1
But	1
oh	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
speak,	1
and	1
open	1
his	1
lips	1
against	1
thee;	1
11:6	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
double	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is!	1
Know	1
therefore	1
that	1
God	1
exacteth	1
of	1
thee	1
less	1
than	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
deserveth.	1
	1
11:7	1
Canst	1
thou	1
by	1
searching	1
find	1
out	1
God?	1
canst	1
thou	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
Almighty	1
unto	1
perfection?	1
	1
11:8	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
heaven;	1
what	1
canst	1
thou	1
do?	1
deeper	1
than	1
hell;	1
what	1
canst	1
thou	1
know?	1
	1
11:9	1
The	1
measure	1
thereof	1
is	1
longer	1
than	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
broader	1
than	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
11:10	1
If	1
he	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
shut	1
up,	1
or	1
gather	1
together,	1
then	1
who	1
can	1
hinder	1
him?	1
	1
11:11	1
For	1
he	1
knoweth	1
vain	1
men:	1
he	1
seeth	1
wickedness	1
also;	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
then	1
consider	1
it?	1
	1
11:12	1
For	1
vain	1
men	1
would	1
be	1
wise,	1
though	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
ass's	1
colt.	1
	1
11:13	1
If	1
thou	1
prepare	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hands	1
toward	1
him;	1
11:14	1
If	1
iniquity	1
be	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
put	1
it	1
far	1
away,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
wickedness	1
dwell	1
in	1
thy	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
11:15	1
For	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
face	1
without	1
spot;	1
yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
fear:	1
11:16	1
Because	1
thou	1
shalt	1
forget	1
thy	1
misery,	1
and	1
remember	1
it	1
as	1
waters	1
that	1
pass	1
away:	1
11:17	1
And	1
thine	1
age	1
shall	1
be	1
clearer	1
than	1
the	1
noonday:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shine	1
forth,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
secure,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
hope;	1
yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dig	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
thy	1
rest	1
in	1
safety.	1
	1
11:19	1
Also	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
afraid;	1
yea,	1
many	1
shall	1
make	1
suit	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
11:20	1
But	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
fail,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
escape,	1
and	1
their	1
hope	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
giving	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
Job	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
12:2	1
No	1
doubt	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
wisdom	1
shall	1
die	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
12:3	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
understanding	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
you;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
inferior	1
to	1
you:	1
yea,	1
who	1
knoweth	1
not	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
these?	1
	1
12:4	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
one	1
mocked	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
who	1
calleth	1
upon	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
answereth	1
him:	1
the	1
just	1
upright	1
man	1
is	1
laughed	1
to	1
scorn.	1
	1
12:5	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
slip	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
lamp	1
despised	1
in	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
ease.	1
	1
12:6	1
The	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
robbers	1
prosper,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
provoke	1
God	1
are	1
secure;	1
into	1
whose	1
hand	1
God	1
bringeth	1
abundantly.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
ask	1
now	1
the	1
beasts,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
teach	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee:	1
12:8	1
Or	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
teach	1
thee:	1
and	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
shall	1
declare	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
12:9	1
Who	1
knoweth	1
not	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
wrought	1
this?	1
	1
12:10	1
In	1
whose	1
hand	1
is	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
every	1
living	1
thing,	1
and	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
all	1
mankind.	1
	1
12:11	1
Doth	1
not	1
the	1
ear	1
try	1
words?	1
and	1
the	1
mouth	1
taste	1
his	1
meat?	1
	1
12:12	1
With	1
the	1
ancient	1
is	1
wisdom;	1
and	1
in	1
length	1
of	1
days	1
understanding.	1
	1
12:13	1
With	1
him	1
is	1
wisdom	1
and	1
strength,	1
he	1
hath	1
counsel	1
and	1
understanding.	1
	1
12:14	1
Behold,	1
he	1
breaketh	1
down,	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
built	1
again:	1
he	1
shutteth	1
up	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
opening.	1
	1
12:15	1
Behold,	1
he	1
withholdeth	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
they	1
dry	1
up:	1
also	1
he	1
sendeth	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
they	1
overturn	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:16	1
With	1
him	1
is	1
strength	1
and	1
wisdom:	1
the	1
deceived	1
and	1
the	1
deceiver	1
are	1
his.	1
	1
12:17	1
He	1
leadeth	1
counsellors	1
away	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
maketh	1
the	1
judges	1
fools.	1
	1
12:18	1
He	1
looseth	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
girdeth	1
their	1
loins	1
with	1
a	1
girdle.	1
	1
12:19	1
He	1
leadeth	1
princes	1
away	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
overthroweth	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
12:20	1
He	1
removeth	1
away	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
the	1
trusty,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
aged.	1
	1
12:21	1
He	1
poureth	1
contempt	1
upon	1
princes,	1
and	1
weakeneth	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
12:22	1
He	1
discovereth	1
deep	1
things	1
out	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
out	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
12:23	1
He	1
increaseth	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
destroyeth	1
them:	1
he	1
enlargeth	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
straiteneth	1
them	1
again.	1
	1
12:24	1
He	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
causeth	1
them	1
to	1
wander	1
in	1
a	1
wilderness	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
way.	1
	1
12:25	1
They	1
grope	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
without	1
light,	1
and	1
he	1
maketh	1
them	1
to	1
stagger	1
like	1
a	1
drunken	1
man.	1
	1
13:1	1
Lo,	1
mine	1
eye	1
hath	1
seen	1
all	1
this,	1
mine	1
ear	1
hath	1
heard	1
and	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
13:2	1
What	1
ye	1
know,	1
the	1
same	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
also:	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
inferior	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
13:3	1
Surely	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
and	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
13:4	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
forgers	1
of	1
lies,	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
physicians	1
of	1
no	1
value.	1
	1
13:5	1
O	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
altogether	1
hold	1
your	1
peace!	1
and	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
your	1
wisdom.	1
	1
13:6	1
Hear	1
now	1
my	1
reasoning,	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
pleadings	1
of	1
my	1
lips.	1
	1
13:7	1
Will	1
ye	1
speak	1
wickedly	1
for	1
God?	1
and	1
talk	1
deceitfully	1
for	1
him?	1
13:8	1
Will	1
ye	1
accept	1
his	1
person?	1
will	1
ye	1
contend	1
for	1
God?	1
	1
13:9	1
Is	1
it	1
good	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
search	1
you	1
out?	1
or	1
as	1
one	1
man	1
mocketh	1
another,	1
do	1
ye	1
so	1
mock	1
him?	1
	1
13:10	1
He	1
will	1
surely	1
reprove	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
secretly	1
accept	1
persons.	1
	1
13:11	1
Shall	1
not	1
his	1
excellency	1
make	1
you	1
afraid?	1
and	1
his	1
dread	1
fall	1
upon	1
you?	1
	1
13:12	1
Your	1
remembrances	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
ashes,	1
your	1
bodies	1
to	1
bodies	1
of	1
clay.	1
	1
13:13	1
Hold	1
your	1
peace,	1
let	1
me	1
alone,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
speak,	1
and	1
let	1
come	1
on	1
me	1
what	1
will.	1
	1
13:14	1
Wherefore	1
do	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
flesh	1
in	1
my	1
teeth,	1
and	1
put	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
mine	1
hand?	1
	1
13:15	1
Though	1
he	1
slay	1
me,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
him:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
maintain	1
mine	1
own	1
ways	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
13:16	1
He	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
salvation:	1
for	1
an	1
hypocrite	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
13:17	1
Hear	1
diligently	1
my	1
speech,	1
and	1
my	1
declaration	1
with	1
your	1
ears.	1
	1
13:18	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
ordered	1
my	1
cause;	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
13:19	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
me?	1
for	1
now,	1
if	1
I	1
hold	1
my	1
tongue,	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
13:20	1
Only	1
do	1
not	1
two	1
things	1
unto	1
me:	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
hide	1
myself	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
13:21	1
Withdraw	1
thine	1
hand	1
far	1
from	1
me:	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
dread	1
make	1
me	1
afraid.	1
	1
13:22	1
Then	1
call	1
thou,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer:	1
or	1
let	1
me	1
speak,	1
and	1
answer	1
thou	1
me.	1
	1
13:23	1
How	1
many	1
are	1
mine	1
iniquities	1
and	1
sins?	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
transgression	1
and	1
my	1
sin.	1
	1
13:24	1
Wherefore	1
hidest	1
thou	1
thy	1
face,	1
and	1
holdest	1
me	1
for	1
thine	1
enemy?	1
13:25	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
break	1
a	1
leaf	1
driven	1
to	1
and	1
fro?	1
and	1
wilt	1
thou	1
pursue	1
the	1
dry	1
stubble?	1
	1
13:26	1
For	1
thou	1
writest	1
bitter	1
things	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
makest	1
me	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
13:27	1
Thou	1
puttest	1
my	1
feet	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
stocks,	1
and	1
lookest	1
narrowly	1
unto	1
all	1
my	1
paths;	1
thou	1
settest	1
a	1
print	1
upon	1
the	1
heels	1
of	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
13:28	1
And	1
he,	1
as	1
a	1
rotten	1
thing,	1
consumeth,	1
as	1
a	1
garment	1
that	1
is	1
moth	1
eaten.	1
	1
14:1	1
Man	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
is	1
of	1
few	1
days	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
14:2	1
He	1
cometh	1
forth	1
like	1
a	1
flower,	1
and	1
is	1
cut	1
down:	1
he	1
fleeth	1
also	1
as	1
a	1
shadow,	1
and	1
continueth	1
not.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
doth	1
thou	1
open	1
thine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
such	1
an	1
one,	1
and	1
bringest	1
me	1
into	1
judgment	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
14:4	1
Who	1
can	1
bring	1
a	1
clean	1
thing	1
out	1
of	1
an	1
unclean?	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
14:5	1
Seeing	1
his	1
days	1
are	1
determined,	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
months	1
are	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
hast	1
appointed	1
his	1
bounds	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
pass;	1
14:6	1
Turn	1
from	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
rest,	1
till	1
he	1
shall	1
accomplish,	1
as	1
an	1
hireling,	1
his	1
day.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
tree,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
cut	1
down,	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
sprout	1
again,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
tender	1
branch	1
thereof	1
will	1
not	1
cease.	1
	1
14:8	1
Though	1
the	1
root	1
thereof	1
wax	1
old	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
stock	1
thereof	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
ground;	1
14:9	1
Yet	1
through	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
water	1
it	1
will	1
bud,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
boughs	1
like	1
a	1
plant.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
man	1
dieth,	1
and	1
wasteth	1
away:	1
yea,	1
man	1
giveth	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
he?	1
	1
14:11	1
As	1
the	1
waters	1
fail	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
flood	1
decayeth	1
and	1
drieth	1
up:	1
14:12	1
So	1
man	1
lieth	1
down,	1
and	1
riseth	1
not:	1
till	1
the	1
heavens	1
be	1
no	1
more,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
awake,	1
nor	1
be	1
raised	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sleep.	1
	1
14:13	1
O	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
hide	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
grave,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
keep	1
me	1
secret,	1
until	1
thy	1
wrath	1
be	1
past,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
appoint	1
me	1
a	1
set	1
time,	1
and	1
remember	1
me!	1
	1
14:14	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
die,	1
shall	1
he	1
live	1
again?	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
appointed	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
wait,	1
till	1
my	1
change	1
come.	1
	1
14:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
call,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
thee:	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hands.	1
	1
14:16	1
For	1
now	1
thou	1
numberest	1
my	1
steps:	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
watch	1
over	1
my	1
sin?	1
	1
14:17	1
My	1
transgression	1
is	1
sealed	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
bag,	1
and	1
thou	1
sewest	1
up	1
mine	1
iniquity.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
surely	1
the	1
mountains	1
falling	1
cometh	1
to	1
nought,	1
and	1
the	1
rock	1
is	1
removed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
14:19	1
The	1
waters	1
wear	1
the	1
stones:	1
thou	1
washest	1
away	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
thou	1
destroyest	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
14:20	1
Thou	1
prevailest	1
for	1
ever	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
passeth:	1
thou	1
changest	1
his	1
countenance,	1
and	1
sendest	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
14:21	1
His	1
sons	1
come	1
to	1
honour,	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
it	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
brought	1
low,	1
but	1
he	1
perceiveth	1
it	1
not	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
14:22	1
But	1
his	1
flesh	1
upon	1
him	1
shall	1
have	1
pain,	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
within	1
him	1
shall	1
mourn.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
answered	1
Eliphaz	1
the	1
Temanite,	1
and	1
said,	1
15:2	1
Should	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
utter	1
vain	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
fill	1
his	1
belly	1
with	1
the	1
east	1
wind?	1
	1
15:3	1
Should	1
he	1
reason	1
with	1
unprofitable	1
talk?	1
or	1
with	1
speeches	1
wherewith	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
good?	1
	1
15:4	1
Yea,	1
thou	1
castest	1
off	1
fear,	1
and	1
restrainest	1
prayer	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
15:5	1
For	1
thy	1
mouth	1
uttereth	1
thine	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
thou	1
choosest	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
crafty.	1
	1
15:6	1
Thine	1
own	1
mouth	1
condemneth	1
thee,	1
and	1
not	1
I:	1
yea,	1
thine	1
own	1
lips	1
testify	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
15:7	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
born?	1
or	1
wast	1
thou	1
made	1
before	1
the	1
hills?	1
	1
15:8	1
Hast	1
thou	1
heard	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
God?	1
and	1
dost	1
thou	1
restrain	1
wisdom	1
to	1
thyself?	1
	1
15:9	1
What	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
not?	1
what	1
understandest	1
thou,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us?	1
	1
15:10	1
With	1
us	1
are	1
both	1
the	1
grayheaded	1
and	1
very	1
aged	1
men,	1
much	1
elder	1
than	1
thy	1
father.	1
	1
15:11	1
Are	1
the	1
consolations	1
of	1
God	1
small	1
with	1
thee?	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
secret	1
thing	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
15:12	1
Why	1
doth	1
thine	1
heart	1
carry	1
thee	1
away?	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
thy	1
eyes	1
wink	1
at,	1
15:13	1
That	1
thou	1
turnest	1
thy	1
spirit	1
against	1
God,	1
and	1
lettest	1
such	1
words	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth?	1
	1
15:14	1
What	1
is	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
clean?	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
righteous?	1
	1
15:15	1
Behold,	1
he	1
putteth	1
no	1
trust	1
in	1
his	1
saints;	1
yea,	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
not	1
clean	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
15:16	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
abominable	1
and	1
filthy	1
is	1
man,	1
which	1
drinketh	1
iniquity	1
like	1
water?	1
	1
15:17	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee,	1
hear	1
me;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
I	1
will	1
declare;	1
15:18	1
Which	1
wise	1
men	1
have	1
told	1
from	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
hid	1
it:	1
15:19	1
Unto	1
whom	1
alone	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
given,	1
and	1
no	1
stranger	1
passed	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
15:20	1
The	1
wicked	1
man	1
travaileth	1
with	1
pain	1
all	1
his	1
days,	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
is	1
hidden	1
to	1
the	1
oppressor.	1
	1
15:21	1
A	1
dreadful	1
sound	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
ears:	1
in	1
prosperity	1
the	1
destroyer	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
15:22	1
He	1
believeth	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
return	1
out	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
waited	1
for	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
15:23	1
He	1
wandereth	1
abroad	1
for	1
bread,	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
it?	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
darkness	1
is	1
ready	1
at	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
15:24	1
Trouble	1
and	1
anguish	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
afraid;	1
they	1
shall	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
king	1
ready	1
to	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
15:25	1
For	1
he	1
stretcheth	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
God,	1
and	1
strengtheneth	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
Almighty.	1
	1
15:26	1
He	1
runneth	1
upon	1
him,	1
even	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
upon	1
the	1
thick	1
bosses	1
of	1
his	1
bucklers:	1
15:27	1
Because	1
he	1
covereth	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
fatness,	1
and	1
maketh	1
collops	1
of	1
fat	1
on	1
his	1
flanks.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
desolate	1
cities,	1
and	1
in	1
houses	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
inhabiteth,	1
which	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
become	1
heaps.	1
	1
15:29	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
rich,	1
neither	1
shall	1
his	1
substance	1
continue,	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
prolong	1
the	1
perfection	1
thereof	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
15:30	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
darkness;	1
the	1
flame	1
shall	1
dry	1
up	1
his	1
branches,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
shall	1
he	1
go	1
away.	1
	1
15:31	1
Let	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
deceived	1
trust	1
in	1
vanity:	1
for	1
vanity	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
recompence.	1
	1
15:32	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
accomplished	1
before	1
his	1
time,	1
and	1
his	1
branch	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
green.	1
	1
15:33	1
He	1
shall	1
shake	1
off	1
his	1
unripe	1
grape	1
as	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
shall	1
cast	1
off	1
his	1
flower	1
as	1
the	1
olive.	1
	1
15:34	1
For	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
hypocrites	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
fire	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
bribery.	1
	1
15:35	1
They	1
conceive	1
mischief,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
vanity,	1
and	1
their	1
belly	1
prepareth	1
deceit.	1
	1
16:1	1
Then	1
Job	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
16:2	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
many	1
such	1
things:	1
miserable	1
comforters	1
are	1
ye	1
all.	1
	1
16:3	1
Shall	1
vain	1
words	1
have	1
an	1
end?	1
or	1
what	1
emboldeneth	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
answerest?	1
	1
16:4	1
I	1
also	1
could	1
speak	1
as	1
ye	1
do:	1
if	1
your	1
soul	1
were	1
in	1
my	1
soul's	1
stead,	1
I	1
could	1
heap	1
up	1
words	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
shake	1
mine	1
head	1
at	1
you.	1
	1
16:5	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
strengthen	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
the	1
moving	1
of	1
my	1
lips	1
should	1
asswage	1
your	1
grief.	1
	1
16:6	1
Though	1
I	1
speak,	1
my	1
grief	1
is	1
not	1
asswaged:	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
forbear,	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
eased?	1
	1
16:7	1
But	1
now	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
weary:	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
desolate	1
all	1
my	1
company.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
wrinkles,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
witness	1
against	1
me:	1
and	1
my	1
leanness	1
rising	1
up	1
in	1
me	1
beareth	1
witness	1
to	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
16:9	1
He	1
teareth	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
wrath,	1
who	1
hateth	1
me:	1
he	1
gnasheth	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
teeth;	1
mine	1
enemy	1
sharpeneth	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
16:10	1
They	1
have	1
gaped	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
mouth;	1
they	1
have	1
smitten	1
me	1
upon	1
the	1
cheek	1
reproachfully;	1
they	1
have	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
16:11	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
ungodly,	1
and	1
turned	1
me	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
16:12	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
ease,	1
but	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
me	1
asunder:	1
he	1
hath	1
also	1
taken	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
neck,	1
and	1
shaken	1
me	1
to	1
pieces,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
up	1
for	1
his	1
mark.	1
	1
16:13	1
His	1
archers	1
compass	1
me	1
round	1
about,	1
he	1
cleaveth	1
my	1
reins	1
asunder,	1
and	1
doth	1
not	1
spare;	1
he	1
poureth	1
out	1
my	1
gall	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
16:14	1
He	1
breaketh	1
me	1
with	1
breach	1
upon	1
breach,	1
he	1
runneth	1
upon	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
giant.	1
	1
16:15	1
I	1
have	1
sewed	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
my	1
skin,	1
and	1
defiled	1
my	1
horn	1
in	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
16:16	1
My	1
face	1
is	1
foul	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
eyelids	1
is	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death;	1
16:17	1
Not	1
for	1
any	1
injustice	1
in	1
mine	1
hands:	1
also	1
my	1
prayer	1
is	1
pure.	1
	1
16:18	1
O	1
earth,	1
cover	1
not	1
thou	1
my	1
blood,	1
and	1
let	1
my	1
cry	1
have	1
no	1
place.	1
	1
16:19	1
Also	1
now,	1
behold,	1
my	1
witness	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
my	1
record	1
is	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
16:20	1
My	1
friends	1
scorn	1
me:	1
but	1
mine	1
eye	1
poureth	1
out	1
tears	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
16:21	1
O	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
plead	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
God,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
pleadeth	1
for	1
his	1
neighbour!	1
	1
16:22	1
When	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
are	1
come,	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
the	1
way	1
whence	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
return.	1
	1
17:1	1
My	1
breath	1
is	1
corrupt,	1
my	1
days	1
are	1
extinct,	1
the	1
graves	1
are	1
ready	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
17:2	1
Are	1
there	1
not	1
mockers	1
with	1
me?	1
and	1
doth	1
not	1
mine	1
eye	1
continue	1
in	1
their	1
provocation?	1
	1
17:3	1
Lay	1
down	1
now,	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
surety	1
with	1
thee;	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
strike	1
hands	1
with	1
me?	1
	1
17:4	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
their	1
heart	1
from	1
understanding:	1
therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
exalt	1
them.	1
	1
17:5	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
flattery	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
even	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
shall	1
fail.	1
	1
17:6	1
He	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
also	1
a	1
byword	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
aforetime	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
tabret.	1
	1
17:7	1
Mine	1
eye	1
also	1
is	1
dim	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
members	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
shadow.	1
	1
17:8	1
Upright	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
astonied	1
at	1
this,	1
and	1
the	1
innocent	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
hypocrite.	1
	1
17:9	1
The	1
righteous	1
also	1
shall	1
hold	1
on	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
clean	1
hands	1
shall	1
be	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger.	1
	1
17:10	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
do	1
ye	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
now:	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
one	1
wise	1
man	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
17:11	1
My	1
days	1
are	1
past,	1
my	1
purposes	1
are	1
broken	1
off,	1
even	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
17:12	1
They	1
change	1
the	1
night	1
into	1
day:	1
the	1
light	1
is	1
short	1
because	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
17:13	1
If	1
I	1
wait,	1
the	1
grave	1
is	1
mine	1
house:	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
17:14	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
corruption,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
father:	1
to	1
the	1
worm,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
mother,	1
and	1
my	1
sister.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
where	1
is	1
now	1
my	1
hope?	1
as	1
for	1
my	1
hope,	1
who	1
shall	1
see	1
it?	1
17:16	1
They	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
when	1
our	1
rest	1
together	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
18:1	1
Then	1
answered	1
Bildad	1
the	1
Shuhite,	1
and	1
said,	1
18:2	1
How	1
long	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
ere	1
ye	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
words?	1
mark,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
we	1
will	1
speak.	1
	1
18:3	1
Wherefore	1
are	1
we	1
counted	1
as	1
beasts,	1
and	1
reputed	1
vile	1
in	1
your	1
sight?	1
	1
18:4	1
He	1
teareth	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
anger:	1
shall	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
forsaken	1
for	1
thee?	1
and	1
shall	1
the	1
rock	1
be	1
removed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place?	1
18:5	1
Yea,	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
spark	1
of	1
his	1
fire	1
shall	1
not	1
shine.	1
	1
18:6	1
The	1
light	1
shall	1
be	1
dark	1
in	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
his	1
candle	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
18:7	1
The	1
steps	1
of	1
his	1
strength	1
shall	1
be	1
straitened,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
counsel	1
shall	1
cast	1
him	1
down.	1
	1
18:8	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
a	1
net	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
feet,	1
and	1
he	1
walketh	1
upon	1
a	1
snare.	1
	1
18:9	1
The	1
gin	1
shall	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
heel,	1
and	1
the	1
robber	1
shall	1
prevail	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
18:10	1
The	1
snare	1
is	1
laid	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
a	1
trap	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
18:11	1
Terrors	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
afraid	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
and	1
shall	1
drive	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
18:12	1
His	1
strength	1
shall	1
be	1
hungerbitten,	1
and	1
destruction	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1
at	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
18:13	1
It	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
skin:	1
even	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
death	1
shall	1
devour	1
his	1
strength.	1
	1
18:14	1
His	1
confidence	1
shall	1
be	1
rooted	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
terrors.	1
	1
18:15	1
It	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
his:	1
brimstone	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
upon	1
his	1
habitation.	1
	1
18:16	1
His	1
roots	1
shall	1
be	1
dried	1
up	1
beneath,	1
and	1
above	1
shall	1
his	1
branch	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
18:17	1
His	1
remembrance	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
name	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
18:18	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
from	1
light	1
into	1
darkness,	1
and	1
chased	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
18:19	1
He	1
shall	1
neither	1
have	1
son	1
nor	1
nephew	1
among	1
his	1
people,	1
nor	1
any	1
remaining	1
in	1
his	1
dwellings.	1
	1
18:20	1
They	1
that	1
come	1
after	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
astonied	1
at	1
his	1
day,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
went	1
before	1
were	1
affrighted.	1
	1
18:21	1
Surely	1
such	1
are	1
the	1
dwellings	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
knoweth	1
not	1
God.	1
	1
19:1	1
Then	1
Job	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
19:2	1
How	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
vex	1
my	1
soul,	1
and	1
break	1
me	1
in	1
pieces	1
with	1
words?	1
	1
19:3	1
These	1
ten	1
times	1
have	1
ye	1
reproached	1
me:	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
ashamed	1
that	1
ye	1
make	1
yourselves	1
strange	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
be	1
it	1
indeed	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
erred,	1
mine	1
error	1
remaineth	1
with	1
myself.	1
	1
19:5	1
If	1
indeed	1
ye	1
will	1
magnify	1
yourselves	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
plead	1
against	1
me	1
my	1
reproach:	1
19:6	1
Know	1
now	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
overthrown	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
compassed	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
net.	1
	1
19:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
cry	1
out	1
of	1
wrong,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
heard:	1
I	1
cry	1
aloud,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
judgment.	1
	1
19:8	1
He	1
hath	1
fenced	1
up	1
my	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
pass,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
darkness	1
in	1
my	1
paths.	1
	1
19:9	1
He	1
hath	1
stripped	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
glory,	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
crown	1
from	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
19:10	1
He	1
hath	1
destroyed	1
me	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
gone:	1
and	1
mine	1
hope	1
hath	1
he	1
removed	1
like	1
a	1
tree.	1
	1
19:11	1
He	1
hath	1
also	1
kindled	1
his	1
wrath	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
counteth	1
me	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
19:12	1
His	1
troops	1
come	1
together,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
their	1
way	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
encamp	1
round	1
about	1
my	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
19:13	1
He	1
hath	1
put	1
my	1
brethren	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
mine	1
acquaintance	1
are	1
verily	1
estranged	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
19:14	1
My	1
kinsfolk	1
have	1
failed,	1
and	1
my	1
familiar	1
friends	1
have	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
	1
19:15	1
They	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
my	1
maids,	1
count	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
stranger:	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
alien	1
in	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
19:16	1
I	1
called	1
my	1
servant,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
answer;	1
I	1
intreated	1
him	1
with	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
19:17	1
My	1
breath	1
is	1
strange	1
to	1
my	1
wife,	1
though	1
I	1
intreated	1
for	1
the	1
children's	1
sake	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
19:18	1
Yea,	1
young	1
children	1
despised	1
me;	1
I	1
arose,	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
19:19	1
All	1
my	1
inward	1
friends	1
abhorred	1
me:	1
and	1
they	1
whom	1
I	1
loved	1
are	1
turned	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
19:20	1
My	1
bone	1
cleaveth	1
to	1
my	1
skin	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
escaped	1
with	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
my	1
teeth.	1
	1
19:21	1
Have	1
pity	1
upon	1
me,	1
have	1
pity	1
upon	1
me,	1
O	1
ye	1
my	1
friends;	1
for	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
touched	1
me.	1
	1
19:22	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
persecute	1
me	1
as	1
God,	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
my	1
flesh?	1
	1
19:23	1
Oh	1
that	1
my	1
words	1
were	1
now	1
written!	1
oh	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
printed	1
in	1
a	1
book!	1
	1
19:24	1
That	1
they	1
were	1
graven	1
with	1
an	1
iron	1
pen	1
and	1
lead	1
in	1
the	1
rock	1
for	1
ever!	1
	1
19:25	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
redeemer	1
liveth,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
latter	1
day	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
19:26	1
And	1
though	1
after	1
my	1
skin	1
worms	1
destroy	1
this	1
body,	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
shall	1
I	1
see	1
God:	1
19:27	1
Whom	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
for	1
myself,	1
and	1
mine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold,	1
and	1
not	1
another;	1
though	1
my	1
reins	1
be	1
consumed	1
within	1
me.	1
	1
19:28	1
But	1
ye	1
should	1
say,	1
Why	1
persecute	1
we	1
him,	1
seeing	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
me?	1
	1
19:29	1
Be	1
ye	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
sword:	1
for	1
wrath	1
bringeth	1
the	1
punishments	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
judgment.	1
	1
20:1	1
Then	1
answered	1
Zophar	1
the	1
Naamathite,	1
and	1
said,	1
20:2	1
Therefore	1
do	1
my	1
thoughts	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
answer,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
I	1
make	1
haste.	1
	1
20:3	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
check	1
of	1
my	1
reproach,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
my	1
understanding	1
causeth	1
me	1
to	1
answer.	1
	1
20:4	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
this	1
of	1
old,	1
since	1
man	1
was	1
placed	1
upon	1
earth,	1
20:5	1
That	1
the	1
triumphing	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
short,	1
and	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
hypocrite	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment?	1
	1
20:6	1
Though	1
his	1
excellency	1
mount	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
reach	1
unto	1
the	1
clouds;	1
20:7	1
Yet	1
he	1
shall	1
perish	1
for	1
ever	1
like	1
his	1
own	1
dung:	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
shall	1
say,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
	1
20:8	1
He	1
shall	1
fly	1
away	1
as	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found:	1
yea,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
chased	1
away	1
as	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
20:9	1
The	1
eye	1
also	1
which	1
saw	1
him	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
no	1
more;	1
neither	1
shall	1
his	1
place	1
any	1
more	1
behold	1
him.	1
	1
20:10	1
His	1
children	1
shall	1
seek	1
to	1
please	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
shall	1
restore	1
their	1
goods.	1
	1
20:11	1
His	1
bones	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
his	1
youth,	1
which	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
20:12	1
Though	1
wickedness	1
be	1
sweet	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
though	1
he	1
hide	1
it	1
under	1
his	1
tongue;	1
20:13	1
Though	1
he	1
spare	1
it,	1
and	1
forsake	1
it	1
not;	1
but	1
keep	1
it	1
still	1
within	1
his	1
mouth:	1
20:14	1
Yet	1
his	1
meat	1
in	1
his	1
bowels	1
is	1
turned,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
asps	1
within	1
him.	1
	1
20:15	1
He	1
hath	1
swallowed	1
down	1
riches,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
vomit	1
them	1
up	1
again:	1
God	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
belly.	1
	1
20:16	1
He	1
shall	1
suck	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
asps:	1
the	1
viper's	1
tongue	1
shall	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
20:17	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
rivers,	1
the	1
floods,	1
the	1
brooks	1
of	1
honey	1
and	1
butter.	1
	1
20:18	1
That	1
which	1
he	1
laboured	1
for	1
shall	1
he	1
restore,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
swallow	1
it	1
down:	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
substance	1
shall	1
the	1
restitution	1
be,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
rejoice	1
therein.	1
	1
20:19	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
oppressed	1
and	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
the	1
poor;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
violently	1
taken	1
away	1
an	1
house	1
which	1
he	1
builded	1
not;	1
20:20	1
Surely	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
feel	1
quietness	1
in	1
his	1
belly,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
save	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
desired.	1
	1
20:21	1
There	1
shall	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
meat	1
be	1
left;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
20:22	1
In	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
his	1
sufficiency	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
straits:	1
every	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
20:23	1
When	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
fill	1
his	1
belly,	1
God	1
shall	1
cast	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
rain	1
it	1
upon	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
eating.	1
	1
20:24	1
He	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
iron	1
weapon,	1
and	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
steel	1
shall	1
strike	1
him	1
through.	1
	1
20:25	1
It	1
is	1
drawn,	1
and	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
yea,	1
the	1
glittering	1
sword	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
gall:	1
terrors	1
are	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
20:26	1
All	1
darkness	1
shall	1
be	1
hid	1
in	1
his	1
secret	1
places:	1
a	1
fire	1
not	1
blown	1
shall	1
consume	1
him;	1
it	1
shall	1
go	1
ill	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
his	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
20:27	1
The	1
heaven	1
shall	1
reveal	1
his	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
20:28	1
The	1
increase	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
shall	1
depart,	1
and	1
his	1
goods	1
shall	1
flow	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
20:29	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
from	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
heritage	1
appointed	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
God.	1
	1
21:1	1
But	1
Job	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
21:2	1
Hear	1
diligently	1
my	1
speech,	1
and	1
let	1
this	1
be	1
your	1
consolations.	1
	1
21:3	1
Suffer	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
speak;	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
mock	1
on.	1
	1
21:4	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
is	1
my	1
complaint	1
to	1
man?	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
so,	1
why	1
should	1
not	1
my	1
spirit	1
be	1
troubled?	1
	1
21:5	1
Mark	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
astonished,	1
and	1
lay	1
your	1
hand	1
upon	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
21:6	1
Even	1
when	1
I	1
remember	1
I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
and	1
trembling	1
taketh	1
hold	1
on	1
my	1
flesh.	1
	1
21:7	1
Wherefore	1
do	1
the	1
wicked	1
live,	1
become	1
old,	1
yea,	1
are	1
mighty	1
in	1
power?	1
	1
21:8	1
Their	1
seed	1
is	1
established	1
in	1
their	1
sight	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
their	1
offspring	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
21:9	1
Their	1
houses	1
are	1
safe	1
from	1
fear,	1
neither	1
is	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
21:10	1
Their	1
bull	1
gendereth,	1
and	1
faileth	1
not;	1
their	1
cow	1
calveth,	1
and	1
casteth	1
not	1
her	1
calf.	1
	1
21:11	1
They	1
send	1
forth	1
their	1
little	1
ones	1
like	1
a	1
flock,	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
dance.	1
	1
21:12	1
They	1
take	1
the	1
timbrel	1
and	1
harp,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
organ.	1
	1
21:13	1
They	1
spend	1
their	1
days	1
in	1
wealth,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
21:14	1
Therefore	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
God,	1
Depart	1
from	1
us;	1
for	1
we	1
desire	1
not	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
thy	1
ways.	1
	1
21:15	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
him?	1
and	1
what	1
profit	1
should	1
we	1
have,	1
if	1
we	1
pray	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
21:16	1
Lo,	1
their	1
good	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
hand:	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
21:17	1
How	1
oft	1
is	1
the	1
candle	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
put	1
out!	1
and	1
how	1
oft	1
cometh	1
their	1
destruction	1
upon	1
them!	1
God	1
distributeth	1
sorrows	1
in	1
his	1
anger.	1
	1
21:18	1
They	1
are	1
as	1
stubble	1
before	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
as	1
chaff	1
that	1
the	1
storm	1
carrieth	1
away.	1
	1
21:19	1
God	1
layeth	1
up	1
his	1
iniquity	1
for	1
his	1
children:	1
he	1
rewardeth	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
21:20	1
His	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
destruction,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty.	1
	1
21:21	1
For	1
what	1
pleasure	1
hath	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
after	1
him,	1
when	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
months	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
midst?	1
	1
21:22	1
Shall	1
any	1
teach	1
God	1
knowledge?	1
seeing	1
he	1
judgeth	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
high.	1
	1
21:23	1
One	1
dieth	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
strength,	1
being	1
wholly	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
quiet.	1
	1
21:24	1
His	1
breasts	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
his	1
bones	1
are	1
moistened	1
with	1
marrow.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
another	1
dieth	1
in	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
and	1
never	1
eateth	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
	1
21:26	1
They	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
alike	1
in	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
the	1
worms	1
shall	1
cover	1
them.	1
	1
21:27	1
Behold,	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
the	1
devices	1
which	1
ye	1
wrongfully	1
imagine	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
21:28	1
For	1
ye	1
say,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
prince?	1
and	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
dwelling	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
wicked?	1
	1
21:29	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
asked	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
way?	1
and	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
their	1
tokens,	1
21:30	1
That	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
reserved	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
destruction?	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
wrath.	1
	1
21:31	1
Who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
face?	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
repay	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
hath	1
done?	1
	1
21:32	1
Yet	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
grave,	1
and	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
tomb.	1
	1
21:33	1
The	1
clods	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
shall	1
be	1
sweet	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
draw	1
after	1
him,	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
innumerable	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
21:34	1
How	1
then	1
comfort	1
ye	1
me	1
in	1
vain,	1
seeing	1
in	1
your	1
answers	1
there	1
remaineth	1
falsehood?	1
	1
22:1	1
Then	1
Eliphaz	1
the	1
Temanite	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
22:2	1
Can	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
profitable	1
unto	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
wise	1
may	1
be	1
profitable	1
unto	1
himself?	1
	1
22:3	1
Is	1
it	1
any	1
pleasure	1
to	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
righteous?	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
gain	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
thou	1
makest	1
thy	1
ways	1
perfect?	1
	1
22:4	1
Will	1
he	1
reprove	1
thee	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
thee?	1
will	1
he	1
enter	1
with	1
thee	1
into	1
judgment?	1
	1
22:5	1
Is	1
not	1
thy	1
wickedness	1
great?	1
and	1
thine	1
iniquities	1
infinite?	1
	1
22:6	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
a	1
pledge	1
from	1
thy	1
brother	1
for	1
nought,	1
and	1
stripped	1
the	1
naked	1
of	1
their	1
clothing.	1
	1
22:7	1
Thou	1
hast	1
not	1
given	1
water	1
to	1
the	1
weary	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
withholden	1
bread	1
from	1
the	1
hungry.	1
	1
22:8	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
mighty	1
man,	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
honourable	1
man	1
dwelt	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
22:9	1
Thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
widows	1
away	1
empty,	1
and	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless	1
have	1
been	1
broken.	1
	1
22:10	1
Therefore	1
snares	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
sudden	1
fear	1
troubleth	1
thee;	1
22:11	1
Or	1
darkness,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
see;	1
and	1
abundance	1
of	1
waters	1
cover	1
thee.	1
	1
22:12	1
Is	1
not	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
heaven?	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
stars,	1
how	1
high	1
they	1
are!	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
How	1
doth	1
God	1
know?	1
can	1
he	1
judge	1
through	1
the	1
dark	1
cloud?	1
	1
22:14	1
Thick	1
clouds	1
are	1
a	1
covering	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
seeth	1
not;	1
and	1
he	1
walketh	1
in	1
the	1
circuit	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
22:15	1
Hast	1
thou	1
marked	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
which	1
wicked	1
men	1
have	1
trodden?	1
22:16	1
Which	1
were	1
cut	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
time,	1
whose	1
foundation	1
was	1
overflown	1
with	1
a	1
flood:	1
22:17	1
Which	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Depart	1
from	1
us:	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
the	1
Almighty	1
do	1
for	1
them?	1
	1
22:18	1
Yet	1
he	1
filled	1
their	1
houses	1
with	1
good	1
things:	1
but	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
22:19	1
The	1
righteous	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
are	1
glad:	1
and	1
the	1
innocent	1
laugh	1
them	1
to	1
scorn.	1
	1
22:20	1
Whereas	1
our	1
substance	1
is	1
not	1
cut	1
down,	1
but	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
fire	1
consumeth.	1
	1
22:21	1
Acquaint	1
now	1
thyself	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
be	1
at	1
peace:	1
thereby	1
good	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
22:22	1
Receive,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
the	1
law	1
from	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
lay	1
up	1
his	1
words	1
in	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
22:23	1
If	1
thou	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
built	1
up,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
away	1
iniquity	1
far	1
from	1
thy	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
22:24	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
lay	1
up	1
gold	1
as	1
dust,	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
Ophir	1
as	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
brooks.	1
	1
22:25	1
Yea,	1
the	1
Almighty	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
defence,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
22:26	1
For	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
thy	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
and	1
shalt	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
face	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
22:27	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
thy	1
prayer	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
pay	1
thy	1
vows.	1
	1
22:28	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
decree	1
a	1
thing,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
unto	1
thee:	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
shall	1
shine	1
upon	1
thy	1
ways.	1
	1
22:29	1
When	1
men	1
are	1
cast	1
down,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
There	1
is	1
lifting	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
humble	1
person.	1
	1
22:30	1
He	1
shall	1
deliver	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
the	1
innocent:	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
pureness	1
of	1
thine	1
hands.	1
	1
23:1	1
Then	1
Job	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
23:2	1
Even	1
to	1
day	1
is	1
my	1
complaint	1
bitter:	1
my	1
stroke	1
is	1
heavier	1
than	1
my	1
groaning.	1
	1
23:3	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
where	1
I	1
might	1
find	1
him!	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
come	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
seat!	1
	1
23:4	1
I	1
would	1
order	1
my	1
cause	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
fill	1
my	1
mouth	1
with	1
arguments.	1
	1
23:5	1
I	1
would	1
know	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
answer	1
me,	1
and	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
23:6	1
Will	1
he	1
plead	1
against	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
power?	1
No;	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
put	1
strength	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
23:7	1
There	1
the	1
righteous	1
might	1
dispute	1
with	1
him;	1
so	1
should	1
I	1
be	1
delivered	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
my	1
judge.	1
	1
23:8	1
Behold,	1
I	1
go	1
forward,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
there;	1
and	1
backward,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
perceive	1
him:	1
23:9	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
where	1
he	1
doth	1
work,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
behold	1
him:	1
he	1
hideth	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
him:	1
23:10	1
But	1
he	1
knoweth	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
take:	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
tried	1
me,	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
as	1
gold.	1
	1
23:11	1
My	1
foot	1
hath	1
held	1
his	1
steps,	1
his	1
way	1
have	1
I	1
kept,	1
and	1
not	1
declined.	1
	1
23:12	1
Neither	1
have	1
I	1
gone	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
his	1
lips;	1
I	1
have	1
esteemed	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
more	1
than	1
my	1
necessary	1
food.	1
	1
23:13	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
one	1
mind,	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
turn	1
him?	1
and	1
what	1
his	1
soul	1
desireth,	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
doeth.	1
	1
23:14	1
For	1
he	1
performeth	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
appointed	1
for	1
me:	1
and	1
many	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
23:15	1
Therefore	1
am	1
I	1
troubled	1
at	1
his	1
presence:	1
when	1
I	1
consider,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
23:16	1
For	1
God	1
maketh	1
my	1
heart	1
soft,	1
and	1
the	1
Almighty	1
troubleth	1
me:	1
23:17	1
Because	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
before	1
the	1
darkness,	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
covered	1
the	1
darkness	1
from	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
24:1	1
Why,	1
seeing	1
times	1
are	1
not	1
hidden	1
from	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
do	1
they	1
that	1
know	1
him	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
days?	1
	1
24:2	1
Some	1
remove	1
the	1
landmarks;	1
they	1
violently	1
take	1
away	1
flocks,	1
and	1
feed	1
thereof.	1
	1
24:3	1
They	1
drive	1
away	1
the	1
ass	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
they	1
take	1
the	1
widow's	1
ox	1
for	1
a	1
pledge.	1
	1
24:4	1
They	1
turn	1
the	1
needy	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way:	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
hide	1
themselves	1
together.	1
	1
24:5	1
Behold,	1
as	1
wild	1
asses	1
in	1
the	1
desert,	1
go	1
they	1
forth	1
to	1
their	1
work;	1
rising	1
betimes	1
for	1
a	1
prey:	1
the	1
wilderness	1
yieldeth	1
food	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
children.	1
	1
24:6	1
They	1
reap	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
they	1
gather	1
the	1
vintage	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
24:7	1
They	1
cause	1
the	1
naked	1
to	1
lodge	1
without	1
clothing,	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
covering	1
in	1
the	1
cold.	1
	1
24:8	1
They	1
are	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
showers	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
embrace	1
the	1
rock	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
shelter.	1
	1
24:9	1
They	1
pluck	1
the	1
fatherless	1
from	1
the	1
breast,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
pledge	1
of	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
24:10	1
They	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
naked	1
without	1
clothing,	1
and	1
they	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
sheaf	1
from	1
the	1
hungry;	1
24:11	1
Which	1
make	1
oil	1
within	1
their	1
walls,	1
and	1
tread	1
their	1
winepresses,	1
and	1
suffer	1
thirst.	1
	1
24:12	1
Men	1
groan	1
from	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
crieth	1
out:	1
yet	1
God	1
layeth	1
not	1
folly	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
24:13	1
They	1
are	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
rebel	1
against	1
the	1
light;	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
ways	1
thereof,	1
nor	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
paths	1
thereof.	1
	1
24:14	1
The	1
murderer	1
rising	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
killeth	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
	1
24:15	1
The	1
eye	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
adulterer	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
twilight,	1
saying,	1
No	1
eye	1
shall	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
disguiseth	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
24:16	1
In	1
the	1
dark	1
they	1
dig	1
through	1
houses,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
marked	1
for	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
daytime:	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
24:17	1
For	1
the	1
morning	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death:	1
if	1
one	1
know	1
them,	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
terrors	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
24:18	1
He	1
is	1
swift	1
as	1
the	1
waters;	1
their	1
portion	1
is	1
cursed	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
beholdeth	1
not	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards.	1
	1
24:19	1
Drought	1
and	1
heat	1
consume	1
the	1
snow	1
waters:	1
so	1
doth	1
the	1
grave	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
sinned.	1
	1
24:20	1
The	1
womb	1
shall	1
forget	1
him;	1
the	1
worm	1
shall	1
feed	1
sweetly	1
on	1
him;	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
remembered;	1
and	1
wickedness	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
as	1
a	1
tree.	1
	1
24:21	1
He	1
evil	1
entreateth	1
the	1
barren	1
that	1
beareth	1
not:	1
and	1
doeth	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
widow.	1
	1
24:22	1
He	1
draweth	1
also	1
the	1
mighty	1
with	1
his	1
power:	1
he	1
riseth	1
up,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
sure	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
24:23	1
Though	1
it	1
be	1
given	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
safety,	1
whereon	1
he	1
resteth;	1
yet	1
his	1
eyes	1
are	1
upon	1
their	1
ways.	1
	1
24:24	1
They	1
are	1
exalted	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
but	1
are	1
gone	1
and	1
brought	1
low;	1
they	1
are	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
all	1
other,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn.	1
	1
24:25	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
so	1
now,	1
who	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
make	1
my	1
speech	1
nothing	1
worth?	1
	1
25:1	1
Then	1
answered	1
Bildad	1
the	1
Shuhite,	1
and	1
said,	1
25:2	1
Dominion	1
and	1
fear	1
are	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
maketh	1
peace	1
in	1
his	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
25:3	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
armies?	1
and	1
upon	1
whom	1
doth	1
not	1
his	1
light	1
arise?	1
	1
25:4	1
How	1
then	1
can	1
man	1
be	1
justified	1
with	1
God?	1
or	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
be	1
clean	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
woman?	1
	1
25:5	1
Behold	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
it	1
shineth	1
not;	1
yea,	1
the	1
stars	1
are	1
not	1
pure	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
25:6	1
How	1
much	1
less	1
man,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
worm?	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
worm?	1
	1
26:1	1
But	1
Job	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
26:2	1
How	1
hast	1
thou	1
helped	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
without	1
power?	1
how	1
savest	1
thou	1
the	1
arm	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
strength?	1
26:3	1
How	1
hast	1
thou	1
counselled	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
wisdom?	1
and	1
how	1
hast	1
thou	1
plentifully	1
declared	1
the	1
thing	1
as	1
it	1
is?	1
	1
26:4	1
To	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
uttered	1
words?	1
and	1
whose	1
spirit	1
came	1
from	1
thee?	1
	1
26:5	1
Dead	1
things	1
are	1
formed	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof.	1
	1
26:6	1
Hell	1
is	1
naked	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
destruction	1
hath	1
no	1
covering.	1
	1
26:7	1
He	1
stretcheth	1
out	1
the	1
north	1
over	1
the	1
empty	1
place,	1
and	1
hangeth	1
the	1
earth	1
upon	1
nothing.	1
	1
26:8	1
He	1
bindeth	1
up	1
the	1
waters	1
in	1
his	1
thick	1
clouds;	1
and	1
the	1
cloud	1
is	1
not	1
rent	1
under	1
them.	1
	1
26:9	1
He	1
holdeth	1
back	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
spreadeth	1
his	1
cloud	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
26:10	1
He	1
hath	1
compassed	1
the	1
waters	1
with	1
bounds,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
26:11	1
The	1
pillars	1
of	1
heaven	1
tremble	1
and	1
are	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
reproof.	1
	1
26:12	1
He	1
divideth	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
understanding	1
he	1
smiteth	1
through	1
the	1
proud.	1
	1
26:13	1
By	1
his	1
spirit	1
he	1
hath	1
garnished	1
the	1
heavens;	1
his	1
hand	1
hath	1
formed	1
the	1
crooked	1
serpent.	1
	1
26:14	1
Lo,	1
these	1
are	1
parts	1
of	1
his	1
ways:	1
but	1
how	1
little	1
a	1
portion	1
is	1
heard	1
of	1
him?	1
but	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
who	1
can	1
understand?	1
	1
27:1	1
Moreover	1
Job	1
continued	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
27:2	1
As	1
God	1
liveth,	1
who	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
judgment;	1
and	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
who	1
hath	1
vexed	1
my	1
soul;	1
27:3	1
All	1
the	1
while	1
my	1
breath	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
nostrils;	1
27:4	1
My	1
lips	1
shall	1
not	1
speak	1
wickedness,	1
nor	1
my	1
tongue	1
utter	1
deceit.	1
	1
27:5	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
justify	1
you:	1
till	1
I	1
die	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
remove	1
mine	1
integrity	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
27:6	1
My	1
righteousness	1
I	1
hold	1
fast,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
it	1
go:	1
my	1
heart	1
shall	1
not	1
reproach	1
me	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live.	1
	1
27:7	1
Let	1
mine	1
enemy	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
riseth	1
up	1
against	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
unrighteous.	1
	1
27:8	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
hypocrite,	1
though	1
he	1
hath	1
gained,	1
when	1
God	1
taketh	1
away	1
his	1
soul?	1
	1
27:9	1
Will	1
God	1
hear	1
his	1
cry	1
when	1
trouble	1
cometh	1
upon	1
him?	1
	1
27:10	1
Will	1
he	1
delight	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
Almighty?	1
will	1
he	1
always	1
call	1
upon	1
God?	1
	1
27:11	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God:	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Almighty	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
conceal.	1
	1
27:12	1
Behold,	1
all	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
have	1
seen	1
it;	1
why	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
thus	1
altogether	1
vain?	1
	1
27:13	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
with	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
heritage	1
of	1
oppressors,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty.	1
	1
27:14	1
If	1
his	1
children	1
be	1
multiplied,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
sword:	1
and	1
his	1
offspring	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
bread.	1
	1
27:15	1
Those	1
that	1
remain	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
death:	1
and	1
his	1
widows	1
shall	1
not	1
weep.	1
	1
27:16	1
Though	1
he	1
heap	1
up	1
silver	1
as	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
prepare	1
raiment	1
as	1
the	1
clay;	1
27:17	1
He	1
may	1
prepare	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
put	1
it	1
on,	1
and	1
the	1
innocent	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
silver.	1
	1
27:18	1
He	1
buildeth	1
his	1
house	1
as	1
a	1
moth,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
booth	1
that	1
the	1
keeper	1
maketh.	1
	1
27:19	1
The	1
rich	1
man	1
shall	1
lie	1
down,	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
gathered:	1
he	1
openeth	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
not.	1
	1
27:20	1
Terrors	1
take	1
hold	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
waters,	1
a	1
tempest	1
stealeth	1
him	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
27:21	1
The	1
east	1
wind	1
carrieth	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
departeth:	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
storm	1
hurleth	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
27:22	1
For	1
God	1
shall	1
cast	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
not	1
spare:	1
he	1
would	1
fain	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
27:23	1
Men	1
shall	1
clap	1
their	1
hands	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
hiss	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
28:1	1
Surely	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
vein	1
for	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
gold	1
where	1
they	1
fine	1
it.	1
	1
28:2	1
Iron	1
is	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
brass	1
is	1
molten	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stone.	1
	1
28:3	1
He	1
setteth	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
darkness,	1
and	1
searcheth	1
out	1
all	1
perfection:	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
28:4	1
The	1
flood	1
breaketh	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
inhabitant;	1
even	1
the	1
waters	1
forgotten	1
of	1
the	1
foot:	1
they	1
are	1
dried	1
up,	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
men.	1
	1
28:5	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
earth,	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
cometh	1
bread:	1
and	1
under	1
it	1
is	1
turned	1
up	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
fire.	1
	1
28:6	1
The	1
stones	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
sapphires:	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
dust	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
28:7	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
path	1
which	1
no	1
fowl	1
knoweth,	1
and	1
which	1
the	1
vulture's	1
eye	1
hath	1
not	1
seen:	1
28:8	1
The	1
lion's	1
whelps	1
have	1
not	1
trodden	1
it,	1
nor	1
the	1
fierce	1
lion	1
passed	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
28:9	1
He	1
putteth	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
rock;	1
he	1
overturneth	1
the	1
mountains	1
by	1
the	1
roots.	1
	1
28:10	1
He	1
cutteth	1
out	1
rivers	1
among	1
the	1
rocks;	1
and	1
his	1
eye	1
seeth	1
every	1
precious	1
thing.	1
	1
28:11	1
He	1
bindeth	1
the	1
floods	1
from	1
overflowing;	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
hid	1
bringeth	1
he	1
forth	1
to	1
light.	1
	1
28:12	1
But	1
where	1
shall	1
wisdom	1
be	1
found?	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
understanding?	1
	1
28:13	1
Man	1
knoweth	1
not	1
the	1
price	1
thereof;	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
28:14	1
The	1
depth	1
saith,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
saith,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
28:15	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
gotten	1
for	1
gold,	1
neither	1
shall	1
silver	1
be	1
weighed	1
for	1
the	1
price	1
thereof.	1
	1
28:16	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
valued	1
with	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
Ophir,	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
onyx,	1
or	1
the	1
sapphire.	1
	1
28:17	1
The	1
gold	1
and	1
the	1
crystal	1
cannot	1
equal	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
exchange	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
jewels	1
of	1
fine	1
gold.	1
	1
28:18	1
No	1
mention	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
coral,	1
or	1
of	1
pearls:	1
for	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
wisdom	1
is	1
above	1
rubies.	1
	1
28:19	1
The	1
topaz	1
of	1
Ethiopia	1
shall	1
not	1
equal	1
it,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
valued	1
with	1
pure	1
gold.	1
	1
28:20	1
Whence	1
then	1
cometh	1
wisdom?	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
understanding?	1
	1
28:21	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
living,	1
and	1
kept	1
close	1
from	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
28:22	1
Destruction	1
and	1
death	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
fame	1
thereof	1
with	1
our	1
ears.	1
	1
28:23	1
God	1
understandeth	1
the	1
way	1
thereof,	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
the	1
place	1
thereof.	1
	1
28:24	1
For	1
he	1
looketh	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
seeth	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven;	1
28:25	1
To	1
make	1
the	1
weight	1
for	1
the	1
winds;	1
and	1
he	1
weigheth	1
the	1
waters	1
by	1
measure.	1
	1
28:26	1
When	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
decree	1
for	1
the	1
rain,	1
and	1
a	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
lightning	1
of	1
the	1
thunder:	1
28:27	1
Then	1
did	1
he	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
declare	1
it;	1
he	1
prepared	1
it,	1
yea,	1
and	1
searched	1
it	1
out.	1
	1
28:28	1
And	1
unto	1
man	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
is	1
wisdom;	1
and	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
evil	1
is	1
understanding.	1
	1
29:1	1
Moreover	1
Job	1
continued	1
his	1
parable,	1
and	1
said,	1
29:2	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
were	1
as	1
in	1
months	1
past,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
God	1
preserved	1
me;	1
29:3	1
When	1
his	1
candle	1
shined	1
upon	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
when	1
by	1
his	1
light	1
I	1
walked	1
through	1
darkness;	1
29:4	1
As	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
youth,	1
when	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
my	1
tabernacle;	1
29:5	1
When	1
the	1
Almighty	1
was	1
yet	1
with	1
me,	1
when	1
my	1
children	1
were	1
about	1
me;	1
29:6	1
When	1
I	1
washed	1
my	1
steps	1
with	1
butter,	1
and	1
the	1
rock	1
poured	1
me	1
out	1
rivers	1
of	1
oil;	1
29:7	1
When	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
through	1
the	1
city,	1
when	1
I	1
prepared	1
my	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
street!	1
29:8	1
The	1
young	1
men	1
saw	1
me,	1
and	1
hid	1
themselves:	1
and	1
the	1
aged	1
arose,	1
and	1
stood	1
up.	1
	1
29:9	1
The	1
princes	1
refrained	1
talking,	1
and	1
laid	1
their	1
hand	1
on	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
29:10	1
The	1
nobles	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
cleaved	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
29:11	1
When	1
the	1
ear	1
heard	1
me,	1
then	1
it	1
blessed	1
me;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
eye	1
saw	1
me,	1
it	1
gave	1
witness	1
to	1
me:	1
29:12	1
Because	1
I	1
delivered	1
the	1
poor	1
that	1
cried,	1
and	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
none	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
29:13	1
The	1
blessing	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
perish	1
came	1
upon	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
caused	1
the	1
widow's	1
heart	1
to	1
sing	1
for	1
joy.	1
	1
29:14	1
I	1
put	1
on	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
it	1
clothed	1
me:	1
my	1
judgment	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
robe	1
and	1
a	1
diadem.	1
	1
29:15	1
I	1
was	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
blind,	1
and	1
feet	1
was	1
I	1
to	1
the	1
lame.	1
	1
29:16	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
poor:	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
which	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
I	1
searched	1
out.	1
	1
29:17	1
And	1
I	1
brake	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
plucked	1
the	1
spoil	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
teeth.	1
	1
29:18	1
Then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
my	1
nest,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
multiply	1
my	1
days	1
as	1
the	1
sand.	1
	1
29:19	1
My	1
root	1
was	1
spread	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
the	1
dew	1
lay	1
all	1
night	1
upon	1
my	1
branch.	1
	1
29:20	1
My	1
glory	1
was	1
fresh	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
bow	1
was	1
renewed	1
in	1
my	1
hand.	1
	1
29:21	1
Unto	1
me	1
men	1
gave	1
ear,	1
and	1
waited,	1
and	1
kept	1
silence	1
at	1
my	1
counsel.	1
	1
29:22	1
After	1
my	1
words	1
they	1
spake	1
not	1
again;	1
and	1
my	1
speech	1
dropped	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
29:23	1
And	1
they	1
waited	1
for	1
me	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
rain;	1
and	1
they	1
opened	1
their	1
mouth	1
wide	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
rain.	1
	1
29:24	1
If	1
I	1
laughed	1
on	1
them,	1
they	1
believed	1
it	1
not;	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
my	1
countenance	1
they	1
cast	1
not	1
down.	1
	1
29:25	1
I	1
chose	1
out	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
sat	1
chief,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
as	1
a	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
army,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
comforteth	1
the	1
mourners.	1
	1
30:1	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
younger	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
me	1
in	1
derision,	1
whose	1
fathers	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
disdained	1
to	1
have	1
set	1
with	1
the	1
dogs	1
of	1
my	1
flock.	1
	1
30:2	1
Yea,	1
whereto	1
might	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
profit	1
me,	1
in	1
whom	1
old	1
age	1
was	1
perished?	1
	1
30:3	1
For	1
want	1
and	1
famine	1
they	1
were	1
solitary;	1
fleeing	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
in	1
former	1
time	1
desolate	1
and	1
waste.	1
	1
30:4	1
Who	1
cut	1
up	1
mallows	1
by	1
the	1
bushes,	1
and	1
juniper	1
roots	1
for	1
their	1
meat.	1
	1
30:5	1
They	1
were	1
driven	1
forth	1
from	1
among	1
men,	1
(they	1
cried	1
after	1
them	1
as	1
after	1
a	1
thief;)	1
30:6	1
To	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
cliffs	1
of	1
the	1
valleys,	1
in	1
caves	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
rocks.	1
	1
30:7	1
Among	1
the	1
bushes	1
they	1
brayed;	1
under	1
the	1
nettles	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
30:8	1
They	1
were	1
children	1
of	1
fools,	1
yea,	1
children	1
of	1
base	1
men:	1
they	1
were	1
viler	1
than	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
30:9	1
And	1
now	1
am	1
I	1
their	1
song,	1
yea,	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
byword.	1
	1
30:10	1
They	1
abhor	1
me,	1
they	1
flee	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
spare	1
not	1
to	1
spit	1
in	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
30:11	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
loosed	1
my	1
cord,	1
and	1
afflicted	1
me,	1
they	1
have	1
also	1
let	1
loose	1
the	1
bridle	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
30:12	1
Upon	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
rise	1
the	1
youth;	1
they	1
push	1
away	1
my	1
feet,	1
and	1
they	1
raise	1
up	1
against	1
me	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
their	1
destruction.	1
	1
30:13	1
They	1
mar	1
my	1
path,	1
they	1
set	1
forward	1
my	1
calamity,	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
helper.	1
	1
30:14	1
They	1
came	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
wide	1
breaking	1
in	1
of	1
waters:	1
in	1
the	1
desolation	1
they	1
rolled	1
themselves	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
30:15	1
Terrors	1
are	1
turned	1
upon	1
me:	1
they	1
pursue	1
my	1
soul	1
as	1
the	1
wind:	1
and	1
my	1
welfare	1
passeth	1
away	1
as	1
a	1
cloud.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
me;	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
affliction	1
have	1
taken	1
hold	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
30:17	1
My	1
bones	1
are	1
pierced	1
in	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
season:	1
and	1
my	1
sinews	1
take	1
no	1
rest.	1
	1
30:18	1
By	1
the	1
great	1
force	1
of	1
my	1
disease	1
is	1
my	1
garment	1
changed:	1
it	1
bindeth	1
me	1
about	1
as	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
my	1
coat.	1
	1
30:19	1
He	1
hath	1
cast	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
mire,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
like	1
dust	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
30:20	1
I	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
hear	1
me:	1
I	1
stand	1
up,	1
and	1
thou	1
regardest	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
30:21	1
Thou	1
art	1
become	1
cruel	1
to	1
me:	1
with	1
thy	1
strong	1
hand	1
thou	1
opposest	1
thyself	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
30:22	1
Thou	1
liftest	1
me	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
wind;	1
thou	1
causest	1
me	1
to	1
ride	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
dissolvest	1
my	1
substance.	1
	1
30:23	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
bring	1
me	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
appointed	1
for	1
all	1
living.	1
	1
30:24	1
Howbeit	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
stretch	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
grave,	1
though	1
they	1
cry	1
in	1
his	1
destruction.	1
	1
30:25	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
weep	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
trouble?	1
was	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
poor?	1
	1
30:26	1
When	1
I	1
looked	1
for	1
good,	1
then	1
evil	1
came	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
waited	1
for	1
light,	1
there	1
came	1
darkness.	1
	1
30:27	1
My	1
bowels	1
boiled,	1
and	1
rested	1
not:	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
affliction	1
prevented	1
me.	1
	1
30:28	1
I	1
went	1
mourning	1
without	1
the	1
sun:	1
I	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
I	1
cried	1
in	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
30:29	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
brother	1
to	1
dragons,	1
and	1
a	1
companion	1
to	1
owls.	1
	1
30:30	1
My	1
skin	1
is	1
black	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
bones	1
are	1
burned	1
with	1
heat.	1
	1
30:31	1
My	1
harp	1
also	1
is	1
turned	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
my	1
organ	1
into	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
weep.	1
	1
31:1	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
mine	1
eyes;	1
why	1
then	1
should	1
I	1
think	1
upon	1
a	1
maid?	1
	1
31:2	1
For	1
what	1
portion	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
there	1
from	1
above?	1
and	1
what	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty	1
from	1
on	1
high?	1
	1
31:3	1
Is	1
not	1
destruction	1
to	1
the	1
wicked?	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
punishment	1
to	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity?	1
	1
31:4	1
Doth	1
not	1
he	1
see	1
my	1
ways,	1
and	1
count	1
all	1
my	1
steps?	1
	1
31:5	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
with	1
vanity,	1
or	1
if	1
my	1
foot	1
hath	1
hasted	1
to	1
deceit;	1
31:6	1
Let	1
me	1
be	1
weighed	1
in	1
an	1
even	1
balance	1
that	1
God	1
may	1
know	1
mine	1
integrity.	1
	1
31:7	1
If	1
my	1
step	1
hath	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
mine	1
heart	1
walked	1
after	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
blot	1
hath	1
cleaved	1
to	1
mine	1
hands;	1
31:8	1
Then	1
let	1
me	1
sow,	1
and	1
let	1
another	1
eat;	1
yea,	1
let	1
my	1
offspring	1
be	1
rooted	1
out.	1
	1
31:9	1
If	1
mine	1
heart	1
have	1
been	1
deceived	1
by	1
a	1
woman,	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
wait	1
at	1
my	1
neighbour's	1
door;	1
31:10	1
Then	1
let	1
my	1
wife	1
grind	1
unto	1
another,	1
and	1
let	1
others	1
bow	1
down	1
upon	1
her.	1
	1
31:11	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
an	1
heinous	1
crime;	1
yea,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
iniquity	1
to	1
be	1
punished	1
by	1
the	1
judges.	1
	1
31:12	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fire	1
that	1
consumeth	1
to	1
destruction,	1
and	1
would	1
root	1
out	1
all	1
mine	1
increase.	1
	1
31:13	1
If	1
I	1
did	1
despise	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
manservant	1
or	1
of	1
my	1
maidservant,	1
when	1
they	1
contended	1
with	1
me;	1
31:14	1
What	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
when	1
God	1
riseth	1
up?	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
visiteth,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
answer	1
him?	1
31:15	1
Did	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
womb	1
make	1
him?	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
one	1
fashion	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
womb?	1
	1
31:16	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
withheld	1
the	1
poor	1
from	1
their	1
desire,	1
or	1
have	1
caused	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
widow	1
to	1
fail;	1
31:17	1
Or	1
have	1
eaten	1
my	1
morsel	1
myself	1
alone,	1
and	1
the	1
fatherless	1
hath	1
not	1
eaten	1
thereof;	1
31:18	1
(For	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
me,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
father,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
guided	1
her	1
from	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb;)	1
31:19	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
any	1
perish	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
clothing,	1
or	1
any	1
poor	1
without	1
covering;	1
31:20	1
If	1
his	1
loins	1
have	1
not	1
blessed	1
me,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
warmed	1
with	1
the	1
fleece	1
of	1
my	1
sheep;	1
31:21	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
lifted	1
up	1
my	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
my	1
help	1
in	1
the	1
gate:	1
31:22	1
Then	1
let	1
mine	1
arm	1
fall	1
from	1
my	1
shoulder	1
blade,	1
and	1
mine	1
arm	1
be	1
broken	1
from	1
the	1
bone.	1
	1
31:23	1
For	1
destruction	1
from	1
God	1
was	1
a	1
terror	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
highness	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
endure.	1
	1
31:24	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
gold	1
my	1
hope,	1
or	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
fine	1
gold,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
confidence;	1
31:25	1
If	1
I	1
rejoice	1
because	1
my	1
wealth	1
was	1
great,	1
and	1
because	1
mine	1
hand	1
had	1
gotten	1
much;	1
31:26	1
If	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
sun	1
when	1
it	1
shined,	1
or	1
the	1
moon	1
walking	1
in	1
brightness;	1
31:27	1
And	1
my	1
heart	1
hath	1
been	1
secretly	1
enticed,	1
or	1
my	1
mouth	1
hath	1
kissed	1
my	1
hand:	1
31:28	1
This	1
also	1
were	1
an	1
iniquity	1
to	1
be	1
punished	1
by	1
the	1
judge:	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
denied	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
is	1
above.	1
	1
31:29	1
If	1
I	1
rejoice	1
at	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hated	1
me,	1
or	1
lifted	1
up	1
myself	1
when	1
evil	1
found	1
him:	1
31:30	1
Neither	1
have	1
I	1
suffered	1
my	1
mouth	1
to	1
sin	1
by	1
wishing	1
a	1
curse	1
to	1
his	1
soul.	1
	1
31:31	1
If	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
tabernacle	1
said	1
not,	1
Oh	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
of	1
his	1
flesh!	1
	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
satisfied.	1
	1
31:32	1
The	1
stranger	1
did	1
not	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
street:	1
but	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
doors	1
to	1
the	1
traveller.	1
	1
31:33	1
If	1
I	1
covered	1
my	1
transgressions	1
as	1
Adam,	1
by	1
hiding	1
mine	1
iniquity	1
in	1
my	1
bosom:	1
31:34	1
Did	1
I	1
fear	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
or	1
did	1
the	1
contempt	1
of	1
families	1
terrify	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
kept	1
silence,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door?	1
	1
31:35	1
Oh	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
hear	1
me!	1
behold,	1
my	1
desire	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
Almighty	1
would	1
answer	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
mine	1
adversary	1
had	1
written	1
a	1
book.	1
	1
31:36	1
Surely	1
I	1
would	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
my	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
bind	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
crown	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
31:37	1
I	1
would	1
declare	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
my	1
steps;	1
as	1
a	1
prince	1
would	1
I	1
go	1
near	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
31:38	1
If	1
my	1
land	1
cry	1
against	1
me,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
furrows	1
likewise	1
thereof	1
complain;	1
31:39	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
the	1
fruits	1
thereof	1
without	1
money,	1
or	1
have	1
caused	1
the	1
owners	1
thereof	1
to	1
lose	1
their	1
life:	1
31:40	1
Let	1
thistles	1
grow	1
instead	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
cockle	1
instead	1
of	1
barley.	1
	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Job	1
are	1
ended.	1
	1
32:1	1
So	1
these	1
three	1
men	1
ceased	1
to	1
answer	1
Job,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
righteous	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
	1
32:2	1
Then	1
was	1
kindled	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
Elihu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Barachel	1
the	1
Buzite,	1
of	1
the	1
kindred	1
of	1
Ram:	1
against	1
Job	1
was	1
his	1
wrath	1
kindled,	1
because	1
he	1
justified	1
himself	1
rather	1
than	1
God.	1
	1
32:3	1
Also	1
against	1
his	1
three	1
friends	1
was	1
his	1
wrath	1
kindled,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
yet	1
had	1
condemned	1
Job.	1
	1
32:4	1
Now	1
Elihu	1
had	1
waited	1
till	1
Job	1
had	1
spoken,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
elder	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
32:5	1
When	1
Elihu	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answer	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
these	1
three	1
men,	1
then	1
his	1
wrath	1
was	1
kindled.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
Elihu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Barachel	1
the	1
Buzite	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
young,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
very	1
old;	1
wherefore	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
durst	1
not	1
shew	1
you	1
mine	1
opinion.	1
	1
32:7	1
I	1
said,	1
Days	1
should	1
speak,	1
and	1
multitude	1
of	1
years	1
should	1
teach	1
wisdom.	1
	1
32:8	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
spirit	1
in	1
man:	1
and	1
the	1
inspiration	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty	1
giveth	1
them	1
understanding.	1
	1
32:9	1
Great	1
men	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
wise:	1
neither	1
do	1
the	1
aged	1
understand	1
judgment.	1
	1
32:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
said,	1
Hearken	1
to	1
me;	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
shew	1
mine	1
opinion.	1
	1
32:11	1
Behold,	1
I	1
waited	1
for	1
your	1
words;	1
I	1
gave	1
ear	1
to	1
your	1
reasons,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
searched	1
out	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
32:12	1
Yea,	1
I	1
attended	1
unto	1
you,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
convinced	1
Job,	1
or	1
that	1
answered	1
his	1
words:	1
32:13	1
Lest	1
ye	1
should	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
wisdom:	1
God	1
thrusteth	1
him	1
down,	1
not	1
man.	1
	1
32:14	1
Now	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
directed	1
his	1
words	1
against	1
me:	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
answer	1
him	1
with	1
your	1
speeches.	1
	1
32:15	1
They	1
were	1
amazed,	1
they	1
answered	1
no	1
more:	1
they	1
left	1
off	1
speaking.	1
	1
32:16	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
waited,	1
(for	1
they	1
spake	1
not,	1
but	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
answered	1
no	1
more;)	1
32:17	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
also	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
shew	1
mine	1
opinion.	1
	1
32:18	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
matter,	1
the	1
spirit	1
within	1
me	1
constraineth	1
me.	1
	1
32:19	1
Behold,	1
my	1
belly	1
is	1
as	1
wine	1
which	1
hath	1
no	1
vent;	1
it	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
like	1
new	1
bottles.	1
	1
32:20	1
I	1
will	1
speak,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
refreshed:	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
my	1
lips	1
and	1
answer.	1
	1
32:21	1
Let	1
me	1
not,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
accept	1
any	1
man's	1
person,	1
neither	1
let	1
me	1
give	1
flattering	1
titles	1
unto	1
man.	1
	1
32:22	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
flattering	1
titles;	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
my	1
maker	1
would	1
soon	1
take	1
me	1
away.	1
	1
33:1	1
Wherefore,	1
Job,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
hear	1
my	1
speeches,	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
all	1
my	1
words.	1
	1
33:2	1
Behold,	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth,	1
my	1
tongue	1
hath	1
spoken	1
in	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
33:3	1
My	1
words	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
uprightness	1
of	1
my	1
heart:	1
and	1
my	1
lips	1
shall	1
utter	1
knowledge	1
clearly.	1
	1
33:4	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
life.	1
	1
33:5	1
If	1
thou	1
canst	1
answer	1
me,	1
set	1
thy	1
words	1
in	1
order	1
before	1
me,	1
stand	1
up.	1
	1
33:6	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
wish	1
in	1
God's	1
stead:	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
formed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
clay.	1
	1
33:7	1
Behold,	1
my	1
terror	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
thee	1
afraid,	1
neither	1
shall	1
my	1
hand	1
be	1
heavy	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
33:8	1
Surely	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
in	1
mine	1
hearing,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
words,	1
saying,	1
33:9	1
I	1
am	1
clean	1
without	1
transgression,	1
I	1
am	1
innocent;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
iniquity	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
33:10	1
Behold,	1
he	1
findeth	1
occasions	1
against	1
me,	1
he	1
counteth	1
me	1
for	1
his	1
enemy,	1
33:11	1
He	1
putteth	1
my	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
stocks,	1
he	1
marketh	1
all	1
my	1
paths.	1
	1
33:12	1
Behold,	1
in	1
this	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
just:	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
thee,	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
man.	1
	1
33:13	1
Why	1
dost	1
thou	1
strive	1
against	1
him?	1
for	1
he	1
giveth	1
not	1
account	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
matters.	1
	1
33:14	1
For	1
God	1
speaketh	1
once,	1
yea	1
twice,	1
yet	1
man	1
perceiveth	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
33:15	1
In	1
a	1
dream,	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
when	1
deep	1
sleep	1
falleth	1
upon	1
men,	1
in	1
slumberings	1
upon	1
the	1
bed;	1
33:16	1
Then	1
he	1
openeth	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
sealeth	1
their	1
instruction,	1
33:17	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
withdraw	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
purpose,	1
and	1
hide	1
pride	1
from	1
man.	1
	1
33:18	1
He	1
keepeth	1
back	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
from	1
perishing	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
33:19	1
He	1
is	1
chastened	1
also	1
with	1
pain	1
upon	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
bones	1
with	1
strong	1
pain:	1
33:20	1
So	1
that	1
his	1
life	1
abhorreth	1
bread,	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
dainty	1
meat.	1
	1
33:21	1
His	1
flesh	1
is	1
consumed	1
away,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
seen;	1
and	1
his	1
bones	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
seen	1
stick	1
out.	1
	1
33:22	1
Yea,	1
his	1
soul	1
draweth	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
grave,	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
destroyers.	1
	1
33:23	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
messenger	1
with	1
him,	1
an	1
interpreter,	1
one	1
among	1
a	1
thousand,	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
man	1
his	1
uprightness:	1
33:24	1
Then	1
he	1
is	1
gracious	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Deliver	1
him	1
from	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit:	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
ransom.	1
	1
33:25	1
His	1
flesh	1
shall	1
be	1
fresher	1
than	1
a	1
child's:	1
he	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
youth:	1
33:26	1
He	1
shall	1
pray	1
unto	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
favourable	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
joy:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
render	1
unto	1
man	1
his	1
righteousness.	1
	1
33:27	1
He	1
looketh	1
upon	1
men,	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
perverted	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right,	1
and	1
it	1
profited	1
me	1
not;	1
33:28	1
He	1
will	1
deliver	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
33:29	1
Lo,	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
worketh	1
God	1
oftentimes	1
with	1
man,	1
33:30	1
To	1
bring	1
back	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
pit,	1
to	1
be	1
enlightened	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
33:31	1
Mark	1
well,	1
O	1
Job,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak.	1
	1
33:32	1
If	1
thou	1
hast	1
anything	1
to	1
say,	1
answer	1
me:	1
speak,	1
for	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
justify	1
thee.	1
	1
33:33	1
If	1
not,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
teach	1
thee	1
wisdom.	1
	1
34:1	1
Furthermore	1
Elihu	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
34:2	1
Hear	1
my	1
words,	1
O	1
ye	1
wise	1
men;	1
and	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
have	1
knowledge.	1
	1
34:3	1
For	1
the	1
ear	1
trieth	1
words,	1
as	1
the	1
mouth	1
tasteth	1
meat.	1
	1
34:4	1
Let	1
us	1
choose	1
to	1
us	1
judgment:	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
among	1
ourselves	1
what	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
34:5	1
For	1
Job	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
righteous:	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
judgment.	1
	1
34:6	1
Should	1
I	1
lie	1
against	1
my	1
right?	1
my	1
wound	1
is	1
incurable	1
without	1
transgression.	1
	1
34:7	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
like	1
Job,	1
who	1
drinketh	1
up	1
scorning	1
like	1
water?	1
	1
34:8	1
Which	1
goeth	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
walketh	1
with	1
wicked	1
men.	1
	1
34:9	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
said,	1
It	1
profiteth	1
a	1
man	1
nothing	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
delight	1
himself	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
34:10	1
Therefore	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
understanding:	1
far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
wickedness;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
commit	1
iniquity.	1
	1
34:11	1
For	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
he	1
render	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
cause	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
find	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
34:12	1
Yea,	1
surely	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
wickedly,	1
neither	1
will	1
the	1
Almighty	1
pervert	1
judgment.	1
	1
34:13	1
Who	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
charge	1
over	1
the	1
earth?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
disposed	1
the	1
whole	1
world?	1
	1
34:14	1
If	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
heart	1
upon	1
man,	1
if	1
he	1
gather	1
unto	1
himself	1
his	1
spirit	1
and	1
his	1
breath;	1
34:15	1
All	1
flesh	1
shall	1
perish	1
together,	1
and	1
man	1
shall	1
turn	1
again	1
unto	1
dust.	1
	1
34:16	1
If	1
now	1
thou	1
hast	1
understanding,	1
hear	1
this:	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
words.	1
	1
34:17	1
Shall	1
even	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
right	1
govern?	1
and	1
wilt	1
thou	1
condemn	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
most	1
just?	1
	1
34:18	1
Is	1
it	1
fit	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
a	1
king,	1
Thou	1
art	1
wicked?	1
and	1
to	1
princes,	1
Ye	1
are	1
ungodly?	1
	1
34:19	1
How	1
much	1
less	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
accepteth	1
not	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
princes,	1
nor	1
regardeth	1
the	1
rich	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
poor?	1
for	1
they	1
all	1
are	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
34:20	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
shall	1
they	1
die,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
troubled	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
pass	1
away:	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
without	1
hand.	1
	1
34:21	1
For	1
his	1
eyes	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
seeth	1
all	1
his	1
goings.	1
	1
34:22	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
darkness,	1
nor	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
where	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
may	1
hide	1
themselves.	1
	1
34:23	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
lay	1
upon	1
man	1
more	1
than	1
right;	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
enter	1
into	1
judgment	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
34:24	1
He	1
shall	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
mighty	1
men	1
without	1
number,	1
and	1
set	1
others	1
in	1
their	1
stead.	1
	1
34:25	1
Therefore	1
he	1
knoweth	1
their	1
works,	1
and	1
he	1
overturneth	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
destroyed.	1
	1
34:26	1
He	1
striketh	1
them	1
as	1
wicked	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
sight	1
of	1
others;	1
34:27	1
Because	1
they	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
consider	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
ways:	1
34:28	1
So	1
that	1
they	1
cause	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
heareth	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
afflicted.	1
	1
34:29	1
When	1
he	1
giveth	1
quietness,	1
who	1
then	1
can	1
make	1
trouble?	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
hideth	1
his	1
face,	1
who	1
then	1
can	1
behold	1
him?	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
against	1
a	1
nation,	1
or	1
against	1
a	1
man	1
only:	1
34:30	1
That	1
the	1
hypocrite	1
reign	1
not,	1
lest	1
the	1
people	1
be	1
ensnared.	1
	1
34:31	1
Surely	1
it	1
is	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
I	1
have	1
borne	1
chastisement,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
offend	1
any	1
more:	1
34:32	1
That	1
which	1
I	1
see	1
not	1
teach	1
thou	1
me:	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
iniquity,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
34:33	1
Should	1
it	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
mind?	1
he	1
will	1
recompense	1
it,	1
whether	1
thou	1
refuse,	1
or	1
whether	1
thou	1
choose;	1
and	1
not	1
I:	1
therefore	1
speak	1
what	1
thou	1
knowest.	1
	1
34:34	1
Let	1
men	1
of	1
understanding	1
tell	1
me,	1
and	1
let	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
34:35	1
Job	1
hath	1
spoken	1
without	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
without	1
wisdom.	1
	1
34:36	1
My	1
desire	1
is	1
that	1
Job	1
may	1
be	1
tried	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
answers	1
for	1
wicked	1
men.	1
	1
34:37	1
For	1
he	1
addeth	1
rebellion	1
unto	1
his	1
sin,	1
he	1
clappeth	1
his	1
hands	1
among	1
us,	1
and	1
multiplieth	1
his	1
words	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
35:1	1
Elihu	1
spake	1
moreover,	1
and	1
said,	1
35:2	1
Thinkest	1
thou	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
right,	1
that	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
My	1
righteousness	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
God's?	1
	1
35:3	1
For	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
What	1
advantage	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
unto	1
thee?	1
and,	1
What	1
profit	1
shall	1
I	1
have,	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
cleansed	1
from	1
my	1
sin?	1
	1
35:4	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
companions	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
35:5	1
Look	1
unto	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
see;	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
clouds	1
which	1
are	1
higher	1
than	1
thou.	1
	1
35:6	1
If	1
thou	1
sinnest,	1
what	1
doest	1
thou	1
against	1
him?	1
or	1
if	1
thy	1
transgressions	1
be	1
multiplied,	1
what	1
doest	1
thou	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
35:7	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
righteous,	1
what	1
givest	1
thou	1
him?	1
or	1
what	1
receiveth	1
he	1
of	1
thine	1
hand?	1
	1
35:8	1
Thy	1
wickedness	1
may	1
hurt	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
thou	1
art;	1
and	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
may	1
profit	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
35:9	1
By	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
oppressions	1
they	1
make	1
the	1
oppressed	1
to	1
cry:	1
they	1
cry	1
out	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
35:10	1
But	1
none	1
saith,	1
Where	1
is	1
God	1
my	1
maker,	1
who	1
giveth	1
songs	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
35:11	1
Who	1
teacheth	1
us	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
maketh	1
us	1
wiser	1
than	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven?	1
	1
35:12	1
There	1
they	1
cry,	1
but	1
none	1
giveth	1
answer,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
evil	1
men.	1
	1
35:13	1
Surely	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
vanity,	1
neither	1
will	1
the	1
Almighty	1
regard	1
it.	1
	1
35:14	1
Although	1
thou	1
sayest	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
him,	1
yet	1
judgment	1
is	1
before	1
him;	1
therefore	1
trust	1
thou	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
35:15	1
But	1
now,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
he	1
hath	1
visited	1
in	1
his	1
anger;	1
yet	1
he	1
knoweth	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
great	1
extremity:	1
35:16	1
Therefore	1
doth	1
Job	1
open	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
vain;	1
he	1
multiplieth	1
words	1
without	1
knowledge.	1
	1
36:1	1
Elihu	1
also	1
proceeded,	1
and	1
said,	1
36:2	1
Suffer	1
me	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
yet	1
to	1
speak	1
on	1
God's	1
behalf.	1
	1
36:3	1
I	1
will	1
fetch	1
my	1
knowledge	1
from	1
afar,	1
and	1
will	1
ascribe	1
righteousness	1
to	1
my	1
Maker.	1
	1
36:4	1
For	1
truly	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
false:	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
perfect	1
in	1
knowledge	1
is	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
36:5	1
Behold,	1
God	1
is	1
mighty,	1
and	1
despiseth	1
not	1
any:	1
he	1
is	1
mighty	1
in	1
strength	1
and	1
wisdom.	1
	1
36:6	1
He	1
preserveth	1
not	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
but	1
giveth	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
36:7	1
He	1
withdraweth	1
not	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
righteous:	1
but	1
with	1
kings	1
are	1
they	1
on	1
the	1
throne;	1
yea,	1
he	1
doth	1
establish	1
them	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
exalted.	1
	1
36:8	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
fetters,	1
and	1
be	1
holden	1
in	1
cords	1
of	1
affliction;	1
36:9	1
Then	1
he	1
sheweth	1
them	1
their	1
work,	1
and	1
their	1
transgressions	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
exceeded.	1
	1
36:10	1
He	1
openeth	1
also	1
their	1
ear	1
to	1
discipline,	1
and	1
commandeth	1
that	1
they	1
return	1
from	1
iniquity.	1
	1
36:11	1
If	1
they	1
obey	1
and	1
serve	1
him,	1
they	1
shall	1
spend	1
their	1
days	1
in	1
prosperity,	1
and	1
their	1
years	1
in	1
pleasures.	1
	1
36:12	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
obey	1
not,	1
they	1
shall	1
perish	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
die	1
without	1
knowledge.	1
	1
36:13	1
But	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
in	1
heart	1
heap	1
up	1
wrath:	1
they	1
cry	1
not	1
when	1
he	1
bindeth	1
them.	1
	1
36:14	1
They	1
die	1
in	1
youth,	1
and	1
their	1
life	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
unclean.	1
	1
36:15	1
He	1
delivereth	1
the	1
poor	1
in	1
his	1
affliction,	1
and	1
openeth	1
their	1
ears	1
in	1
oppression.	1
	1
36:16	1
Even	1
so	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
removed	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
strait	1
into	1
a	1
broad	1
place,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
straitness;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
set	1
on	1
thy	1
table	1
should	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
fatness.	1
	1
36:17	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice	1
take	1
hold	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
36:18	1
Because	1
there	1
is	1
wrath,	1
beware	1
lest	1
he	1
take	1
thee	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
stroke:	1
then	1
a	1
great	1
ransom	1
cannot	1
deliver	1
thee.	1
	1
36:19	1
Will	1
he	1
esteem	1
thy	1
riches?	1
no,	1
not	1
gold,	1
nor	1
all	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
strength.	1
	1
36:20	1
Desire	1
not	1
the	1
night,	1
when	1
people	1
are	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
their	1
place.	1
	1
36:21	1
Take	1
heed,	1
regard	1
not	1
iniquity:	1
for	1
this	1
hast	1
thou	1
chosen	1
rather	1
than	1
affliction.	1
	1
36:22	1
Behold,	1
God	1
exalteth	1
by	1
his	1
power:	1
who	1
teacheth	1
like	1
him?	1
	1
36:23	1
Who	1
hath	1
enjoined	1
him	1
his	1
way?	1
or	1
who	1
can	1
say,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
wrought	1
iniquity?	1
	1
36:24	1
Remember	1
that	1
thou	1
magnify	1
his	1
work,	1
which	1
men	1
behold.	1
	1
36:25	1
Every	1
man	1
may	1
see	1
it;	1
man	1
may	1
behold	1
it	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
36:26	1
Behold,	1
God	1
is	1
great,	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
him	1
not,	1
neither	1
can	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
years	1
be	1
searched	1
out.	1
	1
36:27	1
For	1
he	1
maketh	1
small	1
the	1
drops	1
of	1
water:	1
they	1
pour	1
down	1
rain	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
vapour	1
thereof:	1
36:28	1
Which	1
the	1
clouds	1
do	1
drop	1
and	1
distil	1
upon	1
man	1
abundantly.	1
	1
36:29	1
Also	1
can	1
any	1
understand	1
the	1
spreadings	1
of	1
the	1
clouds,	1
or	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
his	1
tabernacle?	1
	1
36:30	1
Behold,	1
he	1
spreadeth	1
his	1
light	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
covereth	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
36:31	1
For	1
by	1
them	1
judgeth	1
he	1
the	1
people;	1
he	1
giveth	1
meat	1
in	1
abundance.	1
	1
36:32	1
With	1
clouds	1
he	1
covereth	1
the	1
light;	1
and	1
commandeth	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
shine	1
by	1
the	1
cloud	1
that	1
cometh	1
betwixt.	1
	1
36:33	1
The	1
noise	1
thereof	1
sheweth	1
concerning	1
it,	1
the	1
cattle	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
vapour.	1
	1
37:1	1
At	1
this	1
also	1
my	1
heart	1
trembleth,	1
and	1
is	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
37:2	1
Hear	1
attentively	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
that	1
goeth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
37:3	1
He	1
directeth	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven,	1
and	1
his	1
lightning	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
37:4	1
After	1
it	1
a	1
voice	1
roareth:	1
he	1
thundereth	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
excellency;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
stay	1
them	1
when	1
his	1
voice	1
is	1
heard.	1
	1
37:5	1
God	1
thundereth	1
marvellously	1
with	1
his	1
voice;	1
great	1
things	1
doeth	1
he,	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
comprehend.	1
	1
37:6	1
For	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
snow,	1
Be	1
thou	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
likewise	1
to	1
the	1
small	1
rain,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
rain	1
of	1
his	1
strength.	1
	1
37:7	1
He	1
sealeth	1
up	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
every	1
man;	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
may	1
know	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
37:8	1
Then	1
the	1
beasts	1
go	1
into	1
dens,	1
and	1
remain	1
in	1
their	1
places.	1
	1
37:9	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
cometh	1
the	1
whirlwind:	1
and	1
cold	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
37:10	1
By	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
God	1
frost	1
is	1
given:	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
is	1
straitened.	1
	1
37:11	1
Also	1
by	1
watering	1
he	1
wearieth	1
the	1
thick	1
cloud:	1
he	1
scattereth	1
his	1
bright	1
cloud:	1
37:12	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
turned	1
round	1
about	1
by	1
his	1
counsels:	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
commandeth	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
37:13	1
He	1
causeth	1
it	1
to	1
come,	1
whether	1
for	1
correction,	1
or	1
for	1
his	1
land,	1
or	1
for	1
mercy.	1
	1
37:14	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
this,	1
O	1
Job:	1
stand	1
still,	1
and	1
consider	1
the	1
wondrous	1
works	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
37:15	1
Dost	1
thou	1
know	1
when	1
God	1
disposed	1
them,	1
and	1
caused	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
his	1
cloud	1
to	1
shine?	1
	1
37:16	1
Dost	1
thou	1
know	1
the	1
balancings	1
of	1
the	1
clouds,	1
the	1
wondrous	1
works	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
perfect	1
in	1
knowledge?	1
37:17	1
How	1
thy	1
garments	1
are	1
warm,	1
when	1
he	1
quieteth	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
south	1
wind?	1
	1
37:18	1
Hast	1
thou	1
with	1
him	1
spread	1
out	1
the	1
sky,	1
which	1
is	1
strong,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
molten	1
looking	1
glass?	1
	1
37:19	1
Teach	1
us	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him;	1
for	1
we	1
cannot	1
order	1
our	1
speech	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
37:20	1
Shall	1
it	1
be	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
speak?	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
speak,	1
surely	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up.	1
	1
37:21	1
And	1
now	1
men	1
see	1
not	1
the	1
bright	1
light	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
clouds:	1
but	1
the	1
wind	1
passeth,	1
and	1
cleanseth	1
them.	1
	1
37:22	1
Fair	1
weather	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north:	1
with	1
God	1
is	1
terrible	1
majesty.	1
	1
37:23	1
Touching	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
we	1
cannot	1
find	1
him	1
out:	1
he	1
is	1
excellent	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
in	1
plenty	1
of	1
justice:	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
afflict.	1
	1
37:24	1
Men	1
do	1
therefore	1
fear	1
him:	1
he	1
respecteth	1
not	1
any	1
that	1
are	1
wise	1
of	1
heart.	1
	1
38:1	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
Job	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
whirlwind,	1
and	1
said,	1
38:2	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
darkeneth	1
counsel	1
by	1
words	1
without	1
knowledge?	1
	1
38:3	1
Gird	1
up	1
now	1
thy	1
loins	1
like	1
a	1
man;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
demand	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
answer	1
thou	1
me.	1
	1
38:4	1
Where	1
wast	1
thou	1
when	1
I	1
laid	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
declare,	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
understanding.	1
	1
38:5	1
Who	1
hath	1
laid	1
the	1
measures	1
thereof,	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
stretched	1
the	1
line	1
upon	1
it?	1
	1
38:6	1
Whereupon	1
are	1
the	1
foundations	1
thereof	1
fastened?	1
or	1
who	1
laid	1
the	1
corner	1
stone	1
thereof;	1
38:7	1
When	1
the	1
morning	1
stars	1
sang	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
shouted	1
for	1
joy?	1
38:8	1
Or	1
who	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
doors,	1
when	1
it	1
brake	1
forth,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
issued	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
womb?	1
	1
38:9	1
When	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
cloud	1
the	1
garment	1
thereof,	1
and	1
thick	1
darkness	1
a	1
swaddlingband	1
for	1
it,	1
38:10	1
And	1
brake	1
up	1
for	1
it	1
my	1
decreed	1
place,	1
and	1
set	1
bars	1
and	1
doors,	1
38:11	1
And	1
said,	1
Hitherto	1
shalt	1
thou	1
come,	1
but	1
no	1
further:	1
and	1
here	1
shall	1
thy	1
proud	1
waves	1
be	1
stayed?	1
	1
38:12	1
Hast	1
thou	1
commanded	1
the	1
morning	1
since	1
thy	1
days;	1
and	1
caused	1
the	1
dayspring	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
place;	1
38:13	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
the	1
wicked	1
might	1
be	1
shaken	1
out	1
of	1
it?	1
	1
38:14	1
It	1
is	1
turned	1
as	1
clay	1
to	1
the	1
seal;	1
and	1
they	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
garment.	1
	1
38:15	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
wicked	1
their	1
light	1
is	1
withholden,	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
arm	1
shall	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
38:16	1
Hast	1
thou	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
sea?	1
or	1
hast	1
thou	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
depth?	1
	1
38:17	1
Have	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
death	1
been	1
opened	1
unto	1
thee?	1
or	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death?	1
38:18	1
Hast	1
thou	1
perceived	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
declare	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest	1
it	1
all.	1
	1
38:19	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
where	1
light	1
dwelleth?	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
darkness,	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
thereof,	1
38:20	1
That	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
bound	1
thereof,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
know	1
the	1
paths	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
thereof?	1
	1
38:21	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
it,	1
because	1
thou	1
wast	1
then	1
born?	1
or	1
because	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thy	1
days	1
is	1
great?	1
	1
38:22	1
Hast	1
thou	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
snow?	1
or	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
hail,	1
38:23	1
Which	1
I	1
have	1
reserved	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
trouble,	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle	1
and	1
war?	1
	1
38:24	1
By	1
what	1
way	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
parted,	1
which	1
scattereth	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
upon	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
38:25	1
Who	1
hath	1
divided	1
a	1
watercourse	1
for	1
the	1
overflowing	1
of	1
waters,	1
or	1
a	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
lightning	1
of	1
thunder;	1
38:26	1
To	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
where	1
no	1
man	1
is;	1
on	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
wherein	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man;	1
38:27	1
To	1
satisfy	1
the	1
desolate	1
and	1
waste	1
ground;	1
and	1
to	1
cause	1
the	1
bud	1
of	1
the	1
tender	1
herb	1
to	1
spring	1
forth?	1
	1
38:28	1
Hath	1
the	1
rain	1
a	1
father?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
begotten	1
the	1
drops	1
of	1
dew?	1
	1
38:29	1
Out	1
of	1
whose	1
womb	1
came	1
the	1
ice?	1
and	1
the	1
hoary	1
frost	1
of	1
heaven,	1
who	1
hath	1
gendered	1
it?	1
	1
38:30	1
The	1
waters	1
are	1
hid	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
is	1
frozen.	1
	1
38:31	1
Canst	1
thou	1
bind	1
the	1
sweet	1
influences	1
of	1
Pleiades,	1
or	1
loose	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
Orion?	1
	1
38:32	1
Canst	1
thou	1
bring	1
forth	1
Mazzaroth	1
in	1
his	1
season?	1
or	1
canst	1
thou	1
guide	1
Arcturus	1
with	1
his	1
sons?	1
	1
38:33	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
heaven?	1
canst	1
thou	1
set	1
the	1
dominion	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
38:34	1
Canst	1
thou	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
clouds,	1
that	1
abundance	1
of	1
waters	1
may	1
cover	1
thee?	1
	1
38:35	1
Canst	1
thou	1
send	1
lightnings,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Here	1
we	1
are?	1
	1
38:36	1
Who	1
hath	1
put	1
wisdom	1
in	1
the	1
inward	1
parts?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
given	1
understanding	1
to	1
the	1
heart?	1
	1
38:37	1
Who	1
can	1
number	1
the	1
clouds	1
in	1
wisdom?	1
or	1
who	1
can	1
stay	1
the	1
bottles	1
of	1
heaven,	1
38:38	1
When	1
the	1
dust	1
groweth	1
into	1
hardness,	1
and	1
the	1
clods	1
cleave	1
fast	1
together?	1
	1
38:39	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
hunt	1
the	1
prey	1
for	1
the	1
lion?	1
or	1
fill	1
the	1
appetite	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lions,	1
38:40	1
When	1
they	1
couch	1
in	1
their	1
dens,	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
covert	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait?	1
	1
38:41	1
Who	1
provideth	1
for	1
the	1
raven	1
his	1
food?	1
when	1
his	1
young	1
ones	1
cry	1
unto	1
God,	1
they	1
wander	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
meat.	1
	1
39:1	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
wild	1
goats	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
bring	1
forth?	1
or	1
canst	1
thou	1
mark	1
when	1
the	1
hinds	1
do	1
calve?	1
	1
39:2	1
Canst	1
thou	1
number	1
the	1
months	1
that	1
they	1
fulfil?	1
or	1
knowest	1
thou	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
they	1
bring	1
forth?	1
	1
39:3	1
They	1
bow	1
themselves,	1
they	1
bring	1
forth	1
their	1
young	1
ones,	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
their	1
sorrows.	1
	1
39:4	1
Their	1
young	1
ones	1
are	1
in	1
good	1
liking,	1
they	1
grow	1
up	1
with	1
corn;	1
they	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
return	1
not	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
39:5	1
Who	1
hath	1
sent	1
out	1
the	1
wild	1
ass	1
free?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
loosed	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
ass?	1
	1
39:6	1
Whose	1
house	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
the	1
barren	1
land	1
his	1
dwellings.	1
	1
39:7	1
He	1
scorneth	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
neither	1
regardeth	1
he	1
the	1
crying	1
of	1
the	1
driver.	1
	1
39:8	1
The	1
range	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
is	1
his	1
pasture,	1
and	1
he	1
searcheth	1
after	1
every	1
green	1
thing.	1
	1
39:9	1
Will	1
the	1
unicorn	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
serve	1
thee,	1
or	1
abide	1
by	1
thy	1
crib?	1
39:10	1
Canst	1
thou	1
bind	1
the	1
unicorn	1
with	1
his	1
band	1
in	1
the	1
furrow?	1
or	1
will	1
he	1
harrow	1
the	1
valleys	1
after	1
thee?	1
	1
39:11	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
trust	1
him,	1
because	1
his	1
strength	1
is	1
great?	1
or	1
wilt	1
thou	1
leave	1
thy	1
labour	1
to	1
him?	1
	1
39:12	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
believe	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
home	1
thy	1
seed,	1
and	1
gather	1
it	1
into	1
thy	1
barn?	1
	1
39:13	1
Gavest	1
thou	1
the	1
goodly	1
wings	1
unto	1
the	1
peacocks?	1
or	1
wings	1
and	1
feathers	1
unto	1
the	1
ostrich?	1
	1
39:14	1
Which	1
leaveth	1
her	1
eggs	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
warmeth	1
them	1
in	1
dust,	1
39:15	1
And	1
forgetteth	1
that	1
the	1
foot	1
may	1
crush	1
them,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
wild	1
beast	1
may	1
break	1
them.	1
	1
39:16	1
She	1
is	1
hardened	1
against	1
her	1
young	1
ones,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
her's:	1
her	1
labour	1
is	1
in	1
vain	1
without	1
fear;	1
39:17	1
Because	1
God	1
hath	1
deprived	1
her	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
imparted	1
to	1
her	1
understanding.	1
	1
39:18	1
What	1
time	1
she	1
lifteth	1
up	1
herself	1
on	1
high,	1
she	1
scorneth	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
his	1
rider.	1
	1
39:19	1
Hast	1
thou	1
given	1
the	1
horse	1
strength?	1
hast	1
thou	1
clothed	1
his	1
neck	1
with	1
thunder?	1
	1
39:20	1
Canst	1
thou	1
make	1
him	1
afraid	1
as	1
a	1
grasshopper?	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
nostrils	1
is	1
terrible.	1
	1
39:21	1
He	1
paweth	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
rejoiceth	1
in	1
his	1
strength:	1
he	1
goeth	1
on	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
armed	1
men.	1
	1
39:22	1
He	1
mocketh	1
at	1
fear,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
affrighted;	1
neither	1
turneth	1
he	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
39:23	1
The	1
quiver	1
rattleth	1
against	1
him,	1
the	1
glittering	1
spear	1
and	1
the	1
shield.	1
	1
39:24	1
He	1
swalloweth	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
fierceness	1
and	1
rage:	1
neither	1
believeth	1
he	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet.	1
	1
39:25	1
He	1
saith	1
among	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
Ha,	1
ha;	1
and	1
he	1
smelleth	1
the	1
battle	1
afar	1
off,	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
the	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
shouting.	1
	1
39:26	1
Doth	1
the	1
hawk	1
fly	1
by	1
thy	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
stretch	1
her	1
wings	1
toward	1
the	1
south?	1
	1
39:27	1
Doth	1
the	1
eagle	1
mount	1
up	1
at	1
thy	1
command,	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
nest	1
on	1
high?	1
	1
39:28	1
She	1
dwelleth	1
and	1
abideth	1
on	1
the	1
rock,	1
upon	1
the	1
crag	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
the	1
strong	1
place.	1
	1
39:29	1
From	1
thence	1
she	1
seeketh	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
behold	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
39:30	1
Her	1
young	1
ones	1
also	1
suck	1
up	1
blood:	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
slain	1
are,	1
there	1
is	1
she.	1
	1
40:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
Job,	1
and	1
said,	1
40:2	1
Shall	1
he	1
that	1
contendeth	1
with	1
the	1
Almighty	1
instruct	1
him?	1
he	1
that	1
reproveth	1
God,	1
let	1
him	1
answer	1
it.	1
	1
40:3	1
Then	1
Job	1
answered	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
40:4	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
vile;	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
answer	1
thee?	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
40:5	1
Once	1
have	1
I	1
spoken;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
answer:	1
yea,	1
twice;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
proceed	1
no	1
further.	1
	1
40:6	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Job	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
whirlwind,	1
and	1
said,	1
40:7	1
Gird	1
up	1
thy	1
loins	1
now	1
like	1
a	1
man:	1
I	1
will	1
demand	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
declare	1
thou	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
40:8	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
also	1
disannul	1
my	1
judgment?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
condemn	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
righteous?	1
	1
40:9	1
Hast	1
thou	1
an	1
arm	1
like	1
God?	1
or	1
canst	1
thou	1
thunder	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
like	1
him?	1
	1
40:10	1
Deck	1
thyself	1
now	1
with	1
majesty	1
and	1
excellency;	1
and	1
array	1
thyself	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
beauty.	1
	1
40:11	1
Cast	1
abroad	1
the	1
rage	1
of	1
thy	1
wrath:	1
and	1
behold	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
proud,	1
and	1
abase	1
him.	1
	1
40:12	1
Look	1
on	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
proud,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
low;	1
and	1
tread	1
down	1
the	1
wicked	1
in	1
their	1
place.	1
	1
40:13	1
Hide	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
together;	1
and	1
bind	1
their	1
faces	1
in	1
secret.	1
	1
40:14	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
confess	1
unto	1
thee	1
that	1
thine	1
own	1
right	1
hand	1
can	1
save	1
thee.	1
	1
40:15	1
Behold	1
now	1
behemoth,	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
thee;	1
he	1
eateth	1
grass	1
as	1
an	1
ox.	1
	1
40:16	1
Lo	1
now,	1
his	1
strength	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
loins,	1
and	1
his	1
force	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
navel	1
of	1
his	1
belly.	1
	1
40:17	1
He	1
moveth	1
his	1
tail	1
like	1
a	1
cedar:	1
the	1
sinews	1
of	1
his	1
stones	1
are	1
wrapped	1
together.	1
	1
40:18	1
His	1
bones	1
are	1
as	1
strong	1
pieces	1
of	1
brass;	1
his	1
bones	1
are	1
like	1
bars	1
of	1
iron.	1
	1
40:19	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
God:	1
he	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
can	1
make	1
his	1
sword	1
to	1
approach	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
40:20	1
Surely	1
the	1
mountains	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
food,	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
play.	1
	1
40:21	1
He	1
lieth	1
under	1
the	1
shady	1
trees,	1
in	1
the	1
covert	1
of	1
the	1
reed,	1
and	1
fens.	1
	1
40:22	1
The	1
shady	1
trees	1
cover	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
shadow;	1
the	1
willows	1
of	1
the	1
brook	1
compass	1
him	1
about.	1
	1
40:23	1
Behold,	1
he	1
drinketh	1
up	1
a	1
river,	1
and	1
hasteth	1
not:	1
he	1
trusteth	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
draw	1
up	1
Jordan	1
into	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
40:24	1
He	1
taketh	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
eyes:	1
his	1
nose	1
pierceth	1
through	1
snares.	1
	1
41:1	1
Canst	1
thou	1
draw	1
out	1
leviathan	1
with	1
an	1
hook?	1
or	1
his	1
tongue	1
with	1
a	1
cord	1
which	1
thou	1
lettest	1
down?	1
	1
41:2	1
Canst	1
thou	1
put	1
an	1
hook	1
into	1
his	1
nose?	1
or	1
bore	1
his	1
jaw	1
through	1
with	1
a	1
thorn?	1
	1
41:3	1
Will	1
he	1
make	1
many	1
supplications	1
unto	1
thee?	1
will	1
he	1
speak	1
soft	1
words	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
41:4	1
Will	1
he	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
take	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
servant	1
for	1
ever?	1
	1
41:5	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
play	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
bird?	1
or	1
wilt	1
thou	1
bind	1
him	1
for	1
thy	1
maidens?	1
	1
41:6	1
Shall	1
the	1
companions	1
make	1
a	1
banquet	1
of	1
him?	1
shall	1
they	1
part	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
merchants?	1
	1
41:7	1
Canst	1
thou	1
fill	1
his	1
skin	1
with	1
barbed	1
irons?	1
or	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
fish	1
spears?	1
	1
41:8	1
Lay	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
him,	1
remember	1
the	1
battle,	1
do	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
41:9	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
in	1
vain:	1
shall	1
not	1
one	1
be	1
cast	1
down	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him?	1
	1
41:10	1
None	1
is	1
so	1
fierce	1
that	1
dare	1
stir	1
him	1
up:	1
who	1
then	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
me?	1
	1
41:11	1
Who	1
hath	1
prevented	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
repay	1
him?	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven	1
is	1
mine.	1
	1
41:12	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
conceal	1
his	1
parts,	1
nor	1
his	1
power,	1
nor	1
his	1
comely	1
proportion.	1
	1
41:13	1
Who	1
can	1
discover	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
garment?	1
or	1
who	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
double	1
bridle?	1
	1
41:14	1
Who	1
can	1
open	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
his	1
face?	1
his	1
teeth	1
are	1
terrible	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
41:15	1
His	1
scales	1
are	1
his	1
pride,	1
shut	1
up	1
together	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
close	1
seal.	1
	1
41:16	1
One	1
is	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
another,	1
that	1
no	1
air	1
can	1
come	1
between	1
them.	1
	1
41:17	1
They	1
are	1
joined	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
they	1
stick	1
together,	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
sundered.	1
	1
41:18	1
By	1
his	1
neesings	1
a	1
light	1
doth	1
shine,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
eyelids	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
41:19	1
Out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
go	1
burning	1
lamps,	1
and	1
sparks	1
of	1
fire	1
leap	1
out.	1
	1
41:20	1
Out	1
of	1
his	1
nostrils	1
goeth	1
smoke,	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
seething	1
pot	1
or	1
caldron.	1
	1
41:21	1
His	1
breath	1
kindleth	1
coals,	1
and	1
a	1
flame	1
goeth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
41:22	1
In	1
his	1
neck	1
remaineth	1
strength,	1
and	1
sorrow	1
is	1
turned	1
into	1
joy	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
41:23	1
The	1
flakes	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
are	1
joined	1
together:	1
they	1
are	1
firm	1
in	1
themselves;	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
41:24	1
His	1
heart	1
is	1
as	1
firm	1
as	1
a	1
stone;	1
yea,	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
nether	1
millstone.	1
	1
41:25	1
When	1
he	1
raiseth	1
up	1
himself,	1
the	1
mighty	1
are	1
afraid:	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
breakings	1
they	1
purify	1
themselves.	1
	1
41:26	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
layeth	1
at	1
him	1
cannot	1
hold:	1
the	1
spear,	1
the	1
dart,	1
nor	1
the	1
habergeon.	1
	1
41:27	1
He	1
esteemeth	1
iron	1
as	1
straw,	1
and	1
brass	1
as	1
rotten	1
wood.	1
	1
41:28	1
The	1
arrow	1
cannot	1
make	1
him	1
flee:	1
slingstones	1
are	1
turned	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
stubble.	1
	1
41:29	1
Darts	1
are	1
counted	1
as	1
stubble:	1
he	1
laugheth	1
at	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
a	1
spear.	1
	1
41:30	1
Sharp	1
stones	1
are	1
under	1
him:	1
he	1
spreadeth	1
sharp	1
pointed	1
things	1
upon	1
the	1
mire.	1
	1
41:31	1
He	1
maketh	1
the	1
deep	1
to	1
boil	1
like	1
a	1
pot:	1
he	1
maketh	1
the	1
sea	1
like	1
a	1
pot	1
of	1
ointment.	1
	1
41:32	1
He	1
maketh	1
a	1
path	1
to	1
shine	1
after	1
him;	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
the	1
deep	1
to	1
be	1
hoary.	1
	1
41:33	1
Upon	1
earth	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
like,	1
who	1
is	1
made	1
without	1
fear.	1
	1
41:34	1
He	1
beholdeth	1
all	1
high	1
things:	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
pride.	1
	1
42:1	1
Then	1
Job	1
answered	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
42:2	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
do	1
every	1
thing,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
thought	1
can	1
be	1
withholden	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
42:3	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hideth	1
counsel	1
without	1
knowledge?	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
uttered	1
that	1
I	1
understood	1
not;	1
things	1
too	1
wonderful	1
for	1
me,	1
which	1
I	1
knew	1
not.	1
	1
42:4	1
Hear,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak:	1
I	1
will	1
demand	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
declare	1
thou	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
42:5	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
the	1
ear:	1
but	1
now	1
mine	1
eye	1
seeth	1
thee.	1
	1
42:6	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
abhor	1
myself,	1
and	1
repent	1
in	1
dust	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
42:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
Job,	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Eliphaz	1
the	1
Temanite,	1
My	1
wrath	1
is	1
kindled	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
against	1
thy	1
two	1
friends:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
me	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
right,	1
as	1
my	1
servant	1
Job	1
hath.	1
	1
42:8	1
Therefore	1
take	1
unto	1
you	1
now	1
seven	1
bullocks	1
and	1
seven	1
rams,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
servant	1
Job,	1
and	1
offer	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
Job	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
you:	1
for	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
accept:	1
lest	1
I	1
deal	1
with	1
you	1
after	1
your	1
folly,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
me	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
right,	1
like	1
my	1
servant	1
Job.	1
	1
42:9	1
So	1
Eliphaz	1
the	1
Temanite	1
and	1
Bildad	1
the	1
Shuhite	1
and	1
Zophar	1
the	1
Naamathite	1
went,	1
and	1
did	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
them:	1
the	1
LORD	1
also	1
accepted	1
Job.	1
	1
42:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
turned	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Job,	1
when	1
he	1
prayed	1
for	1
his	1
friends:	1
also	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
Job	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
before.	1
	1
42:11	1
Then	1
came	1
there	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
sisters,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
before,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
house:	1
and	1
they	1
bemoaned	1
him,	1
and	1
comforted	1
him	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
brought	1
upon	1
him:	1
every	1
man	1
also	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
money,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
an	1
earring	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
42:12	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
Job	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
beginning:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
fourteen	1
thousand	1
sheep,	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
camels,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
she	1
asses.	1
	1
42:13	1
He	1
had	1
also	1
seven	1
sons	1
and	1
three	1
daughters.	1
	1
42:14	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
Jemima;	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
second,	1
Kezia;	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
third,	1
Kerenhappuch.	1
	1
42:15	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
were	1
no	1
women	1
found	1
so	1
fair	1
as	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Job:	1
and	1
their	1
father	1
gave	1
them	1
inheritance	1
among	1
their	1
brethren.	1
	1
42:16	1
After	1
this	1
lived	1
Job	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
years,	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
sons,	1
even	1
four	1
generations.	1
	1
42:17	1
So	1
Job	1
died,	1
being	1
old	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
days.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Psalms	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
walketh	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
ungodly,	1
nor	1
standeth	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
sinners,	1
nor	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
scornful.	1
	1
1:2	1
But	1
his	1
delight	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
law	1
doth	1
he	1
meditate	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
tree	1
planted	1
by	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
water,	1
that	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
his	1
fruit	1
in	1
his	1
season;	1
his	1
leaf	1
also	1
shall	1
not	1
wither;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
doeth	1
shall	1
prosper.	1
	1
1:4	1
The	1
ungodly	1
are	1
not	1
so:	1
but	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
chaff	1
which	1
the	1
wind	1
driveth	1
away.	1
	1
1:5	1
Therefore	1
the	1
ungodly	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
judgment,	1
nor	1
sinners	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
1:6	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
knoweth	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
righteous:	1
but	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
ungodly	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
	1
	1
2:1	1
Why	1
do	1
the	1
heathen	1
rage,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
imagine	1
a	1
vain	1
thing?	1
	1
2:2	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
set	1
themselves,	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
take	1
counsel	1
together,	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
anointed,	1
saying,	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
us	1
break	1
their	1
bands	1
asunder,	1
and	1
cast	1
away	1
their	1
cords	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
2:4	1
He	1
that	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
laugh:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
have	1
them	1
in	1
derision.	1
	1
2:5	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
vex	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
sore	1
displeasure.	1
	1
2:6	1
Yet	1
have	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
king	1
upon	1
my	1
holy	1
hill	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
2:7	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
the	1
decree:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son;	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
2:8	1
Ask	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
heathen	1
for	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
thy	1
possession.	1
	1
2:9	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
break	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dash	1
them	1
in	1
pieces	1
like	1
a	1
potter's	1
vessel.	1
	1
2:10	1
Be	1
wise	1
now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
ye	1
kings:	1
be	1
instructed,	1
ye	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
2:11	1
Serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
fear,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:12	1
Kiss	1
the	1
Son,	1
lest	1
he	1
be	1
angry,	1
and	1
ye	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
way,	1
when	1
his	1
wrath	1
is	1
kindled	1
but	1
a	1
little.	1
Blessed	1
are	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
3:1	1
Lord,	1
how	1
are	1
they	1
increased	1
that	1
trouble	1
me!	1
many	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
3:2	1
Many	1
there	1
be	1
which	1
say	1
of	1
my	1
soul,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
Selah.	1
	1
3:3	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
art	1
a	1
shield	1
for	1
me;	1
my	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
lifter	1
up	1
of	1
mine	1
head.	1
	1
3:4	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
hill.	1
Selah.	1
	1
3:5	1
I	1
laid	1
me	1
down	1
and	1
slept;	1
I	1
awaked;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
sustained	1
me.	1
	1
3:6	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
people,	1
that	1
have	1
set	1
themselves	1
against	1
me	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
3:7	1
Arise,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
save	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
smitten	1
all	1
mine	1
enemies	1
upon	1
the	1
cheek	1
bone;	1
thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
ungodly.	1
	1
3:8	1
Salvation	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
thy	1
blessing	1
is	1
upon	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
Selah.	1
	1
	1
	1
4:1	1
Hear	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
call,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
righteousness:	1
thou	1
hast	1
enlarged	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
distress;	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
hear	1
my	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:2	1
O	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
turn	1
my	1
glory	1
into	1
shame?	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
love	1
vanity,	1
and	1
seek	1
after	1
leasing?	1
Selah.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
set	1
apart	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
godly	1
for	1
himself:	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
hear	1
when	1
I	1
call	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:4	1
Stand	1
in	1
awe,	1
and	1
sin	1
not:	1
commune	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
heart	1
upon	1
your	1
bed,	1
and	1
be	1
still.	1
Selah.	1
	1
4:5	1
Offer	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
put	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:6	1
There	1
be	1
many	1
that	1
say,	1
Who	1
will	1
shew	1
us	1
any	1
good?	1
LORD,	1
lift	1
thou	1
up	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
thy	1
countenance	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
4:7	1
Thou	1
hast	1
put	1
gladness	1
in	1
my	1
heart,	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
their	1
corn	1
and	1
their	1
wine	1
increased.	1
	1
4:8	1
I	1
will	1
both	1
lay	1
me	1
down	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
sleep:	1
for	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
only	1
makest	1
me	1
dwell	1
in	1
safety.	1
	1
	1
	1
5:1	1
Give	1
ear	1
to	1
my	1
words,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
consider	1
my	1
meditation.	1
	1
5:2	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
cry,	1
my	1
King,	1
and	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
pray.	1
	1
5:3	1
My	1
voice	1
shalt	1
thou	1
hear	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
will	1
I	1
direct	1
my	1
prayer	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
look	1
up.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
a	1
God	1
that	1
hath	1
pleasure	1
in	1
wickedness:	1
neither	1
shall	1
evil	1
dwell	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
5:5	1
The	1
foolish	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
in	1
thy	1
sight:	1
thou	1
hatest	1
all	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
5:6	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
destroy	1
them	1
that	1
speak	1
leasing:	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
abhor	1
the	1
bloody	1
and	1
deceitful	1
man.	1
	1
5:7	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
into	1
thy	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
mercy:	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
fear	1
will	1
I	1
worship	1
toward	1
thy	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
5:8	1
Lead	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
in	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
because	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies;	1
make	1
thy	1
way	1
straight	1
before	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
5:9	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
faithfulness	1
in	1
their	1
mouth;	1
their	1
inward	1
part	1
is	1
very	1
wickedness;	1
their	1
throat	1
is	1
an	1
open	1
sepulchre;	1
they	1
flatter	1
with	1
their	1
tongue.	1
	1
5:10	1
Destroy	1
thou	1
them,	1
O	1
God;	1
let	1
them	1
fall	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
counsels;	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
their	1
transgressions;	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
rebelled	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
let	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
thee	1
rejoice:	1
let	1
them	1
ever	1
shout	1
for	1
joy,	1
because	1
thou	1
defendest	1
them:	1
let	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
love	1
thy	1
name	1
be	1
joyful	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
wilt	1
bless	1
the	1
righteous;	1
with	1
favour	1
wilt	1
thou	1
compass	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
shield.	1
	1
	1
	1
6:1	1
O	1
LORD,	1
rebuke	1
me	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
anger,	1
neither	1
chasten	1
me	1
in	1
thy	1
hot	1
displeasure.	1
	1
6:2	1
Have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
weak:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
heal	1
me;	1
for	1
my	1
bones	1
are	1
vexed.	1
	1
6:3	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
also	1
sore	1
vexed:	1
but	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
how	1
long?	1
	1
6:4	1
Return,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
deliver	1
my	1
soul:	1
oh	1
save	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
mercies'	1
sake.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
in	1
death	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
remembrance	1
of	1
thee:	1
in	1
the	1
grave	1
who	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
thanks?	1
	1
6:6	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
with	1
my	1
groaning;	1
all	1
the	1
night	1
make	1
I	1
my	1
bed	1
to	1
swim;	1
I	1
water	1
my	1
couch	1
with	1
my	1
tears.	1
	1
6:7	1
Mine	1
eye	1
is	1
consumed	1
because	1
of	1
grief;	1
it	1
waxeth	1
old	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
	1
6:8	1
Depart	1
from	1
me,	1
all	1
ye	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
weeping.	1
	1
6:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
heard	1
my	1
supplication;	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
receive	1
my	1
prayer.	1
	1
6:10	1
Let	1
all	1
mine	1
enemies	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
sore	1
vexed:	1
let	1
them	1
return	1
and	1
be	1
ashamed	1
suddenly.	1
	1
	1
	1
7:1	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
in	1
thee	1
do	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
trust:	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
persecute	1
me,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me:	1
	1
7:2	1
Lest	1
he	1
tear	1
my	1
soul	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
rending	1
it	1
in	1
pieces,	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
deliver.	1
	1
7:3	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
this;	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
iniquity	1
in	1
my	1
hands;	1
	1
7:4	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
rewarded	1
evil	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
peace	1
with	1
me;	1
(yea,	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
him	1
that	1
without	1
cause	1
is	1
mine	1
enemy:)	1
	1
7:5	1
Let	1
the	1
enemy	1
persecute	1
my	1
soul,	1
and	1
take	1
it;	1
yea,	1
let	1
him	1
tread	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
lay	1
mine	1
honour	1
in	1
the	1
dust.	1
Selah.	1
	1
7:6	1
Arise,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
in	1
thine	1
anger,	1
lift	1
up	1
thyself	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
rage	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
and	1
awake	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded.	1
	1
7:7	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
compass	1
thee	1
about:	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
therefore	1
return	1
thou	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
7:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
people:	1
judge	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
mine	1
integrity	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:9	1
Oh	1
let	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end;	1
but	1
establish	1
the	1
just:	1
for	1
the	1
righteous	1
God	1
trieth	1
the	1
hearts	1
and	1
reins.	1
	1
7:10	1
My	1
defence	1
is	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
saveth	1
the	1
upright	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
7:11	1
God	1
judgeth	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
God	1
is	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
wicked	1
every	1
day.	1
	1
7:12	1
If	1
he	1
turn	1
not,	1
he	1
will	1
whet	1
his	1
sword;	1
he	1
hath	1
bent	1
his	1
bow,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
ready.	1
	1
7:13	1
He	1
hath	1
also	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
death;	1
he	1
ordaineth	1
his	1
arrows	1
against	1
the	1
persecutors.	1
	1
7:14	1
Behold,	1
he	1
travaileth	1
with	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
hath	1
conceived	1
mischief,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
falsehood.	1
	1
7:15	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
pit,	1
and	1
digged	1
it,	1
and	1
is	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
ditch	1
which	1
he	1
made.	1
	1
7:16	1
His	1
mischief	1
shall	1
return	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
violent	1
dealing	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
pate.	1
	1
7:17	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
righteousness:	1
and	1
will	1
sing	1
praise	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
most	1
high.	1
	1
	1
	1
8:1	1
O	1
LORD,	1
our	1
Lord,	1
how	1
excellent	1
is	1
thy	1
name	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth!	1
who	1
hast	1
set	1
thy	1
glory	1
above	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
8:2	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
babes	1
and	1
sucklings	1
hast	1
thou	1
ordained	1
strength	1
because	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
still	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
the	1
avenger.	1
	1
8:3	1
When	1
I	1
consider	1
thy	1
heavens,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thy	1
fingers,	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
the	1
stars,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
ordained;	1
	1
8:4	1
What	1
is	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
mindful	1
of	1
him?	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
visitest	1
him?	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels,	1
and	1
hast	1
crowned	1
him	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour.	1
	1
8:6	1
Thou	1
madest	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thy	1
hands;	1
thou	1
hast	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet:	1
	1
8:7	1
All	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen,	1
yea,	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1

and	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1

	1
8:9	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
Lord,	1
how	1
excellent	1
is	1
thy	1
name	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth!	1
	1
	1
9:1	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart;	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
forth	1
all	1
thy	1
marvellous	1
works.	1
	1
9:2	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thee:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praise	1
to	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
thou	1
most	1
High.	1
	1
9:3	1
When	1
mine	1
enemies	1
are	1
turned	1
back,	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
and	1
perish	1
at	1
thy	1
presence.	1
	1
9:4	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
maintained	1
my	1
right	1
and	1
my	1
cause;	1
thou	1
satest	1
in	1
the	1
throne	1
judging	1
right.	1
	1
9:5	1
Thou	1
hast	1
rebuked	1
the	1
heathen,	1
thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
the	1
wicked,	1
thou	1
hast	1
put	1
out	1
their	1
name	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
9:6	1
O	1
thou	1
enemy,	1
destructions	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
perpetual	1
end:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
cities;	1
their	1
memorial	1
is	1
perished	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:7	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
endure	1
for	1
ever:	1
he	1
hath	1
prepared	1
his	1
throne	1
for	1
judgment.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
he	1
shall	1
minister	1
judgment	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
uprightness.	1
	1
9:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
refuge	1
for	1
the	1
oppressed,	1
a	1
refuge	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
know	1
thy	1
name	1
will	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
hast	1
not	1
forsaken	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
thee.	1
	1
9:11	1
Sing	1
praises	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
Zion:	1
declare	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
his	1
doings.	1
	1
9:12	1
When	1
he	1
maketh	1
inquisition	1
for	1
blood,	1
he	1
remembereth	1
them:	1
he	1
forgetteth	1
not	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
9:13	1
Have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
consider	1
my	1
trouble	1
which	1
I	1
suffer	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me,	1
thou	1
that	1
liftest	1
me	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
death:	1
	1
9:14	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
shew	1
forth	1
all	1
thy	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
salvation.	1
	1
9:15	1
The	1
heathen	1
are	1
sunk	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
pit	1
that	1
they	1
made:	1
in	1
the	1
net	1
which	1
they	1
hid	1
is	1
their	1
own	1
foot	1
taken.	1
	1
9:16	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
judgment	1
which	1
he	1
executeth:	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
snared	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
hands.	1
Higgaion.	1
Selah.	1
	1
9:17	1
The	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
hell,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
forget	1
God.	1
	1
9:18	1
For	1
the	1
needy	1
shall	1
not	1
alway	1
be	1
forgotten:	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
shall	1
not	1
perish	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
9:19	1
Arise,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
let	1
not	1
man	1
prevail:	1
let	1
the	1
heathen	1
be	1
judged	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
9:20	1
Put	1
them	1
in	1
fear,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
that	1
the	1
nations	1
may	1
know	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
but	1
men.	1
Selah.	1
	1
	1
	1
10:1	1
Why	1
standest	1
thou	1
afar	1
off,	1
O	1
LORD?	1
why	1
hidest	1
thou	1
thyself	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
trouble?	1
	1
10:2	1
The	1
wicked	1
in	1
his	1
pride	1
doth	1
persecute	1
the	1
poor:	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
devices	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
imagined.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
the	1
wicked	1
boasteth	1
of	1
his	1
heart's	1
desire,	1
and	1
blesseth	1
the	1
covetous,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
abhorreth.	1
	1
10:4	1
The	1
wicked,	1
through	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
his	1
countenance,	1
will	1
not	1
seek	1
after	1
God:	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
	1
10:5	1
His	1
ways	1
are	1
always	1
grievous;	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
far	1
above	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight:	1
as	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
enemies,	1
he	1
puffeth	1
at	1
them.	1
	1
10:6	1
He	1
hath	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved:	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
in	1
adversity.	1
	1
10:7	1
His	1
mouth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
cursing	1
and	1
deceit	1
and	1
fraud:	1
under	1
his	1
tongue	1
is	1
mischief	1
and	1
vanity.	1
	1
10:8	1
He	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
lurking	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
villages:	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
places	1
doth	1
he	1
murder	1
the	1
innocent:	1
his	1
eyes	1
are	1
privily	1
set	1
against	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
10:9	1
He	1
lieth	1
in	1
wait	1
secretly	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
in	1
his	1
den:	1
he	1
lieth	1
in	1
wait	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
poor:	1
he	1
doth	1
catch	1
the	1
poor,	1
when	1
he	1
draweth	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
net.	1
	1
10:10	1
He	1
croucheth,	1
and	1
humbleth	1
himself,	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
may	1
fall	1
by	1
his	1
strong	1
ones.	1
	1
10:11	1
He	1
hath	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
God	1
hath	1
forgotten:	1
he	1
hideth	1
his	1
face;	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
10:12	1
Arise,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
O	1
God,	1
lift	1
up	1
thine	1
hand:	1
forget	1
not	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
10:13	1
Wherefore	1
doth	1
the	1
wicked	1
contemn	1
God?	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
require	1
it.	1
	1
10:14	1
Thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
it;	1
for	1
thou	1
beholdest	1
mischief	1
and	1
spite,	1
to	1
requite	1
it	1
with	1
thy	1
hand:	1
the	1
poor	1
committeth	1
himself	1
unto	1
thee;	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
helper	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless.	1
	1
10:15	1
Break	1
thou	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
man:	1
seek	1
out	1
his	1
wickedness	1
till	1
thou	1
find	1
none.	1
	1
10:16	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
King	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
the	1
heathen	1
are	1
perished	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
10:17	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
humble:	1
thou	1
wilt	1
prepare	1
their	1
heart,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
cause	1
thine	1
ear	1
to	1
hear:	1
	1
10:18	1
To	1
judge	1
the	1
fatherless	1
and	1
the	1
oppressed,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
no	1
more	1
oppress.	1
	1
	1
	1
11:1	1
In	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
I	1
my	1
trust:	1
how	1
say	1
ye	1
to	1
my	1
soul,	1
Flee	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
to	1
your	1
mountain?	1
	1
11:2	1
For,	1
lo,	1
the	1
wicked	1
bend	1
their	1
bow,	1
they	1
make	1
ready	1
their	1
arrow	1
upon	1
the	1
string,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
privily	1
shoot	1
at	1
the	1
upright	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
11:3	1
If	1
the	1
foundations	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
what	1
can	1
the	1
righteous	1
do?	1
	1
11:4	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
temple,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
throne	1
is	1
in	1
heaven:	1
his	1
eyes	1
behold,	1
his	1
eyelids	1
try,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
11:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
trieth	1
the	1
righteous:	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
loveth	1
violence	1
his	1
soul	1
hateth.	1
	1
11:6	1
Upon	1
the	1
wicked	1
he	1
shall	1
rain	1
snares,	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone,	1
and	1
an	1
horrible	1
tempest:	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
their	1
cup.	1
	1
11:7	1
For	1
the	1
righteous	1
LORD	1
loveth	1
righteousness;	1
his	1
countenance	1
doth	1
behold	1
the	1
upright.	1
	1
	1
	1
12:1	1
Help,	1
LORD;	1
for	1
the	1
godly	1
man	1
ceaseth;	1
for	1
the	1
faithful	1
fail	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
12:2	1
They	1
speak	1
vanity	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
with	1
flattering	1
lips	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
double	1
heart	1
do	1
they	1
speak.	1
	1
12:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
cut	1
off	1
all	1
flattering	1
lips,	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
that	1
speaketh	1
proud	1
things:	1
	1
12:4	1
Who	1
have	1
said,	1
With	1
our	1
tongue	1
will	1
we	1
prevail;	1
our	1
lips	1
are	1
our	1
own:	1
who	1
is	1
lord	1
over	1
us?	1
	1
12:5	1
For	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
for	1
the	1
sighing	1
of	1
the	1
needy,	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
arise,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
safety	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
puffeth	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
12:6	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
pure	1
words:	1
as	1
silver	1
tried	1
in	1
a	1
furnace	1
of	1
earth,	1
purified	1
seven	1
times.	1
	1
12:7	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
them,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
preserve	1
them	1
from	1
this	1
generation	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
12:8	1
The	1
wicked	1
walk	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
when	1
the	1
vilest	1
men	1
are	1
exalted.	1
	1
	1
	1
13:1	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
forget	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD?	1
for	1
ever?	1
how	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
hide	1
thy	1
face	1
from	1
me?	1
	1
13:2	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
take	1
counsel	1
in	1
my	1
soul,	1
having	1
sorrow	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
daily?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
mine	1
enemy	1
be	1
exalted	1
over	1
me?	1
	1
13:3	1
Consider	1
and	1
hear	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God:	1
lighten	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
lest	1
I	1
sleep	1
the	1
sleep	1
of	1
death;	1
	1
13:4	1
Lest	1
mine	1
enemy	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
prevailed	1
against	1
him;	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
trouble	1
me	1
rejoice	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
moved.	1
	1
13:5	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
trusted	1
in	1
thy	1
mercy;	1
my	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
salvation.	1
	1
13:6	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
dealt	1
bountifully	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
	1
	1
14:1	1
The	1
fool	1
hath	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
God.	1
They	1
are	1
corrupt,	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
abominable	1
works,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good.	1
	1
14:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
looked	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
that	1
did	1
understand,	1
and	1
seek	1
God.	1
	1
14:3	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
gone	1
aside,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
together	1
become	1
filthy:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good,	1
no,	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
14:4	1
Have	1
all	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
no	1
knowledge?	1
who	1
eat	1
up	1
my	1
people	1
as	1
they	1
eat	1
bread,	1
and	1
call	1
not	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:5	1
There	1
were	1
they	1
in	1
great	1
fear:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
generation	1
of	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
14:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
shamed	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
refuge.	1
	1
14:7	1
Oh	1
that	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Zion!	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
bringeth	1
back	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
glad.	1
	1
	1
	1
15:1	1
Lord,	1
who	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
thy	1
tabernacle?	1
who	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
thy	1
holy	1
hill?	1
	1
15:2	1
He	1
that	1
walketh	1
uprightly,	1
and	1
worketh	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
speaketh	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
15:3	1
He	1
that	1
backbiteth	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
tongue,	1
nor	1
doeth	1
evil	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
nor	1
taketh	1
up	1
a	1
reproach	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
15:4	1
In	1
whose	1
eyes	1
a	1
vile	1
person	1
is	1
contemned;	1
but	1
he	1
honoureth	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD.	1
He	1
that	1
sweareth	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
hurt,	1
and	1
changeth	1
not.	1
	1
15:5	1
He	1
that	1
putteth	1
not	1
out	1
his	1
money	1
to	1
usury,	1
nor	1
taketh	1
reward	1
against	1
the	1
innocent.	1
He	1
that	1
doeth	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
	1
	1
16:1	1
Preserve	1
me,	1
O	1
God:	1
for	1
in	1
thee	1
do	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
trust.	1
	1
16:2	1
O	1
my	1
soul,	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Lord:	1
my	1
goodness	1
extendeth	1
not	1
to	1
thee;	1
	1
16:3	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
excellent,	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
all	1
my	1
delight.	1
	1
16:4	1
Their	1
sorrows	1
shall	1
be	1
multiplied	1
that	1
hasten	1
after	1
another	1
god:	1
their	1
drink	1
offerings	1
of	1
blood	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
offer,	1
nor	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
names	1
into	1
my	1
lips.	1
	1
16:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
mine	1
inheritance	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
cup:	1
thou	1
maintainest	1
my	1
lot.	1
	1
16:6	1
The	1
lines	1
are	1
fallen	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
pleasant	1
places;	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
goodly	1
heritage.	1
	1
16:7	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
counsel:	1
my	1
reins	1
also	1
instruct	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
seasons.	1
	1
16:8	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
the	1
LORD	1
always	1
before	1
me:	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
16:9	1
Therefore	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
glad,	1
and	1
my	1
glory	1
rejoiceth:	1
my	1
flesh	1
also	1
shall	1
rest	1
in	1
hope.	1
	1
16:10	1
For	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
leave	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
hell;	1
neither	1
wilt	1
thou	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
16:11	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
life:	1
in	1
thy	1
presence	1
is	1
fulness	1
of	1
joy;	1
at	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
there	1
are	1
pleasures	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
	1
	1
17:1	1
Hear	1
the	1
right,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
attend	1
unto	1
my	1
cry,	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
prayer,	1
that	1
goeth	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
feigned	1
lips.	1
	1
17:2	1
Let	1
my	1
sentence	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
thy	1
presence;	1
let	1
thine	1
eyes	1
behold	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
equal.	1
	1
17:3	1
Thou	1
hast	1
proved	1
mine	1
heart;	1
thou	1
hast	1
visited	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
thou	1
hast	1
tried	1
me,	1
and	1
shalt	1
find	1
nothing;	1
I	1
am	1
purposed	1
that	1
my	1
mouth	1
shall	1
not	1
transgress.	1
	1
17:4	1
Concerning	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
men,	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
thy	1
lips	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
destroyer.	1
	1
17:5	1
Hold	1
up	1
my	1
goings	1
in	1
thy	1
paths,	1
that	1
my	1
footsteps	1
slip	1
not.	1
	1
17:6	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
upon	1
thee,	1
for	1
thou	1
wilt	1
hear	1
me,	1
O	1
God:	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
hear	1
my	1
speech.	1
	1
17:7	1
Shew	1
thy	1
marvellous	1
lovingkindness,	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
savest	1
by	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
them	1
which	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
thee	1
from	1
those	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
17:8	1
Keep	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
the	1
eye,	1
hide	1
me	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
thy	1
wings,	1
	1
17:9	1
From	1
the	1
wicked	1
that	1
oppress	1
me,	1
from	1
my	1
deadly	1
enemies,	1
who	1
compass	1
me	1
about.	1
	1
17:10	1
They	1
are	1
inclosed	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
fat:	1
with	1
their	1
mouth	1
they	1
speak	1
proudly.	1
	1
17:11	1
They	1
have	1
now	1
compassed	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
steps:	1
they	1
have	1
set	1
their	1
eyes	1
bowing	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth;	1
	1
17:12	1
Like	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
that	1
is	1
greedy	1
of	1
his	1
prey,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
lurking	1
in	1
secret	1
places.	1
	1
17:13	1
Arise,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
disappoint	1
him,	1
cast	1
him	1
down:	1
deliver	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
wicked,	1
which	1
is	1
thy	1
sword:	1
	1
17:14	1
From	1
men	1
which	1
are	1
thy	1
hand,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
from	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
which	1
have	1
their	1
portion	1
in	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
whose	1
belly	1
thou	1
fillest	1
with	1
thy	1
hid	1
treasure:	1
they	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
children,	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
their	1
substance	1
to	1
their	1
babes.	1
	1
17:15	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
behold	1
thy	1
face	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
when	1
I	1
awake,	1
with	1
thy	1
likeness.	1
	1
	1
	1
18:1	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
my	1
strength.	1
	1
18:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
rock,	1
and	1
my	1
fortress,	1
and	1
my	1
deliverer;	1
my	1
God,	1
my	1
strength,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
trust;	1
my	1
buckler,	1
and	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
my	1
salvation,	1
and	1
my	1
high	1
tower.	1
	1
18:3	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
praised:	1
so	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
	1
18:4	1
The	1
sorrows	1
of	1
death	1
compassed	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
of	1
ungodly	1
men	1
made	1
me	1
afraid.	1
	1
18:5	1
The	1
sorrows	1
of	1
hell	1
compassed	1
me	1
about:	1
the	1
snares	1
of	1
death	1
prevented	1
me.	1
	1
18:6	1
In	1
my	1
distress	1
I	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
my	1
God:	1
he	1
heard	1
my	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
temple,	1
and	1
my	1
cry	1
came	1
before	1
him,	1
even	1
into	1
his	1
ears.	1
	1
18:7	1
Then	1
the	1
earth	1
shook	1
and	1
trembled;	1
the	1
foundations	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
hills	1
moved	1
and	1
were	1
shaken,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
wroth.	1
	1
18:8	1
There	1
went	1
up	1
a	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
nostrils,	1
and	1
fire	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
devoured:	1
coals	1
were	1
kindled	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
18:9	1
He	1
bowed	1
the	1
heavens	1
also,	1
and	1
came	1
down:	1
and	1
darkness	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
he	1
rode	1
upon	1
a	1
cherub,	1
and	1
did	1
fly:	1
yea,	1
he	1
did	1
fly	1
upon	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
18:11	1
He	1
made	1
darkness	1
his	1
secret	1
place;	1
his	1
pavilion	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
were	1
dark	1
waters	1
and	1
thick	1
clouds	1
of	1
the	1
skies.	1
	1
18:12	1
At	1
the	1
brightness	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
his	1
thick	1
clouds	1
passed,	1
hail	1
stones	1
and	1
coals	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
18:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
thundered	1
in	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
Highest	1
gave	1
his	1
voice;	1
hail	1
stones	1
and	1
coals	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
18:14	1
Yea,	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
his	1
arrows,	1
and	1
scattered	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
shot	1
out	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
discomfited	1
them.	1
	1
18:15	1
Then	1
the	1
channels	1
of	1
waters	1
were	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
were	1
discovered	1
at	1
thy	1
rebuke,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
at	1
the	1
blast	1
of	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
thy	1
nostrils.	1
	1
18:16	1
He	1
sent	1
from	1
above,	1
he	1
took	1
me,	1
he	1
drew	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
many	1
waters.	1
	1
18:17	1
He	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
strong	1
enemy,	1
and	1
from	1
them	1
which	1
hated	1
me:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
18:18	1
They	1
prevented	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
calamity:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
my	1
stay.	1
	1
18:19	1
He	1
brought	1
me	1
forth	1
also	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
place;	1
he	1
delivered	1
me,	1
because	1
he	1
delighted	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
18:20	1
The	1
LORD	1
rewarded	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
righteousness;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
cleanness	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
hath	1
he	1
recompensed	1
me.	1
	1
18:21	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
wickedly	1
departed	1
from	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
18:22	1
For	1
all	1
his	1
judgments	1
were	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
statutes	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
18:23	1
I	1
was	1
also	1
upright	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
kept	1
myself	1
from	1
mine	1
iniquity.	1
	1
18:24	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
recompensed	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
righteousness,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
cleanness	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
eyesight.	1
	1
18:25	1
With	1
the	1
merciful	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
thyself	1
merciful;	1
with	1
an	1
upright	1
man	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
thyself	1
upright;	1
	1
18:26	1
With	1
the	1
pure	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
thyself	1
pure;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
froward	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
thyself	1
froward.	1
	1
18:27	1
For	1
thou	1
wilt	1
save	1
the	1
afflicted	1
people;	1
but	1
wilt	1
bring	1
down	1
high	1
looks.	1
	1
18:28	1
For	1
thou	1
wilt	1
light	1
my	1
candle:	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
will	1
enlighten	1
my	1
darkness.	1
	1
18:29	1
For	1
by	1
thee	1
I	1
have	1
run	1
through	1
a	1
troop;	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
God	1
have	1
I	1
leaped	1
over	1
a	1
wall.	1
	1
18:30	1
As	1
for	1
God,	1
his	1
way	1
is	1
perfect:	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
tried:	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
buckler	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
18:31	1
For	1
who	1
is	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
LORD?	1
or	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
rock	1
save	1
our	1
God?	1
	1
18:32	1
It	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
girdeth	1
me	1
with	1
strength,	1
and	1
maketh	1
my	1
way	1
perfect.	1
	1
18:33	1
He	1
maketh	1
my	1
feet	1
like	1
hinds'	1
feet,	1
and	1
setteth	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
18:34	1
He	1
teacheth	1
my	1
hands	1
to	1
war,	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
bow	1
of	1
steel	1
is	1
broken	1
by	1
mine	1
arms.	1
	1
18:35	1
Thou	1
hast	1
also	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
thy	1
salvation:	1
and	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
hath	1
holden	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
thy	1
gentleness	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
great.	1
	1
18:36	1
Thou	1
hast	1
enlarged	1
my	1
steps	1
under	1
me,	1
that	1
my	1
feet	1
did	1
not	1
slip.	1
	1
18:37	1
I	1
have	1
pursued	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
overtaken	1
them:	1
neither	1
did	1
I	1
turn	1
again	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
consumed.	1
	1
18:38	1
I	1
have	1
wounded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
rise:	1
they	1
are	1
fallen	1
under	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
18:39	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
girded	1
me	1
with	1
strength	1
unto	1
the	1
battle:	1
thou	1
hast	1
subdued	1
under	1
me	1
those	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
18:40	1
Thou	1
hast	1
also	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies;	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
destroy	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me.	1
	1
18:41	1
They	1
cried,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
save	1
them:	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
18:42	1
Then	1
did	1
I	1
beat	1
them	1
small	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
before	1
the	1
wind:	1
I	1
did	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
dirt	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
18:43	1
Thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
strivings	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
heathen:	1
a	1
people	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
shall	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
18:44	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
hear	1
of	1
me,	1
they	1
shall	1
obey	1
me:	1
the	1
strangers	1
shall	1
submit	1
themselves	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
18:45	1
The	1
strangers	1
shall	1
fade	1
away,	1
and	1
be	1
afraid	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
close	1
places.	1
	1
18:46	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth;	1
and	1
blessed	1
be	1
my	1
rock;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
18:47	1
It	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
avengeth	1
me,	1
and	1
subdueth	1
the	1
people	1
under	1
me.	1
	1
18:48	1
He	1
delivereth	1
me	1
from	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
yea,	1
thou	1
liftest	1
me	1
up	1
above	1
those	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
me:	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
violent	1
man.	1
	1
18:49	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
18:50	1
Great	1
deliverance	1
giveth	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
king;	1
and	1
sheweth	1
mercy	1
to	1
his	1
anointed,	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
	1
	1
19:1	1
The	1
heavens	1
declare	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
firmament	1
sheweth	1
his	1
handywork.	1
	1
19:2	1
Day	1
unto	1
day	1
uttereth	1
speech,	1
and	1
night	1
unto	1
night	1
sheweth	1
knowledge.	1
	1
19:3	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
speech	1
nor	1
language,	1
where	1
their	1
voice	1
is	1
not	1
heard.	1
	1
19:4	1
Their	1
line	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
In	1
them	1
hath	1
he	1
set	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
the	1
sun,	1
	1
19:5	1
Which	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
bridegroom	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chamber,	1
and	1
rejoiceth	1
as	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
to	1
run	1
a	1
race.	1
	1
19:6	1
His	1
going	1
forth	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
his	1
circuit	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
heat	1
thereof.	1
	1
19:7	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
perfect,	1
converting	1
the	1
soul:	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
sure,	1
making	1
wise	1
the	1
simple.	1
	1
19:8	1
The	1
statutes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
right,	1
rejoicing	1
the	1
heart:	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
pure,	1
enlightening	1
the	1
eyes.	1
	1
19:9	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
clean,	1
enduring	1
for	1
ever:	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
altogether.	1
	1
19:10	1
More	1
to	1
be	1
desired	1
are	1
they	1
than	1
gold,	1
yea,	1
than	1
much	1
fine	1
gold:	1
sweeter	1
also	1
than	1
honey	1
and	1
the	1
honeycomb.	1
	1
19:11	1
Moreover	1
by	1
them	1
is	1
thy	1
servant	1
warned:	1
and	1
in	1
keeping	1
of	1
them	1
there	1
is	1
great	1
reward.	1
	1
19:12	1
Who	1
can	1
understand	1
his	1
errors?	1
cleanse	1
thou	1
me	1
from	1
secret	1
faults.	1
	1
19:13	1
Keep	1
back	1
thy	1
servant	1
also	1
from	1
presumptuous	1
sins;	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
me:	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
upright,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
innocent	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
transgression.	1
	1
19:14	1
Let	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
the	1
meditation	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
be	1
acceptable	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
my	1
strength,	1
and	1
my	1
redeemer.	1
	1
	1
	1
20:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
hear	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble;	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
defend	1
thee;	1
	1
20:2	1
Send	1
thee	1
help	1
from	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
Zion;	1
	1
20:3	1
Remember	1
all	1
thy	1
offerings,	1
and	1
accept	1
thy	1
burnt	1
sacrifice;	1
Selah.	1
	1
20:4	1
Grant	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
fulfil	1
all	1
thy	1
counsel.	1
	1
20:5	1
We	1
will	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
we	1
will	1
set	1
up	1
our	1
banners:	1
the	1
LORD	1
fulfil	1
all	1
thy	1
petitions.	1
	1
20:6	1
Now	1
know	1
I	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
saveth	1
his	1
anointed;	1
he	1
will	1
hear	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
holy	1
heaven	1
with	1
the	1
saving	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
hand.	1
	1
20:7	1
Some	1
trust	1
in	1
chariots,	1
and	1
some	1
in	1
horses:	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
20:8	1
They	1
are	1
brought	1
down	1
and	1
fallen:	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
risen,	1
and	1
stand	1
upright.	1
	1
20:9	1
Save,	1
LORD:	1
let	1
the	1
king	1
hear	1
us	1
when	1
we	1
call.	1
	1
	1
	1
21:1	1
The	1
king	1
shall	1
joy	1
in	1
thy	1
strength,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
salvation	1
how	1
greatly	1
shall	1
he	1
rejoice!	1
	1
21:2	1
Thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him	1
his	1
heart's	1
desire,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
withholden	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
his	1
lips.	1
Selah.	1
	1
21:3	1
For	1
thou	1
preventest	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
goodness:	1
thou	1
settest	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
pure	1
gold	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
21:4	1
He	1
asked	1
life	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
gavest	1
it	1
him,	1
even	1
length	1
of	1
days	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
21:5	1
His	1
glory	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
thy	1
salvation:	1
honour	1
and	1
majesty	1
hast	1
thou	1
laid	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
21:6	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
him	1
most	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever:	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
him	1
exceeding	1
glad	1
with	1
thy	1
countenance.	1
	1
21:7	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
trusteth	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
21:8	1
Thine	1
hand	1
shall	1
find	1
out	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies:	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
shall	1
find	1
out	1
those	1
that	1
hate	1
thee.	1
	1
21:9	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
fiery	1
oven	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thine	1
anger:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
swallow	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
devour	1
them.	1
	1
21:10	1
Their	1
fruit	1
shalt	1
thou	1
destroy	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
seed	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
21:11	1
For	1
they	1
intended	1
evil	1
against	1
thee:	1
they	1
imagined	1
a	1
mischievous	1
device,	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
perform.	1
	1
21:12	1
Therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
them	1
turn	1
their	1
back,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
ready	1
thine	1
arrows	1
upon	1
thy	1
strings	1
against	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:13	1
Be	1
thou	1
exalted,	1
LORD,	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
strength:	1
so	1
will	1
we	1
sing	1
and	1
praise	1
thy	1
power.	1
	1
	1
	1
22:1	1
My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
forsaken	1
me?	1
why	1
art	1
thou	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
helping	1
me,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
roaring?	1
	1
22:2	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
cry	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time,	1
but	1
thou	1
hearest	1
not;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
season,	1
and	1
am	1
not	1
silent.	1
	1
22:3	1
But	1
thou	1
art	1
holy,	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
inhabitest	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:4	1
Our	1
fathers	1
trusted	1
in	1
thee:	1
they	1
trusted,	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
deliver	1
them.	1
	1
22:5	1
They	1
cried	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
were	1
delivered:	1
they	1
trusted	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
confounded.	1
	1
22:6	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
worm,	1
and	1
no	1
man;	1
a	1
reproach	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
despised	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
22:7	1
All	1
they	1
that	1
see	1
me	1
laugh	1
me	1
to	1
scorn:	1
they	1
shoot	1
out	1
the	1
lip,	1
they	1
shake	1
the	1
head,	1
saying,	1
	1
22:8	1
He	1
trusted	1
on	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
him:	1
let	1
him	1
deliver	1
him,	1
seeing	1
he	1
delighted	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
22:9	1
But	1
thou	1
art	1
he	1
that	1
took	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
womb:	1
thou	1
didst	1
make	1
me	1
hope	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
upon	1
my	1
mother's	1
breasts.	1
	1
22:10	1
I	1
was	1
cast	1
upon	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
womb:	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
God	1
from	1
my	1
mother's	1
belly.	1
	1
22:11	1
Be	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
trouble	1
is	1
near;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
help.	1
	1
22:12	1
Many	1
bulls	1
have	1
compassed	1
me:	1
strong	1
bulls	1
of	1
Bashan	1
have	1
beset	1
me	1
round.	1
	1
22:13	1
They	1
gaped	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
mouths,	1
as	1
a	1
ravening	1
and	1
a	1
roaring	1
lion.	1
	1
22:14	1
I	1
am	1
poured	1
out	1
like	1
water,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
bones	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
joint:	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
like	1
wax;	1
it	1
is	1
melted	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
bowels.	1
	1
22:15	1
My	1
strength	1
is	1
dried	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
potsherd;	1
and	1
my	1
tongue	1
cleaveth	1
to	1
my	1
jaws;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
22:16	1
For	1
dogs	1
have	1
compassed	1
me:	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
have	1
inclosed	1
me:	1
they	1
pierced	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
22:17	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
all	1
my	1
bones:	1
they	1
look	1
and	1
stare	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
22:18	1
They	1
part	1
my	1
garments	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
cast	1
lots	1
upon	1
my	1
vesture.	1
	1
22:19	1
But	1
be	1
not	1
thou	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
O	1
my	1
strength,	1
haste	1
thee	1
to	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
22:20	1
Deliver	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
sword;	1
my	1
darling	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
dog.	1
	1
22:21	1
Save	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
lion's	1
mouth:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
unicorns.	1
	1
22:22	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren:	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
will	1
I	1
praise	1
thee.	1
	1
22:23	1
Ye	1
that	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
praise	1
him;	1
all	1
ye	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
glorify	1
him;	1
and	1
fear	1
him,	1
all	1
ye	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:24	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
despised	1
nor	1
abhorred	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
the	1
afflicted;	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
him;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
heard.	1
	1
22:25	1
My	1
praise	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
congregation:	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
my	1
vows	1
before	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him.	1
	1
22:26	1
The	1
meek	1
shall	1
eat	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied:	1
they	1
shall	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
seek	1
him:	1
your	1
heart	1
shall	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
22:27	1
All	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
remember	1
and	1
turn	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
worship	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
22:28	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's:	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
governor	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
22:29	1
All	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
fat	1
upon	1
earth	1
shall	1
eat	1
and	1
worship:	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dust	1
shall	1
bow	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
none	1
can	1
keep	1
alive	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
22:30	1
A	1
seed	1
shall	1
serve	1
him;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
accounted	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
a	1
generation.	1
	1
22:31	1
They	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
born,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
this.	1
	1
	1
	1
23:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
shepherd;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
want.	1
	1
23:2	1
He	1
maketh	1
me	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
green	1
pastures:	1
he	1
leadeth	1
me	1
beside	1
the	1
still	1
waters.	1
	1
23:3	1
He	1
restoreth	1
my	1
soul:	1
he	1
leadeth	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
righteousness	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
23:4	1
Yea,	1
though	1
I	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
I	1
will	1
fear	1
no	1
evil:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
with	1
me;	1
thy	1
rod	1
and	1
thy	1
staff	1
they	1
comfort	1
me.	1
	1
23:5	1
Thou	1
preparest	1
a	1
table	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
thou	1
anointest	1
my	1
head	1
with	1
oil;	1
my	1
cup	1
runneth	1
over.	1
	1
23:6	1
Surely	1
goodness	1
and	1
mercy	1
shall	1
follow	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
24:1	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof;	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
24:2	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
founded	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
established	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
floods.	1
	1
24:3	1
Who	1
shall	1
ascend	1
into	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
or	1
who	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
place?	1
	1
24:4	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
clean	1
hands,	1
and	1
a	1
pure	1
heart;	1
who	1
hath	1
not	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
soul	1
unto	1
vanity,	1
nor	1
sworn	1
deceitfully.	1
	1
24:5	1
He	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
blessing	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
righteousness	1
from	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
salvation.	1
	1
24:6	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
generation	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
him,	1
that	1
seek	1
thy	1
face,	1
O	1
Jacob.	1
Selah.	1
	1
24:7	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads,	1
O	1
ye	1
gates;	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
lift	1
up,	1
ye	1
everlasting	1
doors;	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
glory	1
shall	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
24:8	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
King	1
of	1
glory?	1
The	1
LORD	1
strong	1
and	1
mighty,	1
the	1
LORD	1
mighty	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
24:9	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads,	1
O	1
ye	1
gates;	1
even	1
lift	1
them	1
up,	1
ye	1
everlasting	1
doors;	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
glory	1
shall	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
24:10	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
King	1
of	1
glory?	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
glory.	1
Selah.	1
	1
	1
	1
25:1	1
Unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
do	1
I	1
lift	1
up	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
25:2	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
thee:	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
let	1
not	1
mine	1
enemies	1
triumph	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
25:3	1
Yea,	1
let	1
none	1
that	1
wait	1
on	1
thee	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
ashamed	1
which	1
transgress	1
without	1
cause.	1
	1
25:4	1
Shew	1
me	1
thy	1
ways,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
teach	1
me	1
thy	1
paths.	1
	1
25:5	1
Lead	1
me	1
in	1
thy	1
truth,	1
and	1
teach	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation;	1
on	1
thee	1
do	1
I	1
wait	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
25:6	1
Remember,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thy	1
tender	1
mercies	1
and	1
thy	1
lovingkindnesses;	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
ever	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
25:7	1
Remember	1
not	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
my	1
youth,	1
nor	1
my	1
transgressions:	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
mercy	1
remember	1
thou	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
goodness'	1
sake,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:8	1
Good	1
and	1
upright	1
is	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
will	1
he	1
teach	1
sinners	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
25:9	1
The	1
meek	1
will	1
he	1
guide	1
in	1
judgment:	1
and	1
the	1
meek	1
will	1
he	1
teach	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
25:10	1
All	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
unto	1
such	1
as	1
keep	1
his	1
covenant	1
and	1
his	1
testimonies.	1
	1
25:11	1
For	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
pardon	1
mine	1
iniquity;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
great.	1
	1
25:12	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
feareth	1
the	1
LORD?	1
him	1
shall	1
he	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
choose.	1
	1
25:13	1
His	1
soul	1
shall	1
dwell	1
at	1
ease;	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
25:14	1
The	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
them	1
his	1
covenant.	1
	1
25:15	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
are	1
ever	1
toward	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
pluck	1
my	1
feet	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
net.	1
	1
25:16	1
Turn	1
thee	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
desolate	1
and	1
afflicted.	1
	1
25:17	1
The	1
troubles	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
are	1
enlarged:	1
O	1
bring	1
thou	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
distresses.	1
	1
25:18	1
Look	1
upon	1
mine	1
affliction	1
and	1
my	1
pain;	1
and	1
forgive	1
all	1
my	1
sins.	1
	1
25:19	1
Consider	1
mine	1
enemies;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
many;	1
and	1
they	1
hate	1
me	1
with	1
cruel	1
hatred.	1
	1
25:20	1
O	1
keep	1
my	1
soul,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me:	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
for	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
trust	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
25:21	1
Let	1
integrity	1
and	1
uprightness	1
preserve	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
wait	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
25:22	1
Redeem	1
Israel,	1
O	1
God,	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
troubles.	1
	1
	1
	1
26:1	1
Judge	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
in	1
mine	1
integrity:	1
I	1
have	1
trusted	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
therefore	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
slide.	1
	1
26:2	1
Examine	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
prove	1
me;	1
try	1
my	1
reins	1
and	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
26:3	1
For	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
is	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
in	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
26:4	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sat	1
with	1
vain	1
persons,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
go	1
in	1
with	1
dissemblers.	1
	1
26:5	1
I	1
have	1
hated	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
evil	1
doers;	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
sit	1
with	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
26:6	1
I	1
will	1
wash	1
mine	1
hands	1
in	1
innocency:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
compass	1
thine	1
altar,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
	1
26:7	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
publish	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
tell	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
wondrous	1
works.	1
	1
26:8	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
thy	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thine	1
honour	1
dwelleth.	1
	1
26:9	1
Gather	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
with	1
sinners,	1
nor	1
my	1
life	1
with	1
bloody	1
men:	1
	1
26:10	1
In	1
whose	1
hands	1
is	1
mischief,	1
and	1
their	1
right	1
hand	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
bribes.	1
	1
26:11	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
mine	1
integrity:	1
redeem	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
26:12	1
My	1
foot	1
standeth	1
in	1
an	1
even	1
place:	1
in	1
the	1
congregations	1
will	1
I	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
27:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
light	1
and	1
my	1
salvation;	1
whom	1
shall	1
I	1
fear?	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
my	1
life;	1
of	1
whom	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
afraid?	1
	1
27:2	1
When	1
the	1
wicked,	1
even	1
mine	1
enemies	1
and	1
my	1
foes,	1
came	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
eat	1
up	1
my	1
flesh,	1
they	1
stumbled	1
and	1
fell.	1
	1
27:3	1
Though	1
an	1
host	1
should	1
encamp	1
against	1
me,	1
my	1
heart	1
shall	1
not	1
fear:	1
though	1
war	1
should	1
rise	1
against	1
me,	1
in	1
this	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
confident.	1
	1
27:4	1
One	1
thing	1
have	1
I	1
desired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
seek	1
after;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life,	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
enquire	1
in	1
his	1
temple.	1
	1
27:5	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
trouble	1
he	1
shall	1
hide	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
pavilion:	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
his	1
tabernacle	1
shall	1
he	1
hide	1
me;	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
me	1
up	1
upon	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
now	1
shall	1
mine	1
head	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
above	1
mine	1
enemies	1
round	1
about	1
me:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
offer	1
in	1
his	1
tabernacle	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
joy;	1
I	1
will	1
sing,	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:7	1
Hear,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
cry	1
with	1
my	1
voice:	1
have	1
mercy	1
also	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
answer	1
me.	1
	1
27:8	1
When	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
Seek	1
ye	1
my	1
face;	1
my	1
heart	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Thy	1
face,	1
LORD,	1
will	1
I	1
seek.	1
	1
27:9	1
Hide	1
not	1
thy	1
face	1
far	1
from	1
me;	1
put	1
not	1
thy	1
servant	1
away	1
in	1
anger:	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
my	1
help;	1
leave	1
me	1
not,	1
neither	1
forsake	1
me,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
27:10	1
When	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
forsake	1
me,	1
then	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
up.	1
	1
27:11	1
Teach	1
me	1
thy	1
way,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
lead	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
plain	1
path,	1
because	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
	1
27:12	1
Deliver	1
me	1
not	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
for	1
false	1
witnesses	1
are	1
risen	1
up	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
breathe	1
out	1
cruelty.	1
	1
27:13	1
I	1
had	1
fainted,	1
unless	1
I	1
had	1
believed	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
27:14	1
Wait	1
on	1
the	1
LORD:	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
strengthen	1
thine	1
heart:	1
wait,	1
I	1
say,	1
on	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
28:1	1
Unto	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
cry,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
rock;	1
be	1
not	1
silent	1
to	1
me:	1
lest,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
silent	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
become	1
like	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
28:2	1
Hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
supplications,	1
when	1
I	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee,	1
when	1
I	1
lift	1
up	1
my	1
hands	1
toward	1
thy	1
holy	1
oracle.	1
	1
28:3	1
Draw	1
me	1
not	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity,	1
which	1
speak	1
peace	1
to	1
their	1
neighbours,	1
but	1
mischief	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
28:4	1
Give	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
deeds,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
their	1
endeavours:	1
give	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
hands;	1
render	1
to	1
them	1
their	1
desert.	1
	1
28:5	1
Because	1
they	1
regard	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
he	1
shall	1
destroy	1
them,	1
and	1
not	1
build	1
them	1
up.	1
	1
28:6	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
supplications.	1
	1
28:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
my	1
shield;	1
my	1
heart	1
trusted	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
helped:	1
therefore	1
my	1
heart	1
greatly	1
rejoiceth;	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
song	1
will	1
I	1
praise	1
him.	1
	1
28:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
their	1
strength,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
saving	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
anointed.	1
	1
28:9	1
Save	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
bless	1
thine	1
inheritance:	1
feed	1
them	1
also,	1
and	1
lift	1
them	1
up	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
29:1	1
Give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
ye	1
mighty,	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
glory	1
and	1
strength.	1
	1
29:2	1
Give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
glory	1
due	1
unto	1
his	1
name;	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
holiness.	1
	1
29:3	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
waters:	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
glory	1
thundereth:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
many	1
waters.	1
	1
29:4	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
powerful;	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
majesty.	1
	1
29:5	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
breaketh	1
the	1
cedars;	1
yea,	1
the	1
LORD	1
breaketh	1
the	1
cedars	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
29:6	1
He	1
maketh	1
them	1
also	1
to	1
skip	1
like	1
a	1
calf;	1
Lebanon	1
and	1
Sirion	1
like	1
a	1
young	1
unicorn.	1
	1
29:7	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
divideth	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
29:8	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shaketh	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
the	1
LORD	1
shaketh	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Kadesh.	1
	1
29:9	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
maketh	1
the	1
hinds	1
to	1
calve,	1
and	1
discovereth	1
the	1
forests:	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
temple	1
doth	1
every	1
one	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
29:10	1
The	1
LORD	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
flood;	1
yea,	1
the	1
LORD	1
sitteth	1
King	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
29:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
give	1
strength	1
unto	1
his	1
people;	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
bless	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
peace.	1
	1
	1
	1
30:1	1
I	1
will	1
extol	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
lifted	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
made	1
my	1
foes	1
to	1
rejoice	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
30:2	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
healed	1
me.	1
	1
30:3	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
up	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
grave:	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
me	1
alive,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
30:4	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
ye	1
saints	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
give	1
thanks	1
at	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
30:5	1
For	1
his	1
anger	1
endureth	1
but	1
a	1
moment;	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
is	1
life:	1
weeping	1
may	1
endure	1
for	1
a	1
night,	1
but	1
joy	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
in	1
my	1
prosperity	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
30:7	1
LORD,	1
by	1
thy	1
favour	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
my	1
mountain	1
to	1
stand	1
strong:	1
thou	1
didst	1
hide	1
thy	1
face,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
troubled.	1
	1
30:8	1
I	1
cried	1
to	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
I	1
made	1
supplication.	1
	1
30:9	1
What	1
profit	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
my	1
blood,	1
when	1
I	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit?	1
Shall	1
the	1
dust	1
praise	1
thee?	1
shall	1
it	1
declare	1
thy	1
truth?	1
	1
30:10	1
Hear,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me:	1
LORD,	1
be	1
thou	1
my	1
helper.	1
	1
30:11	1
Thou	1
hast	1
turned	1
for	1
me	1
my	1
mourning	1
into	1
dancing:	1
thou	1
hast	1
put	1
off	1
my	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
girded	1
me	1
with	1
gladness;	1
	1
30:12	1
To	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
my	1
glory	1
may	1
sing	1
praise	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
silent.	1
	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
31:1	1
In	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
do	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
trust;	1
let	1
me	1
never	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
deliver	1
me	1
in	1
thy	1
righteousness.	1
	1
31:2	1
Bow	1
down	1
thine	1
ear	1
to	1
me;	1
deliver	1
me	1
speedily:	1
be	1
thou	1
my	1
strong	1
rock,	1
for	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
defence	1
to	1
save	1
me.	1
	1
31:3	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
rock	1
and	1
my	1
fortress;	1
therefore	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake	1
lead	1
me,	1
and	1
guide	1
me.	1
	1
31:4	1
Pull	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
net	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
privily	1
for	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
strength.	1
	1
31:5	1
Into	1
thine	1
hand	1
I	1
commit	1
my	1
spirit:	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
truth.	1
	1
31:6	1
I	1
have	1
hated	1
them	1
that	1
regard	1
lying	1
vanities:	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:7	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
mercy:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
considered	1
my	1
trouble;	1
thou	1
hast	1
known	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
adversities;	1
	1
31:8	1
And	1
hast	1
not	1
shut	1
me	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
enemy:	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
my	1
feet	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
room.	1
	1
31:9	1
Have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
trouble:	1
mine	1
eye	1
is	1
consumed	1
with	1
grief,	1
yea,	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
my	1
belly.	1
	1
31:10	1
For	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
spent	1
with	1
grief,	1
and	1
my	1
years	1
with	1
sighing:	1
my	1
strength	1
faileth	1
because	1
of	1
mine	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
my	1
bones	1
are	1
consumed.	1
	1
31:11	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
reproach	1
among	1
all	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
but	1
especially	1
among	1
my	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
a	1
fear	1
to	1
mine	1
acquaintance:	1
they	1
that	1
did	1
see	1
me	1
without	1
fled	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
31:12	1
I	1
am	1
forgotten	1
as	1
a	1
dead	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
mind:	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
broken	1
vessel.	1
	1
31:13	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
slander	1
of	1
many:	1
fear	1
was	1
on	1
every	1
side:	1
while	1
they	1
took	1
counsel	1
together	1
against	1
me,	1
they	1
devised	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
31:14	1
But	1
I	1
trusted	1
in	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
I	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
31:15	1
My	1
times	1
are	1
in	1
thy	1
hand:	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
persecute	1
me.	1
	1
31:16	1
Make	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
shine	1
upon	1
thy	1
servant:	1
save	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
mercies'	1
sake.	1
	1
31:17	1
Let	1
me	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
upon	1
thee:	1
let	1
the	1
wicked	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
silent	1
in	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
31:18	1
Let	1
the	1
lying	1
lips	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
silence;	1
which	1
speak	1
grievous	1
things	1
proudly	1
and	1
contemptuously	1
against	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
31:19	1
Oh	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
thy	1
goodness,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
thee;	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
wrought	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
thee	1
before	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men!	1
	1
31:20	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
hide	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
thy	1
presence	1
from	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
man:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
them	1
secretly	1
in	1
a	1
pavilion	1
from	1
the	1
strife	1
of	1
tongues.	1
	1
31:21	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
his	1
marvellous	1
kindness	1
in	1
a	1
strong	1
city.	1
	1
31:22	1
For	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
my	1
haste,	1
I	1
am	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
before	1
thine	1
eyes:	1
nevertheless	1
thou	1
heardest	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
supplications	1
when	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
31:23	1
O	1
love	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
his	1
saints:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
preserveth	1
the	1
faithful,	1
and	1
plentifully	1
rewardeth	1
the	1
proud	1
doer.	1
	1
31:24	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
strengthen	1
your	1
heart,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
hope	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
32:1	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
whose	1
transgression	1
is	1
forgiven,	1
whose	1
sin	1
is	1
covered.	1
	1
32:2	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
imputeth	1
not	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
in	1
whose	1
spirit	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
guile.	1
	1
32:3	1
When	1
I	1
kept	1
silence,	1
my	1
bones	1
waxed	1
old	1
through	1
my	1
roaring	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long.	1
	1
32:4	1
For	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
thy	1
hand	1
was	1
heavy	1
upon	1
me:	1
my	1
moisture	1
is	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
drought	1
of	1
summer.	1
Selah.	1
	1
32:5	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
my	1
sin	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
mine	1
iniquity	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
hid.	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
my	1
transgressions	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
thou	1
forgavest	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
my	1
sin.	1
Selah.	1
	1
32:6	1
For	1
this	1
shall	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
godly	1
pray	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
found:	1
surely	1
in	1
the	1
floods	1
of	1
great	1
waters	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
32:7	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
hiding	1
place;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
preserve	1
me	1
from	1
trouble;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
compass	1
me	1
about	1
with	1
songs	1
of	1
deliverance.	1
Selah.	1
	1
32:8	1
I	1
will	1
instruct	1
thee	1
and	1
teach	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go:	1
I	1
will	1
guide	1
thee	1
with	1
mine	1
eye.	1
	1
32:9	1
Be	1
ye	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
horse,	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
mule,	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
understanding:	1
whose	1
mouth	1
must	1
be	1
held	1
in	1
with	1
bit	1
and	1
bridle,	1
lest	1
they	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
32:10	1
Many	1
sorrows	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
wicked:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
mercy	1
shall	1
compass	1
him	1
about.	1
	1
32:11	1
Be	1
glad	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
ye	1
righteous:	1
and	1
shout	1
for	1
joy,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
upright	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
	1
	1
33:1	1
Rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
ye	1
righteous:	1
for	1
praise	1
is	1
comely	1
for	1
the	1
upright.	1
	1
33:2	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
harp:	1
sing	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
psaltery	1
and	1
an	1
instrument	1
of	1
ten	1
strings.	1
	1
33:3	1
Sing	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
new	1
song;	1
play	1
skilfully	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
noise.	1
	1
33:4	1
For	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
right;	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
are	1
done	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
33:5	1
He	1
loveth	1
righteousness	1
and	1
judgment:	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
33:6	1
By	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
were	1
the	1
heavens	1
made;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
33:7	1
He	1
gathereth	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
together	1
as	1
an	1
heap:	1
he	1
layeth	1
up	1
the	1
depth	1
in	1
storehouses.	1
	1
33:8	1
Let	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD:	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
stand	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
33:9	1
For	1
he	1
spake,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
done;	1
he	1
commanded,	1
and	1
it	1
stood	1
fast.	1
	1
33:10	1
The	1
LORD	1
bringeth	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
to	1
nought:	1
he	1
maketh	1
the	1
devices	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
33:11	1
The	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
standeth	1
for	1
ever,	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
33:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
nation	1
whose	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
inheritance.	1
	1
33:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
looketh	1
from	1
heaven;	1
he	1
beholdeth	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
33:14	1
From	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
habitation	1
he	1
looketh	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
33:15	1
He	1
fashioneth	1
their	1
hearts	1
alike;	1
he	1
considereth	1
all	1
their	1
works.	1

33:16	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
king	1
saved	1
by	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
an	1
host:	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
delivered	1
by	1
much	1
strength.	1
	1
33:17	1
An	1
horse	1
is	1
a	1
vain	1
thing	1
for	1
safety:	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
deliver	1
any	1
by	1
his	1
great	1
strength.	1
	1
33:18	1
Behold,	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him,	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
hope	1
in	1
his	1
mercy;	1
	1
33:19	1
To	1
deliver	1
their	1
soul	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
alive	1
in	1
famine.	1
	1
33:20	1
Our	1
soul	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
help	1
and	1
our	1
shield.	1
	1
33:21	1
For	1
our	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
him,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
trusted	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
name.	1
	1
33:22	1
Let	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
be	1
upon	1
us,	1
according	1
as	1
we	1
hope	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
	1
	1
34:1	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
all	1
times:	1
his	1
praise	1
shall	1
continually	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
34:2	1
My	1
soul	1
shall	1
make	1
her	1
boast	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
humble	1
shall	1
hear	1
thereof,	1
and	1
be	1
glad.	1
	1
34:3	1
O	1
magnify	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
exalt	1
his	1
name	1
together.	1
	1
34:4	1
I	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
me,	1
and	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
my	1
fears.	1
	1
34:5	1
They	1
looked	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
were	1
lightened:	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
not	1
ashamed.	1
	1
34:6	1
This	1
poor	1
man	1
cried,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
saved	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
troubles.	1
	1
34:7	1
The	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
encampeth	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him,	1
and	1
delivereth	1
them.	1
	1
34:8	1
O	1
taste	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
good:	1
blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
34:9	1
O	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
his	1
saints:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
want	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him.	1
	1
34:10	1
The	1
young	1
lions	1
do	1
lack,	1
and	1
suffer	1
hunger:	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
good	1
thing.	1
	1
34:11	1
Come,	1
ye	1
children,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
34:12	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
desireth	1
life,	1
and	1
loveth	1
many	1
days,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
see	1
good?	1
	1
34:13	1
Keep	1
thy	1
tongue	1
from	1
evil,	1
and	1
thy	1
lips	1
from	1
speaking	1
guile.	1
	1
34:14	1
Depart	1
from	1
evil,	1
and	1
do	1
good;	1
seek	1
peace,	1
and	1
pursue	1
it.	1
	1
34:15	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
his	1
ears	1
are	1
open	1
unto	1
their	1
cry.	1
	1
34:16	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
evil,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
34:17	1
The	1
righteous	1
cry,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
heareth,	1
and	1
delivereth	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
troubles.	1
	1
34:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
nigh	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
broken	1
heart;	1
and	1
saveth	1
such	1
as	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
contrite	1
spirit.	1
	1
34:19	1
Many	1
are	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
the	1
righteous:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivereth	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
34:20	1
He	1
keepeth	1
all	1
his	1
bones:	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
broken.	1
	1
34:21	1
Evil	1
shall	1
slay	1
the	1
wicked:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hate	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate.	1
	1
34:22	1
The	1
LORD	1
redeemeth	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
his	1
servants:	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate.	1
	1
	1
	1
35:1	1
Plead	1
my	1
cause,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
strive	1
with	1
me:	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
35:2	1
Take	1
hold	1
of	1
shield	1
and	1
buckler,	1
and	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
mine	1
help.	1
	1
35:3	1
Draw	1
out	1
also	1
the	1
spear,	1
and	1
stop	1
the	1
way	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
persecute	1
me:	1
say	1
unto	1
my	1
soul,	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
salvation.	1
	1
35:4	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
confounded	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
shame	1
that	1
seek	1
after	1
my	1
soul:	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
turned	1
back	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
confusion	1
that	1
devise	1
my	1
hurt.	1
	1
35:5	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
as	1
chaff	1
before	1
the	1
wind:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
chase	1
them.	1
	1
35:6	1
Let	1
their	1
way	1
be	1
dark	1
and	1
slippery:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
persecute	1
them.	1
	1
35:7	1
For	1
without	1
cause	1
have	1
they	1
hid	1
for	1
me	1
their	1
net	1
in	1
a	1
pit,	1
which	1
without	1
cause	1
they	1
have	1
digged	1
for	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
35:8	1
Let	1
destruction	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
unawares;	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
net	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
hid	1
catch	1
himself:	1
into	1
that	1
very	1
destruction	1
let	1
him	1
fall.	1
	1
35:9	1
And	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
joyful	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
salvation.	1
	1
35:10	1
All	1
my	1
bones	1
shall	1
say,	1
LORD,	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
which	1
deliverest	1
the	1
poor	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
him,	1
yea,	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
spoileth	1
him?	1
	1
35:11	1
False	1
witnesses	1
did	1
rise	1
up;	1
they	1
laid	1
to	1
my	1
charge	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
not.	1
	1
35:12	1
They	1
rewarded	1
me	1
evil	1
for	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
spoiling	1
of	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
35:13	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
sick,	1
my	1
clothing	1
was	1
sackcloth:	1
I	1
humbled	1
my	1
soul	1
with	1
fasting;	1
and	1
my	1
prayer	1
returned	1
into	1
mine	1
own	1
bosom.	1
	1
35:14	1
I	1
behaved	1
myself	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
friend	1
or	1
brother:	1
I	1
bowed	1
down	1
heavily,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
mourneth	1
for	1
his	1
mother.	1
	1
35:15	1
But	1
in	1
mine	1
adversity	1
they	1
rejoiced,	1
and	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together:	1
yea,	1
the	1
abjects	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
not;	1
they	1
did	1
tear	1
me,	1
and	1
ceased	1
not:	1
	1
35:16	1
With	1
hypocritical	1
mockers	1
in	1
feasts,	1
they	1
gnashed	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
teeth.	1
	1
35:17	1
Lord,	1
how	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
look	1
on?	1
rescue	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
their	1
destructions,	1
my	1
darling	1
from	1
the	1
lions.	1
	1
35:18	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
thanks	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
congregation:	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee	1
among	1
much	1
people.	1
	1
35:19	1
Let	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
mine	1
enemies	1
wrongfully	1
rejoice	1
over	1
me:	1
neither	1
let	1
them	1
wink	1
with	1
the	1
eye	1
that	1
hate	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause.	1
	1
35:20	1
For	1
they	1
speak	1
not	1
peace:	1
but	1
they	1
devise	1
deceitful	1
matters	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
quiet	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
35:21	1
Yea,	1
they	1
opened	1
their	1
mouth	1
wide	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
Aha,	1
aha,	1
our	1
eye	1
hath	1
seen	1
it.	1
	1
35:22	1
This	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
keep	1
not	1
silence:	1
O	1
Lord,	1
be	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
35:23	1
Stir	1
up	1
thyself,	1
and	1
awake	1
to	1
my	1
judgment,	1
even	1
unto	1
my	1
cause,	1
my	1
God	1
and	1
my	1
Lord.	1
	1
35:24	1
Judge	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
rejoice	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
35:25	1
Let	1
them	1
not	1
say	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
Ah,	1
so	1
would	1
we	1
have	1
it:	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
swallowed	1
him	1
up.	1
	1
35:26	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
confusion	1
together	1
that	1
rejoice	1
at	1
mine	1
hurt:	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
dishonour	1
that	1
magnify	1
themselves	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
35:27	1
Let	1
them	1
shout	1
for	1
joy,	1
and	1
be	1
glad,	1
that	1
favour	1
my	1
righteous	1
cause:	1
yea,	1
let	1
them	1
say	1
continually,	1
Let	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
magnified,	1
which	1
hath	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
35:28	1
And	1
my	1
tongue	1
shall	1
speak	1
of	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
praise	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long.	1
	1
	1
	1
36:1	1
The	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
saith	1
within	1
my	1
heart,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
36:2	1
For	1
he	1
flattereth	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes,	1
until	1
his	1
iniquity	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
hateful.	1
	1
36:3	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
are	1
iniquity	1
and	1
deceit:	1
he	1
hath	1
left	1
off	1
to	1
be	1
wise,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
good.	1
	1
36:4	1
He	1
deviseth	1
mischief	1
upon	1
his	1
bed;	1
he	1
setteth	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
good;	1
he	1
abhorreth	1
not	1
evil.	1
	1
36:5	1
Thy	1
mercy,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
heavens;	1
and	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
the	1
clouds.	1
	1
36:6	1
Thy	1
righteousness	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
great	1
mountains;	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
deep:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
preservest	1
man	1
and	1
beast.	1
	1
36:7	1
How	1
excellent	1
is	1
thy	1
lovingkindness,	1
O	1
God!	1
therefore	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
thy	1
wings.	1
	1
36:8	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
abundantly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
fatness	1
of	1
thy	1
house;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
them	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
thy	1
pleasures.	1
	1
36:9	1
For	1
with	1
thee	1
is	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
life:	1
in	1
thy	1
light	1
shall	1
we	1
see	1
light.	1
	1
36:10	1
O	1
continue	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
thee;	1
and	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
to	1
the	1
upright	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
36:11	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
pride	1
come	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
remove	1
me.	1
	1
36:12	1
There	1
are	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
fallen:	1
they	1
are	1
cast	1
down,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
rise.	1
	1
	1
	1
37:1	1
Fret	1
not	1
thyself	1
because	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
neither	1
be	1
thou	1
envious	1
against	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
37:2	1
For	1
they	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
cut	1
down	1
like	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
wither	1
as	1
the	1
green	1
herb.	1
	1
37:3	1
Trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
do	1
good;	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
verily	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
fed.	1
	1
37:4	1
Delight	1
thyself	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
37:5	1
Commit	1
thy	1
way	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
trust	1
also	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
37:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
as	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
thy	1
judgment	1
as	1
the	1
noonday.	1
	1
37:7	1
Rest	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
wait	1
patiently	1
for	1
him:	1
fret	1
not	1
thyself	1
because	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
prospereth	1
in	1
his	1
way,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
bringeth	1
wicked	1
devices	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
37:8	1
Cease	1
from	1
anger,	1
and	1
forsake	1
wrath:	1
fret	1
not	1
thyself	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
to	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
37:9	1
For	1
evildoers	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off:	1
but	1
those	1
that	1
wait	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
37:10	1
For	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
not	1
be:	1
yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
diligently	1
consider	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be.	1
	1
37:11	1
But	1
the	1
meek	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
shall	1
delight	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
37:12	1
The	1
wicked	1
plotteth	1
against	1
the	1
just,	1
and	1
gnasheth	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
teeth.	1
	1
37:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
laugh	1
at	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
seeth	1
that	1
his	1
day	1
is	1
coming.	1
	1
37:14	1
The	1
wicked	1
have	1
drawn	1
out	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
have	1
bent	1
their	1
bow,	1
to	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy,	1
and	1
to	1
slay	1
such	1
as	1
be	1
of	1
upright	1
conversation.	1
	1
37:15	1
Their	1
sword	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
their	1
bows	1
shall	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
37:16	1
A	1
little	1
that	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
hath	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
many	1
wicked.	1
	1
37:17	1
For	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
broken:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
upholdeth	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
37:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
knoweth	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
upright:	1
and	1
their	1
inheritance	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
37:19	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
in	1
the	1
evil	1
time:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
famine	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied.	1
	1
37:20	1
But	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
lambs:	1
they	1
shall	1
consume;	1
into	1
smoke	1
shall	1
they	1
consume	1
away.	1
	1
37:21	1
The	1
wicked	1
borroweth,	1
and	1
payeth	1
not	1
again:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
sheweth	1
mercy,	1
and	1
giveth.	1
	1
37:22	1
For	1
such	1
as	1
be	1
blessed	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
cursed	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
37:23	1
The	1
steps	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
are	1
ordered	1
by	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
he	1
delighteth	1
in	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
37:24	1
Though	1
he	1
fall,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
utterly	1
cast	1
down:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
upholdeth	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
37:25	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
young,	1
and	1
now	1
am	1
old;	1
yet	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
righteous	1
forsaken,	1
nor	1
his	1
seed	1
begging	1
bread.	1
	1
37:26	1
He	1
is	1
ever	1
merciful,	1
and	1
lendeth;	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
is	1
blessed.	1
	1
37:27	1
Depart	1
from	1
evil,	1
and	1
do	1
good;	1
and	1
dwell	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
37:28	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
loveth	1
judgment,	1
and	1
forsaketh	1
not	1
his	1
saints;	1
they	1
are	1
preserved	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
37:29	1
The	1
righteous	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
dwell	1
therein	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
37:30	1
The	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
speaketh	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
his	1
tongue	1
talketh	1
of	1
judgment.	1
	1
37:31	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
his	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
heart;	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
steps	1
shall	1
slide.	1
	1
37:32	1
The	1
wicked	1
watcheth	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
seeketh	1
to	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
37:33	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
nor	1
condemn	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
judged.	1
	1
37:34	1
Wait	1
on	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
exalt	1
thee	1
to	1
inherit	1
the	1
land:	1
when	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
cut	1
off,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
37:35	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
wicked	1
in	1
great	1
power,	1
and	1
spreading	1
himself	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
bay	1
tree.	1
	1
37:36	1
Yet	1
he	1
passed	1
away,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
he	1
was	1
not:	1
yea,	1
I	1
sought	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
37:37	1
Mark	1
the	1
perfect	1
man,	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
upright:	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
peace.	1
	1
37:38	1
But	1
the	1
transgressors	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
together:	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
37:39	1
But	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
is	1
their	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
37:40	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
help	1
them,	1
and	1
deliver	1
them:	1
he	1
shall	1
deliver	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
save	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
38:1	1
O	1
lord,	1
rebuke	1
me	1
not	1
in	1
thy	1
wrath:	1
neither	1
chasten	1
me	1
in	1
thy	1
hot	1
displeasure.	1
	1
38:2	1
For	1
thine	1
arrows	1
stick	1
fast	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
thy	1
hand	1
presseth	1
me	1
sore.	1
	1
38:3	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
soundness	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
because	1
of	1
thine	1
anger;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
rest	1
in	1
my	1
bones	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
sin.	1
	1
38:4	1
For	1
mine	1
iniquities	1
are	1
gone	1
over	1
mine	1
head:	1
as	1
an	1
heavy	1
burden	1
they	1
are	1
too	1
heavy	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
38:5	1
My	1
wounds	1
stink	1
and	1
are	1
corrupt	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
foolishness.	1
	1
38:6	1
I	1
am	1
troubled;	1
I	1
am	1
bowed	1
down	1
greatly;	1
I	1
go	1
mourning	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long.	1
	1
38:7	1
For	1
my	1
loins	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
a	1
loathsome	1
disease:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
soundness	1
in	1
my	1
flesh.	1
	1
38:8	1
I	1
am	1
feeble	1
and	1
sore	1
broken:	1
I	1
have	1
roared	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
disquietness	1
of	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
38:9	1
Lord,	1
all	1
my	1
desire	1
is	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
my	1
groaning	1
is	1
not	1
hid	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
38:10	1
My	1
heart	1
panteth,	1
my	1
strength	1
faileth	1
me:	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
it	1
also	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
38:11	1
My	1
lovers	1
and	1
my	1
friends	1
stand	1
aloof	1
from	1
my	1
sore;	1
and	1
my	1
kinsmen	1
stand	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
38:12	1
They	1
also	1
that	1
seek	1
after	1
my	1
life	1
lay	1
snares	1
for	1
me:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
my	1
hurt	1
speak	1
mischievous	1
things,	1
and	1
imagine	1
deceits	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long.	1
	1
38:13	1
But	1
I,	1
as	1
a	1
deaf	1
man,	1
heard	1
not;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
dumb	1
man	1
that	1
openeth	1
not	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
38:14	1
Thus	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
heareth	1
not,	1
and	1
in	1
whose	1
mouth	1
are	1
no	1
reproofs.	1
	1
38:15	1
For	1
in	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
do	1
I	1
hope:	1
thou	1
wilt	1
hear,	1
O	1
Lord	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
38:16	1
For	1
I	1
said,	1
Hear	1
me,	1
lest	1
otherwise	1
they	1
should	1
rejoice	1
over	1
me:	1
when	1
my	1
foot	1
slippeth,	1
they	1
magnify	1
themselves	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
38:17	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
halt,	1
and	1
my	1
sorrow	1
is	1
continually	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
38:18	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
mine	1
iniquity;	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
my	1
sin.	1
	1
38:19	1
But	1
mine	1
enemies	1
are	1
lively,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
strong:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hate	1
me	1
wrongfully	1
are	1
multiplied.	1
	1
38:20	1
They	1
also	1
that	1
render	1
evil	1
for	1
good	1
are	1
mine	1
adversaries;	1
because	1
I	1
follow	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
good	1
is.	1
	1
38:21	1
Forsake	1
me	1
not,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
be	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
38:22	1
Make	1
haste	1
to	1
help	1
me,	1
O	1
Lord	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
	1
	1
39:1	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
my	1
ways,	1
that	1
I	1
sin	1
not	1
with	1
my	1
tongue:	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
my	1
mouth	1
with	1
a	1
bridle,	1
while	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
39:2	1
I	1
was	1
dumb	1
with	1
silence,	1
I	1
held	1
my	1
peace,	1
even	1
from	1
good;	1
and	1
my	1
sorrow	1
was	1
stirred.	1
	1
39:3	1
My	1
heart	1
was	1
hot	1
within	1
me,	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
musing	1
the	1
fire	1
burned:	1
then	1
spake	1
I	1
with	1
my	1
tongue,	1
	1
39:4	1
LORD,	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
mine	1
end,	1
and	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
my	1
days,	1
what	1
it	1
is:	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
frail	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
39:5	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
my	1
days	1
as	1
an	1
handbreadth;	1
and	1
mine	1
age	1
is	1
as	1
nothing	1
before	1
thee:	1
verily	1
every	1
man	1
at	1
his	1
best	1
state	1
is	1
altogether	1
vanity.	1
	1
Selah.	1
	1
39:6	1
Surely	1
every	1
man	1
walketh	1
in	1
a	1
vain	1
shew:	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
disquieted	1
in	1
vain:	1
he	1
heapeth	1
up	1
riches,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
not	1
who	1
shall	1
gather	1
them.	1
	1
39:7	1
And	1
now,	1
Lord,	1
what	1
wait	1
I	1
for?	1
my	1
hope	1
is	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
39:8	1
Deliver	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
my	1
transgressions:	1
make	1
me	1
not	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
the	1
foolish.	1
	1
39:9	1
I	1
was	1
dumb,	1
I	1
opened	1
not	1
my	1
mouth;	1
because	1
thou	1
didst	1
it.	1
	1
39:10	1
Remove	1
thy	1
stroke	1
away	1
from	1
me:	1
I	1
am	1
consumed	1
by	1
the	1
blow	1
of	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
39:11	1
When	1
thou	1
with	1
rebukes	1
dost	1
correct	1
man	1
for	1
iniquity,	1
thou	1
makest	1
his	1
beauty	1
to	1
consume	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
moth:	1
surely	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
vanity.	1
Selah.	1
	1
39:12	1
Hear	1
my	1
prayer,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
cry;	1
hold	1
not	1
thy	1
peace	1
at	1
my	1
tears:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
stranger	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
a	1
sojourner,	1
as	1
all	1
my	1
fathers	1
were.	1
	1
39:13	1
O	1
spare	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
recover	1
strength,	1
before	1
I	1
go	1
hence,	1
and	1
be	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
	1
	1
40:1	1
I	1
waited	1
patiently	1
for	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
he	1
inclined	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
heard	1
my	1
cry.	1
	1
40:2	1
He	1
brought	1
me	1
up	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
an	1
horrible	1
pit,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
miry	1
clay,	1
and	1
set	1
my	1
feet	1
upon	1
a	1
rock,	1
and	1
established	1
my	1
goings.	1
	1
40:3	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
a	1
new	1
song	1
in	1
my	1
mouth,	1
even	1
praise	1
unto	1
our	1
God:	1
many	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
fear,	1
and	1
shall	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
40:4	1
Blessed	1
is	1
that	1
man	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
trust,	1
and	1
respecteth	1
not	1
the	1
proud,	1
nor	1
such	1
as	1
turn	1
aside	1
to	1
lies.	1
	1
40:5	1
Many,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
are	1
thy	1
wonderful	1
works	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
and	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
us-ward:	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
reckoned	1
up	1
in	1
order	1
unto	1
thee:	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
declare	1
and	1
speak	1
of	1
them,	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
can	1
be	1
numbered.	1
	1
40:6	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
desire;	1
mine	1
ears	1
hast	1
thou	1
opened:	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
sin	1
offering	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
required.	1
	1
40:7	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come:	1
in	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
me,	1
	1
40:8	1
I	1
delight	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
my	1
God:	1
yea,	1
thy	1
law	1
is	1
within	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
40:9	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
righteousness	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
congregation:	1
lo,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
refrained	1
my	1
lips,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
knowest.	1
	1
40:10	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
hid	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
within	1
my	1
heart;	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
thy	1
salvation:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
concealed	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
and	1
thy	1
truth	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
congregation.	1
	1
40:11	1
Withhold	1
not	1
thou	1
thy	1
tender	1
mercies	1
from	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
let	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
and	1
thy	1
truth	1
continually	1
preserve	1
me.	1
	1
40:12	1
For	1
innumerable	1
evils	1
have	1
compassed	1
me	1
about:	1
mine	1
iniquities	1
have	1
taken	1
hold	1
upon	1
me,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
up;	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
mine	1
head:	1
therefore	1
my	1
heart	1
faileth	1
me.	1
	1
40:13	1
Be	1
pleased,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
to	1
deliver	1
me:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
40:14	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded	1
together	1
that	1
seek	1
after	1
my	1
soul	1
to	1
destroy	1
it;	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
driven	1
backward	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
shame	1
that	1
wish	1
me	1
evil.	1
	1
40:15	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
desolate	1
for	1
a	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
shame	1
that	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
Aha,	1
aha.	1
	1
40:16	1
Let	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
seek	1
thee	1
rejoice	1
and	1
be	1
glad	1
in	1
thee:	1
let	1
such	1
as	1
love	1
thy	1
salvation	1
say	1
continually,	1
The	1
LORD	1
be	1
magnified.	1
	1
40:17	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
poor	1
and	1
needy;	1
yet	1
the	1
Lord	1
thinketh	1
upon	1
me:	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
help	1
and	1
my	1
deliverer;	1
make	1
no	1
tarrying,	1
O	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
	1
	1
41:1	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
considereth	1
the	1
poor:	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
deliver	1
him	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
41:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
preserve	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
him	1
alive;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
deliver	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
41:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
strengthen	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
languishing:	1
thou	1
wilt	1
make	1
all	1
his	1
bed	1
in	1
his	1
sickness.	1
	1
41:4	1
I	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me:	1
heal	1
my	1
soul;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
41:5	1
Mine	1
enemies	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
me,	1
When	1
shall	1
he	1
die,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
perish?	1
	1
41:6	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
me,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
vanity:	1
his	1
heart	1
gathereth	1
iniquity	1
to	1
itself;	1
when	1
he	1
goeth	1
abroad,	1
he	1
telleth	1
it.	1
	1
41:7	1
All	1
that	1
hate	1
me	1
whisper	1
together	1
against	1
me:	1
against	1
me	1
do	1
they	1
devise	1
my	1
hurt.	1
	1
41:8	1
An	1
evil	1
disease,	1
say	1
they,	1
cleaveth	1
fast	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
lieth	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
41:9	1
Yea,	1
mine	1
own	1
familiar	1
friend,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
trusted,	1
which	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
my	1
bread,	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
heel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
41:10	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
raise	1
me	1
up,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
requite	1
them.	1
	1
41:11	1
By	1
this	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
favourest	1
me,	1
because	1
mine	1
enemy	1
doth	1
not	1
triumph	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
41:12	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
thou	1
upholdest	1
me	1
in	1
mine	1
integrity,	1
and	1
settest	1
me	1
before	1
thy	1
face	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
41:13	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
everlasting,	1
and	1
to	1
everlasting.	1
Amen,	1
and	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
42:1	1
As	1
the	1
hart	1
panteth	1
after	1
the	1
water	1
brooks,	1
so	1
panteth	1
my	1
soul	1
after	1
thee,	1
O	1
God.	1
	1
42:2	1
My	1
soul	1
thirsteth	1
for	1
God,	1
for	1
the	1
living	1
God:	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
appear	1
before	1
God?	1
	1
42:3	1
My	1
tears	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
meat	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
while	1
they	1
continually	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
Where	1
is	1
thy	1
God?	1
	1
42:4	1
When	1
I	1
remember	1
these	1
things,	1
I	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
gone	1
with	1
the	1
multitude,	1
I	1
went	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
praise,	1
with	1
a	1
multitude	1
that	1
kept	1
holyday.	1
	1
42:5	1
Why	1
art	1
thou	1
cast	1
down,	1
O	1
my	1
soul?	1
and	1
why	1
art	1
thou	1
disquieted	1
in	1
me?	1
	1
hope	1
thou	1
in	1
God:	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
yet	1
praise	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
his	1
countenance.	1
	1
42:6	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
cast	1
down	1
within	1
me:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Hermonites,	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
Mizar.	1
	1
42:7	1
Deep	1
calleth	1
unto	1
deep	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thy	1
waterspouts:	1
all	1
thy	1
waves	1
and	1
thy	1
billows	1
are	1
gone	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
42:8	1
Yet	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
command	1
his	1
lovingkindness	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
his	1
song	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
prayer	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
42:9	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
God	1
my	1
rock,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
forgotten	1
me?	1
why	1
go	1
I	1
mourning	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
enemy?	1
	1
42:10	1
As	1
with	1
a	1
sword	1
in	1
my	1
bones,	1
mine	1
enemies	1
reproach	1
me;	1
while	1
they	1
say	1
daily	1
unto	1
me,	1
Where	1
is	1
thy	1
God?	1
	1
42:11	1
Why	1
art	1
thou	1
cast	1
down,	1
O	1
my	1
soul?	1
and	1
why	1
art	1
thou	1
disquieted	1
within	1
me?	1
hope	1
thou	1
in	1
God:	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
yet	1
praise	1
him,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
my	1
countenance,	1
and	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
	1
	1
43:1	1
Judge	1
me,	1
O	1
God,	1
and	1
plead	1
my	1
cause	1
against	1
an	1
ungodly	1
nation:	1
O	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
deceitful	1
and	1
unjust	1
man.	1
	1
43:2	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
strength:	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
cast	1
me	1
off?	1
why	1
go	1
I	1
mourning	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
enemy?	1
	1
43:3	1
O	1
send	1
out	1
thy	1
light	1
and	1
thy	1
truth:	1
let	1
them	1
lead	1
me;	1
let	1
them	1
bring	1
me	1
unto	1
thy	1
holy	1
hill,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
43:4	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
God	1
my	1
exceeding	1
joy:	1
yea,	1
upon	1
the	1
harp	1
will	1
I	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
God	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
43:5	1
Why	1
art	1
thou	1
cast	1
down,	1
O	1
my	1
soul?	1
and	1
why	1
art	1
thou	1
disquieted	1
within	1
me?	1
hope	1
in	1
God:	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
yet	1
praise	1
him,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
my	1
countenance,	1
and	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
	1
	1
44:1	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
with	1
our	1
ears,	1
O	1
God,	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
told	1
us,	1
what	1
work	1
thou	1
didst	1
in	1
their	1
days,	1
in	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
44:2	1
How	1
thou	1
didst	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
heathen	1
with	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
plantedst	1
them;	1
how	1
thou	1
didst	1
afflict	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
44:3	1
For	1
they	1
got	1
not	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
possession	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
sword,	1
neither	1
did	1
their	1
own	1
arm	1
save	1
them:	1
but	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
thine	1
arm,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
thy	1
countenance,	1
because	1
thou	1
hadst	1
a	1
favour	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
44:4	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
King,	1
O	1
God:	1
command	1
deliverances	1
for	1
Jacob.	1
	1
44:5	1
Through	1
thee	1
will	1
we	1
push	1
down	1
our	1
enemies:	1
through	1
thy	1
name	1
will	1
we	1
tread	1
them	1
under	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
us.	1
	1
44:6	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
trust	1
in	1
my	1
bow,	1
neither	1
shall	1
my	1
sword	1
save	1
me.	1
	1
44:7	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
saved	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
hast	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
shame	1
that	1
hated	1
us.	1
	1
44:8	1
In	1
God	1
we	1
boast	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long,	1
and	1
praise	1
thy	1
name	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
Selah.	1
	1
44:9	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
cast	1
off,	1
and	1
put	1
us	1
to	1
shame;	1
and	1
goest	1
not	1
forth	1
with	1
our	1
armies.	1
	1
44:10	1
Thou	1
makest	1
us	1
to	1
turn	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
enemy:	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
hate	1
us	1
spoil	1
for	1
themselves.	1
	1
44:11	1
Thou	1
hast	1
given	1
us	1
like	1
sheep	1
appointed	1
for	1
meat;	1
and	1
hast	1
scattered	1
us	1
among	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
44:12	1
Thou	1
sellest	1
thy	1
people	1
for	1
nought,	1
and	1
dost	1
not	1
increase	1
thy	1
wealth	1
by	1
their	1
price.	1
	1
44:13	1
Thou	1
makest	1
us	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
our	1
neighbours,	1
a	1
scorn	1
and	1
a	1
derision	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
us.	1
	1
44:14	1
Thou	1
makest	1
us	1
a	1
byword	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
a	1
shaking	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
44:15	1
My	1
confusion	1
is	1
continually	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
my	1
face	1
hath	1
covered	1
me,	1
	1
44:16	1
For	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
reproacheth	1
and	1
blasphemeth;	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
avenger.	1
	1
44:17	1
All	1
this	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
us;	1
yet	1
have	1
we	1
not	1
forgotten	1
thee,	1
neither	1
have	1
we	1
dealt	1
falsely	1
in	1
thy	1
covenant.	1
	1
44:18	1
Our	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
back,	1
neither	1
have	1
our	1
steps	1
declined	1
from	1
thy	1
way;	1
	1
44:19	1
Though	1
thou	1
hast	1
sore	1
broken	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
dragons,	1
and	1
covered	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
44:20	1
If	1
we	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
or	1
stretched	1
out	1
our	1
hands	1
to	1
a	1
strange	1
god;	1
	1
44:21	1
Shall	1
not	1
God	1
search	1
this	1
out?	1
for	1
he	1
knoweth	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
44:22	1
Yea,	1
for	1
thy	1
sake	1
are	1
we	1
killed	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long;	1
we	1
are	1
counted	1
as	1
sheep	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter.	1
	1
44:23	1
Awake,	1
why	1
sleepest	1
thou,	1
O	1
Lord?	1
arise,	1
cast	1
us	1
not	1
off	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
44:24	1
Wherefore	1
hidest	1
thou	1
thy	1
face,	1
and	1
forgettest	1
our	1
affliction	1
and	1
our	1
oppression?	1
	1
44:25	1
For	1
our	1
soul	1
is	1
bowed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dust:	1
our	1
belly	1
cleaveth	1
unto	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
44:26	1
Arise	1
for	1
our	1
help,	1
and	1
redeem	1
us	1
for	1
thy	1
mercies'	1
sake.	1
	1
	1
	1
45:1	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
inditing	1
a	1
good	1
matter:	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
touching	1
the	1
king:	1
my	1
tongue	1
is	1
the	1
pen	1
of	1
a	1
ready	1
writer.	1
	1
45:2	1
Thou	1
art	1
fairer	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men:	1
grace	1
is	1
poured	1
into	1
thy	1
lips:	1
therefore	1
God	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thee	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
45:3	1
Gird	1
thy	1
sword	1
upon	1
thy	1
thigh,	1
O	1
most	1
mighty,	1
with	1
thy	1
glory	1
and	1
thy	1
majesty.	1
	1
45:4	1
And	1
in	1
thy	1
majesty	1
ride	1
prosperously	1
because	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
meekness	1
and	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
shall	1
teach	1
thee	1
terrible	1
things.	1
	1
45:5	1
Thine	1
arrows	1
are	1
sharp	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
enemies;	1
whereby	1
the	1
people	1
fall	1
under	1
thee.	1
	1
45:6	1
Thy	1
throne,	1
O	1
God,	1
is	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
is	1
a	1
right	1
sceptre.	1
	1
45:7	1
Thou	1
lovest	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
hatest	1
wickedness:	1
therefore	1
God,	1
thy	1
God,	1
hath	1
anointed	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
gladness	1
above	1
thy	1
fellows.	1
	1
45:8	1
All	1
thy	1
garments	1
smell	1
of	1
myrrh,	1
and	1
aloes,	1
and	1
cassia,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ivory	1
palaces,	1
whereby	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
glad.	1
	1
45:9	1
Kings'	1
daughters	1
were	1
among	1
thy	1
honourable	1
women:	1
upon	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
did	1
stand	1
the	1
queen	1
in	1
gold	1
of	1
Ophir.	1
	1
45:10	1
Hearken,	1
O	1
daughter,	1
and	1
consider,	1
and	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear;	1
forget	1
also	1
thine	1
own	1
people,	1
and	1
thy	1
father's	1
house;	1
	1
45:11	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
greatly	1
desire	1
thy	1
beauty:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
thy	1
Lord;	1
and	1
worship	1
thou	1
him.	1
	1
45:12	1
And	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Tyre	1
shall	1
be	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
gift;	1
even	1
the	1
rich	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
intreat	1
thy	1
favour.	1
	1
45:13	1
The	1
king's	1
daughter	1
is	1
all	1
glorious	1
within:	1
her	1
clothing	1
is	1
of	1
wrought	1
gold.	1
	1
45:14	1
She	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
raiment	1
of	1
needlework:	1
the	1
virgins	1
her	1
companions	1
that	1
follow	1
her	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
45:15	1
With	1
gladness	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
brought:	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
palace.	1
	1
45:16	1
Instead	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
children,	1
whom	1
thou	1
mayest	1
make	1
princes	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
45:17	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
name	1
to	1
be	1
remembered	1
in	1
all	1
generations:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
people	1
praise	1
thee	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
46:1	1
God	1
is	1
our	1
refuge	1
and	1
strength,	1
a	1
very	1
present	1
help	1
in	1
trouble.	1
	1
46:2	1
Therefore	1
will	1
not	1
we	1
fear,	1
though	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
removed,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
mountains	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
	1
46:3	1
Though	1
the	1
waters	1
thereof	1
roar	1
and	1
be	1
troubled,	1
though	1
the	1
mountains	1
shake	1
with	1
the	1
swelling	1
thereof.	1
Selah.	1
	1
46:4	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
river,	1
the	1
streams	1
whereof	1
shall	1
make	1
glad	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High.	1
	1
46:5	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her;	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved:	1
God	1
shall	1
help	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
right	1
early.	1
	1
46:6	1
The	1
heathen	1
raged,	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
were	1
moved:	1
he	1
uttered	1
his	1
voice,	1
the	1
earth	1
melted.	1
	1
46:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
with	1
us;	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
is	1
our	1
refuge.	1
Selah.	1
	1
46:8	1
Come,	1
behold	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
what	1
desolations	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
46:9	1
He	1
maketh	1
wars	1
to	1
cease	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
he	1
breaketh	1
the	1
bow,	1
and	1
cutteth	1
the	1
spear	1
in	1
sunder;	1
he	1
burneth	1
the	1
chariot	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
46:10	1
Be	1
still,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
God:	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
exalted	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
exalted	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
46:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
with	1
us;	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
is	1
our	1
refuge.	1
Selah.	1
	1
	1
	1
47:1	1
O	1
clap	1
your	1
hands,	1
all	1
ye	1
people;	1
shout	1
unto	1
God	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
triumph.	1
	1
47:2	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
most	1
high	1
is	1
terrible;	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
King	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
47:3	1
He	1
shall	1
subdue	1
the	1
people	1
under	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
under	1
our	1
feet.	1
	1
47:4	1
He	1
shall	1
choose	1
our	1
inheritance	1
for	1
us,	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob	1
whom	1
he	1
loved.	1
Selah.	1
	1
47:5	1
God	1
is	1
gone	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
shout,	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet.	1
	1
47:6	1
Sing	1
praises	1
to	1
God,	1
sing	1
praises:	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
our	1
King,	1
sing	1
praises.	1
	1
47:7	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
sing	1
ye	1
praises	1
with	1
understanding.	1
	1
47:8	1
God	1
reigneth	1
over	1
the	1
heathen:	1
God	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
47:9	1
The	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
gathered	1
together,	1
even	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham:	1
for	1
the	1
shields	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
belong	1
unto	1
God:	1
he	1
is	1
greatly	1
exalted.	1
	1
	1
	1
48:1	1
Great	1
is	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
greatly	1
to	1
be	1
praised	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
48:2	1
Beautiful	1
for	1
situation,	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
is	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
on	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
King.	1
	1
48:3	1
God	1
is	1
known	1
in	1
her	1
palaces	1
for	1
a	1
refuge.	1
	1
48:4	1
For,	1
lo,	1
the	1
kings	1
were	1
assembled,	1
they	1
passed	1
by	1
together.	1
	1
48:5	1
They	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
marvelled;	1
they	1
were	1
troubled,	1
and	1
hasted	1
away.	1
	1
48:6	1
Fear	1
took	1
hold	1
upon	1
them	1
there,	1
and	1
pain,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail.	1
	1
48:7	1
Thou	1
breakest	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish	1
with	1
an	1
east	1
wind.	1
	1
48:8	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
so	1
have	1
we	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
our	1
God:	1
God	1
will	1
establish	1
it	1
for	1
ever.	1
Selah.	1
	1
48:9	1
We	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
thy	1
lovingkindness,	1
O	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thy	1
temple.	1
	1
48:10	1
According	1
to	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
God,	1
so	1
is	1
thy	1
praise	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
48:11	1
Let	1
mount	1
Zion	1
rejoice,	1
let	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Judah	1
be	1
glad,	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
48:12	1
Walk	1
about	1
Zion,	1
and	1
go	1
round	1
about	1
her:	1
tell	1
the	1
towers	1
thereof.	1
	1
48:13	1
Mark	1
ye	1
well	1
her	1
bulwarks,	1
consider	1
her	1
palaces;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
generation	1
following.	1
	1
48:14	1
For	1
this	1
God	1
is	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
our	1
guide	1
even	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
	1
	1
49:1	1
Hear	1
this,	1
all	1
ye	1
people;	1
give	1
ear,	1
all	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
	1
49:2	1
Both	1
low	1
and	1
high,	1
rich	1
and	1
poor,	1
together.	1
	1
49:3	1
My	1
mouth	1
shall	1
speak	1
of	1
wisdom;	1
and	1
the	1
meditation	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
understanding.	1
	1
49:4	1
I	1
will	1
incline	1
mine	1
ear	1
to	1
a	1
parable:	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
my	1
dark	1
saying	1
upon	1
the	1
harp.	1
	1
49:5	1
Wherefore	1
should	1
I	1
fear	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
evil,	1
when	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
my	1
heels	1
shall	1
compass	1
me	1
about?	1
	1
49:6	1
They	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
their	1
wealth,	1
and	1
boast	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
their	1
riches;	1
	1
49:7	1
None	1
of	1
them	1
can	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
redeem	1
his	1
brother,	1
nor	1
give	1
to	1
God	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
him:	1
	1
49:8	1
(For	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
their	1
soul	1
is	1
precious,	1
and	1
it	1
ceaseth	1
for	1
ever:)	1
	1
49:9	1
That	1
he	1
should	1
still	1
live	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
not	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
49:10	1
For	1
he	1
seeth	1
that	1
wise	1
men	1
die,	1
likewise	1
the	1
fool	1
and	1
the	1
brutish	1
person	1
perish,	1
and	1
leave	1
their	1
wealth	1
to	1
others.	1
	1
49:11	1
Their	1
inward	1
thought	1
is,	1
that	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
continue	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
their	1
dwelling	1
places	1
to	1
all	1
generations;	1
they	1
call	1
their	1
lands	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
names.	1
	1
49:12	1
Nevertheless	1
man	1
being	1
in	1
honour	1
abideth	1
not:	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
perish.	1
	1
49:13	1
This	1
their	1
way	1
is	1
their	1
folly:	1
yet	1
their	1
posterity	1
approve	1
their	1
sayings.	1
Selah.	1
	1
49:14	1
Like	1
sheep	1
they	1
are	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
grave;	1
death	1
shall	1
feed	1
on	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
their	1
beauty	1
shall	1
consume	1
in	1
the	1
grave	1
from	1
their	1
dwelling.	1
	1
49:15	1
But	1
God	1
will	1
redeem	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
grave:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
me.	1
Selah.	1
	1
49:16	1
Be	1
not	1
thou	1
afraid	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
made	1
rich,	1
when	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
is	1
increased;	1
	1
49:17	1
For	1
when	1
he	1
dieth	1
he	1
shall	1
carry	1
nothing	1
away:	1
his	1
glory	1
shall	1
not	1
descend	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
49:18	1
Though	1
while	1
he	1
lived	1
he	1
blessed	1
his	1
soul:	1
and	1
men	1
will	1
praise	1
thee,	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
well	1
to	1
thyself.	1
	1
49:19	1
He	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
generation	1
of	1
his	1
fathers;	1
they	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
light.	1
	1
49:20	1
Man	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
honour,	1
and	1
understandeth	1
not,	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
perish.	1
	1
	1
	1
50:1	1
The	1
mighty	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
earth	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
unto	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
thereof.	1
	1
50:2	1
Out	1
of	1
Zion,	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
beauty,	1
God	1
hath	1
shined.	1
	1
50:3	1
Our	1
God	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
keep	1
silence:	1
a	1
fire	1
shall	1
devour	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
tempestuous	1
round	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
50:4	1
He	1
shall	1
call	1
to	1
the	1
heavens	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
judge	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
50:5	1
Gather	1
my	1
saints	1
together	1
unto	1
me;	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
me	1
by	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
50:6	1
And	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
judge	1
himself.	1
Selah.	1

50:7	1
Hear,	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak;	1
O	1
Israel,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
testify	1
against	1
thee:	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
even	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
50:8	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
reprove	1
thee	1
for	1
thy	1
sacrifices	1
or	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
continually	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
50:9	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
no	1
bullock	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
house,	1
nor	1
he	1
goats	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
folds.	1
	1
50:10	1
For	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
the	1
cattle	1
upon	1
a	1
thousand	1
hills.	1
	1
50:11	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
mountains:	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
are	1
mine.	1
	1
50:12	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
hungry,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
thee:	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof.	1
	1
50:13	1
Will	1
I	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
bulls,	1
or	1
drink	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
goats?	1
	1
50:14	1
Offer	1
unto	1
God	1
thanksgiving;	1
and	1
pay	1
thy	1
vows	1
unto	1
the	1
most	1
High:	1
	1
50:15	1
And	1
call	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble:	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
glorify	1
me.	1
	1
50:16	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked	1
God	1
saith,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
declare	1
my	1
statutes,	1
or	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
my	1
covenant	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth?	1
	1
50:17	1
Seeing	1
thou	1
hatest	1
instruction,	1
and	1
casteth	1
my	1
words	1
behind	1
thee.	1
	1
50:18	1
When	1
thou	1
sawest	1
a	1
thief,	1
then	1
thou	1
consentedst	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
hast	1
been	1
partaker	1
with	1
adulterers.	1
	1
50:19	1
Thou	1
givest	1
thy	1
mouth	1
to	1
evil,	1
and	1
thy	1
tongue	1
frameth	1
deceit.	1
	1
50:20	1
Thou	1
sittest	1
and	1
speakest	1
against	1
thy	1
brother;	1
thou	1
slanderest	1
thine	1
own	1
mother's	1
son.	1
	1
50:21	1
These	1
things	1
hast	1
thou	1
done,	1
and	1
I	1
kept	1
silence;	1
thou	1
thoughtest	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
altogether	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
thyself:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
reprove	1
thee,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
before	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
50:22	1
Now	1
consider	1
this,	1
ye	1
that	1
forget	1
God,	1
lest	1
I	1
tear	1
you	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
deliver.	1
	1
50:23	1
Whoso	1
offereth	1
praise	1
glorifieth	1
me:	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
ordereth	1
his	1
conversation	1
aright	1
will	1
I	1
shew	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
	1
	1
51:1	1
Have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me,	1
O	1
God,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
lovingkindness:	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
tender	1
mercies	1
blot	1
out	1
my	1
transgressions.	1
	1
51:2	1
Wash	1
me	1
throughly	1
from	1
mine	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
cleanse	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
sin.	1
	1
51:3	1
For	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
my	1
transgressions:	1
and	1
my	1
sin	1
is	1
ever	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
51:4	1
Against	1
thee,	1
thee	1
only,	1
have	1
I	1
sinned,	1
and	1
done	1
this	1
evil	1
in	1
thy	1
sight:	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
justified	1
when	1
thou	1
speakest,	1
and	1
be	1
clear	1
when	1
thou	1
judgest.	1
	1
51:5	1
Behold,	1
I	1
was	1
shapen	1
in	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
in	1
sin	1
did	1
my	1
mother	1
conceive	1
me.	1
	1
51:6	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
desirest	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
inward	1
parts:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hidden	1
part	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
wisdom.	1
	1
51:7	1
Purge	1
me	1
with	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
clean:	1
wash	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
whiter	1
than	1
snow.	1
	1
51:8	1
Make	1
me	1
to	1
hear	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness;	1
that	1
the	1
bones	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
may	1
rejoice.	1
	1
51:9	1
Hide	1
thy	1
face	1
from	1
my	1
sins,	1
and	1
blot	1
out	1
all	1
mine	1
iniquities.	1
	1
51:10	1
Create	1
in	1
me	1
a	1
clean	1
heart,	1
O	1
God;	1
and	1
renew	1
a	1
right	1
spirit	1
within	1
me.	1
	1
51:11	1
Cast	1
me	1
not	1
away	1
from	1
thy	1
presence;	1
and	1
take	1
not	1
thy	1
holy	1
spirit	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
51:12	1
Restore	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
thy	1
salvation;	1
and	1
uphold	1
me	1
with	1
thy	1
free	1
spirit.	1
	1
51:13	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
teach	1
transgressors	1
thy	1
ways;	1
and	1
sinners	1
shall	1
be	1
converted	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
51:14	1
Deliver	1
me	1
from	1
bloodguiltiness,	1
O	1
God,	1
thou	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation:	1
and	1
my	1
tongue	1
shall	1
sing	1
aloud	1
of	1
thy	1
righteousness.	1
	1
51:15	1
O	1
Lord,	1
open	1
thou	1
my	1
lips;	1
and	1
my	1
mouth	1
shall	1
shew	1
forth	1
thy	1
praise.	1
	1
51:16	1
For	1
thou	1
desirest	1
not	1
sacrifice;	1
else	1
would	1
I	1
give	1
it:	1
thou	1
delightest	1
not	1
in	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
51:17	1
The	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
a	1
broken	1
spirit:	1
a	1
broken	1
and	1
a	1
contrite	1
heart,	1
O	1
God,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
despise.	1
	1
51:18	1
Do	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
good	1
pleasure	1
unto	1
Zion:	1
build	1
thou	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
51:19	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
with	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
whole	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
offer	1
bullocks	1
upon	1
thine	1
altar.	1
	1
	1
	1
52:1	1
Why	1
boastest	1
thou	1
thyself	1
in	1
mischief,	1
O	1
mighty	1
man?	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
endureth	1
continually.	1
	1
52:2	1
The	1
tongue	1
deviseth	1
mischiefs;	1
like	1
a	1
sharp	1
razor,	1
working	1
deceitfully.	1
	1
52:3	1
Thou	1
lovest	1
evil	1
more	1
than	1
good;	1
and	1
lying	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
speak	1
righteousness.	1
Selah.	1
	1
52:4	1
Thou	1
lovest	1
all	1
devouring	1
words,	1
O	1
thou	1
deceitful	1
tongue.	1
	1
52:5	1
God	1
shall	1
likewise	1
destroy	1
thee	1
for	1
ever,	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
thee	1
away,	1
and	1
pluck	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
and	1
root	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
Selah.	1
	1
52:6	1
The	1
righteous	1
also	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
fear,	1
and	1
shall	1
laugh	1
at	1
him:	1
	1
52:7	1
Lo,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
made	1
not	1
God	1
his	1
strength;	1
but	1
trusted	1
in	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
his	1
riches,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
wickedness.	1
	1
52:8	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
olive	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
52:9	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee	1
for	1
ever,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
it:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
wait	1
on	1
thy	1
name;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
before	1
thy	1
saints.	1
	1
	1
	1
53:1	1
The	1
fool	1
hath	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
God.	1
Corrupt	1
are	1
they,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
abominable	1
iniquity:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good.	1
	1
53:2	1
God	1
looked	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
that	1
did	1
understand,	1
that	1
did	1
seek	1
God.	1
	1
53:3	1
Every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
gone	1
back:	1
they	1
are	1
altogether	1
become	1
filthy;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good,	1
no,	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
53:4	1
Have	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
no	1
knowledge?	1
who	1
eat	1
up	1
my	1
people	1
as	1
they	1
eat	1
bread:	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
called	1
upon	1
God.	1
	1
53:5	1
There	1
were	1
they	1
in	1
great	1
fear,	1
where	1
no	1
fear	1
was:	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
scattered	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
encampeth	1
against	1
thee:	1
thou	1
hast	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
shame,	1
because	1
God	1
hath	1
despised	1
them.	1
	1
53:6	1
Oh	1
that	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Zion!	1
When	1
God	1
bringeth	1
back	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
glad.	1
	1
	1
	1
54:1	1
Save	1
me,	1
O	1
God,	1
by	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
judge	1
me	1
by	1
thy	1
strength.	1
	1
54:2	1
Hear	1
my	1
prayer,	1
O	1
God;	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
54:3	1
For	1
strangers	1
are	1
risen	1
up	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
oppressors	1
seek	1
after	1
my	1
soul:	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
set	1
God	1
before	1
them.	1
Selah.	1
	1
54:4	1
Behold,	1
God	1
is	1
mine	1
helper:	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
uphold	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
54:5	1
He	1
shall	1
reward	1
evil	1
unto	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
in	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
54:6	1
I	1
will	1
freely	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
thee:	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
54:7	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
delivered	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
trouble:	1
and	1
mine	1
eye	1
hath	1
seen	1
his	1
desire	1
upon	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
	1
	1
	1
55:1	1
Give	1
ear	1
to	1
my	1
prayer,	1
O	1
God;	1
and	1
hide	1
not	1
thyself	1
from	1
my	1
supplication.	1
	1
55:2	1
Attend	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
hear	1
me:	1
I	1
mourn	1
in	1
my	1
complaint,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
noise;	1
	1
55:3	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
for	1
they	1
cast	1
iniquity	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
in	1
wrath	1
they	1
hate	1
me.	1
	1
55:4	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
sore	1
pained	1
within	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
terrors	1
of	1
death	1
are	1
fallen	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
55:5	1
Fearfulness	1
and	1
trembling	1
are	1
come	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
horror	1
hath	1
overwhelmed	1
me.	1
	1
55:6	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
wings	1
like	1
a	1
dove!	1
for	1
then	1
would	1
I	1
fly	1
away,	1
and	1
be	1
at	1
rest.	1
	1
55:7	1
Lo,	1
then	1
would	1
I	1
wander	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
Selah.	1
	1
55:8	1
I	1
would	1
hasten	1
my	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
windy	1
storm	1
and	1
tempest.	1
	1
55:9	1
Destroy,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
and	1
divide	1
their	1
tongues:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
violence	1
and	1
strife	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
55:10	1
Day	1
and	1
night	1
they	1
go	1
about	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof:	1
mischief	1
also	1
and	1
sorrow	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
55:11	1
Wickedness	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof:	1
deceit	1
and	1
guile	1
depart	1
not	1
from	1
her	1
streets.	1
	1
55:12	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
enemy	1
that	1
reproached	1
me;	1
then	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
borne	1
it:	1
neither	1
was	1
it	1
he	1
that	1
hated	1
me	1
that	1
did	1
magnify	1
himself	1
against	1
me;	1
then	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
hid	1
myself	1
from	1
him:	1
	1
55:13	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
thou,	1
a	1
man	1
mine	1
equal,	1
my	1
guide,	1
and	1
mine	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
55:14	1
We	1
took	1
sweet	1
counsel	1
together,	1
and	1
walked	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
company.	1
	1
55:15	1
Let	1
death	1
seize	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
down	1
quick	1
into	1
hell:	1
for	1
wickedness	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
dwellings,	1
and	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
55:16	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
upon	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
save	1
me.	1
	1
55:17	1
Evening,	1
and	1
morning,	1
and	1
at	1
noon,	1
will	1
I	1
pray,	1
and	1
cry	1
aloud:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
55:18	1
He	1
hath	1
delivered	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
battle	1
that	1
was	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
55:19	1
God	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
afflict	1
them,	1
even	1
he	1
that	1
abideth	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
Selah.	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
changes,	1
therefore	1
they	1
fear	1
not	1
God.	1
	1
55:20	1
He	1
hath	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
against	1
such	1
as	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
with	1
him:	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
his	1
covenant.	1
	1
55:21	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
were	1
smoother	1
than	1
butter,	1
but	1
war	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
heart:	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
softer	1
than	1
oil,	1
yet	1
were	1
they	1
drawn	1
swords.	1
	1
55:22	1
Cast	1
thy	1
burden	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
sustain	1
thee:	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
suffer	1
the	1
righteous	1
to	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
55:23	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
shalt	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
destruction:	1
bloody	1
and	1
deceitful	1
men	1
shall	1
not	1
live	1
out	1
half	1
their	1
days;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
trust	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
	1
	1
56:1	1
Be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
God:	1
for	1
man	1
would	1
swallow	1
me	1
up;	1
he	1
fighting	1
daily	1
oppresseth	1
me.	1
	1
56:2	1
Mine	1
enemies	1
would	1
daily	1
swallow	1
me	1
up:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
many	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
me,	1
O	1
thou	1
most	1
High.	1
	1
56:3	1
What	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
I	1
will	1
trust	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
56:4	1
In	1
God	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
his	1
word,	1
in	1
God	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
trust;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
fear	1
what	1
flesh	1
can	1
do	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
56:5	1
Every	1
day	1
they	1
wrest	1
my	1
words:	1
all	1
their	1
thoughts	1
are	1
against	1
me	1
for	1
evil.	1
	1
56:6	1
They	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together,	1
they	1
hide	1
themselves,	1
they	1
mark	1
my	1
steps,	1
when	1
they	1
wait	1
for	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
56:7	1
Shall	1
they	1
escape	1
by	1
iniquity?	1
in	1
thine	1
anger	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
people,	1
O	1
God.	1
	1
56:8	1
Thou	1
tellest	1
my	1
wanderings:	1
put	1
thou	1
my	1
tears	1
into	1
thy	1
bottle:	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
in	1
thy	1
book?	1
	1
56:9	1
When	1
I	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee,	1
then	1
shall	1
mine	1
enemies	1
turn	1
back:	1
this	1
I	1
know;	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
56:10	1
In	1
God	1
will	1
I	1
praise	1
his	1
word:	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
I	1
praise	1
his	1
word.	1
	1
56:11	1
In	1
God	1
have	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
trust:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
what	1
man	1
can	1
do	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
56:12	1
Thy	1
vows	1
are	1
upon	1
me,	1
O	1
God:	1
I	1
will	1
render	1
praises	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
56:13	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
death:	1
wilt	1
not	1
thou	1
deliver	1
my	1
feet	1
from	1
falling,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
walk	1
before	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
living?	1
	1
	1
	1
57:1	1
Be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
God,	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
trusteth	1
in	1
thee:	1
yea,	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
thy	1
wings	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
refuge,	1
until	1
these	1
calamities	1
be	1
overpast.	1
	1
57:2	1
I	1
will	1
cry	1
unto	1
God	1
most	1
high;	1
unto	1
God	1
that	1
performeth	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
57:3	1
He	1
shall	1
send	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
would	1
swallow	1
me	1
up.	1
Selah.	1
God	1
shall	1
send	1
forth	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
his	1
truth.	1
	1
57:4	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
among	1
lions:	1
and	1
I	1
lie	1
even	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
fire,	1
even	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
whose	1
teeth	1
are	1
spears	1
and	1
arrows,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
a	1
sharp	1
sword.	1
	1
57:5	1
Be	1
thou	1
exalted,	1
O	1
God,	1
above	1
the	1
heavens;	1
let	1
thy	1
glory	1
be	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
57:6	1
They	1
have	1
prepared	1
a	1
net	1
for	1
my	1
steps;	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
bowed	1
down:	1
they	1
have	1
digged	1
a	1
pit	1
before	1
me,	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
whereof	1
they	1
are	1
fallen	1
themselves.	1
Selah.	1
	1
57:7	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
fixed,	1
O	1
God,	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
fixed:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
and	1
give	1
praise.	1
	1
57:8	1
Awake	1
up,	1
my	1
glory;	1
awake,	1
psaltery	1
and	1
harp:	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
awake	1
early.	1
	1
57:9	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
unto	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
57:10	1
For	1
thy	1
mercy	1
is	1
great	1
unto	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
thy	1
truth	1
unto	1
the	1
clouds.	1
	1
57:11	1
Be	1
thou	1
exalted,	1
O	1
God,	1
above	1
the	1
heavens:	1
let	1
thy	1
glory	1
be	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
	1
	1
58:1	1
Do	1
ye	1
indeed	1
speak	1
righteousness,	1
O	1
congregation?	1
do	1
ye	1
judge	1
uprightly,	1
O	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
men?	1
	1
58:2	1
Yea,	1
in	1
heart	1
ye	1
work	1
wickedness;	1
ye	1
weigh	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
your	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
58:3	1
The	1
wicked	1
are	1
estranged	1
from	1
the	1
womb:	1
they	1
go	1
astray	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
be	1
born,	1
speaking	1
lies.	1
	1
58:4	1
Their	1
poison	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
a	1
serpent:	1
they	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
deaf	1
adder	1
that	1
stoppeth	1
her	1
ear;	1
	1
58:5	1
Which	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
charmers,	1
charming	1
never	1
so	1
wisely.	1
	1
58:6	1
Break	1
their	1
teeth,	1
O	1
God,	1
in	1
their	1
mouth:	1
break	1
out	1
the	1
great	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lions,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
58:7	1
Let	1
them	1
melt	1
away	1
as	1
waters	1
which	1
run	1
continually:	1
when	1
he	1
bendeth	1
his	1
bow	1
to	1
shoot	1
his	1
arrows,	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
as	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
58:8	1
As	1
a	1
snail	1
which	1
melteth,	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
pass	1
away:	1
like	1
the	1
untimely	1
birth	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
58:9	1
Before	1
your	1
pots	1
can	1
feel	1
the	1
thorns,	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
away	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
whirlwind,	1
both	1
living,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
58:10	1
The	1
righteous	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
vengeance:	1
he	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
58:11	1
So	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
say,	1
Verily	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
reward	1
for	1
the	1
righteous:	1
verily	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
that	1
judgeth	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
	1
	1
59:1	1
Deliver	1
me	1
from	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
O	1
my	1
God:	1
defend	1
me	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
59:2	1
Deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
bloody	1
men.	1
	1
59:3	1
For,	1
lo,	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
my	1
soul:	1
the	1
mighty	1
are	1
gathered	1
against	1
me;	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
transgression,	1
nor	1
for	1
my	1
sin,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
59:4	1
They	1
run	1
and	1
prepare	1
themselves	1
without	1
my	1
fault:	1
awake	1
to	1
help	1
me,	1
and	1
behold.	1
	1
59:5	1
Thou	1
therefore,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
awake	1
to	1
visit	1
all	1
the	1
heathen:	1
be	1
not	1
merciful	1
to	1
any	1
wicked	1
transgressors.	1
Selah.	1
	1
59:6	1
They	1
return	1
at	1
evening:	1
they	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
like	1
a	1
dog,	1
and	1
go	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
59:7	1
Behold,	1
they	1
belch	1
out	1
with	1
their	1
mouth:	1
swords	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
lips:	1
for	1
who,	1
say	1
they,	1
doth	1
hear?	1
	1
59:8	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
shalt	1
laugh	1
at	1
them;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
in	1
derision.	1
	1
59:9	1
Because	1
of	1
his	1
strength	1
will	1
I	1
wait	1
upon	1
thee:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
defence.	1
	1
59:10	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
mercy	1
shall	1
prevent	1
me:	1
God	1
shall	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
my	1
desire	1
upon	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
	1
59:11	1
Slay	1
them	1
not,	1
lest	1
my	1
people	1
forget:	1
scatter	1
them	1
by	1
thy	1
power;	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
down,	1
O	1
Lord	1
our	1
shield.	1
	1
59:12	1
For	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
their	1
mouth	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
their	1
lips	1
let	1
them	1
even	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
their	1
pride:	1
and	1
for	1
cursing	1
and	1
lying	1
which	1
they	1
speak.	1
	1
59:13	1
Consume	1
them	1
in	1
wrath,	1
consume	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
be:	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
ruleth	1
in	1
Jacob	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Selah.	1
	1
59:14	1
And	1
at	1
evening	1
let	1
them	1
return;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
like	1
a	1
dog,	1
and	1
go	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
59:15	1
Let	1
them	1
wander	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
for	1
meat,	1
and	1
grudge	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
satisfied.	1
	1
59:16	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
of	1
thy	1
power;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
aloud	1
of	1
thy	1
mercy	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
my	1
defence	1
and	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
trouble.	1
	1
59:17	1
Unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
my	1
strength,	1
will	1
I	1
sing:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
defence,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
mercy.	1
	1
	1
	1
60:1	1
O	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
cast	1
us	1
off,	1
thou	1
hast	1
scattered	1
us,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
displeased;	1
O	1
turn	1
thyself	1
to	1
us	1
again.	1
	1
60:2	1
Thou	1
hast	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
tremble;	1
thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
it:	1
heal	1
the	1
breaches	1
thereof;	1
for	1
it	1
shaketh.	1
	1
60:3	1
Thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
thy	1
people	1
hard	1
things:	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
astonishment.	1
	1
60:4	1
Thou	1
hast	1
given	1
a	1
banner	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
thee,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
displayed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
Selah.	1
	1
60:5	1
That	1
thy	1
beloved	1
may	1
be	1
delivered;	1
save	1
with	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
hear	1
me.	1
	1
60:6	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
in	1
his	1
holiness;	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice,	1
I	1
will	1
divide	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
mete	1
out	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Succoth.	1
	1
60:7	1
Gilead	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
Manasseh	1
is	1
mine;	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
mine	1
head;	1
Judah	1
is	1
my	1
lawgiver;	1
	1
60:8	1
Moab	1
is	1
my	1
washpot;	1
over	1
Edom	1
will	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
my	1
shoe:	1
Philistia,	1
triumph	1
thou	1
because	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
60:9	1
Who	1
will	1
bring	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
strong	1
city?	1
who	1
will	1
lead	1
me	1
into	1
Edom?	1
	1
60:10	1
Wilt	1
not	1
thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
which	1
hadst	1
cast	1
us	1
off?	1
and	1
thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
which	1
didst	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
our	1
armies?	1
	1
60:11	1
Give	1
us	1
help	1
from	1
trouble:	1
for	1
vain	1
is	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
60:12	1
Through	1
God	1
we	1
shall	1
do	1
valiantly:	1
for	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
shall	1
tread	1
down	1
our	1
enemies.	1
	1
	1
	1
61:1	1
Hear	1
my	1
cry,	1
O	1
God;	1
attend	1
unto	1
my	1
prayer.	1
	1
61:2	1
From	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
will	1
I	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee,	1
when	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
overwhelmed:	1
lead	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
rock	1
that	1
is	1
higher	1
than	1
I.	1
	1
61:3	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
a	1
shelter	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
a	1
strong	1
tower	1
from	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
61:4	1
I	1
will	1
abide	1
in	1
thy	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
ever:	1
I	1
will	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
covert	1
of	1
thy	1
wings.	1
Selah.	1
	1
61:5	1
For	1
thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
hast	1
heard	1
my	1
vows:	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
heritage	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
fear	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
61:6	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
prolong	1
the	1
king's	1
life:	1
and	1
his	1
years	1
as	1
many	1
generations.	1
	1
61:7	1
He	1
shall	1
abide	1
before	1
God	1
for	1
ever:	1
O	1
prepare	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth,	1
which	1
may	1
preserve	1
him.	1
	1
61:8	1
So	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
praise	1
unto	1
thy	1
name	1
for	1
ever,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
daily	1
perform	1
my	1
vows.	1
	1
	1
	1
62:1	1
Truly	1
my	1
soul	1
waiteth	1
upon	1
God:	1
from	1
him	1
cometh	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
62:2	1
He	1
only	1
is	1
my	1
rock	1
and	1
my	1
salvation;	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
defence;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
greatly	1
moved.	1
	1
62:3	1
How	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
imagine	1
mischief	1
against	1
a	1
man?	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
all	1
of	1
you:	1
as	1
a	1
bowing	1
wall	1
shall	1
ye	1
be,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
tottering	1
fence.	1
	1
62:4	1
They	1
only	1
consult	1
to	1
cast	1
him	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
excellency:	1
they	1
delight	1
in	1
lies:	1
they	1
bless	1
with	1
their	1
mouth,	1
but	1
they	1
curse	1
inwardly.	1
Selah.	1
	1
62:5	1
My	1
soul,	1
wait	1
thou	1
only	1
upon	1
God;	1
for	1
my	1
expectation	1
is	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
62:6	1
He	1
only	1
is	1
my	1
rock	1
and	1
my	1
salvation:	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
defence;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
62:7	1
In	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
salvation	1
and	1
my	1
glory:	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
my	1
strength,	1
and	1
my	1
refuge,	1
is	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
62:8	1
Trust	1
in	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
times;	1
ye	1
people,	1
pour	1
out	1
your	1
heart	1
before	1
him:	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
refuge	1
for	1
us.	1
Selah.	1
	1
62:9	1
Surely	1
men	1
of	1
low	1
degree	1
are	1
vanity,	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
high	1
degree	1
are	1
a	1
lie:	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
balance,	1
they	1
are	1
altogether	1
lighter	1
than	1
vanity.	1
	1
62:10	1
Trust	1
not	1
in	1
oppression,	1
and	1
become	1
not	1
vain	1
in	1
robbery:	1
if	1
riches	1
increase,	1
set	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
62:11	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
once;	1
twice	1
have	1
I	1
heard	1
this;	1
that	1
power	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
62:12	1
Also	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
belongeth	1
mercy:	1
for	1
thou	1
renderest	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
	1
	1
63:1	1
O	1
God,	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
God;	1
early	1
will	1
I	1
seek	1
thee:	1
my	1
soul	1
thirsteth	1
for	1
thee,	1
my	1
flesh	1
longeth	1
for	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
thirsty	1
land,	1
where	1
no	1
water	1
is;	1
	1
63:2	1
To	1
see	1
thy	1
power	1
and	1
thy	1
glory,	1
so	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
63:3	1
Because	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
life,	1
my	1
lips	1
shall	1
praise	1
thee.	1
	1
63:4	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
bless	1
thee	1
while	1
I	1
live:	1
I	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
63:5	1
My	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
as	1
with	1
marrow	1
and	1
fatness;	1
and	1
my	1
mouth	1
shall	1
praise	1
thee	1
with	1
joyful	1
lips:	1
	1
63:6	1
When	1
I	1
remember	1
thee	1
upon	1
my	1
bed,	1
and	1
meditate	1
on	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
watches.	1
	1
63:7	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
my	1
help,	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
thy	1
wings	1
will	1
I	1
rejoice.	1
	1
63:8	1
My	1
soul	1
followeth	1
hard	1
after	1
thee:	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
upholdeth	1
me.	1
	1
63:9	1
But	1
those	1
that	1
seek	1
my	1
soul,	1
to	1
destroy	1
it,	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
lower	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
63:10	1
They	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
portion	1
for	1
foxes.	1
	1
63:11	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
God;	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
sweareth	1
by	1
him	1
shall	1
glory:	1
but	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
speak	1
lies	1
shall	1
be	1
stopped.	1
	1
	1
	1
64:1	1
Hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
O	1
God,	1
in	1
my	1
prayer:	1
preserve	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
64:2	1
Hide	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
secret	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
wicked;	1
from	1
the	1
insurrection	1
of	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity:	1
	1
64:3	1
Who	1
whet	1
their	1
tongue	1
like	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
bend	1
their	1
bows	1
to	1
shoot	1
their	1
arrows,	1
even	1
bitter	1
words:	1
	1
64:4	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
shoot	1
in	1
secret	1
at	1
the	1
perfect:	1
suddenly	1
do	1
they	1
shoot	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
fear	1
not.	1
	1
64:5	1
They	1
encourage	1
themselves	1
in	1
an	1
evil	1
matter:	1
they	1
commune	1
of	1
laying	1
snares	1
privily;	1
they	1
say,	1
Who	1
shall	1
see	1
them?	1
	1
64:6	1
They	1
search	1
out	1
iniquities;	1
they	1
accomplish	1
a	1
diligent	1
search:	1
both	1
the	1
inward	1
thought	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
heart,	1
is	1
deep.	1
	1
64:7	1
But	1
God	1
shall	1
shoot	1
at	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
arrow;	1
suddenly	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
wounded.	1
	1
64:8	1
So	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
their	1
own	1
tongue	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
themselves:	1
all	1
that	1
see	1
them	1
shall	1
flee	1
away.	1
	1
64:9	1
And	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
fear,	1
and	1
shall	1
declare	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
wisely	1
consider	1
of	1
his	1
doing.	1
	1
64:10	1
The	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shall	1
trust	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
upright	1
in	1
heart	1
shall	1
glory.	1
	1
	1
	1
65:1	1
Praise	1
waiteth	1
for	1
thee,	1
O	1
God,	1
in	1
Sion:	1
and	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
the	1
vow	1
be	1
performed.	1
	1
65:2	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
hearest	1
prayer,	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
all	1
flesh	1
come.	1
	1
65:3	1
Iniquities	1
prevail	1
against	1
me:	1
as	1
for	1
our	1
transgressions,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
purge	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
65:4	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
thou	1
choosest,	1
and	1
causest	1
to	1
approach	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
thy	1
courts:	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
thy	1
house,	1
even	1
of	1
thy	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
65:5	1
By	1
terrible	1
things	1
in	1
righteousness	1
wilt	1
thou	1
answer	1
us,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
salvation;	1
who	1
art	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
afar	1
off	1
upon	1
the	1
sea:	1
	1
65:6	1
Which	1
by	1
his	1
strength	1
setteth	1
fast	1
the	1
mountains;	1
being	1
girded	1
with	1
power:	1
	1
65:7	1
Which	1
stilleth	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
seas,	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
their	1
waves,	1
and	1
the	1
tumult	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
65:8	1
They	1
also	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
are	1
afraid	1
at	1
thy	1
tokens:	1
thou	1
makest	1
the	1
outgoings	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
evening	1
to	1
rejoice.	1
	1
65:9	1
Thou	1
visitest	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
waterest	1
it:	1
thou	1
greatly	1
enrichest	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
water:	1
thou	1
preparest	1
them	1
corn,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
so	1
provided	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
65:10	1
Thou	1
waterest	1
the	1
ridges	1
thereof	1
abundantly:	1
thou	1
settlest	1
the	1
furrows	1
thereof:	1
thou	1
makest	1
it	1
soft	1
with	1
showers:	1
thou	1
blessest	1
the	1
springing	1
thereof.	1
	1
65:11	1
Thou	1
crownest	1
the	1
year	1
with	1
thy	1
goodness;	1
and	1
thy	1
paths	1
drop	1
fatness.	1
	1
65:12	1
They	1
drop	1
upon	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
hills	1
rejoice	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
65:13	1
The	1
pastures	1
are	1
clothed	1
with	1
flocks;	1
the	1
valleys	1
also	1
are	1
covered	1
over	1
with	1
corn;	1
they	1
shout	1
for	1
joy,	1
they	1
also	1
sing.	1
	1
	1
	1
66:1	1
Make	1
a	1
joyful	1
noise	1
unto	1
God,	1
all	1
ye	1
lands:	1
	1
66:2	1
Sing	1
forth	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
his	1
name:	1
make	1
his	1
praise	1
glorious.	1
	1
66:3	1
Say	1
unto	1
God,	1
How	1
terrible	1
art	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
works!	1
through	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thy	1
power	1
shall	1
thine	1
enemies	1
submit	1
themselves	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
66:4	1
All	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
worship	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
sing	1
unto	1
thee;	1
they	1
shall	1
sing	1
to	1
thy	1
name.	1
Selah.	1
	1
66:5	1
Come	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God:	1
he	1
is	1
terrible	1
in	1
his	1
doing	1
toward	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
66:6	1
He	1
turned	1
the	1
sea	1
into	1
dry	1
land:	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
flood	1
on	1
foot:	1
there	1
did	1
we	1
rejoice	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
66:7	1
He	1
ruleth	1
by	1
his	1
power	1
for	1
ever;	1
his	1
eyes	1
behold	1
the	1
nations:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
rebellious	1
exalt	1
themselves.	1
Selah.	1
	1
66:8	1
O	1
bless	1
our	1
God,	1
ye	1
people,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
praise	1
to	1
be	1
heard:	1
	1
66:9	1
Which	1
holdeth	1
our	1
soul	1
in	1
life,	1
and	1
suffereth	1
not	1
our	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
66:10	1
For	1
thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
hast	1
proved	1
us:	1
thou	1
hast	1
tried	1
us,	1
as	1
silver	1
is	1
tried.	1
	1
66:11	1
Thou	1
broughtest	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
net;	1
thou	1
laidst	1
affliction	1
upon	1
our	1
loins.	1
	1
66:12	1
Thou	1
hast	1
caused	1
men	1
to	1
ride	1
over	1
our	1
heads;	1
we	1
went	1
through	1
fire	1
and	1
through	1
water:	1
but	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
us	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
wealthy	1
place.	1
	1
66:13	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
thy	1
house	1
with	1
burnt	1
offerings:	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
thee	1
my	1
vows,	1
	1
66:14	1
Which	1
my	1
lips	1
have	1
uttered,	1
and	1
my	1
mouth	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
trouble.	1
	1
66:15	1
I	1
will	1
offer	1
unto	1
thee	1
burnt	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
fatlings,	1
with	1
the	1
incense	1
of	1
rams;	1
I	1
will	1
offer	1
bullocks	1
with	1
goats.	1
Selah.	1
	1
66:16	1
Come	1
and	1
hear,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
God,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
what	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
for	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
66:17	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
extolled	1
with	1
my	1
tongue.	1
	1
66:18	1
If	1
I	1
regard	1
iniquity	1
in	1
my	1
heart,	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
me:	1
	1
66:19	1
But	1
verily	1
God	1
hath	1
heard	1
me;	1
he	1
hath	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
prayer.	1
	1
66:20	1
Blessed	1
be	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
not	1
turned	1
away	1
my	1
prayer,	1
nor	1
his	1
mercy	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
	1
	1
67:1	1
God	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
bless	1
us;	1
and	1
cause	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
shine	1
upon	1
us;	1
Selah.	1
	1
67:2	1
That	1
thy	1
way	1
may	1
be	1
known	1
upon	1
earth,	1
thy	1
saving	1
health	1
among	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
67:3	1
Let	1
the	1
people	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
God;	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
praise	1
thee.	1
	1
67:4	1
O	1
let	1
the	1
nations	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
sing	1
for	1
joy:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
judge	1
the	1
people	1
righteously,	1
and	1
govern	1
the	1
nations	1
upon	1
earth.	1
Selah.	1
	1
67:5	1
Let	1
the	1
people	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
God;	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
praise	1
thee.	1
	1
67:6	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
earth	1
yield	1
her	1
increase;	1
and	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
own	1
God,	1
shall	1
bless	1
us.	1
	1
67:7	1
God	1
shall	1
bless	1
us;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
fear	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
68:1	1
Let	1
God	1
arise,	1
let	1
his	1
enemies	1
be	1
scattered:	1
let	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
hate	1
him	1
flee	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
68:2	1
As	1
smoke	1
is	1
driven	1
away,	1
so	1
drive	1
them	1
away:	1
as	1
wax	1
melteth	1
before	1
the	1
fire,	1
so	1
let	1
the	1
wicked	1
perish	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
68:3	1
But	1
let	1
the	1
righteous	1
be	1
glad;	1
let	1
them	1
rejoice	1
before	1
God:	1
yea,	1
let	1
them	1
exceedingly	1
rejoice.	1
	1
68:4	1
Sing	1
unto	1
God,	1
sing	1
praises	1
to	1
his	1
name:	1
extol	1
him	1
that	1
rideth	1
upon	1
the	1
heavens	1
by	1
his	1
name	1
JAH,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
68:5	1
A	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
widows,	1
is	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
habitation.	1
	1
68:6	1
God	1
setteth	1
the	1
solitary	1
in	1
families:	1
he	1
bringeth	1
out	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
bound	1
with	1
chains:	1
but	1
the	1
rebellious	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
68:7	1
O	1
God,	1
when	1
thou	1
wentest	1
forth	1
before	1
thy	1
people,	1
when	1
thou	1
didst	1
march	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
Selah:	1
	1
68:8	1
The	1
earth	1
shook,	1
the	1
heavens	1
also	1
dropped	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God:	1
even	1
Sinai	1
itself	1
was	1
moved	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
68:9	1
Thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
didst	1
send	1
a	1
plentiful	1
rain,	1
whereby	1
thou	1
didst	1
confirm	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
weary.	1
	1
68:10	1
Thy	1
congregation	1
hath	1
dwelt	1
therein:	1
thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
hast	1
prepared	1
of	1
thy	1
goodness	1
for	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
68:11	1
The	1
Lord	1
gave	1
the	1
word:	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
published	1
it.	1
	1
68:12	1
Kings	1
of	1
armies	1
did	1
flee	1
apace:	1
and	1
she	1
that	1
tarried	1
at	1
home	1
divided	1
the	1
spoil.	1
	1
68:13	1
Though	1
ye	1
have	1
lien	1
among	1
the	1
pots,	1
yet	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
dove	1
covered	1
with	1
silver,	1
and	1
her	1
feathers	1
with	1
yellow	1
gold.	1
	1
68:14	1
When	1
the	1
Almighty	1
scattered	1
kings	1
in	1
it,	1
it	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
snow	1
in	1
Salmon.	1
	1
68:15	1
The	1
hill	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Bashan;	1
an	1
high	1
hill	1
as	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Bashan.	1
	1
68:16	1
Why	1
leap	1
ye,	1
ye	1
high	1
hills?	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
hill	1
which	1
God	1
desireth	1
to	1
dwell	1
in;	1
yea,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
68:17	1
The	1
chariots	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
twenty	1
thousand,	1
even	1
thousands	1
of	1
angels:	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
among	1
them,	1
as	1
in	1
Sinai,	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
68:18	1
Thou	1
hast	1
ascended	1
on	1
high,	1
thou	1
hast	1
led	1
captivity	1
captive:	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
gifts	1
for	1
men;	1
yea,	1
for	1
the	1
rebellious	1
also,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
might	1
dwell	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
68:19	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
daily	1
loadeth	1
us	1
with	1
benefits,	1
even	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
salvation.	1
Selah.	1
	1
68:20	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
salvation;	1
and	1
unto	1
GOD	1
the	1
Lord	1
belong	1
the	1
issues	1
from	1
death.	1
	1
68:21	1
But	1
God	1
shall	1
wound	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
enemies,	1
and	1
the	1
hairy	1
scalp	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
goeth	1
on	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
trespasses.	1
	1
68:22	1
The	1
Lord	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
from	1
Bashan,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
my	1
people	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
	1
68:23	1
That	1
thy	1
foot	1
may	1
be	1
dipped	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
thy	1
dogs	1
in	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
68:24	1
They	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
goings,	1
O	1
God;	1
even	1
the	1
goings	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
my	1
King,	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
68:25	1
The	1
singers	1
went	1
before,	1
the	1
players	1
on	1
instruments	1
followed	1
after;	1
among	1
them	1
were	1
the	1
damsels	1
playing	1
with	1
timbrels.	1
	1
68:26	1
Bless	1
ye	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
congregations,	1
even	1
the	1
Lord,	1
from	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
68:27	1
There	1
is	1
little	1
Benjamin	1
with	1
their	1
ruler,	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
their	1
council,	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Zebulun,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Naphtali.	1
	1
68:28	1
Thy	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
thy	1
strength:	1
strengthen,	1
O	1
God,	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
wrought	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
68:29	1
Because	1
of	1
thy	1
temple	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
kings	1
bring	1
presents	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
68:30	1
Rebuke	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
spearmen,	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
bulls,	1
with	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
till	1
every	1
one	1
submit	1
himself	1
with	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver:	1
scatter	1
thou	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
delight	1
in	1
war.	1
	1
68:31	1
Princes	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
Ethiopia	1
shall	1
soon	1
stretch	1
out	1
her	1
hands	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
68:32	1
Sing	1
unto	1
God,	1
ye	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
O	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
Selah:	1
	1
68:33	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
rideth	1
upon	1
the	1
heavens	1
of	1
heavens,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
old;	1
lo,	1
he	1
doth	1
send	1
out	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
mighty	1
voice.	1
	1
68:34	1
Ascribe	1
ye	1
strength	1
unto	1
God:	1
his	1
excellency	1
is	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
his	1
strength	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
clouds.	1
	1
68:35	1
O	1
God,	1
thou	1
art	1
terrible	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
holy	1
places:	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
strength	1
and	1
power	1
unto	1
his	1
people.	1
Blessed	1
be	1
God.	1
	1
	1
	1
69:1	1
Save	1
me,	1
O	1
God;	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
are	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
69:2	1
I	1
sink	1
in	1
deep	1
mire,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
standing:	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
deep	1
waters,	1
where	1
the	1
floods	1
overflow	1
me.	1
	1
69:3	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
of	1
my	1
crying:	1
my	1
throat	1
is	1
dried:	1
mine	1
eyes	1
fail	1
while	1
I	1
wait	1
for	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
69:4	1
They	1
that	1
hate	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
mine	1
head:	1
they	1
that	1
would	1
destroy	1
me,	1
being	1
mine	1
enemies	1
wrongfully,	1
are	1
mighty:	1
then	1
I	1
restored	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
not	1
away.	1
	1
69:5	1
O	1
God,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
my	1
foolishness;	1
and	1
my	1
sins	1
are	1
not	1
hid	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
69:6	1
Let	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
wait	1
on	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
be	1
ashamed	1
for	1
my	1
sake:	1
let	1
not	1
those	1
that	1
seek	1
thee	1
be	1
confounded	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
69:7	1
Because	1
for	1
thy	1
sake	1
I	1
have	1
borne	1
reproach;	1
shame	1
hath	1
covered	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
69:8	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
a	1
stranger	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
an	1
alien	1
unto	1
my	1
mother's	1
children.	1
	1
69:9	1
For	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
thine	1
house	1
hath	1
eaten	1
me	1
up;	1
and	1
the	1
reproaches	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
reproached	1
thee	1
are	1
fallen	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
69:10	1
When	1
I	1
wept,	1
and	1
chastened	1
my	1
soul	1
with	1
fasting,	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
my	1
reproach.	1
	1
69:11	1
I	1
made	1
sackcloth	1
also	1
my	1
garment;	1
and	1
I	1
became	1
a	1
proverb	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
69:12	1
They	1
that	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
speak	1
against	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
drunkards.	1
	1
69:13	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
my	1
prayer	1
is	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
in	1
an	1
acceptable	1
time:	1
O	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
mercy	1
hear	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
thy	1
salvation.	1
	1
69:14	1
Deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mire,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
sink:	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
waters.	1
	1
69:15	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
waterflood	1
overflow	1
me,	1
neither	1
let	1
the	1
deep	1
swallow	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
pit	1
shut	1
her	1
mouth	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
69:16	1
Hear	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
for	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
is	1
good:	1
turn	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
tender	1
mercies.	1
	1
69:17	1
And	1
hide	1
not	1
thy	1
face	1
from	1
thy	1
servant;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
trouble:	1
hear	1
me	1
speedily.	1
	1
69:18	1
Draw	1
nigh	1
unto	1
my	1
soul,	1
and	1
redeem	1
it:	1
deliver	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
	1
69:19	1
Thou	1
hast	1
known	1
my	1
reproach,	1
and	1
my	1
shame,	1
and	1
my	1
dishonour:	1
mine	1
adversaries	1
are	1
all	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
69:20	1
Reproach	1
hath	1
broken	1
my	1
heart;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
heaviness:	1
and	1
I	1
looked	1
for	1
some	1
to	1
take	1
pity,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none;	1
and	1
for	1
comforters,	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
69:21	1
They	1
gave	1
me	1
also	1
gall	1
for	1
my	1
meat;	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
thirst	1
they	1
gave	1
me	1
vinegar	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
69:22	1
Let	1
their	1
table	1
become	1
a	1
snare	1
before	1
them:	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
their	1
welfare,	1
let	1
it	1
become	1
a	1
trap.	1
	1
69:23	1
Let	1
their	1
eyes	1
be	1
darkened,	1
that	1
they	1
see	1
not;	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
loins	1
continually	1
to	1
shake.	1
	1
69:24	1
Pour	1
out	1
thine	1
indignation	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
wrathful	1
anger	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
69:25	1
Let	1
their	1
habitation	1
be	1
desolate;	1
and	1
let	1
none	1
dwell	1
in	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
69:26	1
For	1
they	1
persecute	1
him	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
smitten;	1
and	1
they	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
grief	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
wounded.	1
	1
69:27	1
Add	1
iniquity	1
unto	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
thy	1
righteousness.	1
	1
69:28	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
blotted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
written	1
with	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
69:29	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
poor	1
and	1
sorrowful:	1
let	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
O	1
God,	1
set	1
me	1
up	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
69:30	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
a	1
song,	1
and	1
will	1
magnify	1
him	1
with	1
thanksgiving.	1
	1
69:31	1
This	1
also	1
shall	1
please	1
the	1
LORD	1
better	1
than	1
an	1
ox	1
or	1
bullock	1
that	1
hath	1
horns	1
and	1
hoofs.	1
	1
69:32	1
The	1
humble	1
shall	1
see	1
this,	1
and	1
be	1
glad:	1
and	1
your	1
heart	1
shall	1
live	1
that	1
seek	1
God.	1
	1
69:33	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
heareth	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
despiseth	1
not	1
his	1
prisoners.	1
	1
69:34	1
Let	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
praise	1
him,	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
moveth	1
therein.	1
	1
69:35	1
For	1
God	1
will	1
save	1
Zion,	1
and	1
will	1
build	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah:	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
dwell	1
there,	1
and	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
possession.	1
	1
69:36	1
The	1
seed	1
also	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
shall	1
inherit	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
love	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
	1
	1
70:1	1
Make	1
haste,	1
O	1
God,	1
to	1
deliver	1
me;	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
help	1
me,	1
O	1
Lord.	1
	1
70:2	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded	1
that	1
seek	1
after	1
my	1
soul:	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
turned	1
backward,	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
confusion,	1
that	1
desire	1
my	1
hurt.	1
	1
70:3	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
turned	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
shame	1
that	1
say,	1
Aha,	1
aha.	1
	1
70:4	1
Let	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
seek	1
thee	1
rejoice	1
and	1
be	1
glad	1
in	1
thee:	1
and	1
let	1
such	1
as	1
love	1
thy	1
salvation	1
say	1
continually,	1
Let	1
God	1
be	1
magnified.	1
	1
70:5	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
poor	1
and	1
needy:	1
make	1
haste	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
God:	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
help	1
and	1
my	1
deliverer;	1
O	1
LORD,	1
make	1
no	1
tarrying.	1
	1
	1
	1
71:1	1
In	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
do	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
trust:	1
let	1
me	1
never	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
confusion.	1
	1
71:2	1
Deliver	1
me	1
in	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
escape:	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
save	1
me.	1
	1
71:3	1
Be	1
thou	1
my	1
strong	1
habitation,	1
whereunto	1
I	1
may	1
continually	1
resort:	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
commandment	1
to	1
save	1
me;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
rock	1
and	1
my	1
fortress.	1
	1
71:4	1
Deliver	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
and	1
cruel	1
man.	1
	1
71:5	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
hope,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
trust	1
from	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
71:6	1
By	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
holden	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
womb:	1
thou	1
art	1
he	1
that	1
took	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mother's	1
bowels:	1
my	1
praise	1
shall	1
be	1
continually	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
71:7	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
a	1
wonder	1
unto	1
many;	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
strong	1
refuge.	1
	1
71:8	1
Let	1
my	1
mouth	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
thy	1
praise	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
honour	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
71:9	1
Cast	1
me	1
not	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
old	1
age;	1
forsake	1
me	1
not	1
when	1
my	1
strength	1
faileth.	1
	1
71:10	1
For	1
mine	1
enemies	1
speak	1
against	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
lay	1
wait	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
take	1
counsel	1
together,	1
	1
71:11	1
Saying,	1
God	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
him:	1
persecute	1
and	1
take	1
him;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
deliver	1
him.	1
	1
71:12	1
O	1
God,	1
be	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
me:	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
make	1
haste	1
for	1
my	1
help.	1
	1
71:13	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
confounded	1
and	1
consumed	1
that	1
are	1
adversaries	1
to	1
my	1
soul;	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
covered	1
with	1
reproach	1
and	1
dishonour	1
that	1
seek	1
my	1
hurt.	1
	1
71:14	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
hope	1
continually,	1
and	1
will	1
yet	1
praise	1
thee	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
71:15	1
My	1
mouth	1
shall	1
shew	1
forth	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
and	1
thy	1
salvation	1
all	1
the	1
day;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
numbers	1
thereof.	1
	1
71:16	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
even	1
of	1
thine	1
only.	1
	1
71:17	1
O	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
youth:	1
and	1
hitherto	1
have	1
I	1
declared	1
thy	1
wondrous	1
works.	1
	1
71:18	1
Now	1
also	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
old	1
and	1
greyheaded,	1
O	1
God,	1
forsake	1
me	1
not;	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
thy	1
strength	1
unto	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
thy	1
power	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
71:19	1
Thy	1
righteousness	1
also,	1
O	1
God,	1
is	1
very	1
high,	1
who	1
hast	1
done	1
great	1
things:	1
O	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
thee!	1
	1
71:20	1
Thou,	1
which	1
hast	1
shewed	1
me	1
great	1
and	1
sore	1
troubles,	1
shalt	1
quicken	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
shalt	1
bring	1
me	1
up	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
71:21	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
increase	1
my	1
greatness,	1
and	1
comfort	1
me	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
71:22	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
praise	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
psaltery,	1
even	1
thy	1
truth,	1
O	1
my	1
God:	1
unto	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
harp,	1
O	1
thou	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
71:23	1
My	1
lips	1
shall	1
greatly	1
rejoice	1
when	1
I	1
sing	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
my	1
soul,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed.	1
	1
71:24	1
My	1
tongue	1
also	1
shall	1
talk	1
of	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
confounded,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
brought	1
unto	1
shame,	1
that	1
seek	1
my	1
hurt.	1
	1
	1
	1
72:1	1
Give	1
the	1
king	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
O	1
God,	1
and	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
son.	1
	1
72:2	1
He	1
shall	1
judge	1
thy	1
people	1
with	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
thy	1
poor	1
with	1
judgment.	1
	1
72:3	1
The	1
mountains	1
shall	1
bring	1
peace	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
hills,	1
by	1
righteousness.	1
	1
72:4	1
He	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
needy,	1
and	1
shall	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
oppressor.	1
	1
72:5	1
They	1
shall	1
fear	1
thee	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
moon	1
endure,	1
throughout	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
72:6	1
He	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
like	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
mown	1
grass:	1
as	1
showers	1
that	1
water	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
72:7	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
shall	1
the	1
righteous	1
flourish;	1
and	1
abundance	1
of	1
peace	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
moon	1
endureth.	1
	1
72:8	1
He	1
shall	1
have	1
dominion	1
also	1
from	1
sea	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
72:9	1
They	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
shall	1
bow	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
his	1
enemies	1
shall	1
lick	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
72:10	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
Tarshish	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
isles	1
shall	1
bring	1
presents:	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Sheba	1
and	1
Seba	1
shall	1
offer	1
gifts.	1
	1
72:11	1
Yea,	1
all	1
kings	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
before	1
him:	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
serve	1
him.	1
	1
72:12	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
deliver	1
the	1
needy	1
when	1
he	1
crieth;	1
the	1
poor	1
also,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
helper.	1
	1
72:13	1
He	1
shall	1
spare	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy,	1
and	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
needy.	1
	1
72:14	1
He	1
shall	1
redeem	1
their	1
soul	1
from	1
deceit	1
and	1
violence:	1
and	1
precious	1
shall	1
their	1
blood	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
72:15	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
Sheba:	1
prayer	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
him	1
continually;	1
and	1
daily	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
praised.	1
	1
72:16	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
handful	1
of	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
shall	1
shake	1
like	1
Lebanon:	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
flourish	1
like	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
72:17	1
His	1
name	1
shall	1
endure	1
for	1
ever:	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
continued	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
sun:	1
and	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
in	1
him:	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
call	1
him	1
blessed.	1
	1
72:18	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
only	1
doeth	1
wondrous	1
things.	1
	1
72:19	1
And	1
blessed	1
be	1
his	1
glorious	1
name	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
his	1
glory;	1
Amen,	1
and	1
Amen.	1
	1
72:20	1
The	1
prayers	1
of	1
David	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
are	1
ended.	1
	1
	1
	1
73:1	1
Truly	1
God	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
Israel,	1
even	1
to	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
clean	1
heart.	1
	1
73:2	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
my	1
feet	1
were	1
almost	1
gone;	1
my	1
steps	1
had	1
well	1
nigh	1
slipped.	1
	1
73:3	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
envious	1
at	1
the	1
foolish,	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
73:4	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
bands	1
in	1
their	1
death:	1
but	1
their	1
strength	1
is	1
firm.	1
	1
73:5	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
trouble	1
as	1
other	1
men;	1
neither	1
are	1
they	1
plagued	1
like	1
other	1
men.	1
	1
73:6	1
Therefore	1
pride	1
compasseth	1
them	1
about	1
as	1
a	1
chain;	1
violence	1
covereth	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
garment.	1
	1
73:7	1
Their	1
eyes	1
stand	1
out	1
with	1
fatness:	1
they	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
heart	1
could	1
wish.	1
	1
73:8	1
They	1
are	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
speak	1
wickedly	1
concerning	1
oppression:	1
they	1
speak	1
loftily.	1
	1
73:9	1
They	1
set	1
their	1
mouth	1
against	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
walketh	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
73:10	1
Therefore	1
his	1
people	1
return	1
hither:	1
and	1
waters	1
of	1
a	1
full	1
cup	1
are	1
wrung	1
out	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
73:11	1
And	1
they	1
say,	1
How	1
doth	1
God	1
know?	1
and	1
is	1
there	1
knowledge	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
High?	1
	1
73:12	1
Behold,	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
ungodly,	1
who	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
they	1
increase	1
in	1
riches.	1
	1
73:13	1
Verily	1
I	1
have	1
cleansed	1
my	1
heart	1
in	1
vain,	1
and	1
washed	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
innocency.	1
	1
73:14	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
plagued,	1
and	1
chastened	1
every	1
morning.	1
	1
73:15	1
If	1
I	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
thus;	1
behold,	1
I	1
should	1
offend	1
against	1
the	1
generation	1
of	1
thy	1
children.	1
	1
73:16	1
When	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
know	1
this,	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
painful	1
for	1
me;	1
	1
73:17	1
Until	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
God;	1
then	1
understood	1
I	1
their	1
end.	1
	1
73:18	1
Surely	1
thou	1
didst	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
slippery	1
places:	1
thou	1
castedst	1
them	1
down	1
into	1
destruction.	1
	1
73:19	1
How	1
are	1
they	1
brought	1
into	1
desolation,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
moment!	1
they	1
are	1
utterly	1
consumed	1
with	1
terrors.	1
	1
73:20	1
As	1
a	1
dream	1
when	1
one	1
awaketh;	1
so,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
when	1
thou	1
awakest,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
despise	1
their	1
image.	1
	1
73:21	1
Thus	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
grieved,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
pricked	1
in	1
my	1
reins.	1
	1
73:22	1
So	1
foolish	1
was	1
I,	1
and	1
ignorant:	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
beast	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
73:23	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
am	1
continually	1
with	1
thee:	1
thou	1
hast	1
holden	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
right	1
hand.	1
	1
73:24	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
guide	1
me	1
with	1
thy	1
counsel,	1
and	1
afterward	1
receive	1
me	1
to	1
glory.	1
	1
73:25	1
Whom	1
have	1
I	1
in	1
heaven	1
but	1
thee?	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
upon	1
earth	1
that	1
I	1
desire	1
beside	1
thee.	1
	1
73:26	1
My	1
flesh	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
faileth:	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
my	1
portion	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
73:27	1
For,	1
lo,	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
from	1
thee	1
shall	1
perish:	1
thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
73:28	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
draw	1
near	1
to	1
God:	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
declare	1
all	1
thy	1
works.	1
	1
	1
	1
74:1	1
O	1
God,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
cast	1
us	1
off	1
for	1
ever?	1
why	1
doth	1
thine	1
anger	1
smoke	1
against	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
thy	1
pasture?	1
	1
74:2	1
Remember	1
thy	1
congregation,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
purchased	1
of	1
old;	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed;	1
this	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
dwelt.	1
	1
74:3	1
Lift	1
up	1
thy	1
feet	1
unto	1
the	1
perpetual	1
desolations;	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
hath	1
done	1
wickedly	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
74:4	1
Thine	1
enemies	1
roar	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thy	1
congregations;	1
they	1
set	1
up	1
their	1
ensigns	1
for	1
signs.	1
	1
74:5	1
A	1
man	1
was	1
famous	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
axes	1
upon	1
the	1
thick	1
trees.	1
	1
74:6	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
carved	1
work	1
thereof	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
axes	1
and	1
hammers.	1
	1
74:7	1
They	1
have	1
cast	1
fire	1
into	1
thy	1
sanctuary,	1
they	1
have	1
defiled	1
by	1
casting	1
down	1
the	1
dwelling	1
place	1
of	1
thy	1
name	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
74:8	1
They	1
said	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
Let	1
us	1
destroy	1
them	1
together:	1
they	1
have	1
burned	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
synagogues	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
74:9	1
We	1
see	1
not	1
our	1
signs:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
any	1
prophet:	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
among	1
us	1
any	1
that	1
knoweth	1
how	1
long.	1
	1
74:10	1
O	1
God,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
the	1
adversary	1
reproach?	1
shall	1
the	1
enemy	1
blaspheme	1
thy	1
name	1
for	1
ever?	1
	1
74:11	1
Why	1
withdrawest	1
thou	1
thy	1
hand,	1
even	1
thy	1
right	1
hand?	1
pluck	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
bosom.	1
	1
74:12	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
King	1
of	1
old,	1
working	1
salvation	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
74:13	1
Thou	1
didst	1
divide	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
thy	1
strength:	1
thou	1
brakest	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
dragons	1
in	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
74:14	1
Thou	1
brakest	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
leviathan	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
gavest	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
meat	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
inhabiting	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
74:15	1
Thou	1
didst	1
cleave	1
the	1
fountain	1
and	1
the	1
flood:	1
thou	1
driedst	1
up	1
mighty	1
rivers.	1
	1
74:16	1
The	1
day	1
is	1
thine,	1
the	1
night	1
also	1
is	1
thine:	1
thou	1
hast	1
prepared	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
74:17	1
Thou	1
hast	1
set	1
all	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
summer	1
and	1
winter.	1
	1
74:18	1
Remember	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
hath	1
reproached,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
foolish	1
people	1
have	1
blasphemed	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
74:19	1
O	1
deliver	1
not	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
thy	1
turtledove	1
unto	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
forget	1
not	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
thy	1
poor	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
74:20	1
Have	1
respect	1
unto	1
the	1
covenant:	1
for	1
the	1
dark	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
cruelty.	1
	1
74:21	1
O	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
oppressed	1
return	1
ashamed:	1
let	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy	1
praise	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
74:22	1
Arise,	1
O	1
God,	1
plead	1
thine	1
own	1
cause:	1
remember	1
how	1
the	1
foolish	1
man	1
reproacheth	1
thee	1
daily.	1
	1
74:23	1
Forget	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies:	1
the	1
tumult	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
thee	1
increaseth	1
continually.	1
	1
	1
	1
75:1	1
Unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
God,	1
do	1
we	1
give	1
thanks,	1
unto	1
thee	1
do	1
we	1
give	1
thanks:	1
for	1
that	1
thy	1
name	1
is	1
near	1
thy	1
wondrous	1
works	1
declare.	1
	1
75:2	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
congregation	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
uprightly.	1
	1
75:3	1
The	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
are	1
dissolved:	1
I	1
bear	1
up	1
the	1
pillars	1
of	1
it.	1
Selah.	1
	1
75:4	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
fools,	1
Deal	1
not	1
foolishly:	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wicked,	1
Lift	1
not	1
up	1
the	1
horn:	1
	1
75:5	1
Lift	1
not	1
up	1
your	1
horn	1
on	1
high:	1
speak	1
not	1
with	1
a	1
stiff	1
neck.	1
	1
75:6	1
For	1
promotion	1
cometh	1
neither	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
nor	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
nor	1
from	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
75:7	1
But	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
judge:	1
he	1
putteth	1
down	1
one,	1
and	1
setteth	1
up	1
another.	1
	1
75:8	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
cup,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
is	1
red;	1
it	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
mixture;	1
and	1
he	1
poureth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
same:	1
but	1
the	1
dregs	1
thereof,	1
all	1
the	1
wicked	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wring	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
drink	1
them.	1
	1
75:9	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
for	1
ever;	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praises	1
to	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
75:10	1
All	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off;	1
but	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
	1
	1
76:1	1
In	1
Judah	1
is	1
God	1
known:	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
76:2	1
In	1
Salem	1
also	1
is	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
his	1
dwelling	1
place	1
in	1
Zion.	1
	1
76:3	1
There	1
brake	1
he	1
the	1
arrows	1
of	1
the	1
bow,	1
the	1
shield,	1
and	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
the	1
battle.	1
Selah.	1
	1
76:4	1
Thou	1
art	1
more	1
glorious	1
and	1
excellent	1
than	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
prey.	1
	1
76:5	1
The	1
stouthearted	1
are	1
spoiled,	1
they	1
have	1
slept	1
their	1
sleep:	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
might	1
have	1
found	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
76:6	1
At	1
thy	1
rebuke,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
both	1
the	1
chariot	1
and	1
horse	1
are	1
cast	1
into	1
a	1
dead	1
sleep.	1
	1
76:7	1
Thou,	1
even	1
thou,	1
art	1
to	1
be	1
feared:	1
and	1
who	1
may	1
stand	1
in	1
thy	1
sight	1
when	1
once	1
thou	1
art	1
angry?	1
	1
76:8	1
Thou	1
didst	1
cause	1
judgment	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
heaven;	1
the	1
earth	1
feared,	1
and	1
was	1
still,	1
	1
76:9	1
When	1
God	1
arose	1
to	1
judgment,	1
to	1
save	1
all	1
the	1
meek	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Selah.	1
	1
76:10	1
Surely	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
praise	1
thee:	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
wrath	1
shalt	1
thou	1
restrain.	1
	1
76:11	1
Vow,	1
and	1
pay	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
let	1
all	1
that	1
be	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
bring	1
presents	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
feared.	1
	1
76:12	1
He	1
shall	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
princes:	1
he	1
is	1
terrible	1
to	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
	1
	1
77:1	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
God	1
with	1
my	1
voice,	1
even	1
unto	1
God	1
with	1
my	1
voice;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
ear	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
77:2	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
trouble	1
I	1
sought	1
the	1
Lord:	1
my	1
sore	1
ran	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
ceased	1
not:	1
my	1
soul	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
comforted.	1
	1
77:3	1
I	1
remembered	1
God,	1
and	1
was	1
troubled:	1
I	1
complained,	1
and	1
my	1
spirit	1
was	1
overwhelmed.	1
Selah.	1
	1
77:4	1
Thou	1
holdest	1
mine	1
eyes	1
waking:	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
troubled	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
speak.	1
	1
77:5	1
I	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
ancient	1
times.	1
	1
77:6	1
I	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
my	1
song	1
in	1
the	1
night:	1
I	1
commune	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
heart:	1
and	1
my	1
spirit	1
made	1
diligent	1
search.	1
	1
77:7	1
Will	1
the	1
Lord	1
cast	1
off	1
for	1
ever?	1
and	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
favourable	1
no	1
more?	1
	1
77:8	1
Is	1
his	1
mercy	1
clean	1
gone	1
for	1
ever?	1
doth	1
his	1
promise	1
fail	1
for	1
evermore?	1
	1
77:9	1
Hath	1
God	1
forgotten	1
to	1
be	1
gracious?	1
hath	1
he	1
in	1
anger	1
shut	1
up	1
his	1
tender	1
mercies?	1
Selah.	1
	1
77:10	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
infirmity:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High.	1
	1
77:11	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
surely	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
thy	1
wonders	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
77:12	1
I	1
will	1
meditate	1
also	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
work,	1
and	1
talk	1
of	1
thy	1
doings.	1
	1
77:13	1
Thy	1
way,	1
O	1
God,	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
God	1
as	1
our	1
God?	1
	1
77:14	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
doest	1
wonders:	1
thou	1
hast	1
declared	1
thy	1
strength	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
77:15	1
Thou	1
hast	1
with	1
thine	1
arm	1
redeemed	1
thy	1
people,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Joseph.	1
Selah.	1
	1
77:16	1
The	1
waters	1
saw	1
thee,	1
O	1
God,	1
the	1
waters	1
saw	1
thee;	1
they	1
were	1
afraid:	1
the	1
depths	1
also	1
were	1
troubled.	1
	1
77:17	1
The	1
clouds	1
poured	1
out	1
water:	1
the	1
skies	1
sent	1
out	1
a	1
sound:	1
thine	1
arrows	1
also	1
went	1
abroad.	1
	1
77:18	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
thunder	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
heaven:	1
the	1
lightnings	1
lightened	1
the	1
world:	1
the	1
earth	1
trembled	1
and	1
shook.	1
	1
77:19	1
Thy	1
way	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
thy	1
path	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
waters,	1
and	1
thy	1
footsteps	1
are	1
not	1
known.	1
	1
77:20	1
Thou	1
leddest	1
thy	1
people	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron.	1
	1
	1
	1
78:1	1
Give	1
ear,	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
to	1
my	1
law:	1
incline	1
your	1
ears	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
78:2	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
in	1
a	1
parable:	1
I	1
will	1
utter	1
dark	1
sayings	1
of	1
old:	1
	1
78:3	1
Which	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
and	1
known,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
told	1
us.	1
	1
78:4	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
hide	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
children,	1
shewing	1
to	1
the	1
generation	1
to	1
come	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
strength,	1
and	1
his	1
wonderful	1
works	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done.	1
	1
78:5	1
For	1
he	1
established	1
a	1
testimony	1
in	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
appointed	1
a	1
law	1
in	1
Israel,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
our	1
fathers,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
them	1
known	1
to	1
their	1
children:	1
	1
78:6	1
That	1
the	1
generation	1
to	1
come	1
might	1
know	1
them,	1
even	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
born;	1
who	1
should	1
arise	1
and	1
declare	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
children:	1
	1
78:7	1
That	1
they	1
might	1
set	1
their	1
hope	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
forget	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments:	1
	1
78:8	1
And	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
their	1
fathers,	1
a	1
stubborn	1
and	1
rebellious	1
generation;	1
a	1
generation	1
that	1
set	1
not	1
their	1
heart	1
aright,	1
and	1
whose	1
spirit	1
was	1
not	1
stedfast	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
78:9	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
being	1
armed,	1
and	1
carrying	1
bows,	1
turned	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle.	1
	1
78:10	1
They	1
kept	1
not	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
refused	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
law;	1
	1
78:11	1
And	1
forgat	1
his	1
works,	1
and	1
his	1
wonders	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shewed	1
them.	1
	1
78:12	1
Marvellous	1
things	1
did	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Zoan.	1
	1
78:13	1
He	1
divided	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
pass	1
through;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
waters	1
to	1
stand	1
as	1
an	1
heap.	1
	1
78:14	1
In	1
the	1
daytime	1
also	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
78:15	1
He	1
clave	1
the	1
rocks	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
drink	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
depths.	1
	1
78:16	1
He	1
brought	1
streams	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
caused	1
waters	1
to	1
run	1
down	1
like	1
rivers.	1
	1
78:17	1
And	1
they	1
sinned	1
yet	1
more	1
against	1
him	1
by	1
provoking	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
78:18	1
And	1
they	1
tempted	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
heart	1
by	1
asking	1
meat	1
for	1
their	1
lust.	1
	1
78:19	1
Yea,	1
they	1
spake	1
against	1
God;	1
they	1
said,	1
Can	1
God	1
furnish	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
78:20	1
Behold,	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
rock,	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
gushed	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
streams	1
overflowed;	1
can	1
he	1
give	1
bread	1
also?	1
can	1
he	1
provide	1
flesh	1
for	1
his	1
people?	1
	1
78:21	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
this,	1
and	1
was	1
wroth:	1
so	1
a	1
fire	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
anger	1
also	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
Israel;	1
	1
78:22	1
Because	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
trusted	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
salvation:	1
	1
78:23	1
Though	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
the	1
clouds	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
heaven,	1
	1
78:24	1
And	1
had	1
rained	1
down	1
manna	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
corn	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
78:25	1
Man	1
did	1
eat	1
angels'	1
food:	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
meat	1
to	1
the	1
full.	1
	1
78:26	1
He	1
caused	1
an	1
east	1
wind	1
to	1
blow	1
in	1
the	1
heaven:	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
power	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
wind.	1
	1
78:27	1
He	1
rained	1
flesh	1
also	1
upon	1
them	1
as	1
dust,	1
and	1
feathered	1
fowls	1
like	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
	1
78:28	1
And	1
he	1
let	1
it	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
camp,	1
round	1
about	1
their	1
habitations.	1
	1
78:29	1
So	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
well	1
filled:	1
for	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
their	1
own	1
desire;	1
	1
78:30	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
estranged	1
from	1
their	1
lust.	1
But	1
while	1
their	1
meat	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
their	1
mouths,	1
	1
78:31	1
The	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
fattest	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
smote	1
down	1
the	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
78:32	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
they	1
sinned	1
still,	1
and	1
believed	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
wondrous	1
works.	1
	1
78:33	1
Therefore	1
their	1
days	1
did	1
he	1
consume	1
in	1
vanity,	1
and	1
their	1
years	1
in	1
trouble.	1
	1
78:34	1
When	1
he	1
slew	1
them,	1
then	1
they	1
sought	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
and	1
enquired	1
early	1
after	1
God.	1
	1
78:35	1
And	1
they	1
remembered	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
their	1
rock,	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
God	1
their	1
redeemer.	1
	1
78:36	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
flatter	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
they	1
lied	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
tongues.	1
	1
78:37	1
For	1
their	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
with	1
him,	1
neither	1
were	1
they	1
stedfast	1
in	1
his	1
covenant.	1
	1
78:38	1
But	1
he,	1
being	1
full	1
of	1
compassion,	1
forgave	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
not:	1
yea,	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
turned	1
he	1
his	1
anger	1
away,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
up	1
all	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
78:39	1
For	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
but	1
flesh;	1
a	1
wind	1
that	1
passeth	1
away,	1
and	1
cometh	1
not	1
again.	1
	1
78:40	1
How	1
oft	1
did	1
they	1
provoke	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
grieve	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
desert!	1
	1
78:41	1
Yea,	1
they	1
turned	1
back	1
and	1
tempted	1
God,	1
and	1
limited	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
78:42	1
They	1
remembered	1
not	1
his	1
hand,	1
nor	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
78:43	1
How	1
he	1
had	1
wrought	1
his	1
signs	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
his	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Zoan.	1
	1
78:44	1
And	1
had	1
turned	1
their	1
rivers	1
into	1
blood;	1
and	1
their	1
floods,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
drink.	1
	1
78:45	1
He	1
sent	1
divers	1
sorts	1
of	1
flies	1
among	1
them,	1
which	1
devoured	1
them;	1
and	1
frogs,	1
which	1
destroyed	1
them.	1
	1
78:46	1
He	1
gave	1
also	1
their	1
increase	1
unto	1
the	1
caterpiller,	1
and	1
their	1
labour	1
unto	1
the	1
locust.	1
	1
78:47	1
He	1
destroyed	1
their	1
vines	1
with	1
hail,	1
and	1
their	1
sycomore	1
trees	1
with	1
frost.	1
	1
78:48	1
He	1
gave	1
up	1
their	1
cattle	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
hail,	1
and	1
their	1
flocks	1
to	1
hot	1
thunderbolts.	1
	1
78:49	1
He	1
cast	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
anger,	1
wrath,	1
and	1
indignation,	1
and	1
trouble,	1
by	1
sending	1
evil	1
angels	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
78:50	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
anger;	1
he	1
spared	1
not	1
their	1
soul	1
from	1
death,	1
but	1
gave	1
their	1
life	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
pestilence;	1
	1
78:51	1
And	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
their	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
Ham:	1
	1
78:52	1
But	1
made	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
like	1
sheep,	1
and	1
guided	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
like	1
a	1
flock.	1
	1
78:53	1
And	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
on	1
safely,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
feared	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
sea	1
overwhelmed	1
their	1
enemies.	1
	1
78:54	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
sanctuary,	1
even	1
to	1
this	1
mountain,	1
which	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
had	1
purchased.	1
	1
78:55	1
He	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
heathen	1
also	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
divided	1
them	1
an	1
inheritance	1
by	1
line,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
78:56	1
Yet	1
they	1
tempted	1
and	1
provoked	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
and	1
kept	1
not	1
his	1
testimonies:	1
	1
78:57	1
But	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
dealt	1
unfaithfully	1
like	1
their	1
fathers:	1
they	1
were	1
turned	1
aside	1
like	1
a	1
deceitful	1
bow.	1
	1
78:58	1
For	1
they	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
their	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
moved	1
him	1
to	1
jealousy	1
with	1
their	1
graven	1
images.	1
	1
78:59	1
When	1
God	1
heard	1
this,	1
he	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
greatly	1
abhorred	1
Israel:	1
	1
78:60	1
So	1
that	1
he	1
forsook	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Shiloh,	1
the	1
tent	1
which	1
he	1
placed	1
among	1
men;	1
	1
78:61	1
And	1
delivered	1
his	1
strength	1
into	1
captivity,	1
and	1
his	1
glory	1
into	1
the	1
enemy's	1
hand.	1
	1
78:62	1
He	1
gave	1
his	1
people	1
over	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
78:63	1
The	1
fire	1
consumed	1
their	1
young	1
men;	1
and	1
their	1
maidens	1
were	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
marriage.	1
	1
78:64	1
Their	1
priests	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
their	1
widows	1
made	1
no	1
lamentation.	1
	1
78:65	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
awaked	1
as	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
sleep,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
that	1
shouteth	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
78:66	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
his	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
hinder	1
parts:	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
perpetual	1
reproach.	1
	1
78:67	1
Moreover	1
he	1
refused	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
chose	1
not	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Ephraim:	1
	1
78:68	1
But	1
chose	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah,	1
the	1
mount	1
Zion	1
which	1
he	1
loved.	1
	1
78:69	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
his	1
sanctuary	1
like	1
high	1
palaces,	1
like	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
established	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
78:70	1
He	1
chose	1
David	1
also	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
sheepfolds:	1
	1
78:71	1
From	1
following	1
the	1
ewes	1
great	1
with	1
young	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
feed	1
Jacob	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
Israel	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
78:72	1
So	1
he	1
fed	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
his	1
heart;	1
and	1
guided	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
skilfulness	1
of	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
	1
	1
79:1	1
O	1
God,	1
the	1
heathen	1
are	1
come	1
into	1
thine	1
inheritance;	1
thy	1
holy	1
temple	1
have	1
they	1
defiled;	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
Jerusalem	1
on	1
heaps.	1
	1
79:2	1
The	1
dead	1
bodies	1
of	1
thy	1
servants	1
have	1
they	1
given	1
to	1
be	1
meat	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
thy	1
saints	1
unto	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
79:3	1
Their	1
blood	1
have	1
they	1
shed	1
like	1
water	1
round	1
about	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
bury	1
them.	1
	1
79:4	1
We	1
are	1
become	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
our	1
neighbours,	1
a	1
scorn	1
and	1
derision	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
us.	1
	1
79:5	1
How	1
long,	1
LORD?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
angry	1
for	1
ever?	1
shall	1
thy	1
jealousy	1
burn	1
like	1
fire?	1
	1
79:6	1
Pour	1
out	1
thy	1
wrath	1
upon	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
thee,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
called	1
upon	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
79:7	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
devoured	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
laid	1
waste	1
his	1
dwelling	1
place.	1
	1
79:8	1
O	1
remember	1
not	1
against	1
us	1
former	1
iniquities:	1
let	1
thy	1
tender	1
mercies	1
speedily	1
prevent	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
brought	1
very	1
low.	1
	1
79:9	1
Help	1
us,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
salvation,	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
thy	1
name:	1
and	1
deliver	1
us,	1
and	1
purge	1
away	1
our	1
sins,	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
79:10	1
Wherefore	1
should	1
the	1
heathen	1
say,	1
Where	1
is	1
their	1
God?	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
known	1
among	1
the	1
heathen	1
in	1
our	1
sight	1
by	1
the	1
revenging	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
servants	1
which	1
is	1
shed.	1
	1
79:11	1
Let	1
the	1
sighing	1
of	1
the	1
prisoner	1
come	1
before	1
thee;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thy	1
power	1
preserve	1
thou	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
appointed	1
to	1
die;	1
	1
79:12	1
And	1
render	1
unto	1
our	1
neighbours	1
sevenfold	1
into	1
their	1
bosom	1
their	1
reproach,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
have	1
reproached	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord.	1
	1
79:13	1
So	1
we	1
thy	1
people	1
and	1
sheep	1
of	1
thy	1
pasture	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
thanks	1
for	1
ever:	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
forth	1
thy	1
praise	1
to	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
	1
	1
80:1	1
Give	1
ear,	1
O	1
Shepherd	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
that	1
leadest	1
Joseph	1
like	1
a	1
flock;	1
thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
shine	1
forth.	1
	1
80:2	1
Before	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
and	1
Manasseh	1
stir	1
up	1
thy	1
strength,	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
save	1
us.	1
	1
80:3	1
Turn	1
us	1
again,	1
O	1
God,	1
and	1
cause	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
shine;	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
80:4	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
how	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
angry	1
against	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
people?	1
	1
80:5	1
Thou	1
feedest	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
tears;	1
and	1
givest	1
them	1
tears	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
great	1
measure.	1
	1
80:6	1
Thou	1
makest	1
us	1
a	1
strife	1
unto	1
our	1
neighbours:	1
and	1
our	1
enemies	1
laugh	1
among	1
themselves.	1
	1
80:7	1
Turn	1
us	1
again,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
cause	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
shine;	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
80:8	1
Thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
a	1
vine	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
thou	1
hast	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
planted	1
it.	1
	1
80:9	1
Thou	1
preparedst	1
room	1
before	1
it,	1
and	1
didst	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
deep	1
root,	1
and	1
it	1
filled	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
80:10	1
The	1
hills	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
boughs	1
thereof	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
goodly	1
cedars.	1
	1
80:11	1
She	1
sent	1
out	1
her	1
boughs	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
her	1
branches	1
unto	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
80:12	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
then	1
broken	1
down	1
her	1
hedges,	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
pass	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
do	1
pluck	1
her?	1
	1
80:13	1
The	1
boar	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
doth	1
waste	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
doth	1
devour	1
it.	1
	1
80:14	1
Return,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
hosts:	1
look	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
behold,	1
and	1
visit	1
this	1
vine;	1
	1
80:15	1
And	1
the	1
vineyard	1
which	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
hath	1
planted,	1
and	1
the	1
branch	1
that	1
thou	1
madest	1
strong	1
for	1
thyself.	1
	1
80:16	1
It	1
is	1
burned	1
with	1
fire,	1
it	1
is	1
cut	1
down:	1
they	1
perish	1
at	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
thy	1
countenance.	1
	1
80:17	1
Let	1
thy	1
hand	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
upon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
whom	1
thou	1
madest	1
strong	1
for	1
thyself.	1
	1
80:18	1
So	1
will	1
not	1
we	1
go	1
back	1
from	1
thee:	1
quicken	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
call	1
upon	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
80:19	1
Turn	1
us	1
again,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
cause	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
shine;	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
	1
	1
81:1	1
Sing	1
aloud	1
unto	1
God	1
our	1
strength:	1
make	1
a	1
joyful	1
noise	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
81:2	1
Take	1
a	1
psalm,	1
and	1
bring	1
hither	1
the	1
timbrel,	1
the	1
pleasant	1
harp	1
with	1
the	1
psaltery.	1
	1
81:3	1
Blow	1
up	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
moon,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
appointed,	1
on	1
our	1
solemn	1
feast	1
day.	1
	1
81:4	1
For	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
Israel,	1
and	1
a	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
81:5	1
This	1
he	1
ordained	1
in	1
Joseph	1
for	1
a	1
testimony,	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
where	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
language	1
that	1
I	1
understood	1
not.	1
	1
81:6	1
I	1
removed	1
his	1
shoulder	1
from	1
the	1
burden:	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
pots.	1
	1
81:7	1
Thou	1
calledst	1
in	1
trouble,	1
and	1
I	1
delivered	1
thee;	1
I	1
answered	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
place	1
of	1
thunder:	1
I	1
proved	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Meribah.	1
	1
Selah.	1
	1
81:8	1
Hear,	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
testify	1
unto	1
thee:	1
O	1
Israel,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me;	1
	1
81:9	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
strange	1
god	1
be	1
in	1
thee;	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
worship	1
any	1
strange	1
god.	1
	1
81:10	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
open	1
thy	1
mouth	1
wide,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
it.	1
	1
81:11	1
But	1
my	1
people	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
my	1
voice;	1
and	1
Israel	1
would	1
none	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
81:12	1
So	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
hearts'	1
lust:	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
counsels.	1
	1
81:13	1
Oh	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
had	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
Israel	1
had	1
walked	1
in	1
my	1
ways!	1
	1
81:14	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
have	1
subdued	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
turned	1
my	1
hand	1
against	1
their	1
adversaries.	1
	1
81:15	1
The	1
haters	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
should	1
have	1
submitted	1
themselves	1
unto	1
him:	1
but	1
their	1
time	1
should	1
have	1
endured	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
81:16	1
He	1
should	1
have	1
fed	1
them	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
finest	1
of	1
the	1
wheat:	1
and	1
with	1
honey	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
satisfied	1
thee.	1
	1
	1
	1
82:1	1
God	1
standeth	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
mighty;	1
he	1
judgeth	1
among	1
the	1
gods.	1
	1
82:2	1
How	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
judge	1
unjustly,	1
and	1
accept	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
the	1
wicked?	1
Selah.	1
	1
82:3	1
Defend	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
fatherless:	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
the	1
afflicted	1
and	1
needy.	1
	1
82:4	1
Deliver	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy:	1
rid	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
82:5	1
They	1
know	1
not,	1
neither	1
will	1
they	1
understand;	1
they	1
walk	1
on	1
in	1
darkness:	1
all	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
course.	1
	1
82:6	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
Ye	1
are	1
gods;	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
are	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High.	1
	1
82:7	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
like	1
men,	1
and	1
fall	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
princes.	1
	1
82:8	1
Arise,	1
O	1
God,	1
judge	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
inherit	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
	1
	1
83:1	1
Keep	1
not	1
thou	1
silence,	1
O	1
God:	1
hold	1
not	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
still,	1
O	1
God.	1
	1
83:2	1
For,	1
lo,	1
thine	1
enemies	1
make	1
a	1
tumult:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hate	1
thee	1
have	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
head.	1
	1
83:3	1
They	1
have	1
taken	1
crafty	1
counsel	1
against	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
consulted	1
against	1
thy	1
hidden	1
ones.	1
	1
83:4	1
They	1
have	1
said,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
nation;	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Israel	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
remembrance.	1
	1
83:5	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
consulted	1
together	1
with	1
one	1
consent:	1
they	1
are	1
confederate	1
against	1
thee:	1
	1
83:6	1
The	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
the	1
Ishmaelites;	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
Hagarenes;	1
	1
83:7	1
Gebal,	1
and	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
Amalek;	1
the	1
Philistines	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Tyre;	1
	1
83:8	1
Assur	1
also	1
is	1
joined	1
with	1
them:	1
they	1
have	1
holpen	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Lot.	1
	1
Selah.	1
	1
83:9	1
Do	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
Midianites;	1
as	1
to	1
Sisera,	1
as	1
to	1
Jabin,	1
at	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
Kison:	1
	1
83:10	1
Which	1
perished	1
at	1
Endor:	1
they	1
became	1
as	1
dung	1
for	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
83:11	1
Make	1
their	1
nobles	1
like	1
Oreb,	1
and	1
like	1
Zeeb:	1
yea,	1
all	1
their	1
princes	1
as	1
Zebah,	1
and	1
as	1
Zalmunna:	1
	1
83:12	1
Who	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
take	1
to	1
ourselves	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
possession.	1
	1
83:13	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
make	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
wheel;	1
as	1
the	1
stubble	1
before	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
83:14	1
As	1
the	1
fire	1
burneth	1
a	1
wood,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
flame	1
setteth	1
the	1
mountains	1
on	1
fire;	1
	1
83:15	1
So	1
persecute	1
them	1
with	1
thy	1
tempest,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
afraid	1
with	1
thy	1
storm.	1
	1
83:16	1
Fill	1
their	1
faces	1
with	1
shame;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
seek	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
83:17	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
confounded	1
and	1
troubled	1
for	1
ever;	1
yea,	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
shame,	1
and	1
perish:	1
	1
83:18	1
That	1
men	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou,	1
whose	1
name	1
alone	1
is	1
JEHOVAH,	1
art	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
	1
	1
84:1	1
How	1
amiable	1
are	1
thy	1
tabernacles,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts!	1
	1
84:2	1
My	1
soul	1
longeth,	1
yea,	1
even	1
fainteth	1
for	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
my	1
flesh	1
crieth	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
84:3	1
Yea,	1
the	1
sparrow	1
hath	1
found	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
swallow	1
a	1
nest	1
for	1
herself,	1
where	1
she	1
may	1
lay	1
her	1
young,	1
even	1
thine	1
altars,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
my	1
King,	1
and	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
84:4	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
thy	1
house:	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
praising	1
thee.	1
Selah.	1
	1
84:5	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
strength	1
is	1
in	1
thee;	1
in	1
whose	1
heart	1
are	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
84:6	1
Who	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Baca	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
well;	1
the	1
rain	1
also	1
filleth	1
the	1
pools.	1
	1
84:7	1
They	1
go	1
from	1
strength	1
to	1
strength,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
Zion	1
appeareth	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
84:8	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
hear	1
my	1
prayer:	1
give	1
ear,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
Selah.	1
	1
84:9	1
Behold,	1
O	1
God	1
our	1
shield,	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
thine	1
anointed.	1
	1
84:10	1
For	1
a	1
day	1
in	1
thy	1
courts	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
thousand.	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
be	1
a	1
doorkeeper	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
than	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
wickedness.	1
	1
84:11	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
sun	1
and	1
shield:	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
give	1
grace	1
and	1
glory:	1
no	1
good	1
thing	1
will	1
he	1
withhold	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
walk	1
uprightly.	1
	1
84:12	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
	1
	1
85:1	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
favourable	1
unto	1
thy	1
land:	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
back	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
85:2	1
Thou	1
hast	1
forgiven	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
thou	1
hast	1
covered	1
all	1
their	1
sin.	1
Selah.	1
	1
85:3	1
Thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
away	1
all	1
thy	1
wrath:	1
thou	1
hast	1
turned	1
thyself	1
from	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
thine	1
anger.	1
	1
85:4	1
Turn	1
us,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
salvation,	1
and	1
cause	1
thine	1
anger	1
toward	1
us	1
to	1
cease.	1
	1
85:5	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
ever?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
draw	1
out	1
thine	1
anger	1
to	1
all	1
generations?	1
	1
85:6	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
revive	1
us	1
again:	1
that	1
thy	1
people	1
may	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thee?	1
	1
85:7	1
Shew	1
us	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
grant	1
us	1
thy	1
salvation.	1
	1
85:8	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
what	1
God	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
speak:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
speak	1
peace	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
saints:	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
folly.	1
	1
85:9	1
Surely	1
his	1
salvation	1
is	1
nigh	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him;	1
that	1
glory	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
our	1
land.	1
	1
85:10	1
Mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
are	1
met	1
together;	1
righteousness	1
and	1
peace	1
have	1
kissed	1
each	1
other.	1
	1
85:11	1
Truth	1
shall	1
spring	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
look	1
down	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
85:12	1
Yea,	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good;	1
and	1
our	1
land	1
shall	1
yield	1
her	1
increase.	1
	1
85:13	1
Righteousness	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
steps.	1
	1
	1
	1
86:1	1
Bow	1
down	1
thine	1
ear,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
hear	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
poor	1
and	1
needy.	1
	1
86:2	1
Preserve	1
my	1
soul;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holy:	1
O	1
thou	1
my	1
God,	1
save	1
thy	1
servant	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
86:3	1
Be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
Lord:	1
for	1
I	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
daily.	1
	1
86:4	1
Rejoice	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
thy	1
servant:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
do	1
I	1
lift	1
up	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
86:5	1
For	1
thou,	1
Lord,	1
art	1
good,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
forgive;	1
and	1
plenteous	1
in	1
mercy	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
86:6	1
Give	1
ear,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
my	1
prayer;	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
supplications.	1
	1
86:7	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
trouble	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
upon	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
wilt	1
answer	1
me.	1
	1
86:8	1
Among	1
the	1
gods	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord;	1
neither	1
are	1
there	1
any	1
works	1
like	1
unto	1
thy	1
works.	1
	1
86:9	1
All	1
nations	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord;	1
and	1
shall	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
86:10	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
great,	1
and	1
doest	1
wondrous	1
things:	1
thou	1
art	1
God	1
alone.	1
	1
86:11	1
Teach	1
me	1
thy	1
way,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
thy	1
truth:	1
unite	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
fear	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
86:12	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord	1
my	1
God,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
86:13	1
For	1
great	1
is	1
thy	1
mercy	1
toward	1
me:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
lowest	1
hell.	1
	1
86:14	1
O	1
God,	1
the	1
proud	1
are	1
risen	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
assemblies	1
of	1
violent	1
men	1
have	1
sought	1
after	1
my	1
soul;	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
set	1
thee	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
86:15	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
art	1
a	1
God	1
full	1
of	1
compassion,	1
and	1
gracious,	1
long	1
suffering,	1
and	1
plenteous	1
in	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
86:16	1
O	1
turn	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me;	1
give	1
thy	1
strength	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
save	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid.	1
	1
86:17	1
Shew	1
me	1
a	1
token	1
for	1
good;	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
hate	1
me	1
may	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
because	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
hast	1
holpen	1
me,	1
and	1
comforted	1
me.	1
	1
	1
	1
87:1	1
His	1
foundation	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
mountains.	1
	1
87:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
loveth	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Zion	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
dwellings	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
87:3	1
Glorious	1
things	1
are	1
spoken	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
city	1
of	1
God.	1
Selah.	1
	1
87:4	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
Rahab	1
and	1
Babylon	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
me:	1
behold	1
Philistia,	1
and	1
Tyre,	1
with	1
Ethiopia;	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
born	1
there.	1
	1
87:5	1
And	1
of	1
Zion	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said,	1
This	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
her:	1
and	1
the	1
highest	1
himself	1
shall	1
establish	1
her.	1
	1
87:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
count,	1
when	1
he	1
writeth	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
born	1
there.	1
Selah.	1
	1
87:7	1
As	1
well	1
the	1
singers	1
as	1
the	1
players	1
on	1
instruments	1
shall	1
be	1
there:	1
all	1
my	1
springs	1
are	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
	1
	1
88:1	1
O	1
lord	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation,	1
I	1
have	1
cried	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
before	1
thee:	1
	1
88:2	1
Let	1
my	1
prayer	1
come	1
before	1
thee:	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
cry;	1
	1
88:3	1
For	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
troubles:	1
and	1
my	1
life	1
draweth	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
88:4	1
I	1
am	1
counted	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
pit:	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
strength:	1
	1
88:5	1
Free	1
among	1
the	1
dead,	1
like	1
the	1
slain	1
that	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
grave,	1
whom	1
thou	1
rememberest	1
no	1
more:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
thy	1
hand.	1
	1
88:6	1
Thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
lowest	1
pit,	1
in	1
darkness,	1
in	1
the	1
deeps.	1
	1
88:7	1
Thy	1
wrath	1
lieth	1
hard	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
afflicted	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
waves.	1
Selah.	1
	1
88:8	1
Thou	1
hast	1
put	1
away	1
mine	1
acquaintance	1
far	1
from	1
me;	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
shut	1
up,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
come	1
forth.	1
	1
88:9	1
Mine	1
eye	1
mourneth	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
affliction:	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
daily	1
upon	1
thee,	1
I	1
have	1
stretched	1
out	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
88:10	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
shew	1
wonders	1
to	1
the	1
dead?	1
shall	1
the	1
dead	1
arise	1
and	1
praise	1
thee?	1
Selah.	1
	1
88:11	1
Shall	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
be	1
declared	1
in	1
the	1
grave?	1
or	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
in	1
destruction?	1
	1
88:12	1
Shall	1
thy	1
wonders	1
be	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
dark?	1
and	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
forgetfulness?	1
	1
88:13	1
But	1
unto	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
cried,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
shall	1
my	1
prayer	1
prevent	1
thee.	1
	1
88:14	1
LORD,	1
why	1
castest	1
thou	1
off	1
my	1
soul?	1
why	1
hidest	1
thou	1
thy	1
face	1
from	1
me?	1
	1
88:15	1
I	1
am	1
afflicted	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
up:	1
while	1
I	1
suffer	1
thy	1
terrors	1
I	1
am	1
distracted.	1
	1
88:16	1
Thy	1
fierce	1
wrath	1
goeth	1
over	1
me;	1
thy	1
terrors	1
have	1
cut	1
me	1
off.	1
	1
88:17	1
They	1
came	1
round	1
about	1
me	1
daily	1
like	1
water;	1
they	1
compassed	1
me	1
about	1
together.	1
	1
88:18	1
Lover	1
and	1
friend	1
hast	1
thou	1
put	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
mine	1
acquaintance	1
into	1
darkness.	1
	1
	1
	1
89:1	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
of	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
ever:	1
with	1
my	1
mouth	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
known	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
to	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
89:2	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
Mercy	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
up	1
for	1
ever:	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
shalt	1
thou	1
establish	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
heavens.	1
	1
89:3	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
my	1
chosen,	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
unto	1
David	1
my	1
servant,	1
	1
89:4	1
Thy	1
seed	1
will	1
I	1
establish	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
build	1
up	1
thy	1
throne	1
to	1
all	1
generations.	1
Selah.	1
	1
89:5	1
And	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
praise	1
thy	1
wonders,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
89:6	1
For	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
heaven	1
can	1
be	1
compared	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD?	1
who	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
can	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
89:7	1
God	1
is	1
greatly	1
to	1
be	1
feared	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
in	1
reverence	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
89:8	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
LORD	1
like	1
unto	1
thee?	1
or	1
to	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
round	1
about	1
thee?	1
	1
89:9	1
Thou	1
rulest	1
the	1
raging	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
when	1
the	1
waves	1
thereof	1
arise,	1
thou	1
stillest	1
them.	1
	1
89:10	1
Thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
Rahab	1
in	1
pieces,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
slain;	1
thou	1
hast	1
scattered	1
thine	1
enemies	1
with	1
thy	1
strong	1
arm.	1
	1
89:11	1
The	1
heavens	1
are	1
thine,	1
the	1
earth	1
also	1
is	1
thine:	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof,	1
thou	1
hast	1
founded	1
them.	1
	1
89:12	1
The	1
north	1
and	1
the	1
south	1
thou	1
hast	1
created	1
them:	1
Tabor	1
and	1
Hermon	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
89:13	1
Thou	1
hast	1
a	1
mighty	1
arm:	1
strong	1
is	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
high	1
is	1
thy	1
right	1
hand.	1
	1
89:14	1
Justice	1
and	1
judgment	1
are	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
thy	1
throne:	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
thy	1
face.	1
	1
89:15	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
know	1
the	1
joyful	1
sound:	1
they	1
shall	1
walk,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
thy	1
countenance.	1
	1
89:16	1
In	1
thy	1
name	1
shall	1
they	1
rejoice	1
all	1
the	1
day:	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
89:17	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
their	1
strength:	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
favour	1
our	1
horn	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
89:18	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
our	1
defence;	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
our	1
king.	1
	1
89:19	1
Then	1
thou	1
spakest	1
in	1
vision	1
to	1
thy	1
holy	1
one,	1
and	1
saidst,	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
help	1
upon	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
mighty;	1
I	1
have	1
exalted	1
one	1
chosen	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
89:20	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
David	1
my	1
servant;	1
with	1
my	1
holy	1
oil	1
have	1
I	1
anointed	1
him:	1
	1
89:21	1
With	1
whom	1
my	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
established:	1
mine	1
arm	1
also	1
shall	1
strengthen	1
him.	1
	1
89:22	1
The	1
enemy	1
shall	1
not	1
exact	1
upon	1
him;	1
nor	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
wickedness	1
afflict	1
him.	1
	1
89:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
beat	1
down	1
his	1
foes	1
before	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
plague	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
him.	1
	1
89:24	1
But	1
my	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
my	1
mercy	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
his	1
horn	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
89:25	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
his	1
hand	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
rivers.	1
	1
89:26	1
He	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
father,	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
89:27	1
Also	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
my	1
firstborn,	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
89:28	1
My	1
mercy	1
will	1
I	1
keep	1
for	1
him	1
for	1
evermore,	1
and	1
my	1
covenant	1
shall	1
stand	1
fast	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
89:29	1
His	1
seed	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
to	1
endure	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
his	1
throne	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
89:30	1
If	1
his	1
children	1
forsake	1
my	1
law,	1
and	1
walk	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
judgments;	1
	1
89:31	1
If	1
they	1
break	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
keep	1
not	1
my	1
commandments;	1
	1
89:32	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
visit	1
their	1
transgression	1
with	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
their	1
iniquity	1
with	1
stripes.	1
	1
89:33	1
Nevertheless	1
my	1
lovingkindness	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
utterly	1
take	1
from	1
him,	1
nor	1
suffer	1
my	1
faithfulness	1
to	1
fail.	1
	1
89:34	1
My	1
covenant	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
break,	1
nor	1
alter	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
lips.	1
	1
89:35	1
Once	1
have	1
I	1
sworn	1
by	1
my	1
holiness	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
lie	1
unto	1
David.	1
	1
89:36	1
His	1
seed	1
shall	1
endure	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
his	1
throne	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
89:37	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever	1
as	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
faithful	1
witness	1
in	1
heaven.	1
Selah.	1
	1
89:38	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
cast	1
off	1
and	1
abhorred,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
wroth	1
with	1
thine	1
anointed.	1
	1
89:39	1
Thou	1
hast	1
made	1
void	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
thy	1
servant:	1
thou	1
hast	1
profaned	1
his	1
crown	1
by	1
casting	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
89:40	1
Thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
down	1
all	1
his	1
hedges;	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
his	1
strong	1
holds	1
to	1
ruin.	1
	1
89:41	1
All	1
that	1
pass	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
spoil	1
him:	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
his	1
neighbours.	1
	1
89:42	1
Thou	1
hast	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
adversaries;	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
all	1
his	1
enemies	1
to	1
rejoice.	1
	1
89:43	1
Thou	1
hast	1
also	1
turned	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
89:44	1
Thou	1
hast	1
made	1
his	1
glory	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
cast	1
his	1
throne	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
89:45	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
youth	1
hast	1
thou	1
shortened:	1
thou	1
hast	1
covered	1
him	1
with	1
shame.	1
Selah.	1
	1
89:46	1
How	1
long,	1
LORD?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
hide	1
thyself	1
for	1
ever?	1
shall	1
thy	1
wrath	1
burn	1
like	1
fire?	1
	1
89:47	1
Remember	1
how	1
short	1
my	1
time	1
is:	1
wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
made	1
all	1
men	1
in	1
vain?	1
	1
89:48	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
liveth,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
death?	1
shall	1
he	1
deliver	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
grave?	1
Selah.	1
	1
89:49	1
Lord,	1
where	1
are	1
thy	1
former	1
lovingkindnesses,	1
which	1
thou	1
swarest	1
unto	1
David	1
in	1
thy	1
truth?	1
	1
89:50	1
Remember,	1
Lord,	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
thy	1
servants;	1
how	1
I	1
do	1
bear	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
people;	1
	1
89:51	1
Wherewith	1
thine	1
enemies	1
have	1
reproached,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
wherewith	1
they	1
have	1
reproached	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
thine	1
anointed.	1
	1
89:52	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
evermore.	1
Amen,	1
and	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
90:1	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
our	1
dwelling	1
place	1
in	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
90:2	1
Before	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
brought	1
forth,	1
or	1
ever	1
thou	1
hadst	1
formed	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
from	1
everlasting	1
to	1
everlasting,	1
thou	1
art	1
God.	1
	1
90:3	1
Thou	1
turnest	1
man	1
to	1
destruction;	1
and	1
sayest,	1
Return,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
90:4	1
For	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
in	1
thy	1
sight	1
are	1
but	1
as	1
yesterday	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
past,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
watch	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
90:5	1
Thou	1
carriest	1
them	1
away	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
flood;	1
they	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
sleep:	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
they	1
are	1
like	1
grass	1
which	1
groweth	1
up.	1
	1
90:6	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
flourisheth,	1
and	1
groweth	1
up;	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
it	1
is	1
cut	1
down,	1
and	1
withereth.	1
	1
90:7	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
consumed	1
by	1
thine	1
anger,	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
wrath	1
are	1
we	1
troubled.	1
	1
90:8	1
Thou	1
hast	1
set	1
our	1
iniquities	1
before	1
thee,	1
our	1
secret	1
sins	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
thy	1
countenance.	1
	1
90:9	1
For	1
all	1
our	1
days	1
are	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
thy	1
wrath:	1
we	1
spend	1
our	1
years	1
as	1
a	1
tale	1
that	1
is	1
told.	1
	1
90:10	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
years	1
are	1
threescore	1
years	1
and	1
ten;	1
and	1
if	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
strength	1
they	1
be	1
fourscore	1
years,	1
yet	1
is	1
their	1
strength	1
labour	1
and	1
sorrow;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
soon	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
we	1
fly	1
away.	1
	1
90:11	1
Who	1
knoweth	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
thine	1
anger?	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
fear,	1
so	1
is	1
thy	1
wrath.	1
	1
90:12	1
So	1
teach	1
us	1
to	1
number	1
our	1
days,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
apply	1
our	1
hearts	1
unto	1
wisdom.	1
	1
90:13	1
Return,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
how	1
long?	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
repent	1
thee	1
concerning	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
90:14	1
O	1
satisfy	1
us	1
early	1
with	1
thy	1
mercy;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
rejoice	1
and	1
be	1
glad	1
all	1
our	1
days.	1
	1
90:15	1
Make	1
us	1
glad	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
afflicted	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
years	1
wherein	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
evil.	1
	1
90:16	1
Let	1
thy	1
work	1
appear	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
thy	1
glory	1
unto	1
their	1
children.	1
	1
90:17	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
be	1
upon	1
us:	1
and	1
establish	1
thou	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
our	1
hands	1
upon	1
us;	1
yea,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
our	1
hands	1
establish	1
thou	1
it.	1
	1
	1
	1
91:1	1
He	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
shall	1
abide	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty.	1
	1
91:2	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
He	1
is	1
my	1
refuge	1
and	1
my	1
fortress:	1
my	1
God;	1
in	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
trust.	1
	1
91:3	1
Surely	1
he	1
shall	1
deliver	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
fowler,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
noisome	1
pestilence.	1
	1
91:4	1
He	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee	1
with	1
his	1
feathers,	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
wings	1
shalt	1
thou	1
trust:	1
his	1
truth	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
shield	1
and	1
buckler.	1
	1
91:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
for	1
the	1
terror	1
by	1
night;	1
nor	1
for	1
the	1
arrow	1
that	1
flieth	1
by	1
day;	1
	1
91:6	1
Nor	1
for	1
the	1
pestilence	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness;	1
nor	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
that	1
wasteth	1
at	1
noonday.	1
	1
91:7	1
A	1
thousand	1
shall	1
fall	1
at	1
thy	1
side,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
at	1
thy	1
right	1
hand;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
thee.	1
	1
91:8	1
Only	1
with	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shalt	1
thou	1
behold	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
91:9	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
is	1
my	1
refuge,	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
thy	1
habitation;	1
	1
91:10	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
evil	1
befall	1
thee,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
plague	1
come	1
nigh	1
thy	1
dwelling.	1
	1
91:11	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
angels	1
charge	1
over	1
thee,	1
to	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
ways.	1
	1
91:12	1
They	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
lest	1
thou	1
dash	1
thy	1
foot	1
against	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
91:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
tread	1
upon	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
adder:	1
the	1
young	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
shalt	1
thou	1
trample	1
under	1
feet.	1
	1
91:14	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
his	1
love	1
upon	1
me,	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
him:	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
high,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
known	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
91:15	1
He	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
him:	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
trouble;	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
him,	1
and	1
honour	1
him.	1
	1
91:16	1
With	1
long	1
life	1
will	1
I	1
satisfy	1
him,	1
and	1
shew	1
him	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
	1
	1
92:1	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
to	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
most	1
High:	1
	1
92:2	1
To	1
shew	1
forth	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
every	1
night,	1
	1
92:3	1
Upon	1
an	1
instrument	1
of	1
ten	1
strings,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
psaltery;	1
upon	1
the	1
harp	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
sound.	1
	1
92:4	1
For	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
glad	1
through	1
thy	1
work:	1
I	1
will	1
triumph	1
in	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thy	1
hands.	1
	1
92:5	1
O	1
LORD,	1
how	1
great	1
are	1
thy	1
works!	1
and	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
are	1
very	1
deep.	1
	1
92:6	1
A	1
brutish	1
man	1
knoweth	1
not;	1
neither	1
doth	1
a	1
fool	1
understand	1
this.	1
	1
92:7	1
When	1
the	1
wicked	1
spring	1
as	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
do	1
flourish;	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
92:8	1
But	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
art	1
most	1
high	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
92:9	1
For,	1
lo,	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
for,	1
lo,	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
perish;	1
all	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered.	1
	1
92:10	1
But	1
my	1
horn	1
shalt	1
thou	1
exalt	1
like	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
an	1
unicorn:	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
anointed	1
with	1
fresh	1
oil.	1
	1
92:11	1
Mine	1
eye	1
also	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
desire	1
on	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
mine	1
ears	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
92:12	1
The	1
righteous	1
shall	1
flourish	1
like	1
the	1
palm	1
tree:	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
like	1
a	1
cedar	1
in	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
92:13	1
Those	1
that	1
be	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
flourish	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
92:14	1
They	1
shall	1
still	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
in	1
old	1
age;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
fat	1
and	1
flourishing;	1
	1
92:15	1
To	1
shew	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upright:	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
rock,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
93:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
reigneth,	1
he	1
is	1
clothed	1
with	1
majesty;	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
clothed	1
with	1
strength,	1
wherewith	1
he	1
hath	1
girded	1
himself:	1
the	1
world	1
also	1
is	1
stablished,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
93:2	1
Thy	1
throne	1
is	1
established	1
of	1
old:	1
thou	1
art	1
from	1
everlasting.	1
	1
93:3	1
The	1
floods	1
have	1
lifted	1
up,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
the	1
floods	1
have	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice;	1
the	1
floods	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
waves.	1
	1
93:4	1
The	1
LORD	1
on	1
high	1
is	1
mightier	1
than	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
yea,	1
than	1
the	1
mighty	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
93:5	1
Thy	1
testimonies	1
are	1
very	1
sure:	1
holiness	1
becometh	1
thine	1
house,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
94:1	1
O	1
Lord	1
God,	1
to	1
whom	1
vengeance	1
belongeth;	1
O	1
God,	1
to	1
whom	1
vengeance	1
belongeth,	1
shew	1
thyself.	1
	1
94:2	1
Lift	1
up	1
thyself,	1
thou	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
render	1
a	1
reward	1
to	1
the	1
proud.	1
	1
94:3	1
LORD,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
the	1
wicked,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
the	1
wicked	1
triumph?	1
	1
94:4	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
they	1
utter	1
and	1
speak	1
hard	1
things?	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
boast	1
themselves?	1
	1
94:5	1
They	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
thy	1
people,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
afflict	1
thine	1
heritage.	1
	1
94:6	1
They	1
slay	1
the	1
widow	1
and	1
the	1
stranger,	1
and	1
murder	1
the	1
fatherless.	1
	1
94:7	1
Yet	1
they	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
not	1
see,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
regard	1
it.	1
	1
94:8	1
Understand,	1
ye	1
brutish	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
ye	1
fools,	1
when	1
will	1
ye	1
be	1
wise?	1
	1
94:9	1
He	1
that	1
planted	1
the	1
ear,	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
hear?	1
he	1
that	1
formed	1
the	1
eye,	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
see?	1
	1
94:10	1
He	1
that	1
chastiseth	1
the	1
heathen,	1
shall	1
not	1
he	1
correct?	1
he	1
that	1
teacheth	1
man	1
knowledge,	1
shall	1
not	1
he	1
know?	1
	1
94:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
knoweth	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
man,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
vanity.	1
	1
94:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
thou	1
chastenest,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
teachest	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
law;	1
	1
94:13	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
give	1
him	1
rest	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
adversity,	1
until	1
the	1
pit	1
be	1
digged	1
for	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
94:14	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
cast	1
off	1
his	1
people,	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
forsake	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
94:15	1
But	1
judgment	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
righteousness:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
upright	1
in	1
heart	1
shall	1
follow	1
it.	1
	1
94:16	1
Who	1
will	1
rise	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
against	1
the	1
evildoers?	1
or	1
who	1
will	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
against	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity?	1
	1
94:17	1
Unless	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
help,	1
my	1
soul	1
had	1
almost	1
dwelt	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
94:18	1
When	1
I	1
said,	1
My	1
foot	1
slippeth;	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
held	1
me	1
up.	1
	1
94:19	1
In	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
my	1
thoughts	1
within	1
me	1
thy	1
comforts	1
delight	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
94:20	1
Shall	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
iniquity	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
thee,	1
which	1
frameth	1
mischief	1
by	1
a	1
law?	1
	1
94:21	1
They	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
condemn	1
the	1
innocent	1
blood.	1
	1
94:22	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
defence;	1
and	1
my	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
my	1
refuge.	1
	1
94:23	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
upon	1
them	1
their	1
own	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
shall	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
wickedness;	1
yea,	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
cut	1
them	1
off.	1
	1
	1
	1
95:1	1
O	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
joyful	1
noise	1
to	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
our	1
salvation.	1
	1
95:2	1
Let	1
us	1
come	1
before	1
his	1
presence	1
with	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
joyful	1
noise	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
psalms.	1
	1
95:3	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
God,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
King	1
above	1
all	1
gods.	1
	1
95:4	1
In	1
his	1
hand	1
are	1
the	1
deep	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
hills	1
is	1
his	1
also.	1
	1
95:5	1
The	1
sea	1
is	1
his,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
it:	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
formed	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
95:6	1
O	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
worship	1
and	1
bow	1
down:	1
let	1
us	1
kneel	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
maker.	1
	1
95:7	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
God;	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
his	1
pasture,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
	1
95:8	1
Harden	1
not	1
your	1
heart,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
temptation	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
	1
95:9	1
When	1
your	1
fathers	1
tempted	1
me,	1
proved	1
me,	1
and	1
saw	1
my	1
work.	1
	1
95:10	1
Forty	1
years	1
long	1
was	1
I	1
grieved	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
do	1
err	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
my	1
ways:	1
	1
95:11	1
Unto	1
whom	1
I	1
sware	1
in	1
my	1
wrath	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.	1
	1
	1
	1
96:1	1
O	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
new	1
song:	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
96:2	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
bless	1
his	1
name;	1
shew	1
forth	1
his	1
salvation	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
96:3	1
Declare	1
his	1
glory	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
his	1
wonders	1
among	1
all	1
people.	1
	1
96:4	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
great,	1
and	1
greatly	1
to	1
be	1
praised:	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
feared	1
above	1
all	1
gods.	1
	1
96:5	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
are	1
idols:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
96:6	1
Honour	1
and	1
majesty	1
are	1
before	1
him:	1
strength	1
and	1
beauty	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
96:7	1
Give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
ye	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
glory	1
and	1
strength.	1
	1
96:8	1
Give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
glory	1
due	1
unto	1
his	1
name:	1
bring	1
an	1
offering,	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
courts.	1
	1
96:9	1
O	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
holiness:	1
fear	1
before	1
him,	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
96:10	1
Say	1
among	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
reigneth:	1
the	1
world	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved:	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
people	1
righteously.	1
	1
96:11	1
Let	1
the	1
heavens	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
glad;	1
let	1
the	1
sea	1
roar,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof.	1
	1
96:12	1
Let	1
the	1
field	1
be	1
joyful,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein:	1
then	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
rejoice	1
	1
96:13	1
Before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
cometh,	1
for	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
his	1
truth.	1
	1
	1
	1
97:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
reigneth;	1
let	1
the	1
earth	1
rejoice;	1
let	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
isles	1
be	1
glad	1
thereof.	1
	1
97:2	1
Clouds	1
and	1
darkness	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
him:	1
righteousness	1
and	1
judgment	1
are	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
97:3	1
A	1
fire	1
goeth	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
burneth	1
up	1
his	1
enemies	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
97:4	1
His	1
lightnings	1
enlightened	1
the	1
world:	1
the	1
earth	1
saw,	1
and	1
trembled.	1
	1
97:5	1
The	1
hills	1
melted	1
like	1
wax	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
97:6	1
The	1
heavens	1
declare	1
his	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
see	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
97:7	1
Confounded	1
be	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
serve	1
graven	1
images,	1
that	1
boast	1
themselves	1
of	1
idols:	1
worship	1
him,	1
all	1
ye	1
gods.	1
	1
97:8	1
Zion	1
heard,	1
and	1
was	1
glad;	1
and	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Judah	1
rejoiced	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
97:9	1
For	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
art	1
high	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
thou	1
art	1
exalted	1
far	1
above	1
all	1
gods.	1
	1
97:10	1
Ye	1
that	1
love	1
the	1
LORD,	1
hate	1
evil:	1
he	1
preserveth	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
his	1
saints;	1
he	1
delivereth	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
97:11	1
Light	1
is	1
sown	1
for	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
gladness	1
for	1
the	1
upright	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
97:12	1
Rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
righteous;	1
and	1
give	1
thanks	1
at	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
	1
	1
98:1	1
O	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
new	1
song;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
marvellous	1
things:	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
his	1
holy	1
arm,	1
hath	1
gotten	1
him	1
the	1
victory.	1
	1
98:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
known	1
his	1
salvation:	1
his	1
righteousness	1
hath	1
he	1
openly	1
shewed	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
98:3	1
He	1
hath	1
remembered	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
his	1
truth	1
toward	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
98:4	1
Make	1
a	1
joyful	1
noise	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
make	1
a	1
loud	1
noise,	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
sing	1
praise.	1
	1
98:5	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
the	1
harp;	1
with	1
the	1
harp,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
psalm.	1
	1
98:6	1
With	1
trumpets	1
and	1
sound	1
of	1
cornet	1
make	1
a	1
joyful	1
noise	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
King.	1
	1
98:7	1
Let	1
the	1
sea	1
roar,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof;	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
98:8	1
Let	1
the	1
floods	1
clap	1
their	1
hands:	1
let	1
the	1
hills	1
be	1
joyful	1
together	1
	1
98:9	1
Before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
earth:	1
with	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
he	1
judge	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
equity.	1
	1
	1
	1
99:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
reigneth;	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
tremble:	1
he	1
sitteth	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims;	1
let	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
99:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
Zion;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
high	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
99:3	1
Let	1
them	1
praise	1
thy	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
name;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
holy.	1
	1
99:4	1
The	1
king's	1
strength	1
also	1
loveth	1
judgment;	1
thou	1
dost	1
establish	1
equity,	1
thou	1
executest	1
judgment	1
and	1
righteousness	1
in	1
Jacob.	1
	1
99:5	1
Exalt	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
worship	1
at	1
his	1
footstool;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
holy.	1
	1
99:6	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
among	1
his	1
priests,	1
and	1
Samuel	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
upon	1
his	1
name;	1
they	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
answered	1
them.	1
	1
99:7	1
He	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
cloudy	1
pillar:	1
they	1
kept	1
his	1
testimonies,	1
and	1
the	1
ordinance	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
them.	1
	1
99:8	1
Thou	1
answeredst	1
them,	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God:	1
thou	1
wast	1
a	1
God	1
that	1
forgavest	1
them,	1
though	1
thou	1
tookest	1
vengeance	1
of	1
their	1
inventions.	1
	1
99:9	1
Exalt	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
worship	1
at	1
his	1
holy	1
hill;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
holy.	1
	1
	1
	1
100:1	1
Make	1
a	1
joyful	1
noise	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
lands.	1
	1
100:2	1
Serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
gladness:	1
come	1
before	1
his	1
presence	1
with	1
singing.	1
	1
100:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
he	1
is	1
God:	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
made	1
us,	1
and	1
not	1
we	1
ourselves;	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
his	1
pasture.	1
	1
100:4	1
Enter	1
into	1
his	1
gates	1
with	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
into	1
his	1
courts	1
with	1
praise:	1
be	1
thankful	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
bless	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
100:5	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
good;	1
his	1
mercy	1
is	1
everlasting;	1
and	1
his	1
truth	1
endureth	1
to	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
	1
	1
101:1	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
of	1
mercy	1
and	1
judgment:	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
will	1
I	1
sing.	1
	1
101:2	1
I	1
will	1
behave	1
myself	1
wisely	1
in	1
a	1
perfect	1
way.	1
O	1
when	1
wilt	1
thou	1
come	1
unto	1
me?	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
within	1
my	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart.	1
	1
101:3	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
no	1
wicked	1
thing	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes:	1
I	1
hate	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
turn	1
aside;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
cleave	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
101:4	1
A	1
froward	1
heart	1
shall	1
depart	1
from	1
me:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
know	1
a	1
wicked	1
person.	1
	1
101:5	1
Whoso	1
privily	1
slandereth	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off:	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
high	1
look	1
and	1
a	1
proud	1
heart	1
will	1
not	1
I	1
suffer.	1
	1
101:6	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
faithful	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
dwell	1
with	1
me:	1
he	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
a	1
perfect	1
way,	1
he	1
shall	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
101:7	1
He	1
that	1
worketh	1
deceit	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
within	1
my	1
house:	1
he	1
that	1
telleth	1
lies	1
shall	1
not	1
tarry	1
in	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
101:8	1
I	1
will	1
early	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
wicked	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cut	1
off	1
all	1
wicked	1
doers	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
102:1	1
Hear	1
my	1
prayer,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
let	1
my	1
cry	1
come	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
102:2	1
Hide	1
not	1
thy	1
face	1
from	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
trouble;	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear	1
unto	1
me:	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
call	1
answer	1
me	1
speedily.	1
	1
102:3	1
For	1
my	1
days	1
are	1
consumed	1
like	1
smoke,	1
and	1
my	1
bones	1
are	1
burned	1
as	1
an	1
hearth.	1
	1
102:4	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
smitten,	1
and	1
withered	1
like	1
grass;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
forget	1
to	1
eat	1
my	1
bread.	1
	1
102:5	1
By	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
groaning	1
my	1
bones	1
cleave	1
to	1
my	1
skin.	1
	1
102:6	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
pelican	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
an	1
owl	1
of	1
the	1
desert.	1
	1
102:7	1
I	1
watch,	1
and	1
am	1
as	1
a	1
sparrow	1
alone	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
top.	1
	1
102:8	1
Mine	1
enemies	1
reproach	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
day;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
mad	1
against	1
me	1
are	1
sworn	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
102:9	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
ashes	1
like	1
bread,	1
and	1
mingled	1
my	1
drink	1
with	1
weeping.	1
	1
102:10	1
Because	1
of	1
thine	1
indignation	1
and	1
thy	1
wrath:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
lifted	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
cast	1
me	1
down.	1
	1
102:11	1
My	1
days	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
shadow	1
that	1
declineth;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
withered	1
like	1
grass.	1
	1
102:12	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
shall	1
endure	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
thy	1
remembrance	1
unto	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
102:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
arise,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
Zion:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
favour	1
her,	1
yea,	1
the	1
set	1
time,	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
102:14	1
For	1
thy	1
servants	1
take	1
pleasure	1
in	1
her	1
stones,	1
and	1
favour	1
the	1
dust	1
thereof.	1
	1
102:15	1
So	1
the	1
heathen	1
shall	1
fear	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
102:16	1
When	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
build	1
up	1
Zion,	1
he	1
shall	1
appear	1
in	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
102:17	1
He	1
will	1
regard	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
the	1
destitute,	1
and	1
not	1
despise	1
their	1
prayer.	1
	1
102:18	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
for	1
the	1
generation	1
to	1
come:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
created	1
shall	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
102:19	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
looked	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
sanctuary;	1
from	1
heaven	1
did	1
the	1
LORD	1
behold	1
the	1
earth;	1
	1
102:20	1
To	1
hear	1
the	1
groaning	1
of	1
the	1
prisoner;	1
to	1
loose	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
appointed	1
to	1
death;	1
	1
102:21	1
To	1
declare	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
his	1
praise	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
	1
102:22	1
When	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdoms,	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
102:23	1
He	1
weakened	1
my	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
way;	1
he	1
shortened	1
my	1
days.	1
	1
102:24	1
I	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
take	1
me	1
not	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
days:	1
thy	1
years	1
are	1
throughout	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
102:25	1
Of	1
old	1
hast	1
thou	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thy	1
hands.	1
	1
102:26	1
They	1
shall	1
perish,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
endure:	1
yea,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
like	1
a	1
garment;	1
as	1
a	1
vesture	1
shalt	1
thou	1
change	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
changed:	1
	1
102:27	1
But	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
thy	1
years	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
end.	1
	1
102:28	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
servants	1
shall	1
continue,	1
and	1
their	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
	1
	1
103:1	1
Bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
my	1
soul:	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
me,	1
bless	1
his	1
holy	1
name.	1
	1
103:2	1
Bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
my	1
soul,	1
and	1
forget	1
not	1
all	1
his	1
benefits:	1
	1
103:3	1
Who	1
forgiveth	1
all	1
thine	1
iniquities;	1
who	1
healeth	1
all	1
thy	1
diseases;	1
	1
103:4	1
Who	1
redeemeth	1
thy	1
life	1
from	1
destruction;	1
who	1
crowneth	1
thee	1
with	1
lovingkindness	1
and	1
tender	1
mercies;	1
	1
103:5	1
Who	1
satisfieth	1
thy	1
mouth	1
with	1
good	1
things;	1
so	1
that	1
thy	1
youth	1
is	1
renewed	1
like	1
the	1
eagle's.	1
	1
103:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
executeth	1
righteousness	1
and	1
judgment	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
oppressed.	1
	1
103:7	1
He	1
made	1
known	1
his	1
ways	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
his	1
acts	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
103:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
merciful	1
and	1
gracious,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
plenteous	1
in	1
mercy.	1
	1
103:9	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
always	1
chide:	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
keep	1
his	1
anger	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
103:10	1
He	1
hath	1
not	1
dealt	1
with	1
us	1
after	1
our	1
sins;	1
nor	1
rewarded	1
us	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
iniquities.	1
	1
103:11	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
heaven	1
is	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
earth,	1
so	1
great	1
is	1
his	1
mercy	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him.	1
	1
103:12	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
east	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
so	1
far	1
hath	1
he	1
removed	1
our	1
transgressions	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
103:13	1
Like	1
as	1
a	1
father	1
pitieth	1
his	1
children,	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
pitieth	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him.	1
	1
103:14	1
For	1
he	1
knoweth	1
our	1
frame;	1
he	1
remembereth	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
dust.	1
	1
103:15	1
As	1
for	1
man,	1
his	1
days	1
are	1
as	1
grass:	1
as	1
a	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
so	1
he	1
flourisheth.	1
	1
103:16	1
For	1
the	1
wind	1
passeth	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
gone;	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
thereof	1
shall	1
know	1
it	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
103:17	1
But	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
from	1
everlasting	1
to	1
everlasting	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
children's	1
children;	1
	1
103:18	1
To	1
such	1
as	1
keep	1
his	1
covenant,	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
remember	1
his	1
commandments	1
to	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
103:19	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
prepared	1
his	1
throne	1
in	1
the	1
heavens;	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
ruleth	1
over	1
all.	1
	1
103:20	1
Bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
his	1
angels,	1
that	1
excel	1
in	1
strength,	1
that	1
do	1
his	1
commandments,	1
hearkening	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
word.	1
	1
103:21	1
Bless	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
his	1
hosts;	1
ye	1
ministers	1
of	1
his,	1
that	1
do	1
his	1
pleasure.	1
	1
103:22	1
Bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
of	1
his	1
dominion:	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
	1
	1
104:1	1
Bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
my	1
soul.	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
thou	1
art	1
very	1
great;	1
thou	1
art	1
clothed	1
with	1
honour	1
and	1
majesty.	1
	1
104:2	1
Who	1
coverest	1
thyself	1
with	1
light	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
garment:	1
who	1
stretchest	1
out	1
the	1
heavens	1
like	1
a	1
curtain:	1
	1
104:3	1
Who	1
layeth	1
the	1
beams	1
of	1
his	1
chambers	1
in	1
the	1
waters:	1
who	1
maketh	1
the	1
clouds	1
his	1
chariot:	1
who	1
walketh	1
upon	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
wind:	1
	1
104:4	1
Who	1
maketh	1
his	1
angels	1
spirits;	1
his	1
ministers	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire:	1
	1
104:5	1
Who	1
laid	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
removed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
104:6	1
Thou	1
coveredst	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
deep	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
garment:	1
the	1
waters	1
stood	1
above	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
104:7	1
At	1
thy	1
rebuke	1
they	1
fled;	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
thunder	1
they	1
hasted	1
away.	1
	1
104:8	1
They	1
go	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
mountains;	1
they	1
go	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
valleys	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
founded	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
104:9	1
Thou	1
hast	1
set	1
a	1
bound	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
pass	1
over;	1
that	1
they	1
turn	1
not	1
again	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
104:10	1
He	1
sendeth	1
the	1
springs	1
into	1
the	1
valleys,	1
which	1
run	1
among	1
the	1
hills.	1
	1
104:11	1
They	1
give	1
drink	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
the	1
wild	1
asses	1
quench	1
their	1
thirst.	1
	1
104:12	1
By	1
them	1
shall	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
have	1
their	1
habitation,	1
which	1
sing	1
among	1
the	1
branches.	1
	1
104:13	1
He	1
watereth	1
the	1
hills	1
from	1
his	1
chambers:	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
works.	1
	1
104:14	1
He	1
causeth	1
the	1
grass	1
to	1
grow	1
for	1
the	1
cattle,	1
and	1
herb	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
man:	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
food	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
	1
104:15	1
And	1
wine	1
that	1
maketh	1
glad	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
oil	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
shine,	1
and	1
bread	1
which	1
strengtheneth	1
man's	1
heart.	1
	1
104:16	1
The	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
sap;	1
the	1
cedars	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
planted;	1
	1
104:17	1
Where	1
the	1
birds	1
make	1
their	1
nests:	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
stork,	1
the	1
fir	1
trees	1
are	1
her	1
house.	1
	1
104:18	1
The	1
high	1
hills	1
are	1
a	1
refuge	1
for	1
the	1
wild	1
goats;	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
for	1
the	1
conies.	1
	1
104:19	1
He	1
appointed	1
the	1
moon	1
for	1
seasons:	1
the	1
sun	1
knoweth	1
his	1
going	1
down.	1
	1
104:20	1
Thou	1
makest	1
darkness,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
night:	1
wherein	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
do	1
creep	1
forth.	1
	1
104:21	1
The	1
young	1
lions	1
roar	1
after	1
their	1
prey,	1
and	1
seek	1
their	1
meat	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
104:22	1
The	1
sun	1
ariseth,	1
they	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
dens.	1
	1
104:23	1
Man	1
goeth	1
forth	1
unto	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
labour	1
until	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1
104:24	1
O	1
LORD,	1
how	1
manifold	1
are	1
thy	1
works!	1
in	1
wisdom	1
hast	1
thou	1
made	1
them	1
all:	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
thy	1
riches.	1
	1
104:25	1
So	1
is	1
this	1
great	1
and	1
wide	1
sea,	1
wherein	1
are	1
things	1
creeping	1
innumerable,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great	1
beasts.	1
	1
104:26	1
There	1
go	1
the	1
ships:	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
leviathan,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
to	1
play	1
therein.	1
	1
104:27	1
These	1
wait	1
all	1
upon	1
thee;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
give	1
them	1
their	1
meat	1
in	1
due	1
season.	1
	1
104:28	1
That	1
thou	1
givest	1
them	1
they	1
gather:	1
thou	1
openest	1
thine	1
hand,	1
they	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
good.	1
	1
104:29	1
Thou	1
hidest	1
thy	1
face,	1
they	1
are	1
troubled:	1
thou	1
takest	1
away	1
their	1
breath,	1
they	1
die,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
dust.	1
	1
104:30	1
Thou	1
sendest	1
forth	1
thy	1
spirit,	1
they	1
are	1
created:	1
and	1
thou	1
renewest	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
104:31	1
The	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
endure	1
for	1
ever:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
104:32	1
He	1
looketh	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
trembleth:	1
he	1
toucheth	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
they	1
smoke.	1
	1
104:33	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praise	1
to	1
my	1
God	1
while	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
being.	1
	1
104:34	1
My	1
meditation	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
sweet:	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
104:35	1
Let	1
the	1
sinners	1
be	1
consumed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
wicked	1
be	1
no	1
more.	1
Bless	1
thou	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
my	1
soul.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
105:1	1
O	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
call	1
upon	1
his	1
name:	1
make	1
known	1
his	1
deeds	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
105:2	1
Sing	1
unto	1
him,	1
sing	1
psalms	1
unto	1
him:	1
talk	1
ye	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
wondrous	1
works.	1
	1
105:3	1
Glory	1
ye	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
name:	1
let	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
them	1
rejoice	1
that	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
105:4	1
Seek	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
strength:	1
seek	1
his	1
face	1
evermore.	1
	1
105:5	1
Remember	1
his	1
marvellous	1
works	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done;	1
his	1
wonders,	1
and	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
his	1
mouth;	1
	1
105:6	1
O	1
ye	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham	1
his	1
servant,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Jacob	1
his	1
chosen.	1
	1
105:7	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God:	1
his	1
judgments	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
105:8	1
He	1
hath	1
remembered	1
his	1
covenant	1
for	1
ever,	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
generations.	1
	1
105:9	1
Which	1
covenant	1
he	1
made	1
with	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
his	1
oath	1
unto	1
Isaac;	1
	1
105:10	1
And	1
confirmed	1
the	1
same	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
for	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
to	1
Israel	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant:	1
	1
105:11	1
Saying,	1
Unto	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
your	1
inheritance:	1
	1
105:12	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
men	1
in	1
number;	1
yea,	1
very	1
few,	1
and	1
strangers	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
105:13	1
When	1
they	1
went	1
from	1
one	1
nation	1
to	1
another,	1
from	1
one	1
kingdom	1
to	1
another	1
people;	1
	1
105:14	1
He	1
suffered	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
wrong:	1
yea,	1
he	1
reproved	1
kings	1
for	1
their	1
sakes;	1
	1
105:15	1
Saying,	1
Touch	1
not	1
mine	1
anointed,	1
and	1
do	1
my	1
prophets	1
no	1
harm.	1
	1
105:16	1
Moreover	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
famine	1
upon	1
the	1
land:	1
he	1
brake	1
the	1
whole	1
staff	1
of	1
bread.	1
	1
105:17	1
He	1
sent	1
a	1
man	1
before	1
them,	1
even	1
Joseph,	1
who	1
was	1
sold	1
for	1
a	1
servant:	1
	1
105:18	1
Whose	1
feet	1
they	1
hurt	1
with	1
fetters:	1
he	1
was	1
laid	1
in	1
iron:	1
	1
105:19	1
Until	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
his	1
word	1
came:	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
tried	1
him.	1
	1
105:20	1
The	1
king	1
sent	1
and	1
loosed	1
him;	1
even	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
free.	1
	1
105:21	1
He	1
made	1
him	1
lord	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
ruler	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
substance:	1
	1
105:22	1
To	1
bind	1
his	1
princes	1
at	1
his	1
pleasure;	1
and	1
teach	1
his	1
senators	1
wisdom.	1
	1
105:23	1
Israel	1
also	1
came	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
sojourned	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ham.	1
	1
105:24	1
And	1
he	1
increased	1
his	1
people	1
greatly;	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
stronger	1
than	1
their	1
enemies.	1
	1
105:25	1
He	1
turned	1
their	1
heart	1
to	1
hate	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
deal	1
subtilly	1
with	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
105:26	1
He	1
sent	1
Moses	1
his	1
servant;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen.	1
	1
105:27	1
They	1
shewed	1
his	1
signs	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ham.	1
	1
105:28	1
He	1
sent	1
darkness,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
dark;	1
and	1
they	1
rebelled	1
not	1
against	1
his	1
word.	1
	1
105:29	1
He	1
turned	1
their	1
waters	1
into	1
blood,	1
and	1
slew	1
their	1
fish.	1
	1
105:30	1
Their	1
land	1
brought	1
forth	1
frogs	1
in	1
abundance,	1
in	1
the	1
chambers	1
of	1
their	1
kings.	1
	1
105:31	1
He	1
spake,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
divers	1
sorts	1
of	1
flies,	1
and	1
lice	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
105:32	1
He	1
gave	1
them	1
hail	1
for	1
rain,	1
and	1
flaming	1
fire	1
in	1
their	1
land.	1
	1
105:33	1
He	1
smote	1
their	1
vines	1
also	1
and	1
their	1
fig	1
trees;	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
105:34	1
He	1
spake,	1
and	1
the	1
locusts	1
came,	1
and	1
caterpillers,	1
and	1
that	1
without	1
number,	1
	1
105:35	1
And	1
did	1
eat	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
herbs	1
in	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
devoured	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
ground.	1
	1
105:36	1
He	1
smote	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
their	1
land,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
strength.	1
	1
105:37	1
He	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
also	1
with	1
silver	1
and	1
gold:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
feeble	1
person	1
among	1
their	1
tribes.	1
	1
105:38	1
Egypt	1
was	1
glad	1
when	1
they	1
departed:	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
them	1
fell	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
105:39	1
He	1
spread	1
a	1
cloud	1
for	1
a	1
covering;	1
and	1
fire	1
to	1
give	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
105:40	1
The	1
people	1
asked,	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
quails,	1
and	1
satisfied	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
105:41	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
gushed	1
out;	1
they	1
ran	1
in	1
the	1
dry	1
places	1
like	1
a	1
river.	1
	1
105:42	1
For	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
holy	1
promise,	1
and	1
Abraham	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
105:43	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
forth	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
his	1
chosen	1
with	1
gladness:	1
	1
105:44	1
And	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
the	1
heathen:	1
and	1
they	1
inherited	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
	1
105:45	1
That	1
they	1
might	1
observe	1
his	1
statutes,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
laws.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
106:1	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
O	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
good:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
106:2	1
Who	1
can	1
utter	1
the	1
mighty	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
who	1
can	1
shew	1
forth	1
all	1
his	1
praise?	1
	1
106:3	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
keep	1
judgment,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
at	1
all	1
times.	1
	1
106:4	1
Remember	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
with	1
the	1
favour	1
that	1
thou	1
bearest	1
unto	1
thy	1
people:	1
O	1
visit	1
me	1
with	1
thy	1
salvation;	1
	1
106:5	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
thy	1
chosen,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
gladness	1
of	1
thy	1
nation,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
glory	1
with	1
thine	1
inheritance.	1
	1
106:6	1
We	1
have	1
sinned	1
with	1
our	1
fathers,	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
iniquity,	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly.	1
	1
106:7	1
Our	1
fathers	1
understood	1
not	1
thy	1
wonders	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
they	1
remembered	1
not	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
mercies;	1
but	1
provoked	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
sea,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
106:8	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
saved	1
them	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
his	1
mighty	1
power	1
to	1
be	1
known.	1
	1
106:9	1
He	1
rebuked	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
also,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
dried	1
up:	1
so	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
depths,	1
as	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
106:10	1
And	1
he	1
saved	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hated	1
them,	1
and	1
redeemed	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
106:11	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
covered	1
their	1
enemies:	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
left.	1
	1
106:12	1
Then	1
believed	1
they	1
his	1
words;	1
they	1
sang	1
his	1
praise.	1
	1
106:13	1
They	1
soon	1
forgat	1
his	1
works;	1
they	1
waited	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
counsel:	1
	1
106:14	1
But	1
lusted	1
exceedingly	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
tempted	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
desert.	1
	1
106:15	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
their	1
request;	1
but	1
sent	1
leanness	1
into	1
their	1
soul.	1
	1
106:16	1
They	1
envied	1
Moses	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
Aaron	1
the	1
saint	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
106:17	1
The	1
earth	1
opened	1
and	1
swallowed	1
up	1
Dathan	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
Abiram.	1
	1
106:18	1
And	1
a	1
fire	1
was	1
kindled	1
in	1
their	1
company;	1
the	1
flame	1
burned	1
up	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
106:19	1
They	1
made	1
a	1
calf	1
in	1
Horeb,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
molten	1
image.	1
	1
106:20	1
Thus	1
they	1
changed	1
their	1
glory	1
into	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
an	1
ox	1
that	1
eateth	1
grass.	1
	1
106:21	1
They	1
forgat	1
God	1
their	1
saviour,	1
which	1
had	1
done	1
great	1
things	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
	1
106:22	1
Wondrous	1
works	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ham,	1
and	1
terrible	1
things	1
by	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
106:23	1
Therefore	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
destroy	1
them,	1
had	1
not	1
Moses	1
his	1
chosen	1
stood	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
breach,	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
his	1
wrath,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
106:24	1
Yea,	1
they	1
despised	1
the	1
pleasant	1
land,	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
his	1
word:	1
	1
106:25	1
But	1
murmured	1
in	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
106:26	1
Therefore	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
them,	1
to	1
overthrow	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
	1
106:27	1
To	1
overthrow	1
their	1
seed	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
to	1
scatter	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
lands.	1
	1
106:28	1
They	1
joined	1
themselves	1
also	1
unto	1
Baalpeor,	1
and	1
ate	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
106:29	1
Thus	1
they	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
their	1
inventions:	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
brake	1
in	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
106:30	1
Then	1
stood	1
up	1
Phinehas,	1
and	1
executed	1
judgment:	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
stayed.	1
	1
106:31	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
counted	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
all	1
generations	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
106:32	1
They	1
angered	1
him	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
strife,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
went	1
ill	1
with	1
Moses	1
for	1
their	1
sakes:	1
	1
106:33	1
Because	1
they	1
provoked	1
his	1
spirit,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
unadvisedly	1
with	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
106:34	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
nations,	1
concerning	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
them:	1
	1
106:35	1
But	1
were	1
mingled	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
learned	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
106:36	1
And	1
they	1
served	1
their	1
idols:	1
which	1
were	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
106:37	1
Yea,	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
unto	1
devils,	1
	1
106:38	1
And	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood,	1
even	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
daughters,	1
whom	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
Canaan:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
polluted	1
with	1
blood.	1
	1
106:39	1
Thus	1
were	1
they	1
defiled	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
works,	1
and	1
went	1
a	1
whoring	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
inventions.	1
	1
106:40	1
Therefore	1
was	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
kindled	1
against	1
his	1
people,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
abhorred	1
his	1
own	1
inheritance.	1
	1
106:41	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
heathen;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hated	1
them	1
ruled	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
106:42	1
Their	1
enemies	1
also	1
oppressed	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
into	1
subjection	1
under	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
106:43	1
Many	1
times	1
did	1
he	1
deliver	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
provoked	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
counsel,	1
and	1
were	1
brought	1
low	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
106:44	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
regarded	1
their	1
affliction,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
their	1
cry:	1
	1
106:45	1
And	1
he	1
remembered	1
for	1
them	1
his	1
covenant,	1
and	1
repented	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
mercies.	1
	1
106:46	1
He	1
made	1
them	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
carried	1
them	1
captives.	1
	1
106:47	1
Save	1
us,	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
gather	1
us	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
thy	1
holy	1
name,	1
and	1
to	1
triumph	1
in	1
thy	1
praise.	1
	1
106:48	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
everlasting	1
to	1
everlasting:	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
say,	1
Amen.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
107:1	1
O	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
good:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
107:2	1
Let	1
the	1
redeemed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
say	1
so,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
enemy;	1
	1
107:3	1
And	1
gathered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
lands,	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
107:4	1
They	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
in	1
a	1
solitary	1
way;	1
they	1
found	1
no	1
city	1
to	1
dwell	1
in.	1
	1
107:5	1
Hungry	1
and	1
thirsty,	1
their	1
soul	1
fainted	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
107:6	1
Then	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
their	1
trouble,	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
distresses.	1
	1
107:7	1
And	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
way,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
habitation.	1
	1
107:8	1
Oh	1
that	1
men	1
would	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
wonderful	1
works	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men!	1
	1
107:9	1
For	1
he	1
satisfieth	1
the	1
longing	1
soul,	1
and	1
filleth	1
the	1
hungry	1
soul	1
with	1
goodness.	1
	1
107:10	1
Such	1
as	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
being	1
bound	1
in	1
affliction	1
and	1
iron;	1
	1
107:11	1
Because	1
they	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
contemned	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High:	1
	1
107:12	1
Therefore	1
he	1
brought	1
down	1
their	1
heart	1
with	1
labour;	1
they	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
help.	1
	1
107:13	1
Then	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
their	1
trouble,	1
and	1
he	1
saved	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
distresses.	1
	1
107:14	1
He	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
brake	1
their	1
bands	1
in	1
sunder.	1
	1
107:15	1
Oh	1
that	1
men	1
would	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
wonderful	1
works	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men!	1
	1
107:16	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
cut	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
iron	1
in	1
sunder.	1
	1
107:17	1
Fools	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
transgression,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities,	1
are	1
afflicted.	1
	1
107:18	1
Their	1
soul	1
abhorreth	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
meat;	1
and	1
they	1
draw	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
107:19	1
Then	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
their	1
trouble,	1
and	1
he	1
saveth	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
distresses.	1
	1
107:20	1
He	1
sent	1
his	1
word,	1
and	1
healed	1
them,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
destructions.	1
	1
107:21	1
Oh	1
that	1
men	1
would	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
wonderful	1
works	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men!	1
	1
107:22	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
declare	1
his	1
works	1
with	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
107:23	1
They	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
ships,	1
that	1
do	1
business	1
in	1
great	1
waters;	1
	1
107:24	1
These	1
see	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
deep.	1
	1
107:25	1
For	1
he	1
commandeth,	1
and	1
raiseth	1
the	1
stormy	1
wind,	1
which	1
lifteth	1
up	1
the	1
waves	1
thereof.	1
	1
107:26	1
They	1
mount	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
heaven,	1
they	1
go	1
down	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
depths:	1
their	1
soul	1
is	1
melted	1
because	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
107:27	1
They	1
reel	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
stagger	1
like	1
a	1
drunken	1
man,	1
and	1
are	1
at	1
their	1
wit's	1
end.	1
	1
107:28	1
Then	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
their	1
trouble,	1
and	1
he	1
bringeth	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
distresses.	1
	1
107:29	1
He	1
maketh	1
the	1
storm	1
a	1
calm,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
waves	1
thereof	1
are	1
still.	1
	1
107:30	1
Then	1
are	1
they	1
glad	1
because	1
they	1
be	1
quiet;	1
so	1
he	1
bringeth	1
them	1
unto	1
their	1
desired	1
haven.	1
	1
107:31	1
Oh	1
that	1
men	1
would	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
wonderful	1
works	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men!	1
	1
107:32	1
Let	1
them	1
exalt	1
him	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
praise	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
107:33	1
He	1
turneth	1
rivers	1
into	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
the	1
watersprings	1
into	1
dry	1
ground;	1
	1
107:34	1
A	1
fruitful	1
land	1
into	1
barrenness,	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
107:35	1
He	1
turneth	1
the	1
wilderness	1
into	1
a	1
standing	1
water,	1
and	1
dry	1
ground	1
into	1
watersprings.	1
	1
107:36	1
And	1
there	1
he	1
maketh	1
the	1
hungry	1
to	1
dwell,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
prepare	1
a	1
city	1
for	1
habitation;	1
	1
107:37	1
And	1
sow	1
the	1
fields,	1
and	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
which	1
may	1
yield	1
fruits	1
of	1
increase.	1
	1
107:38	1
He	1
blesseth	1
them	1
also,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
multiplied	1
greatly;	1
and	1
suffereth	1
not	1
their	1
cattle	1
to	1
decrease.	1
	1
107:39	1
Again,	1
they	1
are	1
minished	1
and	1
brought	1
low	1
through	1
oppression,	1
affliction,	1
and	1
sorrow.	1
	1
107:40	1
He	1
poureth	1
contempt	1
upon	1
princes,	1
and	1
causeth	1
them	1
to	1
wander	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
way.	1
	1
107:41	1
Yet	1
setteth	1
he	1
the	1
poor	1
on	1
high	1
from	1
affliction,	1
and	1
maketh	1
him	1
families	1
like	1
a	1
flock.	1
	1
107:42	1
The	1
righteous	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
rejoice:	1
and	1
all	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
stop	1
her	1
mouth.	1
	1
107:43	1
Whoso	1
is	1
wise,	1
and	1
will	1
observe	1
these	1
things,	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
understand	1
the	1
lovingkindness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
108:1	1
O	1
god,	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
fixed;	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
and	1
give	1
praise,	1
even	1
with	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
108:2	1
Awake,	1
psaltery	1
and	1
harp:	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
awake	1
early.	1
	1
108:3	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
108:4	1
For	1
thy	1
mercy	1
is	1
great	1
above	1
the	1
heavens:	1
and	1
thy	1
truth	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
the	1
clouds.	1
	1
108:5	1
Be	1
thou	1
exalted,	1
O	1
God,	1
above	1
the	1
heavens:	1
and	1
thy	1
glory	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
	1
108:6	1
That	1
thy	1
beloved	1
may	1
be	1
delivered:	1
save	1
with	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
answer	1
me.	1
	1
108:7	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
in	1
his	1
holiness;	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice,	1
I	1
will	1
divide	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
mete	1
out	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Succoth.	1
	1
108:8	1
Gilead	1
is	1
mine;	1
Manasseh	1
is	1
mine;	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
mine	1
head;	1
Judah	1
is	1
my	1
lawgiver;	1
	1
108:9	1
Moab	1
is	1
my	1
washpot;	1
over	1
Edom	1
will	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
my	1
shoe;	1
over	1
Philistia	1
will	1
I	1
triumph.	1
	1
108:10	1
Who	1
will	1
bring	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
strong	1
city?	1
who	1
will	1
lead	1
me	1
into	1
Edom?	1
	1
108:11	1
Wilt	1
not	1
thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
who	1
hast	1
cast	1
us	1
off?	1
and	1
wilt	1
not	1
thou,	1
O	1
God,	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
our	1
hosts?	1
	1
108:12	1
Give	1
us	1
help	1
from	1
trouble:	1
for	1
vain	1
is	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
108:13	1
Through	1
God	1
we	1
shall	1
do	1
valiantly:	1
for	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
shall	1
tread	1
down	1
our	1
enemies.	1
	1
	1
	1
109:1	1
Hold	1
not	1
thy	1
peace,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
praise;	1
	1
109:2	1
For	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
deceitful	1
are	1
opened	1
against	1
me:	1
they	1
have	1
spoken	1
against	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
lying	1
tongue.	1
	1
109:3	1
They	1
compassed	1
me	1
about	1
also	1
with	1
words	1
of	1
hatred;	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause.	1
	1
109:4	1
For	1
my	1
love	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
adversaries:	1
but	1
I	1
give	1
myself	1
unto	1
prayer.	1
	1
109:5	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
rewarded	1
me	1
evil	1
for	1
good,	1
and	1
hatred	1
for	1
my	1
love.	1
	1
109:6	1
Set	1
thou	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
over	1
him:	1
and	1
let	1
Satan	1
stand	1
at	1
his	1
right	1
hand.	1
	1
109:7	1
When	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
judged,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
condemned:	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
prayer	1
become	1
sin.	1
	1
109:8	1
Let	1
his	1
days	1
be	1
few;	1
and	1
let	1
another	1
take	1
his	1
office.	1
	1
109:9	1
Let	1
his	1
children	1
be	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
a	1
widow.	1
	1
109:10	1
Let	1
his	1
children	1
be	1
continually	1
vagabonds,	1
and	1
beg:	1
let	1
them	1
seek	1
their	1
bread	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
desolate	1
places.	1
	1
109:11	1
Let	1
the	1
extortioner	1
catch	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
strangers	1
spoil	1
his	1
labour.	1
	1
109:12	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
extend	1
mercy	1
unto	1
him:	1
neither	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
to	1
favour	1
his	1
fatherless	1
children.	1
	1
109:13	1
Let	1
his	1
posterity	1
be	1
cut	1
off;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
generation	1
following	1
let	1
their	1
name	1
be	1
blotted	1
out.	1
	1
109:14	1
Let	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
his	1
fathers	1
be	1
remembered	1
with	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
be	1
blotted	1
out.	1
	1
109:15	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
continually,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
109:16	1
Because	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
not	1
to	1
shew	1
mercy,	1
but	1
persecuted	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
even	1
slay	1
the	1
broken	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
109:17	1
As	1
he	1
loved	1
cursing,	1
so	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
unto	1
him:	1
as	1
he	1
delighted	1
not	1
in	1
blessing,	1
so	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
109:18	1
As	1
he	1
clothed	1
himself	1
with	1
cursing	1
like	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
garment,	1
so	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
bowels	1
like	1
water,	1
and	1
like	1
oil	1
into	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
109:19	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
garment	1
which	1
covereth	1
him,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
girdle	1
wherewith	1
he	1
is	1
girded	1
continually.	1
	1
109:20	1
Let	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
mine	1
adversaries	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
speak	1
evil	1
against	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
109:21	1
But	1
do	1
thou	1
for	1
me,	1
O	1
GOD	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake:	1
because	1
thy	1
mercy	1
is	1
good,	1
deliver	1
thou	1
me.	1
	1
109:22	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
poor	1
and	1
needy,	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
wounded	1
within	1
me.	1
	1
109:23	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
like	1
the	1
shadow	1
when	1
it	1
declineth:	1
I	1
am	1
tossed	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
locust.	1
	1
109:24	1
My	1
knees	1
are	1
weak	1
through	1
fasting;	1
and	1
my	1
flesh	1
faileth	1
of	1
fatness.	1
	1
109:25	1
I	1
became	1
also	1
a	1
reproach	1
unto	1
them:	1
when	1
they	1
looked	1
upon	1
me	1
they	1
shaked	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
109:26	1
Help	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God:	1
O	1
save	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
mercy:	1
	1
109:27	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
thy	1
hand;	1
that	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
hast	1
done	1
it.	1
	1
109:28	1
Let	1
them	1
curse,	1
but	1
bless	1
thou:	1
when	1
they	1
arise,	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
let	1
thy	1
servant	1
rejoice.	1
	1
109:29	1
Let	1
mine	1
adversaries	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
shame,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
cover	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
confusion,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
mantle.	1
	1
109:30	1
I	1
will	1
greatly	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
my	1
mouth;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
109:31	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
those	1
that	1
condemn	1
his	1
soul.	1
	1
	1
	1
110:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
at	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
until	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
110:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
send	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
thy	1
strength	1
out	1
of	1
Zion:	1
rule	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
	1
110:3	1
Thy	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
willing	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
power,	1
in	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
holiness	1
from	1
the	1
womb	1
of	1
the	1
morning:	1
thou	1
hast	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
thy	1
youth.	1
	1
110:4	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
repent,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchizedek.	1
	1
110:5	1
The	1
Lord	1
at	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
shall	1
strike	1
through	1
kings	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
110:6	1
He	1
shall	1
judge	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
he	1
shall	1
fill	1
the	1
places	1
with	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies;	1
he	1
shall	1
wound	1
the	1
heads	1
over	1
many	1
countries.	1
	1
110:7	1
He	1
shall	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
brook	1
in	1
the	1
way:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
he	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
head.	1
	1
	1
	1
111:1	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart,	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
upright,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
111:2	1
The	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
great,	1
sought	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
pleasure	1
therein.	1
	1
111:3	1
His	1
work	1
is	1
honourable	1
and	1
glorious:	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
111:4	1
He	1
hath	1
made	1
his	1
wonderful	1
works	1
to	1
be	1
remembered:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
gracious	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
compassion.	1
	1
111:5	1
He	1
hath	1
given	1
meat	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him:	1
he	1
will	1
ever	1
be	1
mindful	1
of	1
his	1
covenant.	1
	1
111:6	1
He	1
hath	1
shewed	1
his	1
people	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
works,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
heritage	1
of	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
111:7	1
The	1
works	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
are	1
verity	1
and	1
judgment;	1
all	1
his	1
commandments	1
are	1
sure.	1
	1
111:8	1
They	1
stand	1
fast	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
and	1
are	1
done	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
uprightness.	1
	1
111:9	1
He	1
sent	1
redemption	1
unto	1
his	1
people:	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
his	1
covenant	1
for	1
ever:	1
holy	1
and	1
reverend	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
111:10	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
wisdom:	1
a	1
good	1
understanding	1
have	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
do	1
his	1
commandments:	1
his	1
praise	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
112:1	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
feareth	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
delighteth	1
greatly	1
in	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
112:2	1
His	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
mighty	1
upon	1
earth:	1
the	1
generation	1
of	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
112:3	1
Wealth	1
and	1
riches	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
house:	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
112:4	1
Unto	1
the	1
upright	1
there	1
ariseth	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
darkness:	1
he	1
is	1
gracious,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
compassion,	1
and	1
righteous.	1
	1
112:5	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
sheweth	1
favour,	1
and	1
lendeth:	1
he	1
will	1
guide	1
his	1
affairs	1
with	1
discretion.	1
	1
112:6	1
Surely	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved	1
for	1
ever:	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
everlasting	1
remembrance.	1
	1
112:7	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
evil	1
tidings:	1
his	1
heart	1
is	1
fixed,	1
trusting	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
112:8	1
His	1
heart	1
is	1
established,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
afraid,	1
until	1
he	1
see	1
his	1
desire	1
upon	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
112:9	1
He	1
hath	1
dispersed,	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
his	1
righteousness	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever;	1
his	1
horn	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
with	1
honour.	1
	1
112:10	1
The	1
wicked	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
grieved;	1
he	1
shall	1
gnash	1
with	1
his	1
teeth,	1
and	1
melt	1
away:	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
	1
	1
113:1	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Praise,	1
O	1
ye	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
praise	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
113:2	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
and	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
113:3	1
From	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
unto	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
LORD's	1
name	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
praised.	1
	1
113:4	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
high	1
above	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
his	1
glory	1
above	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
113:5	1
Who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
who	1
dwelleth	1
on	1
high,	1
	1
113:6	1
Who	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earth!	1
	1
113:7	1
He	1
raiseth	1
up	1
the	1
poor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
lifteth	1
the	1
needy	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dunghill;	1
	1
113:8	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
set	1
him	1
with	1
princes,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
113:9	1
He	1
maketh	1
the	1
barren	1
woman	1
to	1
keep	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
joyful	1
mother	1
of	1
children.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
114:1	1
When	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
from	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
strange	1
language;	1
	1
114:2	1
Judah	1
was	1
his	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
Israel	1
his	1
dominion.	1
	1
114:3	1
The	1
sea	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
fled:	1
Jordan	1
was	1
driven	1
back.	1
	1
114:4	1
The	1
mountains	1
skipped	1
like	1
rams,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
hills	1
like	1
lambs.	1
	1
114:5	1
What	1
ailed	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
sea,	1
that	1
thou	1
fleddest?	1
thou	1
Jordan,	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
driven	1
back?	1
	1
114:6	1
Ye	1
mountains,	1
that	1
ye	1
skipped	1
like	1
rams;	1
and	1
ye	1
little	1
hills,	1
like	1
lambs?	1
	1
114:7	1
Tremble,	1
thou	1
earth,	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
	1
114:8	1
Which	1
turned	1
the	1
rock	1
into	1
a	1
standing	1
water,	1
the	1
flint	1
into	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
waters.	1
	1
	1
	1
115:1	1
Not	1
unto	1
us,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
not	1
unto	1
us,	1
but	1
unto	1
thy	1
name	1
give	1
glory,	1
for	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
truth's	1
sake.	1
	1
115:2	1
Wherefore	1
should	1
the	1
heathen	1
say,	1
Where	1
is	1
now	1
their	1
God?	1
	1
115:3	1
But	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
heavens:	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
hath	1
pleased.	1
	1
115:4	1
Their	1
idols	1
are	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
men's	1
hands.	1
	1
115:5	1
They	1
have	1
mouths,	1
but	1
they	1
speak	1
not:	1
eyes	1
have	1
they,	1
but	1
they	1
see	1
not:	1
	1
115:6	1
They	1
have	1
ears,	1
but	1
they	1
hear	1
not:	1
noses	1
have	1
they,	1
but	1
they	1
smell	1
not:	1
	1
115:7	1
They	1
have	1
hands,	1
but	1
they	1
handle	1
not:	1
feet	1
have	1
they,	1
but	1
they	1
walk	1
not:	1
neither	1
speak	1
they	1
through	1
their	1
throat.	1
	1
115:8	1
They	1
that	1
make	1
them	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
them;	1
so	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
115:9	1
O	1
Israel,	1
trust	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
is	1
their	1
help	1
and	1
their	1
shield.	1
	1
115:10	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
is	1
their	1
help	1
and	1
their	1
shield.	1
	1
115:11	1
Ye	1
that	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
is	1
their	1
help	1
and	1
their	1
shield.	1
	1
115:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
us:	1
he	1
will	1
bless	1
us;	1
he	1
will	1
bless	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
he	1
will	1
bless	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Aaron.	1
	1
115:13	1
He	1
will	1
bless	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
115:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
increase	1
you	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
children.	1
	1
115:15	1
Ye	1
are	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth.	1
	1
115:16	1
The	1
heaven,	1
even	1
the	1
heavens,	1
are	1
the	1
LORD's:	1
but	1
the	1
earth	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
115:17	1
The	1
dead	1
praise	1
not	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
any	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
silence.	1
	1
115:18	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
and	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
116:1	1
I	1
love	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
heard	1
my	1
voice	1
and	1
my	1
supplications.	1
	1
116:2	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
inclined	1
his	1
ear	1
unto	1
me,	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live.	1
	1
116:3	1
The	1
sorrows	1
of	1
death	1
compassed	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
hell	1
gat	1
hold	1
upon	1
me:	1
I	1
found	1
trouble	1
and	1
sorrow.	1
	1
116:4	1
Then	1
called	1
I	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
deliver	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
116:5	1
Gracious	1
is	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
righteous;	1
yea,	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
merciful.	1
	1
116:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
preserveth	1
the	1
simple:	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
low,	1
and	1
he	1
helped	1
me.	1
	1
116:7	1
Return	1
unto	1
thy	1
rest,	1
O	1
my	1
soul;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
dealt	1
bountifully	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
116:8	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
death,	1
mine	1
eyes	1
from	1
tears,	1
and	1
my	1
feet	1
from	1
falling.	1
	1
116:9	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
116:10	1
I	1
believed,	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
spoken:	1
I	1
was	1
greatly	1
afflicted:	1
	1
116:11	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
my	1
haste,	1
All	1
men	1
are	1
liars.	1
	1
116:12	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
render	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
benefits	1
toward	1
me?	1
	1
116:13	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
116:14	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
my	1
vows	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
116:15	1
Precious	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
saints.	1
	1
116:16	1
O	1
LORD,	1
truly	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
servant;	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid:	1
thou	1
hast	1
loosed	1
my	1
bonds.	1
	1
116:17	1
I	1
will	1
offer	1
to	1
thee	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
will	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
116:18	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
my	1
vows	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
116:19	1
In	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
Jerusalem.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
117:1	1
O	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
nations:	1
praise	1
him,	1
all	1
ye	1
people.	1
	1
117:2	1
For	1
his	1
merciful	1
kindness	1
is	1
great	1
toward	1
us:	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
118:1	1
O	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
good:	1
because	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
118:2	1
Let	1
Israel	1
now	1
say,	1
that	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
118:3	1
Let	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Aaron	1
now	1
say,	1
that	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
118:4	1
Let	1
them	1
now	1
that	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
say,	1
that	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
118:5	1
I	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
distress:	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
me,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
place.	1
	1
118:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
side;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
fear:	1
what	1
can	1
man	1
do	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
118:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
taketh	1
my	1
part	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
help	1
me:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
I	1
see	1
my	1
desire	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me.	1
	1
118:8	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
than	1
to	1
put	1
confidence	1
in	1
man.	1
	1
118:9	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
than	1
to	1
put	1
confidence	1
in	1
princes.	1
	1
118:10	1
All	1
nations	1
compassed	1
me	1
about:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
118:11	1
They	1
compassed	1
me	1
about;	1
yea,	1
they	1
compassed	1
me	1
about:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
118:12	1
They	1
compassed	1
me	1
about	1
like	1
bees:	1
they	1
are	1
quenched	1
as	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
thorns:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
118:13	1
Thou	1
hast	1
thrust	1
sore	1
at	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
fall:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
helped	1
me.	1
	1
118:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
song,	1
and	1
is	1
become	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
118:15	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
rejoicing	1
and	1
salvation	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
the	1
righteous:	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
doeth	1
valiantly.	1
	1
118:16	1
The	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
exalted:	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
doeth	1
valiantly.	1
	1
118:17	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
die,	1
but	1
live,	1
and	1
declare	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
118:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chastened	1
me	1
sore:	1
but	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
given	1
me	1
over	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
118:19	1
Open	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
righteousness:	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD:	1
	1
118:20	1
This	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
enter.	1
	1
118:21	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
me,	1
and	1
art	1
become	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
118:22	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
refused	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
stone	1
of	1
the	1
corner.	1
	1
118:23	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
doing;	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes.	1
	1
118:24	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made;	1
we	1
will	1
rejoice	1
and	1
be	1
glad	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
118:25	1
Save	1
now,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
send	1
now	1
prosperity.	1
	1
118:26	1
Blessed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
we	1
have	1
blessed	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
118:27	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
hath	1
shewed	1
us	1
light:	1
bind	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
cords,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
118:28	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee:	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
exalt	1
thee.	1
	1
118:29	1
O	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
good:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
119:1	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
undefiled	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
who	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
119:2	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
keep	1
his	1
testimonies,	1
and	1
that	1
seek	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
heart.	1
	1
119:3	1
They	1
also	1
do	1
no	1
iniquity:	1
they	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
119:4	1
Thou	1
hast	1
commanded	1
us	1
to	1
keep	1
thy	1
precepts	1
diligently.	1
	1
119:5	1
O	1
that	1
my	1
ways	1
were	1
directed	1
to	1
keep	1
thy	1
statutes!	1
	1
119:6	1
Then	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
respect	1
unto	1
all	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
119:7	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee	1
with	1
uprightness	1
of	1
heart,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
learned	1
thy	1
righteous	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:8	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
thy	1
statutes:	1
O	1
forsake	1
me	1
not	1
utterly.	1
	1
119:9	1
Wherewithal	1
shall	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
cleanse	1
his	1
way?	1
by	1
taking	1
heed	1
thereto	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:10	1
With	1
my	1
whole	1
heart	1
have	1
I	1
sought	1
thee:	1
O	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
wander	1
from	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
119:11	1
Thy	1
word	1
have	1
I	1
hid	1
in	1
mine	1
heart,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
sin	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
119:12	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
teach	1
me	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:13	1
With	1
my	1
lips	1
have	1
I	1
declared	1
all	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
119:14	1
I	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
testimonies,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
riches.	1
	1
119:15	1
I	1
will	1
meditate	1
in	1
thy	1
precepts,	1
and	1
have	1
respect	1
unto	1
thy	1
ways.	1
	1
119:16	1
I	1
will	1
delight	1
myself	1
in	1
thy	1
statutes:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
forget	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:17	1
Deal	1
bountifully	1
with	1
thy	1
servant,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
keep	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:18	1
Open	1
thou	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
behold	1
wondrous	1
things	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:19	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
hide	1
not	1
thy	1
commandments	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
119:20	1
My	1
soul	1
breaketh	1
for	1
the	1
longing	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
unto	1
thy	1
judgments	1
at	1
all	1
times.	1
	1
119:21	1
Thou	1
hast	1
rebuked	1
the	1
proud	1
that	1
are	1
cursed,	1
which	1
do	1
err	1
from	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
119:22	1
Remove	1
from	1
me	1
reproach	1
and	1
contempt;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
thy	1
testimonies.	1
	1
119:23	1
Princes	1
also	1
did	1
sit	1
and	1
speak	1
against	1
me:	1
but	1
thy	1
servant	1
did	1
meditate	1
in	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:24	1
Thy	1
testimonies	1
also	1
are	1
my	1
delight	1
and	1
my	1
counsellors.	1
	1
119:25	1
My	1
soul	1
cleaveth	1
unto	1
the	1
dust:	1
quicken	1
thou	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:26	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
my	1
ways,	1
and	1
thou	1
heardest	1
me:	1
teach	1
me	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:27	1
Make	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
precepts:	1
so	1
shall	1
I	1
talk	1
of	1
thy	1
wondrous	1
works.	1
	1
119:28	1
My	1
soul	1
melteth	1
for	1
heaviness:	1
strengthen	1
thou	1
me	1
according	1
unto	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:29	1
Remove	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
lying:	1
and	1
grant	1
me	1
thy	1
law	1
graciously.	1
	1
119:30	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
truth:	1
thy	1
judgments	1
have	1
I	1
laid	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
119:31	1
I	1
have	1
stuck	1
unto	1
thy	1
testimonies:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
put	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
shame.	1
	1
119:32	1
I	1
will	1
run	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
enlarge	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
119:33	1
Teach	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
statutes;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
119:34	1
Give	1
me	1
understanding,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
thy	1
law;	1
yea,	1
I	1
shall	1
observe	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart.	1
	1
119:35	1
Make	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
thy	1
commandments;	1
for	1
therein	1
do	1
I	1
delight.	1
	1
119:36	1
Incline	1
my	1
heart	1
unto	1
thy	1
testimonies,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
covetousness.	1
	1
119:37	1
Turn	1
away	1
mine	1
eyes	1
from	1
beholding	1
vanity;	1
and	1
quicken	1
thou	1
me	1
in	1
thy	1
way.	1
	1
119:38	1
Stablish	1
thy	1
word	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant,	1
who	1
is	1
devoted	1
to	1
thy	1
fear.	1
	1
119:39	1
Turn	1
away	1
my	1
reproach	1
which	1
I	1
fear:	1
for	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
good.	1
	1
119:40	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
longed	1
after	1
thy	1
precepts:	1
quicken	1
me	1
in	1
thy	1
righteousness.	1
	1
119:41	1
Let	1
thy	1
mercies	1
come	1
also	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
even	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:42	1
So	1
shall	1
I	1
have	1
wherewith	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
that	1
reproacheth	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:43	1
And	1
take	1
not	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth	1
utterly	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
hoped	1
in	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:44	1
So	1
shall	1
I	1
keep	1
thy	1
law	1
continually	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
119:45	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
at	1
liberty:	1
for	1
I	1
seek	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:46	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
of	1
thy	1
testimonies	1
also	1
before	1
kings,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
119:47	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
delight	1
myself	1
in	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
loved.	1
	1
119:48	1
My	1
hands	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
lift	1
up	1
unto	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
loved;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
meditate	1
in	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:49	1
Remember	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant,	1
upon	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
hope.	1
	1
119:50	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
comfort	1
in	1
my	1
affliction:	1
for	1
thy	1
word	1
hath	1
quickened	1
me.	1
	1
119:51	1
The	1
proud	1
have	1
had	1
me	1
greatly	1
in	1
derision:	1
yet	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
declined	1
from	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:52	1
I	1
remembered	1
thy	1
judgments	1
of	1
old,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
and	1
have	1
comforted	1
myself.	1
	1
119:53	1
Horror	1
hath	1
taken	1
hold	1
upon	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
that	1
forsake	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:54	1
Thy	1
statutes	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
songs	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
pilgrimage.	1
	1
119:55	1
I	1
have	1
remembered	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
have	1
kept	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:56	1
This	1
I	1
had,	1
because	1
I	1
kept	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:57	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
portion,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
keep	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
119:58	1
I	1
intreated	1
thy	1
favour	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart:	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:59	1
I	1
thought	1
on	1
my	1
ways,	1
and	1
turned	1
my	1
feet	1
unto	1
thy	1
testimonies.	1
	1
119:60	1
I	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
delayed	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
119:61	1
The	1
bands	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
have	1
robbed	1
me:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
forgotten	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:62	1
At	1
midnight	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
thee	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
righteous	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:63	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
companion	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
thee,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
keep	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:64	1
The	1
earth,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
thy	1
mercy:	1
teach	1
me	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:65	1
Thou	1
hast	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
thy	1
servant,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
according	1
unto	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:66	1
Teach	1
me	1
good	1
judgment	1
and	1
knowledge:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
believed	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
119:67	1
Before	1
I	1
was	1
afflicted	1
I	1
went	1
astray:	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:68	1
Thou	1
art	1
good,	1
and	1
doest	1
good;	1
teach	1
me	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:69	1
The	1
proud	1
have	1
forged	1
a	1
lie	1
against	1
me:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
thy	1
precepts	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart.	1
	1
119:70	1
Their	1
heart	1
is	1
as	1
fat	1
as	1
grease;	1
but	1
I	1
delight	1
in	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:71	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
afflicted;	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
learn	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:72	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth	1
is	1
better	1
unto	1
me	1
than	1
thousands	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver.	1
	1
119:73	1
Thy	1
hands	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
and	1
fashioned	1
me:	1
give	1
me	1
understanding,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
learn	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
119:74	1
They	1
that	1
fear	1
thee	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
me;	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
hoped	1
in	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:75	1
I	1
know,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
right,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
in	1
faithfulness	1
hast	1
afflicted	1
me.	1
	1
119:76	1
Let,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
merciful	1
kindness	1
be	1
for	1
my	1
comfort,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
119:77	1
Let	1
thy	1
tender	1
mercies	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
live:	1
for	1
thy	1
law	1
is	1
my	1
delight.	1
	1
119:78	1
Let	1
the	1
proud	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
for	1
they	1
dealt	1
perversely	1
with	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
meditate	1
in	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:79	1
Let	1
those	1
that	1
fear	1
thee	1
turn	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
known	1
thy	1
testimonies.	1
	1
119:80	1
Let	1
my	1
heart	1
be	1
sound	1
in	1
thy	1
statutes;	1
that	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
ashamed.	1
	1
119:81	1
My	1
soul	1
fainteth	1
for	1
thy	1
salvation:	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
in	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:82	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
fail	1
for	1
thy	1
word,	1
saying,	1
When	1
wilt	1
thou	1
comfort	1
me?	1
	1
119:83	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
like	1
a	1
bottle	1
in	1
the	1
smoke;	1
yet	1
do	1
I	1
not	1
forget	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:84	1
How	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
servant?	1
when	1
wilt	1
thou	1
execute	1
judgment	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
persecute	1
me?	1
	1
119:85	1
The	1
proud	1
have	1
digged	1
pits	1
for	1
me,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
after	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:86	1
All	1
thy	1
commandments	1
are	1
faithful:	1
they	1
persecute	1
me	1
wrongfully;	1
help	1
thou	1
me.	1
	1
119:87	1
They	1
had	1
almost	1
consumed	1
me	1
upon	1
earth;	1
but	1
I	1
forsook	1
not	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:88	1
Quicken	1
me	1
after	1
thy	1
lovingkindness;	1
so	1
shall	1
I	1
keep	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
119:89	1
For	1
ever,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thy	1
word	1
is	1
settled	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
119:90	1
Thy	1
faithfulness	1
is	1
unto	1
all	1
generations:	1
thou	1
hast	1
established	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
abideth.	1
	1
119:91	1
They	1
continue	1
this	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
ordinances:	1
for	1
all	1
are	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
119:92	1
Unless	1
thy	1
law	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
delights,	1
I	1
should	1
then	1
have	1
perished	1
in	1
mine	1
affliction.	1
	1
119:93	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
forget	1
thy	1
precepts:	1
for	1
with	1
them	1
thou	1
hast	1
quickened	1
me.	1
	1
119:94	1
I	1
am	1
thine,	1
save	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
sought	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:95	1
The	1
wicked	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
destroy	1
me:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
consider	1
thy	1
testimonies.	1
	1
119:96	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
perfection:	1
but	1
thy	1
commandment	1
is	1
exceeding	1
broad.	1
	1
119:97	1
O	1
how	1
I	1
love	1
thy	1
law!	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
meditation	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
119:98	1
Thou	1
through	1
thy	1
commandments	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
wiser	1
than	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
ever	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
119:99	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
understanding	1
than	1
all	1
my	1
teachers:	1
for	1
thy	1
testimonies	1
are	1
my	1
meditation.	1
	1
119:100	1
I	1
understand	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
ancients,	1
because	1
I	1
keep	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:101	1
I	1
have	1
refrained	1
my	1
feet	1
from	1
every	1
evil	1
way,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
keep	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:102	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
departed	1
from	1
thy	1
judgments:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
me.	1
	1
119:103	1
How	1
sweet	1
are	1
thy	1
words	1
unto	1
my	1
taste!	1
yea,	1
sweeter	1
than	1
honey	1
to	1
my	1
mouth!	1
	1
119:104	1
Through	1
thy	1
precepts	1
I	1
get	1
understanding:	1
therefore	1
I	1
hate	1
every	1
false	1
way.	1
	1
119:105	1
Thy	1
word	1
is	1
a	1
lamp	1
unto	1
my	1
feet,	1
and	1
a	1
light	1
unto	1
my	1
path.	1
	1
119:106	1
I	1
have	1
sworn,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
perform	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
thy	1
righteous	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:107	1
I	1
am	1
afflicted	1
very	1
much:	1
quicken	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
according	1
unto	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:108	1
Accept,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
the	1
freewill	1
offerings	1
of	1
my	1
mouth,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
teach	1
me	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:109	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
continually	1
in	1
my	1
hand:	1
yet	1
do	1
I	1
not	1
forget	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:110	1
The	1
wicked	1
have	1
laid	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
me:	1
yet	1
I	1
erred	1
not	1
from	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:111	1
Thy	1
testimonies	1
have	1
I	1
taken	1
as	1
an	1
heritage	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
of	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
119:112	1
I	1
have	1
inclined	1
mine	1
heart	1
to	1
perform	1
thy	1
statutes	1
alway,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
119:113	1
I	1
hate	1
vain	1
thoughts:	1
but	1
thy	1
law	1
do	1
I	1
love.	1
	1
119:114	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
hiding	1
place	1
and	1
my	1
shield:	1
I	1
hope	1
in	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:115	1
Depart	1
from	1
me,	1
ye	1
evildoers:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
119:116	1
Uphold	1
me	1
according	1
unto	1
thy	1
word,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
live:	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
my	1
hope.	1
	1
119:117	1
Hold	1
thou	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
safe:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
respect	1
unto	1
thy	1
statutes	1
continually.	1
	1
119:118	1
Thou	1
hast	1
trodden	1
down	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
err	1
from	1
thy	1
statutes:	1
for	1
their	1
deceit	1
is	1
falsehood.	1
	1
119:119	1
Thou	1
puttest	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
wicked	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
like	1
dross:	1
therefore	1
I	1
love	1
thy	1
testimonies.	1
	1
119:120	1
My	1
flesh	1
trembleth	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:121	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice:	1
leave	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
mine	1
oppressors.	1
	1
119:122	1
Be	1
surety	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
for	1
good:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
proud	1
oppress	1
me.	1
	1
119:123	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
fail	1
for	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
thy	1
righteousness.	1
	1
119:124	1
Deal	1
with	1
thy	1
servant	1
according	1
unto	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
and	1
teach	1
me	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:125	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
servant;	1
give	1
me	1
understanding,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
thy	1
testimonies.	1
	1
119:126	1
It	1
is	1
time	1
for	1
thee,	1
LORD,	1
to	1
work:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
void	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:127	1
Therefore	1
I	1
love	1
thy	1
commandments	1
above	1
gold;	1
yea,	1
above	1
fine	1
gold.	1
	1
119:128	1
Therefore	1
I	1
esteem	1
all	1
thy	1
precepts	1
concerning	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
right;	1
and	1
I	1
hate	1
every	1
false	1
way.	1
	1
119:129	1
Thy	1
testimonies	1
are	1
wonderful:	1
therefore	1
doth	1
my	1
soul	1
keep	1
them.	1
	1
119:130	1
The	1
entrance	1
of	1
thy	1
words	1
giveth	1
light;	1
it	1
giveth	1
understanding	1
unto	1
the	1
simple.	1
	1
119:131	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
panted:	1
for	1
I	1
longed	1
for	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
119:132	1
Look	1
thou	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
usest	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
love	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
119:133	1
Order	1
my	1
steps	1
in	1
thy	1
word:	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
any	1
iniquity	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
119:134	1
Deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
man:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
keep	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:135	1
Make	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
shine	1
upon	1
thy	1
servant;	1
and	1
teach	1
me	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:136	1
Rivers	1
of	1
waters	1
run	1
down	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
because	1
they	1
keep	1
not	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:137	1
Righteous	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
upright	1
are	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:138	1
Thy	1
testimonies	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded	1
are	1
righteous	1
and	1
very	1
faithful.	1
	1
119:139	1
My	1
zeal	1
hath	1
consumed	1
me,	1
because	1
mine	1
enemies	1
have	1
forgotten	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
119:140	1
Thy	1
word	1
is	1
very	1
pure:	1
therefore	1
thy	1
servant	1
loveth	1
it.	1
	1
119:141	1
I	1
am	1
small	1
and	1
despised:	1
yet	1
do	1
not	1
I	1
forget	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:142	1
Thy	1
righteousness	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
thy	1
law	1
is	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
119:143	1
Trouble	1
and	1
anguish	1
have	1
taken	1
hold	1
on	1
me:	1
yet	1
thy	1
commandments	1
are	1
my	1
delights.	1
	1
119:144	1
The	1
righteousness	1
of	1
thy	1
testimonies	1
is	1
everlasting:	1
give	1
me	1
understanding,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
119:145	1
I	1
cried	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart;	1
hear	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:146	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
thee;	1
save	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
thy	1
testimonies.	1
	1
119:147	1
I	1
prevented	1
the	1
dawning	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
cried:	1
I	1
hoped	1
in	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:148	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
prevent	1
the	1
night	1
watches,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
meditate	1
in	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:149	1
Hear	1
my	1
voice	1
according	1
unto	1
thy	1
lovingkindness:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
quicken	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
judgment.	1
	1
119:150	1
They	1
draw	1
nigh	1
that	1
follow	1
after	1
mischief:	1
they	1
are	1
far	1
from	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:151	1
Thou	1
art	1
near,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
commandments	1
are	1
truth.	1
	1
119:152	1
Concerning	1
thy	1
testimonies,	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
of	1
old	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
founded	1
them	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
119:153	1
Consider	1
mine	1
affliction,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
forget	1
thy	1
law.	1
	1
119:154	1
Plead	1
my	1
cause,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me:	1
quicken	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:155	1
Salvation	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
wicked:	1
for	1
they	1
seek	1
not	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:156	1
Great	1
are	1
thy	1
tender	1
mercies,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
quicken	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:157	1
Many	1
are	1
my	1
persecutors	1
and	1
mine	1
enemies;	1
yet	1
do	1
I	1
not	1
decline	1
from	1
thy	1
testimonies.	1
	1
119:158	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
transgressors,	1
and	1
was	1
grieved;	1
because	1
they	1
kept	1
not	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:159	1
Consider	1
how	1
I	1
love	1
thy	1
precepts:	1
quicken	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
lovingkindness.	1
	1
119:160	1
Thy	1
word	1
is	1
true	1
from	1
the	1
beginning:	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
righteous	1
judgments	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
119:161	1
Princes	1
have	1
persecuted	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause:	1
but	1
my	1
heart	1
standeth	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:162	1
I	1
rejoice	1
at	1
thy	1
word,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
findeth	1
great	1
spoil.	1
	1
119:163	1
I	1
hate	1
and	1
abhor	1
lying:	1
but	1
thy	1
law	1
do	1
I	1
love.	1
	1
119:164	1
Seven	1
times	1
a	1
day	1
do	1
I	1
praise	1
thee	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
righteous	1
judgments.	1
	1
119:165	1
Great	1
peace	1
have	1
they	1
which	1
love	1
thy	1
law:	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
offend	1
them.	1
	1
119:166	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
hoped	1
for	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
and	1
done	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
119:167	1
My	1
soul	1
hath	1
kept	1
thy	1
testimonies;	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
them	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
119:168	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
thy	1
precepts	1
and	1
thy	1
testimonies:	1
for	1
all	1
my	1
ways	1
are	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
119:169	1
Let	1
my	1
cry	1
come	1
near	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
give	1
me	1
understanding	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:170	1
Let	1
my	1
supplication	1
come	1
before	1
thee:	1
deliver	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
119:171	1
My	1
lips	1
shall	1
utter	1
praise,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
me	1
thy	1
statutes.	1
	1
119:172	1
My	1
tongue	1
shall	1
speak	1
of	1
thy	1
word:	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
commandments	1
are	1
righteousness.	1
	1
119:173	1
Let	1
thine	1
hand	1
help	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
thy	1
precepts.	1
	1
119:174	1
I	1
have	1
longed	1
for	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
and	1
thy	1
law	1
is	1
my	1
delight.	1
	1
119:175	1
Let	1
my	1
soul	1
live,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
praise	1
thee;	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
judgments	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
119:176	1
I	1
have	1
gone	1
astray	1
like	1
a	1
lost	1
sheep;	1
seek	1
thy	1
servant;	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
forget	1
thy	1
commandments.	1
	1
	1
	1
120:1	1
In	1
my	1
distress	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
me.	1
	1
120:2	1
Deliver	1
my	1
soul,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
from	1
lying	1
lips,	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
deceitful	1
tongue.	1
	1
120:3	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
thee?	1
or	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
thee,	1
thou	1
false	1
tongue?	1
	1
120:4	1
Sharp	1
arrows	1
of	1
the	1
mighty,	1
with	1
coals	1
of	1
juniper.	1
	1
120:5	1
Woe	1
is	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
sojourn	1
in	1
Mesech,	1
that	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Kedar!	1
	1
120:6	1
My	1
soul	1
hath	1
long	1
dwelt	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
hateth	1
peace.	1
	1
120:7	1
I	1
am	1
for	1
peace:	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
speak,	1
they	1
are	1
for	1
war.	1
	1
	1
	1
121:1	1
I	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes	1
unto	1
the	1
hills,	1
from	1
whence	1
cometh	1
my	1
help.	1
	1
121:2	1
My	1
help	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth.	1
	1
121:3	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
thy	1
foot	1
to	1
be	1
moved:	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
thee	1
will	1
not	1
slumber.	1
	1
121:4	1
Behold,	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
Israel	1
shall	1
neither	1
slumber	1
nor	1
sleep.	1
	1
121:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
thy	1
keeper:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
thy	1
shade	1
upon	1
thy	1
right	1
hand.	1
	1
121:6	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
not	1
smite	1
thee	1
by	1
day,	1
nor	1
the	1
moon	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
121:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
preserve	1
thee	1
from	1
all	1
evil:	1
he	1
shall	1
preserve	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
121:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
preserve	1
thy	1
going	1
out	1
and	1
thy	1
coming	1
in	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth,	1
and	1
even	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
	1
	1
122:1	1
I	1
was	1
glad	1
when	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
122:2	1
Our	1
feet	1
shall	1
stand	1
within	1
thy	1
gates,	1
O	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
122:3	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
builded	1
as	1
a	1
city	1
that	1
is	1
compact	1
together:	1
	1
122:4	1
Whither	1
the	1
tribes	1
go	1
up,	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
122:5	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
set	1
thrones	1
of	1
judgment,	1
the	1
thrones	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
122:6	1
Pray	1
for	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
they	1
shall	1
prosper	1
that	1
love	1
thee.	1
	1
122:7	1
Peace	1
be	1
within	1
thy	1
walls,	1
and	1
prosperity	1
within	1
thy	1
palaces.	1
	1
122:8	1
For	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
companions'	1
sakes,	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
say,	1
Peace	1
be	1
within	1
thee.	1
	1
122:9	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
thy	1
good.	1
	1
	1
	1
123:1	1
Unto	1
thee	1
lift	1
I	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
123:2	1
Behold,	1
as	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
servants	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
masters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
maiden	1
unto	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
her	1
mistress;	1
so	1
our	1
eyes	1
wait	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
until	1
that	1
he	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
123:3	1
Have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
us,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
exceedingly	1
filled	1
with	1
contempt.	1
	1
123:4	1
Our	1
soul	1
is	1
exceedingly	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
scorning	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
proud.	1
	1
	1
	1
124:1	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
the	1
LORD	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
our	1
side,	1
now	1
may	1
Israel	1
say;	1
	1
124:2	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
the	1
LORD	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
our	1
side,	1
when	1
men	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
us:	1
	1
124:3	1
Then	1
they	1
had	1
swallowed	1
us	1
up	1
quick,	1
when	1
their	1
wrath	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
us:	1
	1
124:4	1
Then	1
the	1
waters	1
had	1
overwhelmed	1
us,	1
the	1
stream	1
had	1
gone	1
over	1
our	1
soul:	1
	1
124:5	1
Then	1
the	1
proud	1
waters	1
had	1
gone	1
over	1
our	1
soul.	1
	1
124:6	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
hath	1
not	1
given	1
us	1
as	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
their	1
teeth.	1
	1
124:7	1
Our	1
soul	1
is	1
escaped	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
fowlers:	1
the	1
snare	1
is	1
broken,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
escaped.	1
	1
124:8	1
Our	1
help	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth.	1
	1
	1
	1
125:1	1
They	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
removed,	1
but	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
125:2	1
As	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
Jerusalem,	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
round	1
about	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
henceforth	1
even	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
125:3	1
For	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
not	1
rest	1
upon	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
righteous;	1
lest	1
the	1
righteous	1
put	1
forth	1
their	1
hands	1
unto	1
iniquity.	1
	1
125:4	1
Do	1
good,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
good,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
upright	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
125:5	1
As	1
for	1
such	1
as	1
turn	1
aside	1
unto	1
their	1
crooked	1
ways,	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
lead	1
them	1
forth	1
with	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity:	1
but	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
Israel.	1
	1
	1
	1
126:1	1
When	1
the	1
LORD	1
turned	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Zion,	1
we	1
were	1
like	1
them	1
that	1
dream.	1
	1
126:2	1
Then	1
was	1
our	1
mouth	1
filled	1
with	1
laughter,	1
and	1
our	1
tongue	1
with	1
singing:	1
then	1
said	1
they	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
great	1
things	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
126:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
great	1
things	1
for	1
us;	1
whereof	1
we	1
are	1
glad.	1
	1
126:4	1
Turn	1
again	1
our	1
captivity,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
streams	1
in	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
126:5	1
They	1
that	1
sow	1
in	1
tears	1
shall	1
reap	1
in	1
joy.	1
	1
126:6	1
He	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth	1
and	1
weepeth,	1
bearing	1
precious	1
seed,	1
shall	1
doubtless	1
come	1
again	1
with	1
rejoicing,	1
bringing	1
his	1
sheaves	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
127:1	1
Except	1
the	1
LORD	1
build	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
labour	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
build	1
it:	1
except	1
the	1
LORD	1
keep	1
the	1
city,	1
the	1
watchman	1
waketh	1
but	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
127:2	1
It	1
is	1
vain	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
rise	1
up	1
early,	1
to	1
sit	1
up	1
late,	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
sorrows:	1
for	1
so	1
he	1
giveth	1
his	1
beloved	1
sleep.	1
	1
127:3	1
Lo,	1
children	1
are	1
an	1
heritage	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
womb	1
is	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
127:4	1
As	1
arrows	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
man;	1
so	1
are	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
youth.	1
	1
127:5	1
Happy	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
his	1
quiver	1
full	1
of	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
	1
	1
128:1	1
Blessed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
feareth	1
the	1
LORD;	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
128:2	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
thine	1
hands:	1
happy	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
128:3	1
Thy	1
wife	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
fruitful	1
vine	1
by	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
thine	1
house:	1
thy	1
children	1
like	1
olive	1
plants	1
round	1
about	1
thy	1
table.	1
	1
128:4	1
Behold,	1
that	1
thus	1
shall	1
the	1
man	1
be	1
blessed	1
that	1
feareth	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
128:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
Zion:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
128:6	1
Yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
thy	1
children's	1
children,	1
and	1
peace	1
upon	1
Israel.	1
	1
	1
	1
129:1	1
Many	1
a	1
time	1
have	1
they	1
afflicted	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
youth,	1
may	1
Israel	1
now	1
say:	1
	1
129:2	1
Many	1
a	1
time	1
have	1
they	1
afflicted	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
youth:	1
yet	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
prevailed	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
129:3	1
The	1
plowers	1
plowed	1
upon	1
my	1
back:	1
they	1
made	1
long	1
their	1
furrows.	1
	1
129:4	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
righteous:	1
he	1
hath	1
cut	1
asunder	1
the	1
cords	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
129:5	1
Let	1
them	1
all	1
be	1
confounded	1
and	1
turned	1
back	1
that	1
hate	1
Zion.	1
	1
129:6	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
grass	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops,	1
which	1
withereth	1
afore	1
it	1
groweth	1
up:	1
	1
129:7	1
Wherewith	1
the	1
mower	1
filleth	1
not	1
his	1
hand;	1
nor	1
he	1
that	1
bindeth	1
sheaves	1
his	1
bosom.	1
	1
129:8	1
Neither	1
do	1
they	1
which	1
go	1
by	1
say,	1
The	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
upon	1
you:	1
we	1
bless	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
130:1	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
depths	1
have	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
130:2	1
Lord,	1
hear	1
my	1
voice:	1
let	1
thine	1
ears	1
be	1
attentive	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
supplications.	1
	1
130:3	1
If	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
shouldest	1
mark	1
iniquities,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
who	1
shall	1
stand?	1
	1
130:4	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
forgiveness	1
with	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
feared.	1
	1
130:5	1
I	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
my	1
soul	1
doth	1
wait,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
word	1
do	1
I	1
hope.	1
	1
130:6	1
My	1
soul	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
that	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
morning:	1
I	1
say,	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
that	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
130:7	1
Let	1
Israel	1
hope	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
there	1
is	1
mercy,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
is	1
plenteous	1
redemption.	1
	1
130:8	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
redeem	1
Israel	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
iniquities.	1
	1
	1
	1
131:1	1
Lord,	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
haughty,	1
nor	1
mine	1
eyes	1
lofty:	1
neither	1
do	1
I	1
exercise	1
myself	1
in	1
great	1
matters,	1
or	1
in	1
things	1
too	1
high	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
131:2	1
Surely	1
I	1
have	1
behaved	1
and	1
quieted	1
myself,	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
that	1
is	1
weaned	1
of	1
his	1
mother:	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
weaned	1
child.	1
	1
131:3	1
Let	1
Israel	1
hope	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
henceforth	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
132:1	1
Lord,	1
remember	1
David,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
afflictions:	1
	1
132:2	1
How	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
vowed	1
unto	1
the	1
mighty	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
	1
132:3	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
my	1
house,	1
nor	1
go	1
up	1
into	1
my	1
bed;	1
	1
132:4	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
sleep	1
to	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
or	1
slumber	1
to	1
mine	1
eyelids,	1
	1
132:5	1
Until	1
I	1
find	1
out	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
an	1
habitation	1
for	1
the	1
mighty	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
132:6	1
Lo,	1
we	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
Ephratah:	1
we	1
found	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
132:7	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
his	1
tabernacles:	1
we	1
will	1
worship	1
at	1
his	1
footstool.	1
	1
132:8	1
Arise,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
into	1
thy	1
rest;	1
thou,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
thy	1
strength.	1
	1
132:9	1
Let	1
thy	1
priests	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
saints	1
shout	1
for	1
joy.	1
	1
132:10	1
For	1
thy	1
servant	1
David's	1
sake	1
turn	1
not	1
away	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
thine	1
anointed.	1
	1
132:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
in	1
truth	1
unto	1
David;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
from	1
it;	1
Of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
body	1
will	1
I	1
set	1
upon	1
thy	1
throne.	1
	1
132:12	1
If	1
thy	1
children	1
will	1
keep	1
my	1
covenant	1
and	1
my	1
testimony	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
teach	1
them,	1
their	1
children	1
shall	1
also	1
sit	1
upon	1
thy	1
throne	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
132:13	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chosen	1
Zion;	1
he	1
hath	1
desired	1
it	1
for	1
his	1
habitation.	1
	1
132:14	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
rest	1
for	1
ever:	1
here	1
will	1
I	1
dwell;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
desired	1
it.	1
	1
132:15	1
I	1
will	1
abundantly	1
bless	1
her	1
provision:	1
I	1
will	1
satisfy	1
her	1
poor	1
with	1
bread.	1
	1
132:16	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
clothe	1
her	1
priests	1
with	1
salvation:	1
and	1
her	1
saints	1
shall	1
shout	1
aloud	1
for	1
joy.	1
	1
132:17	1
There	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
David	1
to	1
bud:	1
I	1
have	1
ordained	1
a	1
lamp	1
for	1
mine	1
anointed.	1
	1
132:18	1
His	1
enemies	1
will	1
I	1
clothe	1
with	1
shame:	1
but	1
upon	1
himself	1
shall	1
his	1
crown	1
flourish.	1
	1
	1
	1
133:1	1
Behold,	1
how	1
good	1
and	1
how	1
pleasant	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
brethren	1
to	1
dwell	1
together	1
in	1
unity!	1
	1
133:2	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
precious	1
ointment	1
upon	1
the	1
head,	1
that	1
ran	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
beard,	1
even	1
Aaron's	1
beard:	1
that	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
his	1
garments;	1
	1
133:3	1
As	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
Hermon,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
dew	1
that	1
descended	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
there	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
the	1
blessing,	1
even	1
life	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
	1
	1
134:1	1
Behold,	1
bless	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
by	1
night	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
134:2	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
134:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
that	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
bless	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
	1
	1
135:1	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
praise	1
him,	1
O	1
ye	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
135:2	1
Ye	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
135:3	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
good:	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
his	1
name;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
pleasant.	1
	1
135:4	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chosen	1
Jacob	1
unto	1
himself,	1
and	1
Israel	1
for	1
his	1
peculiar	1
treasure.	1
	1
135:5	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
great,	1
and	1
that	1
our	1
Lord	1
is	1
above	1
all	1
gods.	1
	1
135:6	1
Whatsoever	1
the	1
LORD	1
pleased,	1
that	1
did	1
he	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
in	1
earth,	1
in	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
all	1
deep	1
places.	1
	1
135:7	1
He	1
causeth	1
the	1
vapours	1
to	1
ascend	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
he	1
maketh	1
lightnings	1
for	1
the	1
rain;	1
he	1
bringeth	1
the	1
wind	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
treasuries.	1
	1
135:8	1
Who	1
smote	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
both	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
beast.	1
	1
135:9	1
Who	1
sent	1
tokens	1
and	1
wonders	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
Egypt,	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
135:10	1
Who	1
smote	1
great	1
nations,	1
and	1
slew	1
mighty	1
kings;	1
	1
135:11	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1

Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
Canaan:	1
	1
135:12	1
And	1
gave	1
their	1
land	1
for	1
an	1
heritage,	1
an	1
heritage	1
unto	1
Israel	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
135:13	1
Thy	1
name,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
thy	1
memorial,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
throughout	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
135:14	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
judge	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
repent	1
himself	1
concerning	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
135:15	1
The	1
idols	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
are	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
men's	1
hands.	1
	1
135:16	1
They	1
have	1
mouths,	1
but	1
they	1
speak	1
not;	1
eyes	1
have	1
they,	1
but	1
they	1
see	1
not;	1
	1
135:17	1
They	1
have	1
ears,	1
but	1
they	1
hear	1
not;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
breath	1
in	1
their	1
mouths.	1
	1
135:18	1
They	1
that	1
make	1
them	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
them:	1
so	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
135:19	1
Bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Aaron:	1
	1
135:20	1
Bless	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Levi:	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
135:21	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
Zion,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
136:1	1
O	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
good:	1
for	1
his	1

	1
136:2	1
O	1

O	1
give	1

Lord	1
of	1
lords:	1
for	1
his	1

	1
136:4	1
To	1
him	1
who	1
alone	1
doeth	1
great	1
wonders:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
136:5	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
by	1
wisdom	1
made	1
the	1
heavens:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1

	1
136:6	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
stretched	1
out	1
the	1
earth	1
above	1
the	1
waters:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
136:7	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
great	1
lights:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:8	1
The	1
sun	1
to	1
rule	1
by	1
day:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1

	1
136:9	1
The	1
moon	1
and	1
stars	1
to	1

by	1
night:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1

	1
136:10	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
Egypt	1
in	1
their	1
firstborn:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:11	1
And	1
brought	1
out	1
Israel	1
from	1
among	1
them:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:12	1
With	1
a	1
strong	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
136:13	1
To	1
him	1
which	1
divided	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
into	1
parts:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:14	1
And	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:15	1
But	1
overthrew	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
his	1
host	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
136:16	1
To	1
him	1
which	1
led	1
his	1
people	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
136:17	1
To	1
him	1
which	1
smote	1
great	1
kings:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:18	1
And	1
slew	1
famous	1
kings:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:19	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:20	1
And	1
Og	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:21	1
And	1
gave	1
their	1
land	1
for	1
an	1
heritage:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:22	1
Even	1
an	1
heritage	1
unto	1
Israel	1
his	1
servant:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
136:23	1
Who	1
remembered	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
low	1
estate:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
136:24	1
And	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
enemies:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
136:25	1
Who	1
giveth	1
food	1
to	1
all	1
flesh:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
136:26	1
O	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven:	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
137:1	1
By	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
there	1
we	1
sat	1
down,	1
yea,	1
we	1
wept,	1
when	1
we	1
remembered	1
Zion.	1
	1
137:2	1
We	1
hanged	1
our	1
harps	1
upon	1
the	1
willows	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof.	1
	1
137:3	1
For	1
there	1
they	1
that	1
carried	1
us	1
away	1
captive	1
required	1
of	1
us	1
a	1
song;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
wasted	1
us	1
required	1
of	1
us	1
mirth,	1
saying,	1
Sing	1
us	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
137:4	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
sing	1
the	1
LORD's	1
song	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land?	1
	1
137:5	1
If	1
I	1
forget	1
thee,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
let	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
forget	1
her	1
cunning.	1
	1
137:6	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
thee,	1
let	1
my	1
tongue	1
cleave	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
my	1
mouth;	1
if	1
I	1
prefer	1
not	1
Jerusalem	1
above	1
my	1
chief	1
joy.	1
	1
137:7	1
Remember,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Edom	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
who	1
said,	1
Rase	1
it,	1
rase	1
it,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
foundation	1
thereof.	1
	1
137:8	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
who	1
art	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed;	1
happy	1
shall	1
he	1
be,	1
that	1
rewardeth	1
thee	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
served	1
us.	1
	1
137:9	1
Happy	1
shall	1
he	1
be,	1
that	1
taketh	1
and	1
dasheth	1
thy	1
little	1
ones	1
against	1
the	1
stones.	1
	1
	1
	1
138:1	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart:	1
before	1
the	1
gods	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
praise	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
138:2	1
I	1
will	1
worship	1
toward	1
thy	1
holy	1
temple,	1
and	1
praise	1
thy	1
name	1
for	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
truth:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
magnified	1
thy	1
word	1
above	1
all	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
138:3	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
cried	1
thou	1
answeredst	1
me,	1
and	1
strengthenedst	1
me	1
with	1
strength	1
in	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
138:4	1
All	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
when	1
they	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
138:5	1
Yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
sing	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
138:6	1
Though	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
high,	1
yet	1
hath	1
he	1
respect	1
unto	1
the	1
lowly:	1
but	1
the	1
proud	1
he	1
knoweth	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
138:7	1
Though	1
I	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
trouble,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
revive	1
me:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
shall	1
save	1
me.	1
	1
138:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
perfect	1
that	1
which	1
concerneth	1
me:	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
forsake	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
	1
	1
139:1	1
O	1
lord,	1
thou	1
hast	1
searched	1
me,	1
and	1
known	1
me.	1
	1
139:2	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
my	1
downsitting	1
and	1
mine	1
uprising,	1
thou	1
understandest	1
my	1
thought	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
139:3	1
Thou	1
compassest	1
my	1
path	1
and	1
my	1
lying	1
down,	1
and	1
art	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
ways.	1
	1
139:4	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
my	1
tongue,	1
but,	1
lo,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
it	1
altogether.	1
	1
139:5	1
Thou	1
hast	1
beset	1
me	1
behind	1
and	1
before,	1
and	1
laid	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
139:6	1
Such	1
knowledge	1
is	1
too	1
wonderful	1
for	1
me;	1
it	1
is	1
high,	1
I	1
cannot	1
attain	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
139:7	1
Whither	1
shall	1
I	1
go	1
from	1
thy	1
spirit?	1
or	1
whither	1
shall	1
I	1
flee	1
from	1
thy	1
presence?	1
	1
139:8	1
If	1
I	1
ascend	1
up	1
into	1
heaven,	1
thou	1
art	1
there:	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
bed	1
in	1
hell,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
there.	1
	1
139:9	1
If	1
I	1
take	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
	1
139:10	1
Even	1
there	1
shall	1
thy	1
hand	1
lead	1
me,	1
and	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
shall	1
hold	1
me.	1
	1
139:11	1
If	1
I	1
say,	1
Surely	1
the	1
darkness	1
shall	1
cover	1
me;	1
even	1
the	1
night	1
shall	1
be	1
light	1
about	1
me.	1
	1
139:12	1
Yea,	1
the	1
darkness	1
hideth	1
not	1
from	1
thee;	1
but	1
the	1
night	1
shineth	1
as	1
the	1
day:	1
the	1
darkness	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
are	1
both	1
alike	1
to	1
thee.	1
	1
139:13	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
possessed	1
my	1
reins:	1
thou	1
hast	1
covered	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb.	1
	1
139:14	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
fearfully	1
and	1
wonderfully	1
made:	1
marvellous	1
are	1
thy	1
works;	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
knoweth	1
right	1
well.	1
	1
139:15	1
My	1
substance	1
was	1
not	1
hid	1
from	1
thee,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
secret,	1
and	1
curiously	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
lowest	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
139:16	1
Thine	1
eyes	1
did	1
see	1
my	1
substance,	1
yet	1
being	1
unperfect;	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
book	1
all	1
my	1
members	1
were	1
written,	1
which	1
in	1
continuance	1
were	1
fashioned,	1
when	1
as	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
139:17	1
How	1
precious	1
also	1
are	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
God!	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
them!	1
	1
139:18	1
If	1
I	1
should	1
count	1
them,	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
in	1
number	1
than	1
the	1
sand:	1
when	1
I	1
awake,	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
139:19	1
Surely	1
thou	1
wilt	1
slay	1
the	1
wicked,	1
O	1
God:	1
depart	1
from	1
me	1
therefore,	1
ye	1
bloody	1
men.	1
	1
139:20	1
For	1
they	1
speak	1
against	1
thee	1
wickedly,	1
and	1
thine	1
enemies	1
take	1
thy	1
name	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
139:21	1
Do	1
not	1
I	1
hate	1
them,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
that	1
hate	1
thee?	1
and	1
am	1
not	1
I	1
grieved	1
with	1
those	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
139:22	1
I	1
hate	1
them	1
with	1
perfect	1
hatred:	1
I	1
count	1
them	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
	1
139:23	1
Search	1
me,	1
O	1
God,	1
and	1
know	1
my	1
heart:	1
try	1
me,	1
and	1
know	1
my	1
thoughts:	1
	1
139:24	1
And	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
wicked	1
way	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
lead	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
everlasting.	1
	1
	1
	1
140:1	1
Deliver	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
man:	1
preserve	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
violent	1
man;	1
	1
140:2	1
Which	1
imagine	1
mischiefs	1
in	1
their	1
heart;	1
continually	1
are	1
they	1
gathered	1
together	1
for	1
war.	1
	1
140:3	1
They	1
have	1
sharpened	1
their	1
tongues	1
like	1
a	1
serpent;	1
adders'	1
poison	1
is	1
under	1
their	1
lips.	1
Selah.	1
	1
140:4	1
Keep	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
wicked;	1
preserve	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
violent	1
man;	1
who	1
have	1
purposed	1
to	1
overthrow	1
my	1
goings.	1
	1
140:5	1
The	1
proud	1
have	1
hid	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
cords;	1
they	1
have	1
spread	1
a	1
net	1
by	1
the	1
wayside;	1
they	1
have	1
set	1
gins	1
for	1
me.	1
Selah.	1
	1
140:6	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
God:	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
supplications,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
140:7	1
O	1
GOD	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
my	1
salvation,	1
thou	1
hast	1
covered	1
my	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle.	1
	1
140:8	1
Grant	1
not,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
further	1
not	1
his	1
wicked	1
device;	1
lest	1
they	1
exalt	1
themselves.	1
Selah.	1
	1
140:9	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
compass	1
me	1
about,	1
let	1
the	1
mischief	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
lips	1
cover	1
them.	1
	1
140:10	1
Let	1
burning	1
coals	1
fall	1
upon	1
them:	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire;	1
into	1
deep	1
pits,	1
that	1
they	1
rise	1
not	1
up	1
again.	1
	1
140:11	1
Let	1
not	1
an	1
evil	1
speaker	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
evil	1
shall	1
hunt	1
the	1
violent	1
man	1
to	1
overthrow	1
him.	1
	1
140:12	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
maintain	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
140:13	1
Surely	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
thy	1
name:	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
thy	1
presence.	1
	1
	1
	1
141:1	1
Lord,	1
I	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee:	1
make	1
haste	1
unto	1
me;	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
voice,	1
when	1
I	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
141:2	1
Let	1
my	1
prayer	1
be	1
set	1
forth	1
before	1
thee	1
as	1
incense;	1
and	1
the	1
lifting	1
up	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
as	1
the	1
evening	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
141:3	1
Set	1
a	1
watch,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
before	1
my	1
mouth;	1
keep	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
my	1
lips.	1
	1
141:4	1
Incline	1
not	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
any	1
evil	1
thing,	1
to	1
practise	1
wicked	1
works	1
with	1
men	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity:	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
their	1
dainties.	1
	1
141:5	1
Let	1
the	1
righteous	1
smite	1
me;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
kindness:	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
reprove	1
me;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
excellent	1
oil,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
break	1
my	1
head:	1
for	1
yet	1
my	1
prayer	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
calamities.	1
	1
141:6	1
When	1
their	1
judges	1
are	1
overthrown	1
in	1
stony	1
places,	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
words;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
sweet.	1
	1
141:7	1
Our	1
bones	1
are	1
scattered	1
at	1
the	1
grave's	1
mouth,	1
as	1
when	1
one	1
cutteth	1
and	1
cleaveth	1
wood	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
141:8	1
But	1
mine	1
eyes	1
are	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
GOD	1
the	1
Lord:	1
in	1
thee	1
is	1
my	1
trust;	1
leave	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
destitute.	1
	1
141:9	1
Keep	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
snares	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
gins	1
of	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
141:10	1
Let	1
the	1
wicked	1
fall	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
nets,	1
whilst	1
that	1
I	1
withal	1
escape.	1
	1
	1
	1
142:1	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
my	1
voice;	1
with	1
my	1
voice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
supplication.	1
	1
142:2	1
I	1
poured	1
out	1
my	1
complaint	1
before	1
him;	1
I	1
shewed	1
before	1
him	1
my	1
trouble.	1
	1
142:3	1
When	1
my	1
spirit	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
within	1
me,	1
then	1
thou	1
knewest	1
my	1
path.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
way	1
wherein	1
I	1
walked	1
have	1
they	1
privily	1
laid	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
142:4	1
I	1
looked	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
beheld,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
would	1
know	1
me:	1
refuge	1
failed	1
me;	1
no	1
man	1
cared	1
for	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
142:5	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
I	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
refuge	1
and	1
my	1
portion	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
142:6	1
Attend	1
unto	1
my	1
cry;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
brought	1
very	1
low:	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
persecutors;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
stronger	1
than	1
I.	1
	1
142:7	1
Bring	1
my	1
soul	1
out	1
of	1
prison,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
praise	1
thy	1
name:	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
compass	1
me	1
about;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deal	1
bountifully	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
	1
	1
143:1	1
Hear	1
my	1
prayer,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
my	1
supplications:	1
in	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
answer	1
me,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
righteousness.	1
	1
143:2	1
And	1
enter	1
not	1
into	1
judgment	1
with	1
thy	1
servant:	1
for	1
in	1
thy	1
sight	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
living	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
143:3	1
For	1
the	1
enemy	1
hath	1
persecuted	1
my	1
soul;	1
he	1
hath	1
smitten	1
my	1
life	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
darkness,	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
long	1
dead.	1
	1
143:4	1
Therefore	1
is	1
my	1
spirit	1
overwhelmed	1
within	1
me;	1
my	1
heart	1
within	1
me	1
is	1
desolate.	1
	1
143:5	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old;	1
I	1
meditate	1
on	1
all	1
thy	1
works;	1
I	1
muse	1
on	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thy	1
hands.	1
	1
143:6	1
I	1
stretch	1
forth	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
thee:	1
my	1
soul	1
thirsteth	1
after	1
thee,	1
as	1
a	1
thirsty	1
land.	1
Selah.	1
	1
143:7	1
Hear	1
me	1
speedily,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
my	1
spirit	1
faileth:	1
hide	1
not	1
thy	1
face	1
from	1
me,	1
lest	1
I	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
143:8	1
Cause	1
me	1
to	1
hear	1
thy	1
lovingkindness	1
in	1
the	1
morning;	1
for	1
in	1
thee	1
do	1
I	1
trust:	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
way	1
wherein	1
I	1
should	1
walk;	1
for	1
I	1
lift	1
up	1
my	1
soul	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
143:9	1
Deliver	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
from	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
I	1
flee	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
hide	1
me.	1
	1
143:10	1
Teach	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
God:	1
thy	1
spirit	1
is	1
good;	1
lead	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
uprightness.	1
	1
143:11	1
Quicken	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake:	1
for	1
thy	1
righteousness'	1
sake	1
bring	1
my	1
soul	1
out	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
143:12	1
And	1
of	1
thy	1
mercy	1
cut	1
off	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
destroy	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
afflict	1
my	1
soul:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
	1
	1
144:1	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
strength	1
which	1
teacheth	1
my	1
hands	1
to	1
war,	1
and	1
my	1
fingers	1
to	1
fight:	1
	1
144:2	1
My	1
goodness,	1
and	1
my	1
fortress;	1
my	1
high	1
tower,	1
and	1
my	1
deliverer;	1
my	1
shield,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
trust;	1
who	1
subdueth	1
my	1
people	1
under	1
me.	1
	1
144:3	1
LORD,	1
what	1
is	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
takest	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him!	1
or	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
makest	1
account	1
of	1
him!	1
	1
144:4	1
Man	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
vanity:	1
his	1
days	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
shadow	1
that	1
passeth	1
away.	1
	1
144:5	1
Bow	1
thy	1
heavens,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
come	1
down:	1
touch	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
smoke.	1
	1
144:6	1
Cast	1
forth	1
lightning,	1
and	1
scatter	1
them:	1
shoot	1
out	1
thine	1
arrows,	1
and	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
144:7	1
Send	1
thine	1
hand	1
from	1
above;	1
rid	1
me,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
great	1
waters,	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
strange	1
children;	1
	1
144:8	1
Whose	1
mouth	1
speaketh	1
vanity,	1
and	1
their	1
right	1
hand	1
is	1
a	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
falsehood.	1
	1
144:9	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
a	1
new	1
song	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
God:	1
upon	1
a	1
psaltery	1
and	1
an	1
instrument	1
of	1
ten	1
strings	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
144:10	1
It	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
salvation	1
unto	1
kings:	1
who	1
delivereth	1
David	1
his	1
servant	1
from	1
the	1
hurtful	1
sword.	1
	1
144:11	1
Rid	1
me,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
strange	1
children,	1
whose	1
mouth	1
speaketh	1
vanity,	1
and	1
their	1
right	1
hand	1
is	1
a	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
falsehood:	1
	1
144:12	1
That	1
our	1
sons	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
plants	1
grown	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
youth;	1
that	1
our	1
daughters	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
corner	1
stones,	1
polished	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
a	1
palace:	1
	1
144:13	1
That	1
our	1
garners	1
may	1
be	1
full,	1
affording	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
store:	1
that	1
our	1
sheep	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
thousands	1
and	1
ten	1
thousands	1
in	1
our	1
streets:	1
	1
144:14	1
That	1
our	1
oxen	1
may	1
be	1
strong	1
to	1
labour;	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
breaking	1
in,	1
nor	1
going	1
out;	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
complaining	1
in	1
our	1
streets.	1
	1
144:15	1
Happy	1
is	1
that	1
people,	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case:	1
yea,	1
happy	1
is	1
that	1
people,	1
whose	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
145:1	1
I	1
will	1
extol	1
thee,	1
my	1
God,	1
O	1
king;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thy	1
name	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
145:2	1
Every	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
bless	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thy	1
name	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
145:3	1
Great	1
is	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
greatly	1
to	1
be	1
praised;	1
and	1
his	1
greatness	1
is	1
unsearchable.	1
	1
145:4	1
One	1
generation	1
shall	1
praise	1
thy	1
works	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
shall	1
declare	1
thy	1
mighty	1
acts.	1
	1
145:5	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
glorious	1
honour	1
of	1
thy	1
majesty,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
wondrous	1
works.	1
	1
145:6	1
And	1
men	1
shall	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
thy	1
terrible	1
acts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
thy	1
greatness.	1
	1
145:7	1
They	1
shall	1
abundantly	1
utter	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
thy	1
great	1
goodness,	1
and	1
shall	1
sing	1
of	1
thy	1
righteousness.	1
	1
145:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
gracious,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
compassion;	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
mercy.	1
	1
145:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
all:	1
and	1
his	1
tender	1
mercies	1
are	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
145:10	1
All	1
thy	1
works	1
shall	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
and	1
thy	1
saints	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee.	1
	1
145:11	1
They	1
shall	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
talk	1
of	1
thy	1
power;	1
	1
145:12	1
To	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
his	1
mighty	1
acts,	1
and	1
the	1
glorious	1
majesty	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
145:13	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
thy	1
dominion	1
endureth	1
throughout	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
145:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
upholdeth	1
all	1
that	1
fall,	1
and	1
raiseth	1
up	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
bowed	1
down.	1
	1
145:15	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
wait	1
upon	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
givest	1
them	1
their	1
meat	1
in	1
due	1
season.	1
	1
145:16	1
Thou	1
openest	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
satisfiest	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
every	1
living	1
thing.	1
	1
145:17	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
righteous	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
holy	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
145:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
nigh	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
upon	1
him,	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
145:19	1
He	1
will	1
fulfil	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him:	1
he	1
also	1
will	1
hear	1
their	1
cry,	1
and	1
will	1
save	1
them.	1
	1
145:20	1
The	1
LORD	1
preserveth	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him:	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
wicked	1
will	1
he	1
destroy.	1
	1
145:21	1
My	1
mouth	1
shall	1
speak	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
flesh	1
bless	1
his	1
holy	1
name	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
	1
	1
146:1	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
146:2	1
While	1
I	1
live	1
will	1
I	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
my	1
God	1
while	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
being.	1
	1
146:3	1
Put	1
not	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
princes,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
in	1
whom	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
help.	1
	1
146:4	1
His	1
breath	1
goeth	1
forth,	1
he	1
returneth	1
to	1
his	1
earth;	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
day	1
his	1
thoughts	1
perish.	1
	1
146:5	1
Happy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
for	1
his	1
help,	1
whose	1
hope	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God:	1
	1
146:6	1
Which	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
therein	1
is:	1
which	1
keepeth	1
truth	1
for	1
ever:	1
	1
146:7	1
Which	1
executeth	1
judgment	1
for	1
the	1
oppressed:	1
which	1
giveth	1
food	1
to	1
the	1
hungry.	1
The	1
LORD	1
looseth	1
the	1
prisoners:	1
	1
146:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
openeth	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind:	1
the	1
LORD	1
raiseth	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
bowed	1
down:	1
the	1
LORD	1
loveth	1
the	1
righteous:	1
	1
146:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
preserveth	1
the	1
strangers;	1
he	1
relieveth	1
the	1
fatherless	1
and	1
widow:	1
but	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
he	1
turneth	1
upside	1
down.	1
	1
146:10	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever,	1
even	1
thy	1
God,	1
O	1
Zion,	1
unto	1
all	1
generations.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
147:1	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
our	1
God;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
pleasant;	1
and	1
praise	1
is	1
comely.	1
	1
147:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
doth	1
build	1
up	1
Jerusalem:	1
he	1
gathereth	1
together	1
the	1
outcasts	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
147:3	1
He	1
healeth	1
the	1
broken	1
in	1
heart,	1
and	1
bindeth	1
up	1
their	1
wounds.	1
	1
147:4	1
He	1
telleth	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
stars;	1
he	1
calleth	1
them	1
all	1
by	1
their	1
names.	1
	1
147:5	1
Great	1
is	1
our	1
Lord,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
power:	1
his	1
understanding	1
is	1
infinite.	1
	1
147:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
lifteth	1
up	1
the	1
meek:	1
he	1
casteth	1
the	1
wicked	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
147:7	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
thanksgiving;	1
sing	1
praise	1
upon	1
the	1
harp	1
unto	1
our	1
God:	1
	1
147:8	1
Who	1
covereth	1
the	1
heaven	1
with	1
clouds,	1
who	1
prepareth	1
rain	1
for	1
the	1
earth,	1
who	1
maketh	1
grass	1
to	1
grow	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
147:9	1
He	1
giveth	1
to	1
the	1
beast	1
his	1
food,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ravens	1
which	1
cry.	1
	1
147:10	1
He	1
delighteth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
horse:	1
he	1
taketh	1
not	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
147:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
taketh	1
pleasure	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him,	1
in	1
those	1
that	1
hope	1
in	1
his	1
mercy.	1
	1
147:12	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
Jerusalem;	1
praise	1
thy	1
God,	1
O	1
Zion.	1
	1
147:13	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
strengthened	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
thy	1
gates;	1
he	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thy	1
children	1
within	1
thee.	1
	1
147:14	1
He	1
maketh	1
peace	1
in	1
thy	1
borders,	1
and	1
filleth	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
finest	1
of	1
the	1
wheat.	1
	1
147:15	1
He	1
sendeth	1
forth	1
his	1
commandment	1
upon	1
earth:	1
his	1
word	1
runneth	1
very	1
swiftly.	1
	1
147:16	1
He	1
giveth	1
snow	1
like	1
wool:	1
he	1
scattereth	1
the	1
hoarfrost	1
like	1
ashes.	1
	1
147:17	1
He	1
casteth	1
forth	1
his	1
ice	1
like	1
morsels:	1
who	1
can	1
stand	1
before	1
his	1
cold?	1
	1
147:18	1
He	1
sendeth	1
out	1
his	1
word,	1
and	1
melteth	1
them:	1
he	1
causeth	1
his	1
wind	1
to	1
blow,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
flow.	1
	1
147:19	1
He	1
sheweth	1
his	1
word	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
his	1
statutes	1
and	1
his	1
judgments	1
unto	1
Israel.	1
	1
147:20	1
He	1
hath	1
not	1
dealt	1
so	1
with	1
any	1
nation:	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
his	1
judgments,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
them.	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
	1
	1
148:1	1
Praise	1

in	1
the	1
heights.	1
	1
148:2	1
Praise	1

	1
148:3	1
Praise	1
ye	1
him,	1

stars	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
148:4	1
Praise	1
him,	1
ye	1
heavens	1
of	1
heavens,	1
and	1
ye	1
waters	1
that	1
be	1
above	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
148:5	1
Let	1
them	1
praise	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
created.	1
	1
148:6	1
He	1
hath	1
also	1
stablished	1
them	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
a	1
decree	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
pass.	1
	1
148:7	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
ye	1
dragons,	1
and	1
all	1
deeps:	1
	1
148:8	1
Fire,	1
and	1
hail;	1
snow,	1
and	1
vapours;	1
stormy	1
wind	1
fulfilling	1
his	1
word:	1
	1
148:9	1
Mountains,	1
and	1
all	1
hills;	1
fruitful	1
trees,	1
and	1
all	1
cedars:	1
	1
148:10	1
Beasts,	1
and	1
all	1
cattle;	1
creeping	1

	1
148:11	1
Kings	1
of	1
the	1

all	1

and	1

judges	1
of	1
the	1

	1
148:12	1
Both	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
maidens;	1
old	1
men,	1
and	1
children:	1
	1
148:13	1
Let	1
them	1
praise	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
his	1
name	1
alone	1
is	1
excellent;	1
his	1
glory	1
is	1
above	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
heaven.	1
	1
148:14	1
He	1
also	1
exalteth	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
saints;	1
even	1
of	1
the	1

unto	1
him.	1
Praise	1
ye	1

	1
	1
	1
149:1	1
Praise	1

Sing	1

the	1

a	1

in	1
the	1

	1
149:2	1
Let	1
Israel	1

in	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
him:	1
let	1

	1
149:3	1
Let	1

let	1

him	1
with	1
the	1

	1
149:4	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
taketh	1
pleasure	1
in	1
his	1
people:	1
he	1
will	1
beautify	1
the	1
meek	1

	1
149:5	1
Let	1
the	1

	1
149:6	1
Let	1
the	1

in	1
their	1
hand;	1
	1
149:7	1
To	1
execute	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
punishments	1
upon	1
the	1
people;	1
	1
149:8	1
To	1
bind	1
their	1
kings	1
with	1
chains,	1
and	1
their	1
nobles	1
with	1

To	1

The	1
Proverbs	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
proverbs	1
of	1
Solomon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
king	1
of	1
Israel;	1
1:2	1
To	1
know	1
wisdom	1
and	1
instruction;	1
to	1
perceive	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
understanding;	1
1:3	1
To	1
receive	1
the	1
instruction	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
justice,	1
and	1
judgment,	1
and	1
equity;	1
1:4	1
To	1
give	1
subtilty	1
to	1
the	1
simple,	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
knowledge	1
and	1
discretion.	1
	1
1:5	1
A	1
wise	1
man	1
will	1
hear,	1
and	1
will	1
increase	1
learning;	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding	1
shall	1
attain	1
unto	1
wise	1
counsels:	1
1:6	1
To	1
understand	1
a	1
proverb,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation;	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
their	1
dark	1
sayings.	1
	1
1:7	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
knowledge:	1
but	1
fools	1
despise	1
wisdom	1
and	1
instruction.	1
	1
1:8	1
My	1
son,	1
hear	1
the	1
instruction	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
forsake	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
thy	1
mother:	1
1:9	1
For	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
ornament	1
of	1
grace	1
unto	1
thy	1
head,	1
and	1
chains	1
about	1
thy	1
neck.	1
	1
1:10	1
My	1
son,	1
if	1
sinners	1
entice	1
thee,	1
consent	1
thou	1
not.	1
	1
1:11	1
If	1
they	1
say,	1
Come	1
with	1
us,	1
let	1
us	1
lay	1
wait	1
for	1
blood,	1
let	1
us	1
lurk	1
privily	1
for	1
the	1
innocent	1
without	1
cause:	1
1:12	1
Let	1
us	1
swallow	1
them	1
up	1
alive	1
as	1
the	1
grave;	1
and	1
whole,	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
pit:	1
1:13	1
We	1
shall	1
find	1
all	1
precious	1
substance,	1
we	1
shall	1
fill	1
our	1
houses	1
with	1
spoil:	1
1:14	1
Cast	1
in	1
thy	1
lot	1
among	1
us;	1
let	1
us	1
all	1
have	1
one	1
purse:	1
1:15	1
My	1
son,	1
walk	1
not	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
them;	1
refrain	1
thy	1
foot	1
from	1
their	1
path:	1
1:16	1
For	1
their	1
feet	1
run	1
to	1
evil,	1
and	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
shed	1
blood.	1
	1
1:17	1
Surely	1
in	1
vain	1
the	1
net	1
is	1
spread	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
any	1
bird.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
they	1
lay	1
wait	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
blood;	1
they	1
lurk	1
privily	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
lives.	1
	1
1:19	1
So	1
are	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
greedy	1
of	1
gain;	1
which	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
owners	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:20	1
Wisdom	1
crieth	1
without;	1
she	1
uttereth	1
her	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
streets:	1
1:21	1
She	1
crieth	1
in	1
the	1
chief	1
place	1
of	1
concourse,	1
in	1
the	1
openings	1
of	1
the	1
gates:	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
she	1
uttereth	1
her	1
words,	1
saying,	1
1:22	1
How	1
long,	1
ye	1
simple	1
ones,	1
will	1
ye	1
love	1
simplicity?	1
and	1
the	1
scorners	1
delight	1
in	1
their	1
scorning,	1
and	1
fools	1
hate	1
knowledge?	1
	1
1:23	1
Turn	1
you	1
at	1
my	1
reproof:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
spirit	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
known	1
my	1
words	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:24	1
Because	1
I	1
have	1
called,	1
and	1
ye	1
refused;	1
I	1
have	1
stretched	1
out	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
regarded;	1
1:25	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
all	1
my	1
counsel,	1
and	1
would	1
none	1
of	1
my	1
reproof:	1
1:26	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
laugh	1
at	1
your	1
calamity;	1
I	1
will	1
mock	1
when	1
your	1
fear	1
cometh;	1
1:27	1
When	1
your	1
fear	1
cometh	1
as	1
desolation,	1
and	1
your	1
destruction	1
cometh	1
as	1
a	1
whirlwind;	1
when	1
distress	1
and	1
anguish	1
cometh	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
1:28	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
call	1
upon	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
answer;	1
they	1
shall	1
seek	1
me	1
early,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
1:29	1
For	1
that	1
they	1
hated	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
1:30	1
They	1
would	1
none	1
of	1
my	1
counsel:	1
they	1
despised	1
all	1
my	1
reproof.	1
	1
1:31	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
way,	1
and	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
devices.	1
	1
1:32	1
For	1
the	1
turning	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
simple	1
shall	1
slay	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
fools	1
shall	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
1:33	1
But	1
whoso	1
hearkeneth	1
unto	1
me	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
quiet	1
from	1
fear	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
son,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
receive	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
hide	1
my	1
commandments	1
with	1
thee;	1
2:2	1
So	1
that	1
thou	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear	1
unto	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
apply	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
understanding;	1
2:3	1
Yea,	1
if	1
thou	1
criest	1
after	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
liftest	1
up	1
thy	1
voice	1
for	1
understanding;	1
2:4	1
If	1
thou	1
seekest	1
her	1
as	1
silver,	1
and	1
searchest	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
for	1
hid	1
treasures;	1
2:5	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
understand	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
find	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:6	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
giveth	1
wisdom:	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
cometh	1
knowledge	1
and	1
understanding.	1
	1
2:7	1
He	1
layeth	1
up	1
sound	1
wisdom	1
for	1
the	1
righteous:	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
buckler	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
walk	1
uprightly.	1
	1
2:8	1
He	1
keepeth	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
preserveth	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
saints.	1
	1
2:9	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
understand	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
judgment,	1
and	1
equity;	1
yea,	1
every	1
good	1
path.	1
	1
2:10	1
When	1
wisdom	1
entereth	1
into	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
knowledge	1
is	1
pleasant	1
unto	1
thy	1
soul;	1
2:11	1
Discretion	1
shall	1
preserve	1
thee,	1
understanding	1
shall	1
keep	1
thee:	1
2:12	1
To	1
deliver	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
man,	1
from	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
speaketh	1
froward	1
things;	1
2:13	1
Who	1
leave	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
uprightness,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
darkness;	1
2:14	1
Who	1
rejoice	1
to	1
do	1
evil,	1
and	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
frowardness	1
of	1
the	1
wicked;	1
2:15	1
Whose	1
ways	1
are	1
crooked,	1
and	1
they	1
froward	1
in	1
their	1
paths:	1
2:16	1
To	1
deliver	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
strange	1
woman,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
stranger	1
which	1
flattereth	1
with	1
her	1
words;	1
2:17	1
Which	1
forsaketh	1
the	1
guide	1
of	1
her	1
youth,	1
and	1
forgetteth	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
her	1
God.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
her	1
house	1
inclineth	1
unto	1
death,	1
and	1
her	1
paths	1
unto	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
2:19	1
None	1
that	1
go	1
unto	1
her	1
return	1
again,	1
neither	1
take	1
they	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
2:20	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
good	1
men,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
perfect	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
transgressors	1
shall	1
be	1
rooted	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
3:1	1
My	1
son,	1
forget	1
not	1
my	1
law;	1
but	1
let	1
thine	1
heart	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments:	1
3:2	1
For	1
length	1
of	1
days,	1
and	1
long	1
life,	1
and	1
peace,	1
shall	1
they	1
add	1
to	1
thee.	1
	1
3:3	1
Let	1
not	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
forsake	1
thee:	1
bind	1
them	1
about	1
thy	1
neck;	1
write	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
thine	1
heart:	1
3:4	1
So	1
shalt	1
thou	1
find	1
favour	1
and	1
good	1
understanding	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
man.	1
	1
3:5	1
Trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart;	1
and	1
lean	1
not	1
unto	1
thine	1
own	1
understanding.	1
	1
3:6	1
In	1
all	1
thy	1
ways	1
acknowledge	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
direct	1
thy	1
paths.	1
	1
3:7	1
Be	1
not	1
wise	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eyes:	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
depart	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
3:8	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
health	1
to	1
thy	1
navel,	1
and	1
marrow	1
to	1
thy	1
bones.	1
	1
3:9	1
Honour	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
thy	1
substance,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
all	1
thine	1
increase:	1
3:10	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
barns	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
plenty,	1
and	1
thy	1
presses	1
shall	1
burst	1
out	1
with	1
new	1
wine.	1
	1
3:11	1
My	1
son,	1
despise	1
not	1
the	1
chastening	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
neither	1
be	1
weary	1
of	1
his	1
correction:	1
3:12	1
For	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
loveth	1
he	1
correcteth;	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
father	1
the	1
son	1
in	1
whom	1
he	1
delighteth.	1
	1
3:13	1
Happy	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
findeth	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
getteth	1
understanding.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
the	1
merchandise	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
merchandise	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gain	1
thereof	1
than	1
fine	1
gold.	1
	1
3:15	1
She	1
is	1
more	1
precious	1
than	1
rubies:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
thou	1
canst	1
desire	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
3:16	1
Length	1
of	1
days	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
right	1
hand;	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
left	1
hand	1
riches	1
and	1
honour.	1
	1
3:17	1
Her	1
ways	1
are	1
ways	1
of	1
pleasantness,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
paths	1
are	1
peace.	1
	1
3:18	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
her:	1
and	1
happy	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
retaineth	1
her.	1
	1
3:19	1
The	1
LORD	1
by	1
wisdom	1
hath	1
founded	1
the	1
earth;	1
by	1
understanding	1
hath	1
he	1
established	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
3:20	1
By	1
his	1
knowledge	1
the	1
depths	1
are	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
clouds	1
drop	1
down	1
the	1
dew.	1
	1
3:21	1
My	1
son,	1
let	1
not	1
them	1
depart	1
from	1
thine	1
eyes:	1
keep	1
sound	1
wisdom	1
and	1
discretion:	1
3:22	1
So	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
life	1
unto	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
grace	1
to	1
thy	1
neck.	1
	1
3:23	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
walk	1
in	1
thy	1
way	1
safely,	1
and	1
thy	1
foot	1
shall	1
not	1
stumble.	1
	1
3:24	1
When	1
thou	1
liest	1
down,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
afraid:	1
yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
thy	1
sleep	1
shall	1
be	1
sweet.	1
	1
3:25	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
sudden	1
fear,	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
desolation	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
when	1
it	1
cometh.	1
	1
3:26	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
confidence,	1
and	1
shall	1
keep	1
thy	1
foot	1
from	1
being	1
taken.	1
	1
3:27	1
Withhold	1
not	1
good	1
from	1
them	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
due,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
3:28	1
Say	1
not	1
unto	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
Go,	1
and	1
come	1
again,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
give;	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
it	1
by	1
thee.	1
	1
3:29	1
Devise	1
not	1
evil	1
against	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
seeing	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
securely	1
by	1
thee.	1
	1
3:30	1
Strive	1
not	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
cause,	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
done	1
thee	1
no	1
harm.	1
	1
3:31	1
Envy	1
thou	1
not	1
the	1
oppressor,	1
and	1
choose	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
3:32	1
For	1
the	1
froward	1
is	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
his	1
secret	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:33	1
The	1
curse	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
but	1
he	1
blesseth	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
the	1
just.	1
	1
3:34	1
Surely	1
he	1
scorneth	1
the	1
scorners:	1
but	1
he	1
giveth	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
lowly.	1
	1
3:35	1
The	1
wise	1
shall	1
inherit	1
glory:	1
but	1
shame	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
promotion	1
of	1
fools.	1
	1
4:1	1
Hear,	1
ye	1
children,	1
the	1
instruction	1
of	1
a	1
father,	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
know	1
understanding.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
good	1
doctrine,	1
forsake	1
ye	1
not	1
my	1
law.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
my	1
father's	1
son,	1
tender	1
and	1
only	1
beloved	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
mother.	1
	1
4:4	1
He	1
taught	1
me	1
also,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Let	1
thine	1
heart	1
retain	1
my	1
words:	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
live.	1
	1
4:5	1
Get	1
wisdom,	1
get	1
understanding:	1
forget	1
it	1
not;	1
neither	1
decline	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
4:6	1
Forsake	1
her	1
not,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
preserve	1
thee:	1
love	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
keep	1
thee.	1
	1
4:7	1
Wisdom	1
is	1
the	1
principal	1
thing;	1
therefore	1
get	1
wisdom:	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
getting	1
get	1
understanding.	1
	1
4:8	1
Exalt	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
promote	1
thee:	1
she	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
to	1
honour,	1
when	1
thou	1
dost	1
embrace	1
her.	1
	1
4:9	1
She	1
shall	1
give	1
to	1
thine	1
head	1
an	1
ornament	1
of	1
grace:	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory	1
shall	1
she	1
deliver	1
to	1
thee.	1
	1
4:10	1
Hear,	1
O	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
receive	1
my	1
sayings;	1
and	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
thy	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
many.	1
	1
4:11	1
I	1
have	1
taught	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
wisdom;	1
I	1
have	1
led	1
thee	1
in	1
right	1
paths.	1
	1
4:12	1
When	1
thou	1
goest,	1
thy	1
steps	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
straitened;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
runnest,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
stumble.	1
	1
4:13	1
Take	1
fast	1
hold	1
of	1
instruction;	1
let	1
her	1
not	1
go:	1
keep	1
her;	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
4:14	1
Enter	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
go	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
evil	1
men.	1
	1
4:15	1
Avoid	1
it,	1
pass	1
not	1
by	1
it,	1
turn	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
they	1
sleep	1
not,	1
except	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
mischief;	1
and	1
their	1
sleep	1
is	1
taken	1
away,	1
unless	1
they	1
cause	1
some	1
to	1
fall.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
they	1
eat	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
violence.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
shining	1
light,	1
that	1
shineth	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
unto	1
the	1
perfect	1
day.	1
	1
4:19	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
as	1
darkness:	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
stumble.	1
	1
4:20	1
My	1
son,	1
attend	1
to	1
my	1
words;	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
sayings.	1
	1
4:21	1
Let	1
them	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
thine	1
eyes;	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
life	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
find	1
them,	1
and	1
health	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
flesh.	1
	1
4:23	1
Keep	1
thy	1
heart	1
with	1
all	1
diligence;	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
the	1
issues	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
4:24	1
Put	1
away	1
from	1
thee	1
a	1
froward	1
mouth,	1
and	1
perverse	1
lips	1
put	1
far	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
4:25	1
Let	1
thine	1
eyes	1
look	1
right	1
on,	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
eyelids	1
look	1
straight	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
4:26	1
Ponder	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
thy	1
ways	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
4:27	1
Turn	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left:	1
remove	1
thy	1
foot	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
5:1	1
My	1
son,	1
attend	1
unto	1
my	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
bow	1
thine	1
ear	1
to	1
my	1
understanding:	1
5:2	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
regard	1
discretion,	1
and	1
that	1
thy	1
lips	1
may	1
keep	1
knowledge.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
woman	1
drop	1
as	1
an	1
honeycomb,	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
is	1
smoother	1
than	1
oil:	1
5:4	1
But	1
her	1
end	1
is	1
bitter	1
as	1
wormwood,	1
sharp	1
as	1
a	1
two-edged	1
sword.	1
	1
5:5	1
Her	1
feet	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
death;	1
her	1
steps	1
take	1
hold	1
on	1
hell.	1
	1
5:6	1
Lest	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
ponder	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
life,	1
her	1
ways	1
are	1
moveable,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
5:7	1
Hear	1
me	1
now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
ye	1
children,	1
and	1
depart	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
5:8	1
Remove	1
thy	1
way	1
far	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
come	1
not	1
nigh	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
house:	1
5:9	1
Lest	1
thou	1
give	1
thine	1
honour	1
unto	1
others,	1
and	1
thy	1
years	1
unto	1
the	1
cruel:	1
5:10	1
Lest	1
strangers	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
thy	1
wealth;	1
and	1
thy	1
labours	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
stranger;	1
5:11	1
And	1
thou	1
mourn	1
at	1
the	1
last,	1
when	1
thy	1
flesh	1
and	1
thy	1
body	1
are	1
consumed,	1
5:12	1
And	1
say,	1
How	1
have	1
I	1
hated	1
instruction,	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
despised	1
reproof;	1
5:13	1
And	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
teachers,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
mine	1
ear	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
instructed	1
me!	1
	1
5:14	1
I	1
was	1
almost	1
in	1
all	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
assembly.	1
	1
5:15	1
Drink	1
waters	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
cistern,	1
and	1
running	1
waters	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
well.	1
	1
5:16	1
Let	1
thy	1
fountains	1
be	1
dispersed	1
abroad,	1
and	1
rivers	1
of	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
5:17	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
only	1
thine	1
own,	1
and	1
not	1
strangers'	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
5:18	1
Let	1
thy	1
fountain	1
be	1
blessed:	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
thy	1
youth.	1
	1
5:19	1
Let	1
her	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
loving	1
hind	1
and	1
pleasant	1
roe;	1
let	1
her	1
breasts	1
satisfy	1
thee	1
at	1
all	1
times;	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
ravished	1
always	1
with	1
her	1
love.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
why	1
wilt	1
thou,	1
my	1
son,	1
be	1
ravished	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
woman,	1
and	1
embrace	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
a	1
stranger?	1
	1
5:21	1
For	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
man	1
are	1
before	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
pondereth	1
all	1
his	1
goings.	1
	1
5:22	1
His	1
own	1
iniquities	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
wicked	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holden	1
with	1
the	1
cords	1
of	1
his	1
sins.	1
	1
5:23	1
He	1
shall	1
die	1
without	1
instruction;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
folly	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
astray.	1
	1
6:1	1
My	1
son,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
surety	1
for	1
thy	1
friend,	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
stricken	1
thy	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
stranger,	1
6:2	1
Thou	1
art	1
snared	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
thou	1
art	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
6:3	1
Do	1
this	1
now,	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
deliver	1
thyself,	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thy	1
friend;	1
go,	1
humble	1
thyself,	1
and	1
make	1
sure	1
thy	1
friend.	1
	1
6:4	1
Give	1
not	1
sleep	1
to	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
nor	1
slumber	1
to	1
thine	1
eyelids.	1
	1
6:5	1
Deliver	1
thyself	1
as	1
a	1
roe	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
hunter,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
fowler.	1
	1
6:6	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
ant,	1
thou	1
sluggard;	1
consider	1
her	1
ways,	1
and	1
be	1
wise:	1
6:7	1
Which	1
having	1
no	1
guide,	1
overseer,	1
or	1
ruler,	1
6:8	1
Provideth	1
her	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
summer,	1
and	1
gathereth	1
her	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
harvest.	1
	1
6:9	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
sleep,	1
O	1
sluggard?	1
when	1
wilt	1
thou	1
arise	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
sleep?	1
	1
6:10	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
sleep,	1
a	1
little	1
slumber,	1
a	1
little	1
folding	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
sleep:	1
6:11	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
poverty	1
come	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
travelleth,	1
and	1
thy	1
want	1
as	1
an	1
armed	1
man.	1
	1
6:12	1
A	1
naughty	1
person,	1
a	1
wicked	1
man,	1
walketh	1
with	1
a	1
froward	1
mouth.	1
	1
6:13	1
He	1
winketh	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
with	1
his	1
feet,	1
he	1
teacheth	1
with	1
his	1
fingers;	1
6:14	1
Frowardness	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
he	1
deviseth	1
mischief	1
continually;	1
he	1
soweth	1
discord.	1
	1
6:15	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
his	1
calamity	1
come	1
suddenly;	1
suddenly	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
broken	1
without	1
remedy.	1
	1
6:16	1
These	1
six	1
things	1
doth	1
the	1
LORD	1
hate:	1
yea,	1
seven	1
are	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
him:	1
6:17	1
A	1
proud	1
look,	1
a	1
lying	1
tongue,	1
and	1
hands	1
that	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood,	1
6:18	1
An	1
heart	1
that	1
deviseth	1
wicked	1
imaginations,	1
feet	1
that	1
be	1
swift	1
in	1
running	1
to	1
mischief,	1
6:19	1
A	1
false	1
witness	1
that	1
speaketh	1
lies,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
discord	1
among	1
brethren.	1
	1
6:20	1
My	1
son,	1
keep	1
thy	1
father's	1
commandment,	1
and	1
forsake	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
thy	1
mother:	1
6:21	1
Bind	1
them	1
continually	1
upon	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
tie	1
them	1
about	1
thy	1
neck.	1
	1
6:22	1
When	1
thou	1
goest,	1
it	1
shall	1
lead	1
thee;	1
when	1
thou	1
sleepest,	1
it	1
shall	1
keep	1
thee;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
awakest,	1
it	1
shall	1
talk	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
6:23	1
For	1
the	1
commandment	1
is	1
a	1
lamp;	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
light;	1
and	1
reproofs	1
of	1
instruction	1
are	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
life:	1
6:24	1
To	1
keep	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
woman,	1
from	1
the	1
flattery	1
of	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
woman.	1
	1
6:25	1
Lust	1
not	1
after	1
her	1
beauty	1
in	1
thine	1
heart;	1
neither	1
let	1
her	1
take	1
thee	1
with	1
her	1
eyelids.	1
	1
6:26	1
For	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
a	1
whorish	1
woman	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread:	1
and	1
the	1
adultress	1
will	1
hunt	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
life.	1
	1
6:27	1
Can	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
fire	1
in	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and	1
his	1
clothes	1
not	1
be	1
burned?	1
6:28	1
Can	1
one	1
go	1
upon	1
hot	1
coals,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
not	1
be	1
burned?	1
	1
6:29	1
So	1
he	1
that	1
goeth	1
in	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife;	1
whosoever	1
toucheth	1
her	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
innocent.	1
	1
6:30	1
Men	1
do	1
not	1
despise	1
a	1
thief,	1
if	1
he	1
steal	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
soul	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
hungry;	1
6:31	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
found,	1
he	1
shall	1
restore	1
sevenfold;	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
all	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
6:32	1
But	1
whoso	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
lacketh	1
understanding:	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
it	1
destroyeth	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
6:33	1
A	1
wound	1
and	1
dishonour	1
shall	1
he	1
get;	1
and	1
his	1
reproach	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
wiped	1
away.	1
	1
6:34	1
For	1
jealousy	1
is	1
the	1
rage	1
of	1
a	1
man:	1
therefore	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
spare	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
vengeance.	1
	1
6:35	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
regard	1
any	1
ransom;	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
rest	1
content,	1
though	1
thou	1
givest	1
many	1
gifts.	1
	1
7:1	1
My	1
son,	1
keep	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
lay	1
up	1
my	1
commandments	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
7:2	1
Keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
live;	1
and	1
my	1
law	1
as	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
thine	1
eye.	1
	1
7:3	1
Bind	1
them	1
upon	1
thy	1
fingers,	1
write	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
7:4	1
Say	1
unto	1
wisdom,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
sister;	1
and	1
call	1
understanding	1
thy	1
kinswoman:	1
7:5	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
keep	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
strange	1
woman,	1
from	1
the	1
stranger	1
which	1
flattereth	1
with	1
her	1
words.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
my	1
house	1
I	1
looked	1
through	1
my	1
casement,	1
7:7	1
And	1
beheld	1
among	1
the	1
simple	1
ones,	1
I	1
discerned	1
among	1
the	1
youths,	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
void	1
of	1
understanding,	1
7:8	1
Passing	1
through	1
the	1
street	1
near	1
her	1
corner;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
her	1
house,	1
7:9	1
In	1
the	1
twilight,	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
and	1
dark	1
night:	1
7:10	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
the	1
attire	1
of	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
subtil	1
of	1
heart.	1
	1
7:11	1
(She	1
is	1
loud	1
and	1
stubborn;	1
her	1
feet	1
abide	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
house:	1
7:12	1
Now	1
is	1
she	1
without,	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
lieth	1
in	1
wait	1
at	1
every	1
corner.)	1
	1
7:13	1
So	1
she	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
impudent	1
face	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
7:14	1
I	1
have	1
peace	1
offerings	1
with	1
me;	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
payed	1
my	1
vows.	1
	1
7:15	1
Therefore	1
came	1
I	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
thee,	1
diligently	1
to	1
seek	1
thy	1
face,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
thee.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
have	1
decked	1
my	1
bed	1
with	1
coverings	1
of	1
tapestry,	1
with	1
carved	1
works,	1
with	1
fine	1
linen	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:17	1
I	1
have	1
perfumed	1
my	1
bed	1
with	1
myrrh,	1
aloes,	1
and	1
cinnamon.	1
	1
7:18	1
Come,	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
our	1
fill	1
of	1
love	1
until	1
the	1
morning:	1
let	1
us	1
solace	1
ourselves	1
with	1
loves.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
goodman	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
home,	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
a	1
long	1
journey:	1
7:20	1
He	1
hath	1
taken	1
a	1
bag	1
of	1
money	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
home	1
at	1
the	1
day	1
appointed.	1
	1
7:21	1
With	1
her	1
much	1
fair	1
speech	1
she	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
yield,	1
with	1
the	1
flattering	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
she	1
forced	1
him.	1
	1
7:22	1
He	1
goeth	1
after	1
her	1
straightway,	1
as	1
an	1
ox	1
goeth	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
to	1
the	1
correction	1
of	1
the	1
stocks;	1
7:23	1
Till	1
a	1
dart	1
strike	1
through	1
his	1
liver;	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
hasteth	1
to	1
the	1
snare,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
7:24	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
ye	1
children,	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
7:25	1
Let	1
not	1
thine	1
heart	1
decline	1
to	1
her	1
ways,	1
go	1
not	1
astray	1
in	1
her	1
paths.	1
	1
7:26	1
For	1
she	1
hath	1
cast	1
down	1
many	1
wounded:	1
yea,	1
many	1
strong	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
slain	1
by	1
her.	1
	1
7:27	1
Her	1
house	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
hell,	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
chambers	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
8:1	1
Doth	1
not	1
wisdom	1
cry?	1
and	1
understanding	1
put	1
forth	1
her	1
voice?	1
	1
8:2	1
She	1
standeth	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
high	1
places,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
paths.	1
	1
8:3	1
She	1
crieth	1
at	1
the	1
gates,	1
at	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
doors.	1
	1
8:4	1
Unto	1
you,	1
O	1
men,	1
I	1
call;	1
and	1
my	1
voice	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
8:5	1
O	1
ye	1
simple,	1
understand	1
wisdom:	1
and,	1
ye	1
fools,	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
an	1
understanding	1
heart.	1
	1
8:6	1
Hear;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
of	1
excellent	1
things;	1
and	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
my	1
lips	1
shall	1
be	1
right	1
things.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
my	1
mouth	1
shall	1
speak	1
truth;	1
and	1
wickedness	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
to	1
my	1
lips.	1
	1
8:8	1
All	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
are	1
in	1
righteousness;	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
froward	1
or	1
perverse	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
8:9	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
plain	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
understandeth,	1
and	1
right	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
find	1
knowledge.	1
	1
8:10	1
Receive	1
my	1
instruction,	1
and	1
not	1
silver;	1
and	1
knowledge	1
rather	1
than	1
choice	1
gold.	1
	1
8:11	1
For	1
wisdom	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
rubies;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
desired	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
8:12	1
I	1
wisdom	1
dwell	1
with	1
prudence,	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
knowledge	1
of	1
witty	1
inventions.	1
	1
8:13	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
to	1
hate	1
evil:	1
pride,	1
and	1
arrogancy,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
froward	1
mouth,	1
do	1
I	1
hate.	1
	1
8:14	1
Counsel	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
sound	1
wisdom:	1
I	1
am	1
understanding;	1
I	1
have	1
strength.	1
	1
8:15	1
By	1
me	1
kings	1
reign,	1
and	1
princes	1
decree	1
justice.	1
	1
8:16	1
By	1
me	1
princes	1
rule,	1
and	1
nobles,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:17	1
I	1
love	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
me;	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
seek	1
me	1
early	1
shall	1
find	1
me.	1
	1
8:18	1
Riches	1
and	1
honour	1
are	1
with	1
me;	1
yea,	1
durable	1
riches	1
and	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:19	1
My	1
fruit	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
gold,	1
yea,	1
than	1
fine	1
gold;	1
and	1
my	1
revenue	1
than	1
choice	1
silver.	1
	1
8:20	1
I	1
lead	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
judgment:	1
8:21	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
cause	1
those	1
that	1
love	1
me	1
to	1
inherit	1
substance;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
their	1
treasures.	1
	1
8:22	1
The	1
LORD	1
possessed	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
way,	1
before	1
his	1
works	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
8:23	1
I	1
was	1
set	1
up	1
from	1
everlasting,	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
or	1
ever	1
the	1
earth	1
was.	1
	1
8:24	1
When	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
depths,	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
forth;	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
fountains	1
abounding	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
8:25	1
Before	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
settled,	1
before	1
the	1
hills	1
was	1
I	1
brought	1
forth:	1
8:26	1
While	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
the	1
earth,	1
nor	1
the	1
fields,	1
nor	1
the	1
highest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
8:27	1
When	1
he	1
prepared	1
the	1
heavens,	1
I	1
was	1
there:	1
when	1
he	1
set	1
a	1
compass	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
depth:	1
8:28	1
When	1
he	1
established	1
the	1
clouds	1
above:	1
when	1
he	1
strengthened	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
the	1
deep:	1
8:29	1
When	1
he	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
his	1
decree,	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
should	1
not	1
pass	1
his	1
commandment:	1
when	1
he	1
appointed	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
8:30	1
Then	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
him,	1
as	1
one	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
daily	1
his	1
delight,	1
rejoicing	1
always	1
before	1
him;	1
8:31	1
Rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
habitable	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
earth;	1
and	1
my	1
delights	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
8:32	1
Now	1
therefore	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
ye	1
children:	1
for	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
keep	1
my	1
ways.	1
	1
8:33	1
Hear	1
instruction,	1
and	1
be	1
wise,	1
and	1
refuse	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
8:34	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
heareth	1
me,	1
watching	1
daily	1
at	1
my	1
gates,	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
posts	1
of	1
my	1
doors.	1
	1
8:35	1
For	1
whoso	1
findeth	1
me	1
findeth	1
life,	1
and	1
shall	1
obtain	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:36	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
sinneth	1
against	1
me	1
wrongeth	1
his	1
own	1
soul:	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
hate	1
me	1
love	1
death.	1
	1
9:1	1
Wisdom	1
hath	1
builded	1
her	1
house,	1
she	1
hath	1
hewn	1
out	1
her	1
seven	1
pillars:	1
9:2	1
She	1
hath	1
killed	1
her	1
beasts;	1
she	1
hath	1
mingled	1
her	1
wine;	1
she	1
hath	1
also	1
furnished	1
her	1
table.	1
	1
9:3	1
She	1
hath	1
sent	1
forth	1
her	1
maidens:	1
she	1
crieth	1
upon	1
the	1
highest	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
9:4	1
Whoso	1
is	1
simple,	1
let	1
him	1
turn	1
in	1
hither:	1
as	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
wanteth	1
understanding,	1
she	1
saith	1
to	1
him,	1
9:5	1
Come,	1
eat	1
of	1
my	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
mingled.	1
	1
9:6	1
Forsake	1
the	1
foolish,	1
and	1
live;	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
understanding.	1
	1
9:7	1
He	1
that	1
reproveth	1
a	1
scorner	1
getteth	1
to	1
himself	1
shame:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
rebuketh	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
getteth	1
himself	1
a	1
blot.	1
	1
9:8	1
Reprove	1
not	1
a	1
scorner,	1
lest	1
he	1
hate	1
thee:	1
rebuke	1
a	1
wise	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
love	1
thee.	1
	1
9:9	1
Give	1
instruction	1
to	1
a	1
wise	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
yet	1
wiser:	1
teach	1
a	1
just	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
increase	1
in	1
learning.	1
	1
9:10	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
wisdom:	1
and	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
is	1
understanding.	1
	1
9:11	1
For	1
by	1
me	1
thy	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
multiplied,	1
and	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
thy	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
increased.	1
	1
9:12	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
wise,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
wise	1
for	1
thyself:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
scornest,	1
thou	1
alone	1
shalt	1
bear	1
it.	1
	1
9:13	1
A	1
foolish	1
woman	1
is	1
clamorous:	1
she	1
is	1
simple,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
nothing.	1
	1
9:14	1
For	1
she	1
sitteth	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
house,	1
on	1
a	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
9:15	1
To	1
call	1
passengers	1
who	1
go	1
right	1
on	1
their	1
ways:	1
9:16	1
Whoso	1
is	1
simple,	1
let	1
him	1
turn	1
in	1
hither:	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
wanteth	1
understanding,	1
she	1
saith	1
to	1
him,	1
9:17	1
Stolen	1
waters	1
are	1
sweet,	1
and	1
bread	1
eaten	1
in	1
secret	1
is	1
pleasant.	1
	1
9:18	1
But	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
there;	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
guests	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
hell.	1
	1
10:1	1
The	1
proverbs	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
A	1
wise	1
son	1
maketh	1
a	1
glad	1
father:	1
but	1
a	1
foolish	1
son	1
is	1
the	1
heaviness	1
of	1
his	1
mother.	1
	1
10:2	1
Treasures	1
of	1
wickedness	1
profit	1
nothing:	1
but	1
righteousness	1
delivereth	1
from	1
death.	1
	1
10:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
to	1
famish:	1
but	1
he	1
casteth	1
away	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
10:4	1
He	1
becometh	1
poor	1
that	1
dealeth	1
with	1
a	1
slack	1
hand:	1
but	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
diligent	1
maketh	1
rich.	1
	1
10:5	1
He	1
that	1
gathereth	1
in	1
summer	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
son:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sleepeth	1
in	1
harvest	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
that	1
causeth	1
shame.	1
	1
10:6	1
Blessings	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
just:	1
but	1
violence	1
covereth	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
10:7	1
The	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
is	1
blessed:	1
but	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
rot.	1
	1
10:8	1
The	1
wise	1
in	1
heart	1
will	1
receive	1
commandments:	1
but	1
a	1
prating	1
fool	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
10:9	1
He	1
that	1
walketh	1
uprightly	1
walketh	1
surely:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
perverteth	1
his	1
ways	1
shall	1
be	1
known.	1
	1
10:10	1
He	1
that	1
winketh	1
with	1
the	1
eye	1
causeth	1
sorrow:	1
but	1
a	1
prating	1
fool	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
10:11	1
The	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
life:	1
but	1
violence	1
covereth	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
10:12	1
Hatred	1
stirreth	1
up	1
strifes:	1
but	1
love	1
covereth	1
all	1
sins.	1
	1
10:13	1
In	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding	1
wisdom	1
is	1
found:	1
but	1
a	1
rod	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
void	1
of	1
understanding.	1
	1
10:14	1
Wise	1
men	1
lay	1
up	1
knowledge:	1
but	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
foolish	1
is	1
near	1
destruction.	1
	1
10:15	1
The	1
rich	1
man's	1
wealth	1
is	1
his	1
strong	1
city:	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
is	1
their	1
poverty.	1
	1
10:16	1
The	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
tendeth	1
to	1
life:	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
10:17	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
keepeth	1
instruction:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
refuseth	1
reproof	1
erreth.	1
	1
10:18	1
He	1
that	1
hideth	1
hatred	1
with	1
lying	1
lips,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
uttereth	1
a	1
slander,	1
is	1
a	1
fool.	1
	1
10:19	1
In	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
words	1
there	1
wanteth	1
not	1
sin:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
refraineth	1
his	1
lips	1
is	1
wise.	1
	1
10:20	1
The	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
is	1
as	1
choice	1
silver:	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
little	1
worth.	1
	1
10:21	1
The	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
feed	1
many:	1
but	1
fools	1
die	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
wisdom.	1
	1
10:22	1
The	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
it	1
maketh	1
rich,	1
and	1
he	1
addeth	1
no	1
sorrow	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
10:23	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
sport	1
to	1
a	1
fool	1
to	1
do	1
mischief:	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding	1
hath	1
wisdom.	1
	1
10:24	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
granted.	1
	1
10:25	1
As	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
passeth,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
wicked	1
no	1
more:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
foundation.	1
	1
10:26	1
As	1
vinegar	1
to	1
the	1
teeth,	1
and	1
as	1
smoke	1
to	1
the	1
eyes,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
sluggard	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
send	1
him.	1
	1
10:27	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
prolongeth	1
days:	1
but	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
shortened.	1
	1
10:28	1
The	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
gladness:	1
but	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
10:29	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
upright:	1
but	1
destruction	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
10:30	1
The	1
righteous	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
removed:	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
not	1
inhabit	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
10:31	1
The	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
wisdom:	1
but	1
the	1
froward	1
tongue	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
out.	1
	1
10:32	1
The	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
acceptable:	1
but	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
speaketh	1
frowardness.	1
	1
11:1	1
A	1
false	1
balance	1
is	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
a	1
just	1
weight	1
is	1
his	1
delight.	1
	1
11:2	1
When	1
pride	1
cometh,	1
then	1
cometh	1
shame:	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
lowly	1
is	1
wisdom.	1
	1
11:3	1
The	1
integrity	1
of	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
guide	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
perverseness	1
of	1
transgressors	1
shall	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
Riches	1
profit	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
wrath:	1
but	1
righteousness	1
delivereth	1
from	1
death.	1
	1
11:5	1
The	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
perfect	1
shall	1
direct	1
his	1
way:	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
wickedness.	1
	1
11:6	1
The	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
deliver	1
them:	1
but	1
transgressors	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
naughtiness.	1
	1
11:7	1
When	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
dieth,	1
his	1
expectation	1
shall	1
perish:	1
and	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
unjust	1
men	1
perisheth.	1
	1
11:8	1
The	1
righteous	1
is	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
trouble,	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
cometh	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
11:9	1
An	1
hypocrite	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
destroyeth	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
but	1
through	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
the	1
just	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
11:10	1
When	1
it	1
goeth	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
righteous,	1
the	1
city	1
rejoiceth:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
wicked	1
perish,	1
there	1
is	1
shouting.	1
	1
11:11	1
By	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
upright	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
exalted:	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
overthrown	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
11:12	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
void	1
of	1
wisdom	1
despiseth	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding	1
holdeth	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
11:13	1
A	1
talebearer	1
revealeth	1
secrets:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
faithful	1
spirit	1
concealeth	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
11:14	1
Where	1
no	1
counsel	1
is,	1
the	1
people	1
fall:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
counsellors	1
there	1
is	1
safety.	1
	1
11:15	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
surety	1
for	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
smart	1
for	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
suretiship	1
is	1
sure.	1
	1
11:16	1
A	1
gracious	1
woman	1
retaineth	1
honour:	1
and	1
strong	1
men	1
retain	1
riches.	1
	1
11:17	1
The	1
merciful	1
man	1
doeth	1
good	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
soul:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
cruel	1
troubleth	1
his	1
own	1
flesh.	1
	1
11:18	1
The	1
wicked	1
worketh	1
a	1
deceitful	1
work:	1
but	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
soweth	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sure	1
reward.	1
	1
11:19	1
As	1
righteousness	1
tendeth	1
to	1
life:	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
pursueth	1
evil	1
pursueth	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
death.	1
	1
11:20	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
froward	1
heart	1
are	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
upright	1
in	1
their	1
way	1
are	1
his	1
delight.	1
	1
11:21	1
Though	1
hand	1
join	1
in	1
hand,	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unpunished:	1
but	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
11:22	1
As	1
a	1
jewel	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
a	1
swine's	1
snout,	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
fair	1
woman	1
which	1
is	1
without	1
discretion.	1
	1
11:23	1
The	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
is	1
only	1
good:	1
but	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
wrath.	1
	1
11:24	1
There	1
is	1
that	1
scattereth,	1
and	1
yet	1
increaseth;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
withholdeth	1
more	1
than	1
is	1
meet,	1
but	1
it	1
tendeth	1
to	1
poverty.	1
	1
11:25	1
The	1
liberal	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
fat:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
watereth	1
shall	1
be	1
watered	1
also	1
himself.	1
	1
11:26	1
He	1
that	1
withholdeth	1
corn,	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
curse	1
him:	1
but	1
blessing	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
selleth	1
it.	1
	1
11:27	1
He	1
that	1
diligently	1
seeketh	1
good	1
procureth	1
favour:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
mischief,	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:28	1
He	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
his	1
riches	1
shall	1
fall;	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
flourish	1
as	1
a	1
branch.	1
	1
11:29	1
He	1
that	1
troubleth	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
wind:	1
and	1
the	1
fool	1
shall	1
be	1
servant	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
of	1
heart.	1
	1
11:30	1
The	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
is	1
a	1
tree	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
winneth	1
souls	1
is	1
wise.	1
	1
11:31	1
Behold,	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
recompensed	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
much	1
more	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
the	1
sinner.	1
	1
12:1	1
Whoso	1
loveth	1
instruction	1
loveth	1
knowledge:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
reproof	1
is	1
brutish.	1
	1
12:2	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
obtaineth	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
wicked	1
devices	1
will	1
he	1
condemn.	1
	1
12:3	1
A	1
man	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
established	1
by	1
wickedness:	1
but	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
12:4	1
A	1
virtuous	1
woman	1
is	1
a	1
crown	1
to	1
her	1
husband:	1
but	1
she	1
that	1
maketh	1
ashamed	1
is	1
as	1
rottenness	1
in	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
12:5	1
The	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
are	1
right:	1
but	1
the	1
counsels	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
deceit.	1
	1
12:6	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
blood:	1
but	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
deliver	1
them.	1
	1
12:7	1
The	1
wicked	1
are	1
overthrown,	1
and	1
are	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
stand.	1
	1
12:8	1
A	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
commended	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
wisdom:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
perverse	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
despised.	1
	1
12:9	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
despised,	1
and	1
hath	1
a	1
servant,	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
honoureth	1
himself,	1
and	1
lacketh	1
bread.	1
	1
12:10	1
A	1
righteous	1
man	1
regardeth	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
beast:	1
but	1
the	1
tender	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
cruel.	1
	1
12:11	1
He	1
that	1
tilleth	1
his	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
bread:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
followeth	1
vain	1
persons	1
is	1
void	1
of	1
understanding.	1
	1
12:12	1
The	1
wicked	1
desireth	1
the	1
net	1
of	1
evil	1
men:	1
but	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
yieldeth	1
fruit.	1
	1
12:13	1
The	1
wicked	1
is	1
snared	1
by	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
his	1
lips:	1
but	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
12:14	1
A	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
good	1
by	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
the	1
recompence	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
hands	1
shall	1
be	1
rendered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
12:15	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
hearkeneth	1
unto	1
counsel	1
is	1
wise.	1
	1
12:16	1
A	1
fool's	1
wrath	1
is	1
presently	1
known:	1
but	1
a	1
prudent	1
man	1
covereth	1
shame.	1
	1
12:17	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
truth	1
sheweth	1
forth	1
righteousness:	1
but	1
a	1
false	1
witness	1
deceit.	1
	1
12:18	1
There	1
is	1
that	1
speaketh	1
like	1
the	1
piercings	1
of	1
a	1
sword:	1
but	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
is	1
health.	1
	1
12:19	1
The	1
lip	1
of	1
truth	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
a	1
lying	1
tongue	1
is	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
12:20	1
Deceit	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
imagine	1
evil:	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
counsellors	1
of	1
peace	1
is	1
joy.	1
	1
12:21	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
evil	1
happen	1
to	1
the	1
just:	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
mischief.	1
	1
12:22	1
Lying	1
lips	1
are	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
deal	1
truly	1
are	1
his	1
delight.	1
	1
12:23	1
A	1
prudent	1
man	1
concealeth	1
knowledge:	1
but	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
fools	1
proclaimeth	1
foolishness.	1
	1
12:24	1
The	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
diligent	1
shall	1
bear	1
rule:	1
but	1
the	1
slothful	1
shall	1
be	1
under	1
tribute.	1
	1
12:25	1
Heaviness	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man	1
maketh	1
it	1
stoop:	1
but	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
maketh	1
it	1
glad.	1
	1
12:26	1
The	1
righteous	1
is	1
more	1
excellent	1
than	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
but	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
seduceth	1
them.	1
	1
12:27	1
The	1
slothful	1
man	1
roasteth	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
in	1
hunting:	1
but	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
a	1
diligent	1
man	1
is	1
precious.	1
	1
12:28	1
In	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
life:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
pathway	1
thereof	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
death.	1
	1
13:1	1
A	1
wise	1
son	1
heareth	1
his	1
father's	1
instruction:	1
but	1
a	1
scorner	1
heareth	1
not	1
rebuke.	1
	1
13:2	1
A	1
man	1
shall	1
eat	1
good	1
by	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
but	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
transgressors	1
shall	1
eat	1
violence.	1
	1
13:3	1
He	1
that	1
keepeth	1
his	1
mouth	1
keepeth	1
his	1
life:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
openeth	1
wide	1
his	1
lips	1
shall	1
have	1
destruction.	1
	1
13:4	1
The	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
sluggard	1
desireth,	1
and	1
hath	1
nothing:	1
but	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
diligent	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
fat.	1
	1
13:5	1
A	1
righteous	1
man	1
hateth	1
lying:	1
but	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
is	1
loathsome,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
shame.	1
	1
13:6	1
Righteousness	1
keepeth	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
upright	1
in	1
the	1
way:	1
but	1
wickedness	1
overthroweth	1
the	1
sinner.	1
	1
13:7	1
There	1
is	1
that	1
maketh	1
himself	1
rich,	1
yet	1
hath	1
nothing:	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
maketh	1
himself	1
poor,	1
yet	1
hath	1
great	1
riches.	1
	1
13:8	1
The	1
ransom	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
life	1
are	1
his	1
riches:	1
but	1
the	1
poor	1
heareth	1
not	1
rebuke.	1
	1
13:9	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
rejoiceth:	1
but	1
the	1
lamp	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
out.	1
	1
13:10	1
Only	1
by	1
pride	1
cometh	1
contention:	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
well	1
advised	1
is	1
wisdom.	1
	1
13:11	1
Wealth	1
gotten	1
by	1
vanity	1
shall	1
be	1
diminished:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
by	1
labour	1
shall	1
increase.	1
	1
13:12	1
Hope	1
deferred	1
maketh	1
the	1
heart	1
sick:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
desire	1
cometh,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
tree	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
13:13	1
Whoso	1
despiseth	1
the	1
word	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
feareth	1
the	1
commandment	1
shall	1
be	1
rewarded.	1
	1
13:14	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
is	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
life,	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
snares	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
13:15	1
Good	1
understanding	1
giveth	1
favour:	1
but	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
transgressors	1
is	1
hard.	1
	1
13:16	1
Every	1
prudent	1
man	1
dealeth	1
with	1
knowledge:	1
but	1
a	1
fool	1
layeth	1
open	1
his	1
folly.	1
	1
13:17	1
A	1
wicked	1
messenger	1
falleth	1
into	1
mischief:	1
but	1
a	1
faithful	1
ambassador	1
is	1
health.	1
	1
13:18	1
Poverty	1
and	1
shame	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
refuseth	1
instruction:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
regardeth	1
reproof	1
shall	1
be	1
honoured.	1
	1
13:19	1
The	1
desire	1
accomplished	1
is	1
sweet	1
to	1
the	1
soul:	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
abomination	1
to	1
fools	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
13:20	1
He	1
that	1
walketh	1
with	1
wise	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
wise:	1
but	1
a	1
companion	1
of	1
fools	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
13:21	1
Evil	1
pursueth	1
sinners:	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
righteous	1
good	1
shall	1
be	1
repayed.	1
	1
13:22	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
leaveth	1
an	1
inheritance	1
to	1
his	1
children's	1
children:	1
and	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
sinner	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
just.	1
	1
13:23	1
Much	1
food	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
tillage	1
of	1
the	1
poor:	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
is	1
destroyed	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
judgment.	1
	1
13:24	1
He	1
that	1
spareth	1
his	1
rod	1
hateth	1
his	1
son:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
him	1
chasteneth	1
him	1
betimes.	1
	1
13:25	1
The	1
righteous	1
eateth	1
to	1
the	1
satisfying	1
of	1
his	1
soul:	1
but	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
want.	1
	1
14:1	1
Every	1
wise	1
woman	1
buildeth	1
her	1
house:	1
but	1
the	1
foolish	1
plucketh	1
it	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
14:2	1
He	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
his	1
uprightness	1
feareth	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
perverse	1
in	1
his	1
ways	1
despiseth	1
him.	1
	1
14:3	1
In	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
foolish	1
is	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
pride:	1
but	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
shall	1
preserve	1
them.	1
	1
14:4	1
Where	1
no	1
oxen	1
are,	1
the	1
crib	1
is	1
clean:	1
but	1
much	1
increase	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
ox.	1
	1
14:5	1
A	1
faithful	1
witness	1
will	1
not	1
lie:	1
but	1
a	1
false	1
witness	1
will	1
utter	1
lies.	1
	1
14:6	1
A	1
scorner	1
seeketh	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
findeth	1
it	1
not:	1
but	1
knowledge	1
is	1
easy	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
understandeth.	1
	1
14:7	1
Go	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
foolish	1
man,	1
when	1
thou	1
perceivest	1
not	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
knowledge.	1
	1
14:8	1
The	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
prudent	1
is	1
to	1
understand	1
his	1
way:	1
but	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
fools	1
is	1
deceit.	1
	1
14:9	1
Fools	1
make	1
a	1
mock	1
at	1
sin:	1
but	1
among	1
the	1
righteous	1
there	1
is	1
favour.	1
	1
14:10	1
The	1
heart	1
knoweth	1
his	1
own	1
bitterness;	1
and	1
a	1
stranger	1
doth	1
not	1
intermeddle	1
with	1
his	1
joy.	1
	1
14:11	1
The	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
overthrown:	1
but	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
flourish.	1
	1
14:12	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
way	1
which	1
seemeth	1
right	1
unto	1
a	1
man,	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
are	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
14:13	1
Even	1
in	1
laughter	1
the	1
heart	1
is	1
sorrowful;	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
mirth	1
is	1
heaviness.	1
	1
14:14	1
The	1
backslider	1
in	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
ways:	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
from	1
himself.	1
	1
14:15	1
The	1
simple	1
believeth	1
every	1
word:	1
but	1
the	1
prudent	1
man	1
looketh	1
well	1
to	1
his	1
going.	1
	1
14:16	1
A	1
wise	1
man	1
feareth,	1
and	1
departeth	1
from	1
evil:	1
but	1
the	1
fool	1
rageth,	1
and	1
is	1
confident.	1
	1
14:17	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
soon	1
angry	1
dealeth	1
foolishly:	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
wicked	1
devices	1
is	1
hated.	1
	1
14:18	1
The	1
simple	1
inherit	1
folly:	1
but	1
the	1
prudent	1
are	1
crowned	1
with	1
knowledge.	1
	1
14:19	1
The	1
evil	1
bow	1
before	1
the	1
good;	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
14:20	1
The	1
poor	1
is	1
hated	1
even	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
neighbour:	1
but	1
the	1
rich	1
hath	1
many	1
friends.	1
	1
14:21	1
He	1
that	1
despiseth	1
his	1
neighbour	1
sinneth:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
mercy	1
on	1
the	1
poor,	1
happy	1
is	1
he.	1
	1
14:22	1
Do	1
they	1
not	1
err	1
that	1
devise	1
evil?	1
but	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
devise	1
good.	1
	1
14:23	1
In	1
all	1
labour	1
there	1
is	1
profit:	1
but	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
lips	1
tendeth	1
only	1
to	1
penury.	1
	1
14:24	1
The	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
is	1
their	1
riches:	1
but	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
fools	1
is	1
folly.	1
	1
14:25	1
A	1
true	1
witness	1
delivereth	1
souls:	1
but	1
a	1
deceitful	1
witness	1
speaketh	1
lies.	1
	1
14:26	1
In	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
strong	1
confidence:	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
refuge.	1
	1
14:27	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
life,	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
snares	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
14:28	1
In	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
people	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
honour:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
people	1
is	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
14:29	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
slow	1
to	1
wrath	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
understanding:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
hasty	1
of	1
spirit	1
exalteth	1
folly.	1
	1
14:30	1
A	1
sound	1
heart	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
flesh:	1
but	1
envy	1
the	1
rottenness	1
of	1
the	1
bones.	1
	1
14:31	1
He	1
that	1
oppresseth	1
the	1
poor	1
reproacheth	1
his	1
Maker:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
honoureth	1
him	1
hath	1
mercy	1
on	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
14:32	1
The	1
wicked	1
is	1
driven	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
wickedness:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
hath	1
hope	1
in	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
14:33	1
Wisdom	1
resteth	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding:	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
fools	1
is	1
made	1
known.	1
	1
14:34	1
Righteousness	1
exalteth	1
a	1
nation:	1
but	1
sin	1
is	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
any	1
people.	1
	1
14:35	1
The	1
king's	1
favour	1
is	1
toward	1
a	1
wise	1
servant:	1
but	1
his	1
wrath	1
is	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
causeth	1
shame.	1
	1
15:1	1
A	1
soft	1
answer	1
turneth	1
away	1
wrath:	1
but	1
grievous	1
words	1
stir	1
up	1
anger.	1
	1
15:2	1
The	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
useth	1
knowledge	1
aright:	1
but	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
fools	1
poureth	1
out	1
foolishness.	1
	1
15:3	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
in	1
every	1
place,	1
beholding	1
the	1
evil	1
and	1
the	1
good.	1
	1
15:4	1
A	1
wholesome	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
tree	1
of	1
life:	1
but	1
perverseness	1
therein	1
is	1
a	1
breach	1
in	1
the	1
spirit.	1
	1
15:5	1
A	1
fool	1
despiseth	1
his	1
father's	1
instruction:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
regardeth	1
reproof	1
is	1
prudent.	1
	1
15:6	1
In	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
is	1
much	1
treasure:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
revenues	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
trouble.	1
	1
15:7	1
The	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
disperse	1
knowledge:	1
but	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
foolish	1
doeth	1
not	1
so.	1
	1
15:8	1
The	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
the	1
upright	1
is	1
his	1
delight.	1
	1
15:9	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
he	1
loveth	1
him	1
that	1
followeth	1
after	1
righteousness.	1
	1
15:10	1
Correction	1
is	1
grievous	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
forsaketh	1
the	1
way:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
reproof	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
15:11	1
Hell	1
and	1
destruction	1
are	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
then	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men?	1
	1
15:12	1
A	1
scorner	1
loveth	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
reproveth	1
him:	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
wise.	1
	1
15:13	1
A	1
merry	1
heart	1
maketh	1
a	1
cheerful	1
countenance:	1
but	1
by	1
sorrow	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
the	1
spirit	1
is	1
broken.	1
	1
15:14	1
The	1
heart	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding	1
seeketh	1
knowledge:	1
but	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
fools	1
feedeth	1
on	1
foolishness.	1
	1
15:15	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
afflicted	1
are	1
evil:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
merry	1
heart	1
hath	1
a	1
continual	1
feast.	1
	1
15:16	1
Better	1
is	1
little	1
with	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
than	1
great	1
treasure	1
and	1
trouble	1
therewith.	1
	1
15:17	1
Better	1
is	1
a	1
dinner	1
of	1
herbs	1
where	1
love	1
is,	1
than	1
a	1
stalled	1
ox	1
and	1
hatred	1
therewith.	1
	1
15:18	1
A	1
wrathful	1
man	1
stirreth	1
up	1
strife:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
slow	1
to	1
anger	1
appeaseth	1
strife.	1
	1
15:19	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
slothful	1
man	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
hedge	1
of	1
thorns:	1
but	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
is	1
made	1
plain.	1
	1
15:20	1
A	1
wise	1
son	1
maketh	1
a	1
glad	1
father:	1
but	1
a	1
foolish	1
man	1
despiseth	1
his	1
mother.	1
	1
15:21	1
Folly	1
is	1
joy	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
destitute	1
of	1
wisdom:	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding	1
walketh	1
uprightly.	1
	1
15:22	1
Without	1
counsel	1
purposes	1
are	1
disappointed:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
counsellors	1
they	1
are	1
established.	1
	1
15:23	1
A	1
man	1
hath	1
joy	1
by	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
a	1
word	1
spoken	1
in	1
due	1
season,	1
how	1
good	1
is	1
it!	1
	1
15:24	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
above	1
to	1
the	1
wise,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
depart	1
from	1
hell	1
beneath.	1
	1
15:25	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
proud:	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
establish	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
widow.	1
	1
15:26	1
The	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
an	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
pure	1
are	1
pleasant	1
words.	1
	1
15:27	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
greedy	1
of	1
gain	1
troubleth	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
gifts	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
15:28	1
The	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
studieth	1
to	1
answer:	1
but	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
poureth	1
out	1
evil	1
things.	1
	1
15:29	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
wicked:	1
but	1
he	1
heareth	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
15:30	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
rejoiceth	1
the	1
heart:	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
maketh	1
the	1
bones	1
fat.	1
	1
15:31	1
The	1
ear	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
reproof	1
of	1
life	1
abideth	1
among	1
the	1
wise.	1
	1
15:32	1
He	1
that	1
refuseth	1
instruction	1
despiseth	1
his	1
own	1
soul:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
reproof	1
getteth	1
understanding.	1
	1
15:33	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
instruction	1
of	1
wisdom;	1
and	1
before	1
honour	1
is	1
humility.	1
	1
16:1	1
The	1
preparations	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
in	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
the	1
tongue,	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:2	1
All	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
are	1
clean	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
weigheth	1
the	1
spirits.	1
	1
16:3	1
Commit	1
thy	1
works	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
shall	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
16:4	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
himself:	1
yea,	1
even	1
the	1
wicked	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
16:5	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
proud	1
in	1
heart	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
though	1
hand	1
join	1
in	1
hand,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unpunished.	1
	1
16:6	1
By	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
iniquity	1
is	1
purged:	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
men	1
depart	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
16:7	1
When	1
a	1
man's	1
ways	1
please	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
maketh	1
even	1
his	1
enemies	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
16:8	1
Better	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
with	1
righteousness	1
than	1
great	1
revenues	1
without	1
right.	1
	1
16:9	1
A	1
man's	1
heart	1
deviseth	1
his	1
way:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
directeth	1
his	1
steps.	1
	1
16:10	1
A	1
divine	1
sentence	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
king:	1
his	1
mouth	1
transgresseth	1
not	1
in	1
judgment.	1
	1
16:11	1
A	1
just	1
weight	1
and	1
balance	1
are	1
the	1
LORD's:	1
all	1
the	1
weights	1
of	1
the	1
bag	1
are	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
16:12	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
to	1
kings	1
to	1
commit	1
wickedness:	1
for	1
the	1
throne	1
is	1
established	1
by	1
righteousness.	1
	1
16:13	1
Righteous	1
lips	1
are	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
kings;	1
and	1
they	1
love	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
right.	1
	1
16:14	1
The	1
wrath	1
of	1
a	1
king	1
is	1
as	1
messengers	1
of	1
death:	1
but	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
will	1
pacify	1
it.	1
	1
16:15	1
In	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
countenance	1
is	1
life;	1
and	1
his	1
favour	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
rain.	1
	1
16:16	1
How	1
much	1
better	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
get	1
wisdom	1
than	1
gold!	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
understanding	1
rather	1
to	1
be	1
chosen	1
than	1
silver!	1
	1
16:17	1
The	1
highway	1
of	1
the	1
upright	1
is	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
evil:	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
his	1
way	1
preserveth	1
his	1
soul.	1
	1
16:18	1
Pride	1
goeth	1
before	1
destruction,	1
and	1
an	1
haughty	1
spirit	1
before	1
a	1
fall.	1
	1
16:19	1
Better	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
an	1
humble	1
spirit	1
with	1
the	1
lowly,	1
than	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil	1
with	1
the	1
proud.	1
	1
16:20	1
He	1
that	1
handleth	1
a	1
matter	1
wisely	1
shall	1
find	1
good:	1
and	1
whoso	1
trusteth	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
happy	1
is	1
he.	1
	1
16:21	1
The	1
wise	1
in	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
prudent:	1
and	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
the	1
lips	1
increaseth	1
learning.	1
	1
16:22	1
Understanding	1
is	1
a	1
wellspring	1
of	1
life	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
it:	1
but	1
the	1
instruction	1
of	1
fools	1
is	1
folly.	1
	1
16:23	1
The	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
teacheth	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
addeth	1
learning	1
to	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
16:24	1
Pleasant	1
words	1
are	1
as	1
an	1
honeycomb,	1
sweet	1
to	1
the	1
soul,	1
and	1
health	1
to	1
the	1
bones.	1
	1
16:25	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
seemeth	1
right	1
unto	1
a	1
man,	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
are	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
16:26	1
He	1
that	1
laboureth	1
laboureth	1
for	1
himself;	1
for	1
his	1
mouth	1
craveth	1
it	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
16:27	1
An	1
ungodly	1
man	1
diggeth	1
up	1
evil:	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
lips	1
there	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
burning	1
fire.	1
	1
16:28	1
A	1
froward	1
man	1
soweth	1
strife:	1
and	1
a	1
whisperer	1
separateth	1
chief	1
friends.	1
	1
16:29	1
A	1
violent	1
man	1
enticeth	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
leadeth	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
good.	1
	1
16:30	1
He	1
shutteth	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
devise	1
froward	1
things:	1
moving	1
his	1
lips	1
he	1
bringeth	1
evil	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
16:31	1
The	1
hoary	1
head	1
is	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
16:32	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
slow	1
to	1
anger	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
mighty;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
ruleth	1
his	1
spirit	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
taketh	1
a	1
city.	1
	1
16:33	1
The	1
lot	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lap;	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
disposing	1
thereof	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:1	1
Better	1
is	1
a	1
dry	1
morsel,	1
and	1
quietness	1
therewith,	1
than	1
an	1
house	1
full	1
of	1
sacrifices	1
with	1
strife.	1
	1
17:2	1
A	1
wise	1
servant	1
shall	1
have	1
rule	1
over	1
a	1
son	1
that	1
causeth	1
shame,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
among	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
17:3	1
The	1
fining	1
pot	1
is	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
furnace	1
for	1
gold:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
trieth	1
the	1
hearts.	1
	1
17:4	1
A	1
wicked	1
doer	1
giveth	1
heed	1
to	1
false	1
lips;	1
and	1
a	1
liar	1
giveth	1
ear	1
to	1
a	1
naughty	1
tongue.	1
	1
17:5	1
Whoso	1
mocketh	1
the	1
poor	1
reproacheth	1
his	1
Maker:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
glad	1
at	1
calamities	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unpunished.	1
	1
17:6	1
Children's	1
children	1
are	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
old	1
men;	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
children	1
are	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
17:7	1
Excellent	1
speech	1
becometh	1
not	1
a	1
fool:	1
much	1
less	1
do	1
lying	1
lips	1
a	1
prince.	1
	1
17:8	1
A	1
gift	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
precious	1
stone	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
it:	1
whithersoever	1
it	1
turneth,	1
it	1
prospereth.	1
	1
17:9	1
He	1
that	1
covereth	1
a	1
transgression	1
seeketh	1
love;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
repeateth	1
a	1
matter	1
separateth	1
very	1
friends.	1
	1
17:10	1
A	1
reproof	1
entereth	1
more	1
into	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
than	1
an	1
hundred	1
stripes	1
into	1
a	1
fool.	1
	1
17:11	1
An	1
evil	1
man	1
seeketh	1
only	1
rebellion:	1
therefore	1
a	1
cruel	1
messenger	1
shall	1
be	1
sent	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
17:12	1
Let	1
a	1
bear	1
robbed	1
of	1
her	1
whelps	1
meet	1
a	1
man,	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
his	1
folly.	1
	1
17:13	1
Whoso	1
rewardeth	1
evil	1
for	1
good,	1
evil	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
17:14	1
The	1
beginning	1
of	1
strife	1
is	1
as	1
when	1
one	1
letteth	1
out	1
water:	1
therefore	1
leave	1
off	1
contention,	1
before	1
it	1
be	1
meddled	1
with.	1
	1
17:15	1
He	1
that	1
justifieth	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth	1
the	1
just,	1
even	1
they	1
both	1
are	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:16	1
Wherefore	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
price	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
to	1
get	1
wisdom,	1
seeing	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
heart	1
to	1
it?	1
	1
17:17	1
A	1
friend	1
loveth	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
and	1
a	1
brother	1
is	1
born	1
for	1
adversity.	1
	1
17:18	1
A	1
man	1
void	1
of	1
understanding	1
striketh	1
hands,	1
and	1
becometh	1
surety	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
friend.	1
	1
17:19	1
He	1
loveth	1
transgression	1
that	1
loveth	1
strife:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
exalteth	1
his	1
gate	1
seeketh	1
destruction.	1
	1
17:20	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
froward	1
heart	1
findeth	1
no	1
good:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
perverse	1
tongue	1
falleth	1
into	1
mischief.	1
	1
17:21	1
He	1
that	1
begetteth	1
a	1
fool	1
doeth	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
sorrow:	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
hath	1
no	1
joy.	1
	1
17:22	1
A	1
merry	1
heart	1
doeth	1
good	1
like	1
a	1
medicine:	1
but	1
a	1
broken	1
spirit	1
drieth	1
the	1
bones.	1
	1
17:23	1
A	1
wicked	1
man	1
taketh	1
a	1
gift	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bosom	1
to	1
pervert	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
judgment.	1
	1
17:24	1
Wisdom	1
is	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding;	1
but	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
17:25	1
A	1
foolish	1
son	1
is	1
a	1
grief	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
bitterness	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
bare	1
him.	1
	1
17:26	1
Also	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
just	1
is	1
not	1
good,	1
nor	1
to	1
strike	1
princes	1
for	1
equity.	1
	1
17:27	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
knowledge	1
spareth	1
his	1
words:	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding	1
is	1
of	1
an	1
excellent	1
spirit.	1
	1
17:28	1
Even	1
a	1
fool,	1
when	1
he	1
holdeth	1
his	1
peace,	1
is	1
counted	1
wise:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shutteth	1
his	1
lips	1
is	1
esteemed	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding.	1
	1
18:1	1
Through	1
desire	1
a	1
man,	1
having	1
separated	1
himself,	1
seeketh	1
and	1
intermeddleth	1
with	1
all	1
wisdom.	1
	1
18:2	1
A	1
fool	1
hath	1
no	1
delight	1
in	1
understanding,	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
may	1
discover	1
itself.	1
	1
18:3	1
When	1
the	1
wicked	1
cometh,	1
then	1
cometh	1
also	1
contempt,	1
and	1
with	1
ignominy	1
reproach.	1
	1
18:4	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
mouth	1
are	1
as	1
deep	1
waters,	1
and	1
the	1
wellspring	1
of	1
wisdom	1
as	1
a	1
flowing	1
brook.	1
	1
18:5	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
to	1
overthrow	1
the	1
righteous	1
in	1
judgment.	1
	1
18:6	1
A	1
fool's	1
lips	1
enter	1
into	1
contention,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
calleth	1
for	1
strokes.	1
	1
18:7	1
A	1
fool's	1
mouth	1
is	1
his	1
destruction,	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
are	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
his	1
soul.	1
	1
18:8	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
talebearer	1
are	1
as	1
wounds,	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
innermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
belly.	1
	1
18:9	1
He	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
slothful	1
in	1
his	1
work	1
is	1
brother	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
waster.	1
	1
18:10	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
tower:	1
the	1
righteous	1
runneth	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
is	1
safe.	1
	1
18:11	1
The	1
rich	1
man's	1
wealth	1
is	1
his	1
strong	1
city,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
high	1
wall	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
conceit.	1
	1
18:12	1
Before	1
destruction	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
haughty,	1
and	1
before	1
honour	1
is	1
humility.	1
	1
18:13	1
He	1
that	1
answereth	1
a	1
matter	1
before	1
he	1
heareth	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
folly	1
and	1
shame	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
18:14	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
will	1
sustain	1
his	1
infirmity;	1
but	1
a	1
wounded	1
spirit	1
who	1
can	1
bear?	1
	1
18:15	1
The	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
prudent	1
getteth	1
knowledge;	1
and	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
seeketh	1
knowledge.	1
	1
18:16	1
A	1
man's	1
gift	1
maketh	1
room	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
him	1
before	1
great	1
men.	1
	1
18:17	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
first	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
cause	1
seemeth	1
just;	1
but	1
his	1
neighbour	1
cometh	1
and	1
searcheth	1
him.	1
	1
18:18	1
The	1
lot	1
causeth	1
contentions	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
parteth	1
between	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
18:19	1
A	1
brother	1
offended	1
is	1
harder	1
to	1
be	1
won	1
than	1
a	1
strong	1
city:	1
and	1
their	1
contentions	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
a	1
castle.	1
	1
18:20	1
A	1
man's	1
belly	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
mouth;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
filled.	1
	1
18:21	1
Death	1
and	1
life	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
tongue:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
love	1
it	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof.	1
	1
18:22	1
Whoso	1
findeth	1
a	1
wife	1
findeth	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
and	1
obtaineth	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:23	1
The	1
poor	1
useth	1
intreaties;	1
but	1
the	1
rich	1
answereth	1
roughly.	1
	1
18:24	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
friends	1
must	1
shew	1
himself	1
friendly:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
that	1
sticketh	1
closer	1
than	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
19:1	1
Better	1
is	1
the	1
poor	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
his	1
integrity,	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
perverse	1
in	1
his	1
lips,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
fool.	1
	1
19:2	1
Also,	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
be	1
without	1
knowledge,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
good;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hasteth	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
sinneth.	1
	1
19:3	1
The	1
foolishness	1
of	1
man	1
perverteth	1
his	1
way:	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
fretteth	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:4	1
Wealth	1
maketh	1
many	1
friends;	1
but	1
the	1
poor	1
is	1
separated	1
from	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
19:5	1
A	1
false	1
witness	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unpunished,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
lies	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
19:6	1
Many	1
will	1
intreat	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
prince:	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
giveth	1
gifts.	1
	1
19:7	1
All	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
do	1
hate	1
him:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
do	1
his	1
friends	1
go	1
far	1
from	1
him?	1
he	1
pursueth	1
them	1
with	1
words,	1
yet	1
they	1
are	1
wanting	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
19:8	1
He	1
that	1
getteth	1
wisdom	1
loveth	1
his	1
own	1
soul:	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
understanding	1
shall	1
find	1
good.	1
	1
19:9	1
A	1
false	1
witness	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unpunished,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
lies	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
19:10	1
Delight	1
is	1
not	1
seemly	1
for	1
a	1
fool;	1
much	1
less	1
for	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
have	1
rule	1
over	1
princes.	1
	1
19:11	1
The	1
discretion	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
deferreth	1
his	1
anger;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
glory	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
a	1
transgression.	1
	1
19:12	1
The	1
king's	1
wrath	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
a	1
lion;	1
but	1
his	1
favour	1
is	1
as	1
dew	1
upon	1
the	1
grass.	1
	1
19:13	1
A	1
foolish	1
son	1
is	1
the	1
calamity	1
of	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
the	1
contentions	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
are	1
a	1
continual	1
dropping.	1
	1
19:14	1
House	1
and	1
riches	1
are	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
fathers:	1
and	1
a	1
prudent	1
wife	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:15	1
Slothfulness	1
casteth	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep;	1
and	1
an	1
idle	1
soul	1
shall	1
suffer	1
hunger.	1
	1
19:16	1
He	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
commandment	1
keepeth	1
his	1
own	1
soul;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
his	1
ways	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
19:17	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
pity	1
upon	1
the	1
poor	1
lendeth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
will	1
he	1
pay	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
19:18	1
Chasten	1
thy	1
son	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
hope,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
soul	1
spare	1
for	1
his	1
crying.	1
	1
19:19	1
A	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
wrath	1
shall	1
suffer	1
punishment:	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
deliver	1
him,	1
yet	1
thou	1
must	1
do	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
19:20	1
Hear	1
counsel,	1
and	1
receive	1
instruction,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
thy	1
latter	1
end.	1
	1
19:21	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
devices	1
in	1
a	1
man's	1
heart;	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
shall	1
stand.	1
	1
19:22	1
The	1
desire	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
his	1
kindness:	1
and	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
liar.	1
	1
19:23	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
tendeth	1
to	1
life:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
it	1
shall	1
abide	1
satisfied;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
visited	1
with	1
evil.	1
	1
19:24	1
A	1
slothful	1
man	1
hideth	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
again.	1
	1
19:25	1
Smite	1
a	1
scorner,	1
and	1
the	1
simple	1
will	1
beware:	1
and	1
reprove	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
understand	1
knowledge.	1
	1
19:26	1
He	1
that	1
wasteth	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
chaseth	1
away	1
his	1
mother,	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
that	1
causeth	1
shame,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
reproach.	1
	1
19:27	1
Cease,	1
my	1
son,	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
instruction	1
that	1
causeth	1
to	1
err	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
knowledge.	1
	1
19:28	1
An	1
ungodly	1
witness	1
scorneth	1
judgment:	1
and	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
devoureth	1
iniquity.	1
	1
19:29	1
Judgments	1
are	1
prepared	1
for	1
scorners,	1
and	1
stripes	1
for	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
fools.	1
	1
20:1	1
Wine	1
is	1
a	1
mocker,	1
strong	1
drink	1
is	1
raging:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
is	1
deceived	1
thereby	1
is	1
not	1
wise.	1
	1
20:2	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
a	1
king	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
a	1
lion:	1
whoso	1
provoketh	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
sinneth	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
20:3	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
honour	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
strife:	1
but	1
every	1
fool	1
will	1
be	1
meddling.	1
	1
20:4	1
The	1
sluggard	1
will	1
not	1
plow	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
cold;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
he	1
beg	1
in	1
harvest,	1
and	1
have	1
nothing.	1
	1
20:5	1
Counsel	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
like	1
deep	1
water;	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding	1
will	1
draw	1
it	1
out.	1
	1
20:6	1
Most	1
men	1
will	1
proclaim	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
own	1
goodness:	1
but	1
a	1
faithful	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
find?	1
	1
20:7	1
The	1
just	1
man	1
walketh	1
in	1
his	1
integrity:	1
his	1
children	1
are	1
blessed	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
20:8	1
A	1
king	1
that	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
judgment	1
scattereth	1
away	1
all	1
evil	1
with	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
20:9	1
Who	1
can	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
heart	1
clean,	1
I	1
am	1
pure	1
from	1
my	1
sin?	1
20:10	1
Divers	1
weights,	1
and	1
divers	1
measures,	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
alike	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:11	1
Even	1
a	1
child	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
doings,	1
whether	1
his	1
work	1
be	1
pure,	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
right.	1
	1
20:12	1
The	1
hearing	1
ear,	1
and	1
the	1
seeing	1
eye,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
even	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
20:13	1
Love	1
not	1
sleep,	1
lest	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
poverty;	1
open	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
bread.	1
	1
20:14	1
It	1
is	1
naught,	1
it	1
is	1
naught,	1
saith	1
the	1
buyer:	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
his	1
way,	1
then	1
he	1
boasteth.	1
	1
20:15	1
There	1
is	1
gold,	1
and	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
rubies:	1
but	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
knowledge	1
are	1
a	1
precious	1
jewel.	1
	1
20:16	1
Take	1
his	1
garment	1
that	1
is	1
surety	1
for	1
a	1
stranger:	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
pledge	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
strange	1
woman.	1
	1
20:17	1
Bread	1
of	1
deceit	1
is	1
sweet	1
to	1
a	1
man;	1
but	1
afterwards	1
his	1
mouth	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
gravel.	1
	1
20:18	1
Every	1
purpose	1
is	1
established	1
by	1
counsel:	1
and	1
with	1
good	1
advice	1
make	1
war.	1
	1
20:19	1
He	1
that	1
goeth	1
about	1
as	1
a	1
talebearer	1
revealeth	1
secrets:	1
therefore	1
meddle	1
not	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
flattereth	1
with	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
20:20	1
Whoso	1
curseth	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
lamp	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
in	1
obscure	1
darkness.	1
	1
20:21	1
An	1
inheritance	1
may	1
be	1
gotten	1
hastily	1
at	1
the	1
beginning;	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
20:22	1
Say	1
not	1
thou,	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
evil;	1
but	1
wait	1
on	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
save	1
thee.	1
	1
20:23	1
Divers	1
weights	1
are	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
a	1
false	1
balance	1
is	1
not	1
good.	1
	1
20:24	1
Man's	1
goings	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
how	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
then	1
understand	1
his	1
own	1
way?	1
	1
20:25	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
snare	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
devoureth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
holy,	1
and	1
after	1
vows	1
to	1
make	1
enquiry.	1
	1
20:26	1
A	1
wise	1
king	1
scattereth	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
the	1
wheel	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
20:27	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
candle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
searching	1
all	1
the	1
inward	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
belly.	1
	1
20:28	1
Mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
preserve	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
his	1
throne	1
is	1
upholden	1
by	1
mercy.	1
	1
20:29	1
The	1
glory	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
is	1
their	1
strength:	1
and	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
old	1
men	1
is	1
the	1
grey	1
head.	1
	1
20:30	1
The	1
blueness	1
of	1
a	1
wound	1
cleanseth	1
away	1
evil:	1
so	1
do	1
stripes	1
the	1
inward	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
belly.	1
	1
21:1	1
The	1
king's	1
heart	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
water:	1
he	1
turneth	1
it	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
21:2	1
Every	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
pondereth	1
the	1
hearts.	1
	1
21:3	1
To	1
do	1
justice	1
and	1
judgment	1
is	1
more	1
acceptable	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
than	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
21:4	1
An	1
high	1
look,	1
and	1
a	1
proud	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
plowing	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
21:5	1
The	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
diligent	1
tend	1
only	1
to	1
plenteousness;	1
but	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
hasty	1
only	1
to	1
want.	1
	1
21:6	1
The	1
getting	1
of	1
treasures	1
by	1
a	1
lying	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
vanity	1
tossed	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
death.	1
	1
21:7	1
The	1
robbery	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
destroy	1
them;	1
because	1
they	1
refuse	1
to	1
do	1
judgment.	1
	1
21:8	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
froward	1
and	1
strange:	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
pure,	1
his	1
work	1
is	1
right.	1
	1
21:9	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
housetop,	1
than	1
with	1
a	1
brawling	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
wide	1
house.	1
	1
21:10	1
The	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
desireth	1
evil:	1
his	1
neighbour	1
findeth	1
no	1
favour	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
21:11	1
When	1
the	1
scorner	1
is	1
punished,	1
the	1
simple	1
is	1
made	1
wise:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
wise	1
is	1
instructed,	1
he	1
receiveth	1
knowledge.	1
	1
21:12	1
The	1
righteous	1
man	1
wisely	1
considereth	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
but	1
God	1
overthroweth	1
the	1
wicked	1
for	1
their	1
wickedness.	1
	1
21:13	1
Whoso	1
stoppeth	1
his	1
ears	1
at	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
he	1
also	1
shall	1
cry	1
himself,	1
but	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
21:14	1
A	1
gift	1
in	1
secret	1
pacifieth	1
anger:	1
and	1
a	1
reward	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
strong	1
wrath.	1
	1
21:15	1
It	1
is	1
joy	1
to	1
the	1
just	1
to	1
do	1
judgment:	1
but	1
destruction	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
21:16	1
The	1
man	1
that	1
wandereth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
understanding	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
21:17	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
pleasure	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
poor	1
man:	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
wine	1
and	1
oil	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
rich.	1
	1
21:18	1
The	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
the	1
transgressor	1
for	1
the	1
upright.	1
	1
21:19	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
than	1
with	1
a	1
contentious	1
and	1
an	1
angry	1
woman.	1
	1
21:20	1
There	1
is	1
treasure	1
to	1
be	1
desired	1
and	1
oil	1
in	1
the	1
dwelling	1
of	1
the	1
wise;	1
but	1
a	1
foolish	1
man	1
spendeth	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
21:21	1
He	1
that	1
followeth	1
after	1
righteousness	1
and	1
mercy	1
findeth	1
life,	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
honour.	1
	1
21:22	1
A	1
wise	1
man	1
scaleth	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
mighty,	1
and	1
casteth	1
down	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
confidence	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:23	1
Whoso	1
keepeth	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
his	1
tongue	1
keepeth	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
troubles.	1
	1
21:24	1
Proud	1
and	1
haughty	1
scorner	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
who	1
dealeth	1
in	1
proud	1
wrath.	1
	1
21:25	1
The	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
slothful	1
killeth	1
him;	1
for	1
his	1
hands	1
refuse	1
to	1
labour.	1
	1
21:26	1
He	1
coveteth	1
greedily	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
giveth	1
and	1
spareth	1
not.	1
	1
21:27	1
The	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
abomination:	1
how	1
much	1
more,	1
when	1
he	1
bringeth	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
wicked	1
mind?	1
	1
21:28	1
A	1
false	1
witness	1
shall	1
perish:	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
heareth	1
speaketh	1
constantly.	1
	1
21:29	1
A	1
wicked	1
man	1
hardeneth	1
his	1
face:	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
upright,	1
he	1
directeth	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
21:30	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
wisdom	1
nor	1
understanding	1
nor	1
counsel	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:31	1
The	1
horse	1
is	1
prepared	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle:	1
but	1
safety	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:1	1
A	1
GOOD	1
name	1
is	1
rather	1
to	1
be	1
chosen	1
than	1
great	1
riches,	1
and	1
loving	1
favour	1
rather	1
than	1
silver	1
and	1
gold.	1
	1
22:2	1
The	1
rich	1
and	1
poor	1
meet	1
together:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
22:3	1
A	1
prudent	1
man	1
foreseeth	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
hideth	1
himself:	1
but	1
the	1
simple	1
pass	1
on,	1
and	1
are	1
punished.	1
	1
22:4	1
By	1
humility	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
riches,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
life.	1
	1
22:5	1
Thorns	1
and	1
snares	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
froward:	1
he	1
that	1
doth	1
keep	1
his	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
22:6	1
Train	1
up	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
should	1
go:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
old,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
22:7	1
The	1
rich	1
ruleth	1
over	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
the	1
borrower	1
is	1
servant	1
to	1
the	1
lender.	1
	1
22:8	1
He	1
that	1
soweth	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
reap	1
vanity:	1
and	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
anger	1
shall	1
fail.	1
	1
22:9	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
bountiful	1
eye	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed;	1
for	1
he	1
giveth	1
of	1
his	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
22:10	1
Cast	1
out	1
the	1
scorner,	1
and	1
contention	1
shall	1
go	1
out;	1
yea,	1
strife	1
and	1
reproach	1
shall	1
cease.	1
	1
22:11	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
pureness	1
of	1
heart,	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
friend.	1
	1
22:12	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
preserve	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
he	1
overthroweth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
transgressor.	1
	1
22:13	1
The	1
slothful	1
man	1
saith,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
lion	1
without,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
22:14	1
The	1
mouth	1
of	1
strange	1
women	1
is	1
a	1
deep	1
pit:	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
abhorred	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
fall	1
therein.	1
	1
22:15	1
Foolishness	1
is	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
child;	1
but	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
correction	1
shall	1
drive	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
22:16	1
He	1
that	1
oppresseth	1
the	1
poor	1
to	1
increase	1
his	1
riches,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
to	1
the	1
rich,	1
shall	1
surely	1
come	1
to	1
want.	1
	1
22:17	1
Bow	1
down	1
thine	1
ear,	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
apply	1
thine	1
heart	1
unto	1
my	1
knowledge.	1
	1
22:18	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pleasant	1
thing	1
if	1
thou	1
keep	1
them	1
within	1
thee;	1
they	1
shall	1
withal	1
be	1
fitted	1
in	1
thy	1
lips.	1
	1
22:19	1
That	1
thy	1
trust	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
even	1
to	1
thee.	1
	1
22:20	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
written	1
to	1
thee	1
excellent	1
things	1
in	1
counsels	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
22:21	1
That	1
I	1
might	1
make	1
thee	1
know	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
truth;	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
answer	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
truth	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
send	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
22:22	1
Rob	1
not	1
the	1
poor,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
poor:	1
neither	1
oppress	1
the	1
afflicted	1
in	1
the	1
gate:	1
22:23	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
plead	1
their	1
cause,	1
and	1
spoil	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
spoiled	1
them.	1
	1
22:24	1
Make	1
no	1
friendship	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
man;	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
furious	1
man	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go:	1
22:25	1
Lest	1
thou	1
learn	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
get	1
a	1
snare	1
to	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
22:26	1
Be	1
not	1
thou	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
strike	1
hands,	1
or	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sureties	1
for	1
debts.	1
	1
22:27	1
If	1
thou	1
hast	1
nothing	1
to	1
pay,	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
bed	1
from	1
under	1
thee?	1
	1
22:28	1
Remove	1
not	1
the	1
ancient	1
landmark,	1
which	1
thy	1
fathers	1
have	1
set.	1
	1
22:29	1
Seest	1
thou	1
a	1
man	1
diligent	1
in	1
his	1
business?	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
kings;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
before	1
mean	1
men.	1
	1
23:1	1
When	1
thou	1
sittest	1
to	1
eat	1
with	1
a	1
ruler,	1
consider	1
diligently	1
what	1
is	1
before	1
thee:	1
23:2	1
And	1
put	1
a	1
knife	1
to	1
thy	1
throat,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
given	1
to	1
appetite.	1
	1
23:3	1
Be	1
not	1
desirous	1
of	1
his	1
dainties:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
deceitful	1
meat.	1
	1
23:4	1
Labour	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
rich:	1
cease	1
from	1
thine	1
own	1
wisdom.	1
	1
23:5	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
set	1
thine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not?	1
for	1
riches	1
certainly	1
make	1
themselves	1
wings;	1
they	1
fly	1
away	1
as	1
an	1
eagle	1
toward	1
heaven.	1
	1
23:6	1
Eat	1
thou	1
not	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
evil	1
eye,	1
neither	1
desire	1
thou	1
his	1
dainty	1
meats:	1
23:7	1
For	1
as	1
he	1
thinketh	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
so	1
is	1
he:	1
Eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
thee;	1
but	1
his	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
23:8	1
The	1
morsel	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
eaten	1
shalt	1
thou	1
vomit	1
up,	1
and	1
lose	1
thy	1
sweet	1
words.	1
	1
23:9	1
Speak	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
a	1
fool:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
despise	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
23:10	1
Remove	1
not	1
the	1
old	1
landmark;	1
and	1
enter	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless:	1
23:11	1
For	1
their	1
redeemer	1
is	1
mighty;	1
he	1
shall	1
plead	1
their	1
cause	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
23:12	1
Apply	1
thine	1
heart	1
unto	1
instruction,	1
and	1
thine	1
ears	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
knowledge.	1
	1
23:13	1
Withhold	1
not	1
correction	1
from	1
the	1
child:	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
beatest	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
rod,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
23:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
beat	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
shalt	1
deliver	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
hell.	1
	1
23:15	1
My	1
son,	1
if	1
thine	1
heart	1
be	1
wise,	1
my	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
even	1
mine.	1
	1
23:16	1
Yea,	1
my	1
reins	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
when	1
thy	1
lips	1
speak	1
right	1
things.	1
	1
23:17	1
Let	1
not	1
thine	1
heart	1
envy	1
sinners:	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long.	1
	1
23:18	1
For	1
surely	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
end;	1
and	1
thine	1
expectation	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
23:19	1
Hear	1
thou,	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
be	1
wise,	1
and	1
guide	1
thine	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
23:20	1
Be	1
not	1
among	1
winebibbers;	1
among	1
riotous	1
eaters	1
of	1
flesh:	1
23:21	1
For	1
the	1
drunkard	1
and	1
the	1
glutton	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
poverty:	1
and	1
drowsiness	1
shall	1
clothe	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
rags.	1
	1
23:22	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
thy	1
father	1
that	1
begat	1
thee,	1
and	1
despise	1
not	1
thy	1
mother	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
old.	1
	1
23:23	1
Buy	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
sell	1
it	1
not;	1
also	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
instruction,	1
and	1
understanding.	1
	1
23:24	1
The	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
greatly	1
rejoice:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
begetteth	1
a	1
wise	1
child	1
shall	1
have	1
joy	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
23:25	1
Thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
shall	1
be	1
glad,	1
and	1
she	1
that	1
bare	1
thee	1
shall	1
rejoice.	1
	1
23:26	1
My	1
son,	1
give	1
me	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
eyes	1
observe	1
my	1
ways.	1
	1
23:27	1
For	1
a	1
whore	1
is	1
a	1
deep	1
ditch;	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
woman	1
is	1
a	1
narrow	1
pit.	1
	1
23:28	1
She	1
also	1
lieth	1
in	1
wait	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
prey,	1
and	1
increaseth	1
the	1
transgressors	1
among	1
men.	1
	1
23:29	1
Who	1
hath	1
woe?	1
who	1
hath	1
sorrow?	1
who	1
hath	1
contentions?	1
who	1
hath	1
babbling?	1
who	1
hath	1
wounds	1
without	1
cause?	1
who	1
hath	1
redness	1
of	1
eyes?	1
23:30	1
They	1
that	1
tarry	1
long	1
at	1
the	1
wine;	1
they	1
that	1
go	1
to	1
seek	1
mixed	1
wine.	1
	1
23:31	1
Look	1
not	1
thou	1
upon	1
the	1
wine	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
red,	1
when	1
it	1
giveth	1
his	1
colour	1
in	1
the	1
cup,	1
when	1
it	1
moveth	1
itself	1
aright.	1
	1
23:32	1
At	1
the	1
last	1
it	1
biteth	1
like	1
a	1
serpent,	1
and	1
stingeth	1
like	1
an	1
adder.	1
	1
23:33	1
Thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
strange	1
women,	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
shall	1
utter	1
perverse	1
things.	1
	1
23:34	1
Yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
lieth	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
or	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
lieth	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
mast.	1
	1
23:35	1
They	1
have	1
stricken	1
me,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
sick;	1
they	1
have	1
beaten	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
it	1
not:	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
awake?	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
it	1
yet	1
again.	1
	1
24:1	1
Be	1
not	1
thou	1
envious	1
against	1
evil	1
men,	1
neither	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:2	1
For	1
their	1
heart	1
studieth	1
destruction,	1
and	1
their	1
lips	1
talk	1
of	1
mischief.	1
	1
24:3	1
Through	1
wisdom	1
is	1
an	1
house	1
builded;	1
and	1
by	1
understanding	1
it	1
is	1
established:	1
24:4	1
And	1
by	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
the	1
chambers	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
precious	1
and	1
pleasant	1
riches.	1
	1
24:5	1
A	1
wise	1
man	1
is	1
strong;	1
yea,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
knowledge	1
increaseth	1
strength.	1
	1
24:6	1
For	1
by	1
wise	1
counsel	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
thy	1
war:	1
and	1
in	1
multitude	1
of	1
counsellors	1
there	1
is	1
safety.	1
	1
24:7	1
Wisdom	1
is	1
too	1
high	1
for	1
a	1
fool:	1
he	1
openeth	1
not	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
24:8	1
He	1
that	1
deviseth	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
mischievous	1
person.	1
	1
24:9	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
foolishness	1
is	1
sin:	1
and	1
the	1
scorner	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
to	1
men.	1
	1
24:10	1
If	1
thou	1
faint	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
adversity,	1
thy	1
strength	1
is	1
small.	1
	1
24:11	1
If	1
thou	1
forbear	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
drawn	1
unto	1
death,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
slain;	1
24:12	1
If	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
knew	1
it	1
not;	1
doth	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
pondereth	1
the	1
heart	1
consider	1
it?	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
thy	1
soul,	1
doth	1
not	1
he	1
know	1
it?	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
he	1
render	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works?	1
	1
24:13	1
My	1
son,	1
eat	1
thou	1
honey,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
good;	1
and	1
the	1
honeycomb,	1
which	1
is	1
sweet	1
to	1
thy	1
taste:	1
24:14	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
wisdom	1
be	1
unto	1
thy	1
soul:	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
it,	1
then	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
reward,	1
and	1
thy	1
expectation	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
24:15	1
Lay	1
not	1
wait,	1
O	1
wicked	1
man,	1
against	1
the	1
dwelling	1
of	1
the	1
righteous;	1
spoil	1
not	1
his	1
resting	1
place:	1
24:16	1
For	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
falleth	1
seven	1
times,	1
and	1
riseth	1
up	1
again:	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
mischief.	1
	1
24:17	1
Rejoice	1
not	1
when	1
thine	1
enemy	1
falleth,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
thine	1
heart	1
be	1
glad	1
when	1
he	1
stumbleth:	1
24:18	1
Lest	1
the	1
LORD	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
displease	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
turn	1
away	1
his	1
wrath	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
24:19	1
Fret	1
not	1
thyself	1
because	1
of	1
evil	1
men,	1
neither	1
be	1
thou	1
envious	1
at	1
the	1
wicked:	1
24:20	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
reward	1
to	1
the	1
evil	1
man;	1
the	1
candle	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
out.	1
	1
24:21	1
My	1
son,	1
fear	1
thou	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
meddle	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
given	1
to	1
change:	1
24:22	1
For	1
their	1
calamity	1
shall	1
rise	1
suddenly;	1
and	1
who	1
knoweth	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
them	1
both?	1
	1
24:23	1
These	1
things	1
also	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
wise.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
have	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
in	1
judgment.	1
	1
24:24	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked,	1
Thou	1
are	1
righteous;	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
people	1
curse,	1
nations	1
shall	1
abhor	1
him:	1
24:25	1
But	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
rebuke	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
delight,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
blessing	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
24:26	1
Every	1
man	1
shall	1
kiss	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
giveth	1
a	1
right	1
answer.	1
	1
24:27	1
Prepare	1
thy	1
work	1
without,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
fit	1
for	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
afterwards	1
build	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
24:28	1
Be	1
not	1
a	1
witness	1
against	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
without	1
cause;	1
and	1
deceive	1
not	1
with	1
thy	1
lips.	1
	1
24:29	1
Say	1
not,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
so	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
me:	1
I	1
will	1
render	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
24:30	1
I	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
the	1
slothful,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
vineyard	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
void	1
of	1
understanding;	1
24:31	1
And,	1
lo,	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
grown	1
over	1
with	1
thorns,	1
and	1
nettles	1
had	1
covered	1
the	1
face	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
stone	1
wall	1
thereof	1
was	1
broken	1
down.	1
	1
24:32	1
Then	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
considered	1
it	1
well:	1
I	1
looked	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
received	1
instruction.	1
	1
24:33	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
sleep,	1
a	1
little	1
slumber,	1
a	1
little	1
folding	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
sleep:	1
24:34	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
poverty	1
come	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
travelleth;	1
and	1
thy	1
want	1
as	1
an	1
armed	1
man.	1
	1
25:1	1
These	1
are	1
also	1
proverbs	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
copied	1
out.	1
	1
25:2	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
conceal	1
a	1
thing:	1
but	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
kings	1
is	1
to	1
search	1
out	1
a	1
matter.	1
	1
25:3	1
The	1
heaven	1
for	1
height,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
depth,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
kings	1
is	1
unsearchable.	1
	1
25:4	1
Take	1
away	1
the	1
dross	1
from	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
a	1
vessel	1
for	1
the	1
finer.	1
	1
25:5	1
Take	1
away	1
the	1
wicked	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
throne	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
25:6	1
Put	1
not	1
forth	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
stand	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
great	1
men:	1
25:7	1
For	1
better	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither;	1
than	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
put	1
lower	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
whom	1
thine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen.	1
	1
25:8	1
Go	1
not	1
forth	1
hastily	1
to	1
strive,	1
lest	1
thou	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
thereof,	1
when	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
hath	1
put	1
thee	1
to	1
shame.	1
	1
25:9	1
Debate	1
thy	1
cause	1
with	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
himself;	1
and	1
discover	1
not	1
a	1
secret	1
to	1
another:	1
25:10	1
Lest	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
it	1
put	1
thee	1
to	1
shame,	1
and	1
thine	1
infamy	1
turn	1
not	1
away.	1
	1
25:11	1
A	1
word	1
fitly	1
spoken	1
is	1
like	1
apples	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
pictures	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
25:12	1
As	1
an	1
earring	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
an	1
ornament	1
of	1
fine	1
gold,	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
reprover	1
upon	1
an	1
obedient	1
ear.	1
	1
25:13	1
As	1
the	1
cold	1
of	1
snow	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
harvest,	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
messenger	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
send	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
refresheth	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
his	1
masters.	1
	1
25:14	1
Whoso	1
boasteth	1
himself	1
of	1
a	1
false	1
gift	1
is	1
like	1
clouds	1
and	1
wind	1
without	1
rain.	1
	1
25:15	1
By	1
long	1
forbearing	1
is	1
a	1
prince	1
persuaded,	1
and	1
a	1
soft	1
tongue	1
breaketh	1
the	1
bone.	1
	1
25:16	1
Hast	1
thou	1
found	1
honey?	1
eat	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
thee,	1
lest	1
thou	1
be	1
filled	1
therewith,	1
and	1
vomit	1
it.	1
	1
25:17	1
Withdraw	1
thy	1
foot	1
from	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
house;	1
lest	1
he	1
be	1
weary	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
so	1
hate	1
thee.	1
	1
25:18	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
beareth	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour	1
is	1
a	1
maul,	1
and	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
a	1
sharp	1
arrow.	1
	1
25:19	1
Confidence	1
in	1
an	1
unfaithful	1
man	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
trouble	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
broken	1
tooth,	1
and	1
a	1
foot	1
out	1
of	1
joint.	1
	1
25:20	1
As	1
he	1
that	1
taketh	1
away	1
a	1
garment	1
in	1
cold	1
weather,	1
and	1
as	1
vinegar	1
upon	1
nitre,	1
so	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
singeth	1
songs	1
to	1
an	1
heavy	1
heart.	1
	1
25:21	1
If	1
thine	1
enemy	1
be	1
hungry,	1
give	1
him	1
bread	1
to	1
eat;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
thirsty,	1
give	1
him	1
water	1
to	1
drink:	1
25:22	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
heap	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee.	1
	1
25:23	1
The	1
north	1
wind	1
driveth	1
away	1
rain:	1
so	1
doth	1
an	1
angry	1
countenance	1
a	1
backbiting	1
tongue.	1
	1
25:24	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
housetop,	1
than	1
with	1
a	1
brawling	1
woman	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
wide	1
house.	1
	1
25:25	1
As	1
cold	1
waters	1
to	1
a	1
thirsty	1
soul,	1
so	1
is	1
good	1
news	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country.	1
	1
25:26	1
A	1
righteous	1
man	1
falling	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
wicked	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
troubled	1
fountain,	1
and	1
a	1
corrupt	1
spring.	1
	1
25:27	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
eat	1
much	1
honey:	1
so	1
for	1
men	1
to	1
search	1
their	1
own	1
glory	1
is	1
not	1
glory.	1
	1
25:28	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
rule	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
spirit	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
city	1
that	1
is	1
broken	1
down,	1
and	1
without	1
walls.	1
	1
26:1	1
As	1
snow	1
in	1
summer,	1
and	1
as	1
rain	1
in	1
harvest,	1
so	1
honour	1
is	1
not	1
seemly	1
for	1
a	1
fool.	1
	1
26:2	1
As	1
the	1
bird	1
by	1
wandering,	1
as	1
the	1
swallow	1
by	1
flying,	1
so	1
the	1
curse	1
causeless	1
shall	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
26:3	1
A	1
whip	1
for	1
the	1
horse,	1
a	1
bridle	1
for	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
a	1
rod	1
for	1
the	1
fool's	1
back.	1
	1
26:4	1
Answer	1
not	1
a	1
fool	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
folly,	1
lest	1
thou	1
also	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
26:5	1
Answer	1
a	1
fool	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
folly,	1
lest	1
he	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
conceit.	1
	1
26:6	1
He	1
that	1
sendeth	1
a	1
message	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
cutteth	1
off	1
the	1
feet,	1
and	1
drinketh	1
damage.	1
	1
26:7	1
The	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
lame	1
are	1
not	1
equal:	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
parable	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
fools.	1
	1
26:8	1
As	1
he	1
that	1
bindeth	1
a	1
stone	1
in	1
a	1
sling,	1
so	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
honour	1
to	1
a	1
fool.	1
	1
26:9	1
As	1
a	1
thorn	1
goeth	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
drunkard,	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
parable	1
in	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
fools.	1
	1
26:10	1
The	1
great	1
God	1
that	1
formed	1
all	1
things	1
both	1
rewardeth	1
the	1
fool,	1
and	1
rewardeth	1
transgressors.	1
	1
26:11	1
As	1
a	1
dog	1
returneth	1
to	1
his	1
vomit,	1
so	1
a	1
fool	1
returneth	1
to	1
his	1
folly.	1
	1
26:12	1
Seest	1
thou	1
a	1
man	1
wise	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
conceit?	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
than	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
26:13	1
The	1
slothful	1
man	1
saith,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
lion	1
in	1
the	1
way;	1
a	1
lion	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
26:14	1
As	1
the	1
door	1
turneth	1
upon	1
his	1
hinges,	1
so	1
doth	1
the	1
slothful	1
upon	1
his	1
bed.	1
	1
26:15	1
The	1
slothful	1
hideth	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
bosom;	1
it	1
grieveth	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
26:16	1
The	1
sluggard	1
is	1
wiser	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
conceit	1
than	1
seven	1
men	1
that	1
can	1
render	1
a	1
reason.	1
	1
26:17	1
He	1
that	1
passeth	1
by,	1
and	1
meddleth	1
with	1
strife	1
belonging	1
not	1
to	1
him,	1
is	1
like	1
one	1
that	1
taketh	1
a	1
dog	1
by	1
the	1
ears.	1
	1
26:18	1
As	1
a	1
mad	1
man	1
who	1
casteth	1
firebrands,	1
arrows,	1
and	1
death,	1
26:19	1
So	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
deceiveth	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Am	1
not	1
I	1
in	1
sport?	1
26:20	1
Where	1
no	1
wood	1
is,	1
there	1
the	1
fire	1
goeth	1
out:	1
so	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
talebearer,	1
the	1
strife	1
ceaseth.	1
	1
26:21	1
As	1
coals	1
are	1
to	1
burning	1
coals,	1
and	1
wood	1
to	1
fire;	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
contentious	1
man	1
to	1
kindle	1
strife.	1
	1
26:22	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
talebearer	1
are	1
as	1
wounds,	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
innermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
belly.	1
	1
26:23	1
Burning	1
lips	1
and	1
a	1
wicked	1
heart	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
potsherd	1
covered	1
with	1
silver	1
dross.	1
	1
26:24	1
He	1
that	1
hateth	1
dissembleth	1
with	1
his	1
lips,	1
and	1
layeth	1
up	1
deceit	1
within	1
him;	1
26:25	1
When	1
he	1
speaketh	1
fair,	1
believe	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
seven	1
abominations	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
26:26	1
Whose	1
hatred	1
is	1
covered	1
by	1
deceit,	1
his	1
wickedness	1
shall	1
be	1
shewed	1
before	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation.	1
	1
26:27	1
Whoso	1
diggeth	1
a	1
pit	1
shall	1
fall	1
therein:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
rolleth	1
a	1
stone,	1
it	1
will	1
return	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
26:28	1
A	1
lying	1
tongue	1
hateth	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
afflicted	1
by	1
it;	1
and	1
a	1
flattering	1
mouth	1
worketh	1
ruin.	1
	1
27:1	1
Boast	1
not	1
thyself	1
of	1
to	1
morrow;	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
what	1
a	1
day	1
may	1
bring	1
forth.	1
	1
27:2	1
Let	1
another	1
man	1
praise	1
thee,	1
and	1
not	1
thine	1
own	1
mouth;	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
not	1
thine	1
own	1
lips.	1
	1
27:3	1
A	1
stone	1
is	1
heavy,	1
and	1
the	1
sand	1
weighty;	1
but	1
a	1
fool's	1
wrath	1
is	1
heavier	1
than	1
them	1
both.	1
	1
27:4	1
Wrath	1
is	1
cruel,	1
and	1
anger	1
is	1
outrageous;	1
but	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
envy?	1
	1
27:5	1
Open	1
rebuke	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
secret	1
love.	1
	1
27:6	1
Faithful	1
are	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
a	1
friend;	1
but	1
the	1
kisses	1
of	1
an	1
enemy	1
are	1
deceitful.	1
	1
27:7	1
The	1
full	1
soul	1
loatheth	1
an	1
honeycomb;	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
hungry	1
soul	1
every	1
bitter	1
thing	1
is	1
sweet.	1
	1
27:8	1
As	1
a	1
bird	1
that	1
wandereth	1
from	1
her	1
nest,	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
wandereth	1
from	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
27:9	1
Ointment	1
and	1
perfume	1
rejoice	1
the	1
heart:	1
so	1
doth	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
friend	1
by	1
hearty	1
counsel.	1
	1
27:10	1
Thine	1
own	1
friend,	1
and	1
thy	1
father's	1
friend,	1
forsake	1
not;	1
neither	1
go	1
into	1
thy	1
brother's	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
calamity:	1
for	1
better	1
is	1
a	1
neighbour	1
that	1
is	1
near	1
than	1
a	1
brother	1
far	1
off.	1
	1
27:11	1
My	1
son,	1
be	1
wise,	1
and	1
make	1
my	1
heart	1
glad,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
answer	1
him	1
that	1
reproacheth	1
me.	1
	1
27:12	1
A	1
prudent	1
man	1
foreseeth	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
hideth	1
himself;	1
but	1
the	1
simple	1
pass	1
on,	1
and	1
are	1
punished.	1
	1
27:13	1
Take	1
his	1
garment	1
that	1
is	1
surety	1
for	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
pledge	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
strange	1
woman.	1
	1
27:14	1
He	1
that	1
blesseth	1
his	1
friend	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
rising	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
a	1
curse	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
27:15	1
A	1
continual	1
dropping	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
rainy	1
day	1
and	1
a	1
contentious	1
woman	1
are	1
alike.	1
	1
27:16	1
Whosoever	1
hideth	1
her	1
hideth	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
the	1
ointment	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
which	1
bewrayeth	1
itself.	1
	1
27:17	1
Iron	1
sharpeneth	1
iron;	1
so	1
a	1
man	1
sharpeneth	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
his	1
friend.	1
	1
27:18	1
Whoso	1
keepeth	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof:	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
waiteth	1
on	1
his	1
master	1
shall	1
be	1
honoured.	1
	1
27:19	1
As	1
in	1
water	1
face	1
answereth	1
to	1
face,	1
so	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man	1
to	1
man.	1
	1
27:20	1
Hell	1
and	1
destruction	1
are	1
never	1
full;	1
so	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
man	1
are	1
never	1
satisfied.	1
	1
27:21	1
As	1
the	1
fining	1
pot	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
furnace	1
for	1
gold;	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
praise.	1
	1
27:22	1
Though	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
bray	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
a	1
mortar	1
among	1
wheat	1
with	1
a	1
pestle,	1
yet	1
will	1
not	1
his	1
foolishness	1
depart	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
27:23	1
Be	1
thou	1
diligent	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
thy	1
flocks,	1
and	1
look	1
well	1
to	1
thy	1
herds.	1
	1
27:24	1
For	1
riches	1
are	1
not	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
doth	1
the	1
crown	1
endure	1
to	1
every	1
generation?	1
	1
27:25	1
The	1
hay	1
appeareth,	1
and	1
the	1
tender	1
grass	1
sheweth	1
itself,	1
and	1
herbs	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
gathered.	1
	1
27:26	1
The	1
lambs	1
are	1
for	1
thy	1
clothing,	1
and	1
the	1
goats	1
are	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
27:27	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
goats'	1
milk	1
enough	1
for	1
thy	1
food,	1
for	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
thy	1
household,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
maintenance	1
for	1
thy	1
maidens.	1
	1
28:1	1
The	1
wicked	1
flee	1
when	1
no	1
man	1
pursueth:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
are	1
bold	1
as	1
a	1
lion.	1
	1
28:2	1
For	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
a	1
land	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof:	1
but	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding	1
and	1
knowledge	1
the	1
state	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
prolonged.	1
	1
28:3	1
A	1
poor	1
man	1
that	1
oppresseth	1
the	1
poor	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
sweeping	1
rain	1
which	1
leaveth	1
no	1
food.	1
	1
28:4	1
They	1
that	1
forsake	1
the	1
law	1
praise	1
the	1
wicked:	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
contend	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
28:5	1
Evil	1
men	1
understand	1
not	1
judgment:	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
understand	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
28:6	1
Better	1
is	1
the	1
poor	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
his	1
uprightness,	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
perverse	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
rich.	1
	1
28:7	1
Whoso	1
keepeth	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
son:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
companion	1
of	1
riotous	1
men	1
shameth	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
28:8	1
He	1
that	1
by	1
usury	1
and	1
unjust	1
gain	1
increaseth	1
his	1
substance,	1
he	1
shall	1
gather	1
it	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
will	1
pity	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
28:9	1
He	1
that	1
turneth	1
away	1
his	1
ear	1
from	1
hearing	1
the	1
law,	1
even	1
his	1
prayer	1
shall	1
be	1
abomination.	1
	1
28:10	1
Whoso	1
causeth	1
the	1
righteous	1
to	1
go	1
astray	1
in	1
an	1
evil	1
way,	1
he	1
shall	1
fall	1
himself	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
pit:	1
but	1
the	1
upright	1
shall	1
have	1
good	1
things	1
in	1
possession.	1
	1
28:11	1
The	1
rich	1
man	1
is	1
wise	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
conceit;	1
but	1
the	1
poor	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding	1
searcheth	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
28:12	1
When	1
righteous	1
men	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
there	1
is	1
great	1
glory:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
wicked	1
rise,	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
hidden.	1
	1
28:13	1
He	1
that	1
covereth	1
his	1
sins	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper:	1
but	1
whoso	1
confesseth	1
and	1
forsaketh	1
them	1
shall	1
have	1
mercy.	1
	1
28:14	1
Happy	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
feareth	1
alway:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
hardeneth	1
his	1
heart	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
mischief.	1
	1
28:15	1
As	1
a	1
roaring	1
lion,	1
and	1
a	1
ranging	1
bear;	1
so	1
is	1
a	1
wicked	1
ruler	1
over	1
the	1
poor	1
people.	1
	1
28:16	1
The	1
prince	1
that	1
wanteth	1
understanding	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
oppressor:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
covetousness	1
shall	1
prolong	1
his	1
days.	1
	1
28:17	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
any	1
person	1
shall	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
pit;	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
stay	1
him.	1
	1
28:18	1
Whoso	1
walketh	1
uprightly	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
perverse	1
in	1
his	1
ways	1
shall	1
fall	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
28:19	1
He	1
that	1
tilleth	1
his	1
land	1
shall	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
bread:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
followeth	1
after	1
vain	1
persons	1
shall	1
have	1
poverty	1
enough.	1
	1
28:20	1
A	1
faithful	1
man	1
shall	1
abound	1
with	1
blessings:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
maketh	1
haste	1
to	1
be	1
rich	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
innocent.	1
	1
28:21	1
To	1
have	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
is	1
not	1
good:	1
for	1
for	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
that	1
man	1
will	1
transgress.	1
	1
28:22	1
He	1
that	1
hasteth	1
to	1
be	1
rich	1
hath	1
an	1
evil	1
eye,	1
and	1
considereth	1
not	1
that	1
poverty	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
28:23	1
He	1
that	1
rebuketh	1
a	1
man	1
afterwards	1
shall	1
find	1
more	1
favour	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
flattereth	1
with	1
the	1
tongue.	1
	1
28:24	1
Whoso	1
robbeth	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
saith,	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
transgression;	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
the	1
companion	1
of	1
a	1
destroyer.	1
	1
28:25	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
proud	1
heart	1
stirreth	1
up	1
strife:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
putteth	1
his	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
fat.	1
	1
28:26	1
He	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
heart	1
is	1
a	1
fool:	1
but	1
whoso	1
walketh	1
wisely,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
28:27	1
He	1
that	1
giveth	1
unto	1
the	1
poor	1
shall	1
not	1
lack:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
hideth	1
his	1
eyes	1
shall	1
have	1
many	1
a	1
curse.	1
	1
28:28	1
When	1
the	1
wicked	1
rise,	1
men	1
hide	1
themselves:	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
perish,	1
the	1
righteous	1
increase.	1
	1
29:1	1
He,	1
that	1
being	1
often	1
reproved	1
hardeneth	1
his	1
neck,	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
that	1
without	1
remedy.	1
	1
29:2	1
When	1
the	1
righteous	1
are	1
in	1
authority,	1
the	1
people	1
rejoice:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
wicked	1
beareth	1
rule,	1
the	1
people	1
mourn.	1
	1
29:3	1
Whoso	1
loveth	1
wisdom	1
rejoiceth	1
his	1
father:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
company	1
with	1
harlots	1
spendeth	1
his	1
substance.	1
	1
29:4	1
The	1
king	1
by	1
judgment	1
establisheth	1
the	1
land:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
gifts	1
overthroweth	1
it.	1
	1
29:5	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
flattereth	1
his	1
neighbour	1
spreadeth	1
a	1
net	1
for	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
29:6	1
In	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
an	1
evil	1
man	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
snare:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
doth	1
sing	1
and	1
rejoice.	1
	1
29:7	1
The	1
righteous	1
considereth	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
poor:	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
regardeth	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
29:8	1
Scornful	1
men	1
bring	1
a	1
city	1
into	1
a	1
snare:	1
but	1
wise	1
men	1
turn	1
away	1
wrath.	1
	1
29:9	1
If	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
contendeth	1
with	1
a	1
foolish	1
man,	1
whether	1
he	1
rage	1
or	1
laugh,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
rest.	1
	1
29:10	1
The	1
bloodthirsty	1
hate	1
the	1
upright:	1
but	1
the	1
just	1
seek	1
his	1
soul.	1
	1
29:11	1
A	1
fool	1
uttereth	1
all	1
his	1
mind:	1
but	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
keepeth	1
it	1
in	1
till	1
afterwards.	1
	1
29:12	1
If	1
a	1
ruler	1
hearken	1
to	1
lies,	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
are	1
wicked.	1
	1
29:13	1
The	1
poor	1
and	1
the	1
deceitful	1
man	1
meet	1
together:	1
the	1
LORD	1
lighteneth	1
both	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
29:14	1
The	1
king	1
that	1
faithfully	1
judgeth	1
the	1
poor,	1
his	1
throne	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
29:15	1
The	1
rod	1
and	1
reproof	1
give	1
wisdom:	1
but	1
a	1
child	1
left	1
to	1
himself	1
bringeth	1
his	1
mother	1
to	1
shame.	1
	1
29:16	1
When	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
multiplied,	1
transgression	1
increaseth:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
see	1
their	1
fall.	1
	1
29:17	1
Correct	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
rest;	1
yea,	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
delight	1
unto	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
29:18	1
Where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
vision,	1
the	1
people	1
perish:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
law,	1
happy	1
is	1
he.	1
	1
29:19	1
A	1
servant	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
corrected	1
by	1
words:	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
understand	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
answer.	1
	1
29:20	1
Seest	1
thou	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
hasty	1
in	1
his	1
words?	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
than	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
29:21	1
He	1
that	1
delicately	1
bringeth	1
up	1
his	1
servant	1
from	1
a	1
child	1
shall	1
have	1
him	1
become	1
his	1
son	1
at	1
the	1
length.	1
	1
29:22	1
An	1
angry	1
man	1
stirreth	1
up	1
strife,	1
and	1
a	1
furious	1
man	1
aboundeth	1
in	1
transgression.	1
	1
29:23	1
A	1
man's	1
pride	1
shall	1
bring	1
him	1
low:	1
but	1
honour	1
shall	1
uphold	1
the	1
humble	1
in	1
spirit.	1
	1
29:24	1
Whoso	1
is	1
partner	1
with	1
a	1
thief	1
hateth	1
his	1
own	1
soul:	1
he	1
heareth	1
cursing,	1
and	1
bewrayeth	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
29:25	1
The	1
fear	1
of	1
man	1
bringeth	1
a	1
snare:	1
but	1
whoso	1
putteth	1
his	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
safe.	1
	1
29:26	1
Many	1
seek	1
the	1
ruler's	1
favour;	1
but	1
every	1
man's	1
judgment	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:27	1
An	1
unjust	1
man	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
just:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
upright	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
is	1
abomination	1
to	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
30:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Agur	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jakeh,	1
even	1
the	1
prophecy:	1
the	1
man	1
spake	1
unto	1
Ithiel,	1
even	1
unto	1
Ithiel	1
and	1
Ucal,	1
30:2	1
Surely	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
brutish	1
than	1
any	1
man,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
30:3	1
I	1
neither	1
learned	1
wisdom,	1
nor	1
have	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
holy.	1
	1
30:4	1
Who	1
hath	1
ascended	1
up	1
into	1
heaven,	1
or	1
descended?	1
who	1
hath	1
gathered	1
the	1
wind	1
in	1
his	1
fists?	1
who	1
hath	1
bound	1
the	1
waters	1
in	1
a	1
garment?	1
who	1
hath	1
established	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
son's	1
name,	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
tell?	1
	1
30:5	1
Every	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
pure:	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
shield	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
30:6	1
Add	1
thou	1
not	1
unto	1
his	1
words,	1
lest	1
he	1
reprove	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
be	1
found	1
a	1
liar.	1
	1
30:7	1
Two	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
required	1
of	1
thee;	1
deny	1
me	1
them	1
not	1
before	1
I	1
die:	1
30:8	1
Remove	1
far	1
from	1
me	1
vanity	1
and	1
lies:	1
give	1
me	1
neither	1
poverty	1
nor	1
riches;	1
feed	1
me	1
with	1
food	1
convenient	1
for	1
me:	1
30:9	1
Lest	1
I	1
be	1
full,	1
and	1
deny	1
thee,	1
and	1
say,	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
LORD?	1
or	1
lest	1
I	1
be	1
poor,	1
and	1
steal,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
30:10	1
Accuse	1
not	1
a	1
servant	1
unto	1
his	1
master,	1
lest	1
he	1
curse	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
be	1
found	1
guilty.	1
	1
30:11	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
generation	1
that	1
curseth	1
their	1
father,	1
and	1
doth	1
not	1
bless	1
their	1
mother.	1
	1
30:12	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
generation	1
that	1
are	1
pure	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
yet	1
is	1
not	1
washed	1
from	1
their	1
filthiness.	1
	1
30:13	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
generation,	1
O	1
how	1
lofty	1
are	1
their	1
eyes!	1
and	1
their	1
eyelids	1
are	1
lifted	1
up.	1
	1
30:14	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
generation,	1
whose	1
teeth	1
are	1
as	1
swords,	1
and	1
their	1
jaw	1
teeth	1
as	1
knives,	1
to	1
devour	1
the	1
poor	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
from	1
among	1
men.	1
	1
30:15	1
The	1
horseleach	1
hath	1
two	1
daughters,	1
crying,	1
Give,	1
give.	1
There	1
are	1
three	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
never	1
satisfied,	1
yea,	1
four	1
things	1
say	1
not,	1
It	1
is	1
enough:	1
30:16	1
The	1
grave;	1
and	1
the	1
barren	1
womb;	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
filled	1
with	1
water;	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
saith	1
not,	1
It	1
is	1
enough.	1
	1
30:17	1
The	1
eye	1
that	1
mocketh	1
at	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
despiseth	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
mother,	1
the	1
ravens	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
shall	1
pick	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
eagles	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
30:18	1
There	1
be	1
three	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
too	1
wonderful	1
for	1
me,	1
yea,	1
four	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
not:	1
30:19	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
an	1
eagle	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
serpent	1
upon	1
a	1
rock;	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
maid.	1
	1
30:20	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
an	1
adulterous	1
woman;	1
she	1
eateth,	1
and	1
wipeth	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
saith,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
no	1
wickedness.	1
	1
30:21	1
For	1
three	1
things	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
disquieted,	1
and	1
for	1
four	1
which	1
it	1
cannot	1
bear:	1
30:22	1
For	1
a	1
servant	1
when	1
he	1
reigneth;	1
and	1
a	1
fool	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
meat;	1
30:23	1
For	1
an	1
odious	1
woman	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
married;	1
and	1
an	1
handmaid	1
that	1
is	1
heir	1
to	1
her	1
mistress.	1
	1
30:24	1
There	1
be	1
four	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
little	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
exceeding	1
wise:	1
30:25	1
The	1
ants	1
are	1
a	1
people	1
not	1
strong,	1
yet	1
they	1
prepare	1
their	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
summer;	1
30:26	1
The	1
conies	1
are	1
but	1
a	1
feeble	1
folk,	1
yet	1
make	1
they	1
their	1
houses	1
in	1
the	1
rocks;	1
30:27	1
The	1
locusts	1
have	1
no	1
king,	1
yet	1
go	1
they	1
forth	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
bands;	1
30:28	1
The	1
spider	1
taketh	1
hold	1
with	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
is	1
in	1
kings'	1
palaces.	1
	1
30:29	1
There	1
be	1
three	1
things	1
which	1
go	1
well,	1
yea,	1
four	1
are	1
comely	1
in	1
going:	1
30:30	1
A	1
lion	1
which	1
is	1
strongest	1
among	1
beasts,	1
and	1
turneth	1
not	1
away	1
for	1
any;	1
30:31	1
A	1
greyhound;	1
an	1
he	1
goat	1
also;	1
and	1
a	1
king,	1
against	1
whom	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
rising	1
up.	1
	1
30:32	1
If	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
foolishly	1
in	1
lifting	1
up	1
thyself,	1
or	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
thought	1
evil,	1
lay	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
30:33	1
Surely	1
the	1
churning	1
of	1
milk	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
butter,	1
and	1
the	1
wringing	1
of	1
the	1
nose	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
blood:	1
so	1
the	1
forcing	1
of	1
wrath	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
strife.	1
	1
31:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
king	1
Lemuel,	1
the	1
prophecy	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
taught	1
him.	1
	1
31:2	1
What,	1
my	1
son?	1
and	1
what,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
my	1
womb?	1
and	1
what,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
my	1
vows?	1
	1
31:3	1
Give	1
not	1
thy	1
strength	1
unto	1
women,	1
nor	1
thy	1
ways	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
destroyeth	1
kings.	1
	1
31:4	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
kings,	1
O	1
Lemuel,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
kings	1
to	1
drink	1
wine;	1
nor	1
for	1
princes	1
strong	1
drink:	1
31:5	1
Lest	1
they	1
drink,	1
and	1
forget	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
pervert	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
afflicted.	1
	1
31:6	1
Give	1
strong	1
drink	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
perish,	1
and	1
wine	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
heavy	1
hearts.	1
	1
31:7	1
Let	1
him	1
drink,	1
and	1
forget	1
his	1
poverty,	1
and	1
remember	1
his	1
misery	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
31:8	1
Open	1
thy	1
mouth	1
for	1
the	1
dumb	1
in	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
appointed	1
to	1
destruction.	1
	1
31:9	1
Open	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
judge	1
righteously,	1
and	1
plead	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy.	1
	1
31:10	1
Who	1
can	1
find	1
a	1
virtuous	1
woman?	1
for	1
her	1
price	1
is	1
far	1
above	1
rubies.	1
	1
31:11	1
The	1
heart	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
doth	1
safely	1
trust	1
in	1
her,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
spoil.	1
	1
31:12	1
She	1
will	1
do	1
him	1
good	1
and	1
not	1
evil	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
	1
31:13	1
She	1
seeketh	1
wool,	1
and	1
flax,	1
and	1
worketh	1
willingly	1
with	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
31:14	1
She	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
merchants'	1
ships;	1
she	1
bringeth	1
her	1
food	1
from	1
afar.	1
	1
31:15	1
She	1
riseth	1
also	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
night,	1
and	1
giveth	1
meat	1
to	1
her	1
household,	1
and	1
a	1
portion	1
to	1
her	1
maidens.	1
	1
31:16	1
She	1
considereth	1
a	1
field,	1
and	1
buyeth	1
it:	1
with	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
her	1
hands	1
she	1
planteth	1
a	1
vineyard.	1
	1
31:17	1
She	1
girdeth	1
her	1
loins	1
with	1
strength,	1
and	1
strengtheneth	1
her	1
arms.	1
	1
31:18	1
She	1
perceiveth	1
that	1
her	1
merchandise	1
is	1
good:	1
her	1
candle	1
goeth	1
not	1
out	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
31:19	1
She	1
layeth	1
her	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
spindle,	1
and	1
her	1
hands	1
hold	1
the	1
distaff.	1
	1
31:20	1
She	1
stretcheth	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
yea,	1
she	1
reacheth	1
forth	1
her	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
needy.	1
	1
31:21	1
She	1
is	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
snow	1
for	1
her	1
household:	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
household	1
are	1
clothed	1
with	1
scarlet.	1
	1
31:22	1
She	1
maketh	1
herself	1
coverings	1
of	1
tapestry;	1
her	1
clothing	1
is	1
silk	1
and	1
purple.	1
	1
31:23	1
Her	1
husband	1
is	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
gates,	1
when	1
he	1
sitteth	1
among	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
31:24	1
She	1
maketh	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
selleth	1
it;	1
and	1
delivereth	1
girdles	1
unto	1
the	1
merchant.	1
	1
31:25	1
Strength	1
and	1
honour	1
are	1
her	1
clothing;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
31:26	1
She	1
openeth	1
her	1
mouth	1
with	1
wisdom;	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
tongue	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
kindness.	1
	1
31:27	1
She	1
looketh	1
well	1
to	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
her	1
household,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
idleness.	1
	1
31:28	1
Her	1
children	1
arise	1
up,	1
and	1
call	1
her	1
blessed;	1
her	1
husband	1
also,	1
and	1
he	1
praiseth	1
her.	1
	1
31:29	1
Many	1
daughters	1
have	1
done	1
virtuously,	1
but	1
thou	1
excellest	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
31:30	1
Favour	1
is	1
deceitful,	1
and	1
beauty	1
is	1
vain:	1
but	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
feareth	1
the	1
LORD,	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
praised.	1
	1
31:31	1
Give	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
her	1
hands;	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
own	1
works	1
praise	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
gates.	1

The	1
Preacher	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Preacher,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
king	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:2	1
Vanity	1
of	1
vanities,	1
saith	1
the	1
Preacher,	1
vanity	1
of	1
vanities;	1
all	1
is	1
vanity.	1
	1
1:3	1
What	1
profit	1
hath	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
labour	1
which	1
he	1
taketh	1
under	1
the	1
sun?	1
	1
1:4	1
One	1
generation	1
passeth	1
away,	1
and	1
another	1
generation	1
cometh:	1
but	1
the	1
earth	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:5	1
The	1
sun	1
also	1
ariseth,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
goeth	1
down,	1
and	1
hasteth	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
arose.	1
	1
1:6	1
The	1
wind	1
goeth	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
turneth	1
about	1
unto	1
the	1
north;	1
it	1
whirleth	1
about	1
continually,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
returneth	1
again	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
circuits.	1

All	1

is	1
not	1
full;	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
from	1
whence	1
the	1
rivers	1
come,	1
thither	1
they	1
return	1
again.	1
	1
1:8	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
labour;	1
man	1
cannot	1
utter	1
it:	1
the	1
eye	1
is	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
seeing,	1
nor	1
the	1
ear	1
filled	1
with	1
hearing.	1
	1
1:9	1
The	1
thing	1
that	1
hath	1
been,	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
be;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
done:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
new	1
thing	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
1:10	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
thing	1
whereof	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said,	1
See,	1
this	1
is	1
new?	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
already	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
us.	1
	1
1:11	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
remembrance	1
of	1
former	1
things;	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
remembrance	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
those	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
after.	1
	1
1:12	1
I	1
the	1
Preacher	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
seek	1
and	1
search	1
out	1
by	1
wisdom	1
concerning	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
done	1
under	1
heaven:	1
this	1
sore	1
travail	1
hath	1
God	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
exercised	1
therewith.	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
are	1
done	1
under	1
the	1
sun;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
all	1
is	1
vanity	1
and	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
1:15	1
That	1
which	1
is	1
crooked	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
straight:	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
wanting	1
cannot	1
be	1
numbered.	1
	1
1:16	1
I	1
communed	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
heart,	1
saying,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
great	1
estate,	1
and	1
have	1
gotten	1
more	1
wisdom	1
than	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
yea,	1
my	1
heart	1
had	1
great	1
experience	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
know	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
madness	1
and	1
folly:	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
this	1
also	1
is	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
in	1
much	1
wisdom	1
is	1
much	1
grief:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
increaseth	1
knowledge	1
increaseth	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
mine	1
heart,	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
I	1
will	1
prove	1
thee	1
with	1
mirth,	1
therefore	1
enjoy	1
pleasure:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
this	1
also	1
is	1
vanity.	1
	1
2:2	1
I	1
said	1
of	1
laughter,	1
It	1
is	1
mad:	1
and	1
of	1
mirth,	1
What	1
doeth	1
it?	1
	1
2:3	1
I	1
sought	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
to	1
give	1
myself	1
unto	1
wine,	1
yet	1
acquainting	1
mine	1
heart	1
with	1
wisdom;	1
and	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
folly,	1
till	1
I	1
might	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
that	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
which	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
under	1
the	1
heaven	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
life.	1
	1
2:4	1
I	1
made	1
me	1
great	1
works;	1
I	1
builded	1
me	1
houses;	1
I	1
planted	1
me	1
vineyards:	1
2:5	1
I	1
made	1
me	1
gardens	1
and	1
orchards,	1
and	1
I	1
planted	1
trees	1
in	1
them	1
of	1
all	1
kind	1
of	1
fruits:	1
2:6	1
I	1
made	1
me	1
pools	1
of	1
water,	1
to	1
water	1
therewith	1
the	1
wood	1
that	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
trees:	1
2:7	1
I	1
got	1
me	1
servants	1
and	1
maidens,	1
and	1
had	1
servants	1
born	1
in	1
my	1
house;	1
also	1
I	1
had	1
great	1
possessions	1
of	1
great	1
and	1
small	1
cattle	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
before	1
me:	1
2:8	1
I	1
gathered	1
me	1
also	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
peculiar	1
treasure	1
of	1
kings	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
provinces:	1
I	1
gat	1
me	1
men	1
singers	1
and	1
women	1
singers,	1
and	1
the	1
delights	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
musical	1
instruments,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
sorts.	1
	1
2:9	1
So	1
I	1
was	1
great,	1
and	1
increased	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
also	1
my	1
wisdom	1
remained	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
mine	1
eyes	1
desired	1
I	1
kept	1
not	1
from	1
them,	1
I	1
withheld	1
not	1
my	1
heart	1
from	1
any	1
joy;	1
for	1
my	1
heart	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
labour:	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
my	1
portion	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
labour.	1
	1
2:11	1
Then	1
I	1
looked	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
my	1
hands	1
had	1
wrought,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
labour	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
laboured	1
to	1
do:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
all	1
was	1
vanity	1
and	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
profit	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
I	1
turned	1
myself	1
to	1
behold	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
madness,	1
and	1
folly:	1
for	1
what	1
can	1
the	1
man	1
do	1
that	1
cometh	1
after	1
the	1
king?	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
already	1
done.	1
	1
2:13	1
Then	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
wisdom	1
excelleth	1
folly,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
light	1
excelleth	1
darkness.	1
	1
2:14	1
The	1
wise	1
man's	1
eyes	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
head;	1
but	1
the	1
fool	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness:	1
and	1
I	1
myself	1
perceived	1
also	1
that	1
one	1
event	1
happeneth	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
2:15	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
in	1
my	1
heart,	1
As	1
it	1
happeneth	1
to	1
the	1
fool,	1
so	1
it	1
happeneth	1
even	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
why	1
was	1
I	1
then	1
more	1
wise?	1
Then	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
my	1
heart,	1
that	1
this	1
also	1
is	1
vanity.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
more	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
fool	1
for	1
ever;	1
seeing	1
that	1
which	1
now	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
to	1
come	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
	1
And	1
how	1
dieth	1
the	1
wise	1
man?	1
as	1
the	1
fool.	1
	1
2:17	1
Therefore	1
I	1
hated	1
life;	1
because	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
is	1
wrought	1
under	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
grievous	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
all	1
is	1
vanity	1
and	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
2:18	1
Yea,	1
I	1
hated	1
all	1
my	1
labour	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
taken	1
under	1
the	1
sun:	1
because	1
I	1
should	1
leave	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
who	1
knoweth	1
whether	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
fool?	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
have	1
rule	1
over	1
all	1
my	1
labour	1
wherein	1
I	1
have	1
laboured,	1
and	1
wherein	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
myself	1
wise	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
This	1
is	1
also	1
vanity.	1
	1
2:20	1
Therefore	1
I	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
cause	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
despair	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
labour	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
labour	1
is	1
in	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
equity;	1
yet	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
laboured	1
therein	1
shall	1
he	1
leave	1
it	1
for	1
his	1
portion.	1
This	1
also	1
is	1
vanity	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
evil.	1
	1
2:22	1
For	1
what	1
hath	1
man	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
labour,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
vexation	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
laboured	1
under	1
the	1
sun?	1
	1
2:23	1
For	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
are	1
sorrows,	1
and	1
his	1
travail	1
grief;	1
yea,	1
his	1
heart	1
taketh	1
not	1
rest	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
This	1
is	1
also	1
vanity.	1
	1
2:24	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
better	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
his	1
soul	1
enjoy	1
good	1
in	1
his	1
labour.	1
This	1
also	1
I	1
saw,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
who	1
can	1
eat,	1
or	1
who	1
else	1
can	1
hasten	1
hereunto,	1
more	1
than	1
I?	1
2:26	1
For	1
God	1
giveth	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
his	1
sight	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
joy:	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
sinner	1
he	1
giveth	1
travail,	1
to	1
gather	1
and	1
to	1
heap	1
up,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
before	1
God.	1
This	1
also	1
is	1
vanity	1
and	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
3:1	1
To	1
every	1
thing	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
season,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
every	1
purpose	1
under	1
the	1
heaven:	1
3:2	1
A	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
born,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
die;	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
plant,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
pluck	1
up	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
planted;	1
3:3	1
A	1
time	1
to	1
kill,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
heal;	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
break	1
down,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
build	1
up;	1
3:4	1
A	1
time	1
to	1
weep,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
laugh;	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
mourn,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
dance;	1
3:5	1
A	1
time	1
to	1
cast	1
away	1
stones,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
gather	1
stones	1
together;	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
embrace,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
embracing;	1
3:6	1
A	1
time	1
to	1
get,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
lose;	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
keep,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
cast	1
away;	1
3:7	1
A	1
time	1
to	1
rend,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
sew;	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
keep	1
silence,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
speak;	1
3:8	1
A	1
time	1
to	1
love,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
hate;	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
3:9	1
What	1
profit	1
hath	1
he	1
that	1
worketh	1
in	1
that	1
wherein	1
he	1
laboureth?	1
3:10	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
travail,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
exercised	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
3:11	1
He	1
hath	1
made	1
every	1
thing	1
beautiful	1
in	1
his	1
time:	1
also	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
God	1
maketh	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
3:12	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
in	1
them,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
enjoy	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
labour,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:14	1
I	1
know	1
that,	1
whatsoever	1
God	1
doeth,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
ever:	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
it,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
taken	1
from	1
it:	1
and	1
God	1
doeth	1
it,	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
fear	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:15	1
That	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
is	1
now;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
hath	1
already	1
been;	1
and	1
God	1
requireth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
past.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
sun	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
judgment,	1
that	1
wickedness	1
was	1
there;	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
that	1
iniquity	1
was	1
there.	1
	1
3:17	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
mine	1
heart,	1
God	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
the	1
wicked:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
for	1
every	1
purpose	1
and	1
for	1
every	1
work.	1
	1
3:18	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
concerning	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
that	1
God	1
might	1
manifest	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
themselves	1
are	1
beasts.	1
	1
3:19	1
For	1
that	1
which	1
befalleth	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
befalleth	1
beasts;	1
even	1
one	1
thing	1
befalleth	1
them:	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
dieth,	1
so	1
dieth	1
the	1
other;	1
yea,	1
they	1
have	1
all	1
one	1
breath;	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
hath	1
no	1
preeminence	1
above	1
a	1
beast:	1
for	1
all	1
is	1
vanity.	1
	1
3:20	1
All	1
go	1
unto	1
one	1
place;	1
all	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
all	1
turn	1
to	1
dust	1
again.	1
	1
3:21	1
Who	1
knoweth	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
goeth	1
upward,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
goeth	1
downward	1
to	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
3:22	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
better,	1
than	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
works;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
portion:	1
for	1
who	1
shall	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
after	1
him?	1
	1
4:1	1
So	1
I	1
returned,	1
and	1
considered	1
all	1
the	1
oppressions	1
that	1
are	1
done	1
under	1
the	1
sun:	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
oppressed,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
comforter;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
their	1
oppressors	1
there	1
was	1
power;	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
comforter.	1
	1
4:2	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
praised	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
are	1
already	1
dead	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
living	1
which	1
are	1
yet	1
alive.	1
	1
4:3	1
Yea,	1
better	1
is	1
he	1
than	1
both	1
they,	1
which	1
hath	1
not	1
yet	1
been,	1
who	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
evil	1
work	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
4:4	1
Again,	1
I	1
considered	1
all	1
travail,	1
and	1
every	1
right	1
work,	1
that	1
for	1
this	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
envied	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
This	1
is	1
also	1
vanity	1
and	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
4:5	1
The	1
fool	1
foldeth	1
his	1
hands	1
together,	1
and	1
eateth	1
his	1
own	1
flesh.	1
	1
4:6	1
Better	1
is	1
an	1
handful	1
with	1
quietness,	1
than	1
both	1
the	1
hands	1
full	1
with	1
travail	1
and	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
4:7	1
Then	1
I	1
returned,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
vanity	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
4:8	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
alone,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
second;	1
yea,	1
he	1
hath	1
neither	1
child	1
nor	1
brother:	1
yet	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
labour;	1
neither	1
is	1
his	1
eye	1
satisfied	1
with	1
riches;	1
neither	1
saith	1
he,	1
For	1
whom	1
do	1
I	1
labour,	1
and	1
bereave	1
my	1
soul	1
of	1
good?	1
This	1
is	1
also	1
vanity,	1
yea,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sore	1
travail.	1
	1
4:9	1
Two	1
are	1
better	1
than	1
one;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
reward	1
for	1
their	1
labour.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
fall,	1
the	1
one	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
fellow:	1
but	1
woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
alone	1
when	1
he	1
falleth;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
another	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
up.	1
	1
4:11	1
Again,	1
if	1
two	1
lie	1
together,	1
then	1
they	1
have	1
heat:	1
but	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
be	1
warm	1
alone?	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
if	1
one	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
two	1
shall	1
withstand	1
him;	1
and	1
a	1
threefold	1
cord	1
is	1
not	1
quickly	1
broken.	1
	1
4:13	1
Better	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
and	1
a	1
wise	1
child	1
than	1
an	1
old	1
and	1
foolish	1
king,	1
who	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
admonished.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
reign;	1
whereas	1
also	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom	1
becometh	1
poor.	1
	1
4:15	1
I	1
considered	1
all	1
the	1
living	1
which	1
walk	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
with	1
the	1
second	1
child	1
that	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
4:16	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
before	1
them:	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
come	1
after	1
shall	1
not	1
rejoice	1
in	1
him.	1
Surely	1
this	1
also	1
is	1
vanity	1
and	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
5:1	1
Keep	1
thy	1
foot	1
when	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
be	1
more	1
ready	1
to	1
hear,	1
than	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
fools:	1
for	1
they	1
consider	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
5:2	1
Be	1
not	1
rash	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
thine	1
heart	1
be	1
hasty	1
to	1
utter	1
any	1
thing	1
before	1
God:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
thou	1
upon	1
earth:	1
therefore	1
let	1
thy	1
words	1
be	1
few.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
a	1
dream	1
cometh	1
through	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
business;	1
and	1
a	1
fool's	1
voice	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
multitude	1
of	1
words.	1
	1
5:4	1
When	1
thou	1
vowest	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
God,	1
defer	1
not	1
to	1
pay	1
it;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
fools:	1
pay	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
vowed.	1
	1
5:5	1
Better	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
vow,	1
than	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
vow	1
and	1
not	1
pay.	1
	1
5:6	1
Suffer	1
not	1
thy	1
mouth	1
to	1
cause	1
thy	1
flesh	1
to	1
sin;	1
neither	1
say	1
thou	1
before	1
the	1
angel,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
error:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
God	1
be	1
angry	1
at	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hands?	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
dreams	1
and	1
many	1
words	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
divers	1
vanities:	1
but	1
fear	1
thou	1
God.	1
	1
5:8	1
If	1
thou	1
seest	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
violent	1
perverting	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice	1
in	1
a	1
province,	1
marvel	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
matter:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
highest	1
regardeth;	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
higher	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
5:9	1
Moreover	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
for	1
all:	1
the	1
king	1
himself	1
is	1
served	1
by	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
5:10	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
silver	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
silver;	1
nor	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
abundance	1
with	1
increase:	1
this	1
is	1
also	1
vanity.	1
	1
5:11	1
When	1
goods	1
increase,	1
they	1
are	1
increased	1
that	1
eat	1
them:	1
and	1
what	1
good	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
owners	1
thereof,	1
saving	1
the	1
beholding	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
eyes?	1
	1
5:12	1
The	1
sleep	1
of	1
a	1
labouring	1
man	1
is	1
sweet,	1
whether	1
he	1
eat	1
little	1
or	1
much:	1
but	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
him	1
to	1
sleep.	1
	1
5:13	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
sore	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
namely,	1
riches	1
kept	1
for	1
the	1
owners	1
thereof	1
to	1
their	1
hurt.	1
	1
5:14	1
But	1
those	1
riches	1
perish	1
by	1
evil	1
travail:	1
and	1
he	1
begetteth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
5:15	1
As	1
he	1
came	1
forth	1
of	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
naked	1
shall	1
he	1
return	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
he	1
came,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
nothing	1
of	1
his	1
labour,	1
which	1
he	1
may	1
carry	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
this	1
also	1
is	1
a	1
sore	1
evil,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
points	1
as	1
he	1
came,	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
go:	1
and	1
what	1
profit	1
hath	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
laboured	1
for	1
the	1
wind?	1
5:17	1
All	1
his	1
days	1
also	1
he	1
eateth	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
much	1
sorrow	1
and	1
wrath	1
with	1
his	1
sickness.	1
	1
5:18	1
Behold	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen:	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
comely	1
for	1
one	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
labour	1
that	1
he	1
taketh	1
under	1
the	1
sun	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
which	1
God	1
giveth	1
him:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
portion.	1
	1
5:19	1
Every	1
man	1
also	1
to	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
riches	1
and	1
wealth,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
power	1
to	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
portion,	1
and	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
labour;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:20	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
much	1
remember	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life;	1
because	1
God	1
answereth	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
6:1	1
There	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
common	1
among	1
men:	1
6:2	1
A	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
riches,	1
wealth,	1
and	1
honour,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
wanteth	1
nothing	1
for	1
his	1
soul	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
desireth,	1
yet	1
God	1
giveth	1
him	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
but	1
a	1
stranger	1
eateth	1
it:	1
this	1
is	1
vanity,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
disease.	1
	1
6:3	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
beget	1
an	1
hundred	1
children,	1
and	1
live	1
many	1
years,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
years	1
be	1
many,	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
be	1
not	1
filled	1
with	1
good,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
he	1
have	1
no	1
burial;	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
an	1
untimely	1
birth	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
he	1
cometh	1
in	1
with	1
vanity,	1
and	1
departeth	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
covered	1
with	1
darkness.	1
	1
6:5	1
Moreover	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
sun,	1
nor	1
known	1
any	1
thing:	1
this	1
hath	1
more	1
rest	1
than	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
6:6	1
Yea,	1
though	1
he	1
live	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
twice	1
told,	1
yet	1
hath	1
he	1
seen	1
no	1
good:	1
do	1
not	1
all	1
go	1
to	1
one	1
place?	1
	1
6:7	1
All	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
for	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
appetite	1
is	1
not	1
filled.	1
	1
6:8	1
For	1
what	1
hath	1
the	1
wise	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
fool?	1
what	1
hath	1
the	1
poor,	1
that	1
knoweth	1
to	1
walk	1
before	1
the	1
living?	1
	1
6:9	1
Better	1
is	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
than	1
the	1
wandering	1
of	1
the	1
desire:	1
this	1
is	1
also	1
vanity	1
and	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
6:10	1
That	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
is	1
named	1
already,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
known	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
man:	1
neither	1
may	1
he	1
contend	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
mightier	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
6:11	1
Seeing	1
there	1
be	1
many	1
things	1
that	1
increase	1
vanity,	1
what	1
is	1
man	1
the	1
better?	1
	1
6:12	1
For	1
who	1
knoweth	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
man	1
in	1
this	1
life,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
vain	1
life	1
which	1
he	1
spendeth	1
as	1
a	1
shadow?	1
for	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
a	1
man	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
after	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
sun?	1
	1
7:1	1
A	1
good	1
name	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
precious	1
ointment;	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
death	1
than	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
one's	1
birth.	1
	1
7:2	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning,	1
than	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
feasting:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
men;	1
and	1
the	1
living	1
will	1
lay	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
7:3	1
Sorrow	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
laughter:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
sadness	1
of	1
the	1
countenance	1
the	1
heart	1
is	1
made	1
better.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning;	1
but	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
fools	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mirth.	1
	1
7:5	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
fools.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
crackling	1
of	1
thorns	1
under	1
a	1
pot,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
fool:	1
this	1
also	1
is	1
vanity.	1
	1
7:7	1
Surely	1
oppression	1
maketh	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
mad;	1
and	1
a	1
gift	1
destroyeth	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
7:8	1
Better	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
thing	1
than	1
the	1
beginning	1
thereof:	1
and	1
the	1
patient	1
in	1
spirit	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
proud	1
in	1
spirit.	1
	1
7:9	1
Be	1
not	1
hasty	1
in	1
thy	1
spirit	1
to	1
be	1
angry:	1
for	1
anger	1
resteth	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
fools.	1
	1
7:10	1
Say	1
not	1
thou,	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
days	1
were	1
better	1
than	1
these?	1
for	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
enquire	1
wisely	1
concerning	1
this.	1
	1
7:11	1
Wisdom	1
is	1
good	1
with	1
an	1
inheritance:	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
there	1
is	1
profit	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
see	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
7:12	1
For	1
wisdom	1
is	1
a	1
defence,	1
and	1
money	1
is	1
a	1
defence:	1
but	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
knowledge	1
is,	1
that	1
wisdom	1
giveth	1
life	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
it.	1
	1
7:13	1
Consider	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
who	1
can	1
make	1
that	1
straight,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
crooked?	1
	1
7:14	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
prosperity	1
be	1
joyful,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
adversity	1
consider:	1
God	1
also	1
hath	1
set	1
the	1
one	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
other,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
man	1
should	1
find	1
nothing	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
7:15	1
All	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
vanity:	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
that	1
perisheth	1
in	1
his	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
that	1
prolongeth	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
his	1
wickedness.	1
	1
7:16	1
Be	1
not	1
righteous	1
over	1
much;	1
neither	1
make	1
thyself	1
over	1
wise:	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
destroy	1
thyself	1
?	1
	1
7:17	1
Be	1
not	1
over	1
much	1
wicked,	1
neither	1
be	1
thou	1
foolish:	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
die	1
before	1
thy	1
time?	1
	1
7:18	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
this;	1
yea,	1
also	1
from	1
this	1
withdraw	1
not	1
thine	1
hand:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
feareth	1
God	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
7:19	1
Wisdom	1
strengtheneth	1
the	1
wise	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
mighty	1
men	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
7:20	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
upon	1
earth,	1
that	1
doeth	1
good,	1
and	1
sinneth	1
not.	1
	1
7:21	1
Also	1
take	1
no	1
heed	1
unto	1
all	1
words	1
that	1
are	1
spoken;	1
lest	1
thou	1
hear	1
thy	1
servant	1
curse	1
thee:	1
7:22	1
For	1
oftentimes	1
also	1
thine	1
own	1
heart	1
knoweth	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
likewise	1
hast	1
cursed	1
others.	1
	1
7:23	1
All	1
this	1
have	1
I	1
proved	1
by	1
wisdom:	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
wise;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
7:24	1
That	1
which	1
is	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
exceeding	1
deep,	1
who	1
can	1
find	1
it	1
out?	1
7:25	1
I	1
applied	1
mine	1
heart	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
to	1
search,	1
and	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
things,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
folly,	1
even	1
of	1
foolishness	1
and	1
madness:	1
7:26	1
And	1
I	1
find	1
more	1
bitter	1
than	1
death	1
the	1
woman,	1
whose	1
heart	1
is	1
snares	1
and	1
nets,	1
and	1
her	1
hands	1
as	1
bands:	1
whoso	1
pleaseth	1
God	1
shall	1
escape	1
from	1
her;	1
but	1
the	1
sinner	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
by	1
her.	1
	1
7:27	1
Behold,	1
this	1
have	1
I	1
found,	1
saith	1
the	1
preacher,	1
counting	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
account:	1
7:28	1
Which	1
yet	1
my	1
soul	1
seeketh,	1
but	1
I	1
find	1
not:	1
one	1
man	1
among	1
a	1
thousand	1
have	1
I	1
found;	1
but	1
a	1
woman	1
among	1
all	1
those	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
found.	1
	1
7:29	1
Lo,	1
this	1
only	1
have	1
I	1
found,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
man	1
upright;	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
sought	1
out	1
many	1
inventions.	1
	1
8:1	1
Who	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
wise	1
man?	1
and	1
who	1
knoweth	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
a	1
thing?	1
	1
a	1
man's	1
wisdom	1
maketh	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
shine,	1
and	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
shall	1
be	1
changed.	1
	1
8:2	1
I	1
counsel	1
thee	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
regard	1
of	1
the	1
oath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:3	1
Be	1
not	1
hasty	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight:	1
stand	1
not	1
in	1
an	1
evil	1
thing;	1
for	1
he	1
doeth	1
whatsoever	1
pleaseth	1
him.	1
	1
8:4	1
Where	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
a	1
king	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
power:	1
and	1
who	1
may	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
doest	1
thou?	1
	1
8:5	1
Whoso	1
keepeth	1
the	1
commandment	1
shall	1
feel	1
no	1
evil	1
thing:	1
and	1
a	1
wise	1
man's	1
heart	1
discerneth	1
both	1
time	1
and	1
judgment.	1
	1
8:6	1
Because	1
to	1
every	1
purpose	1
there	1
is	1
time	1
and	1
judgment,	1
therefore	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
great	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
be:	1
for	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
him	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
be?	1
	1
8:8	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
spirit	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
spirit;	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
death:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
discharge	1
in	1
that	1
war;	1
neither	1
shall	1
wickedness	1
deliver	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
8:9	1
All	1
this	1
have	1
I	1
seen,	1
and	1
applied	1
my	1
heart	1
unto	1
every	1
work	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
under	1
the	1
sun:	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
wherein	1
one	1
man	1
ruleth	1
over	1
another	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
hurt.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
wicked	1
buried,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
and	1
gone	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
holy,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
forgotten	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
done:	1
this	1
is	1
also	1
vanity.	1
	1
8:11	1
Because	1
sentence	1
against	1
an	1
evil	1
work	1
is	1
not	1
executed	1
speedily,	1
therefore	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
is	1
fully	1
set	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
8:12	1
Though	1
a	1
sinner	1
do	1
evil	1
an	1
hundred	1
times,	1
and	1
his	1
days	1
be	1
prolonged,	1
yet	1
surely	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
God,	1
which	1
fear	1
before	1
him:	1
8:13	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
wicked,	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
prolong	1
his	1
days,	1
which	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
shadow;	1
because	1
he	1
feareth	1
not	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
8:14	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
vanity	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
just	1
men,	1
unto	1
whom	1
it	1
happeneth	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
wicked;	1
again,	1
there	1
be	1
wicked	1
men,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
happeneth	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
righteous:	1
I	1
said	1
that	1
this	1
also	1
is	1
vanity.	1
	1
8:15	1
Then	1
I	1
commended	1
mirth,	1
because	1
a	1
man	1
hath	1
no	1
better	1
thing	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
than	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
merry:	1
for	1
that	1
shall	1
abide	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
labour	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
which	1
God	1
giveth	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
8:16	1
When	1
I	1
applied	1
mine	1
heart	1
to	1
know	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
business	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
(for	1
also	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
neither	1
day	1
nor	1
night	1
seeth	1
sleep	1
with	1
his	1
eyes:)	1
8:17	1
Then	1
I	1
beheld	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
cannot	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
under	1
the	1
sun:	1
because	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
labour	1
to	1
seek	1
it	1
out,	1
yet	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it;	1
yea	1
farther;	1
though	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
think	1
to	1
know	1
it,	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
9:1	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
considered	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
even	1
to	1
declare	1
all	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
their	1
works,	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God:	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
either	1
love	1
or	1
hatred	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
9:2	1
All	1
things	1
come	1
alike	1
to	1
all:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
event	1
to	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wicked;	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
clean,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
unclean;	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sacrificeth,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sacrificeth	1
not:	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
good,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
sinner;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sweareth,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
feareth	1
an	1
oath.	1
	1
9:3	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
among	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
done	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
event	1
unto	1
all:	1
yea,	1
also	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
evil,	1
and	1
madness	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
heart	1
while	1
they	1
live,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
9:4	1
For	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
living	1
there	1
is	1
hope:	1
for	1
a	1
living	1
dog	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
dead	1
lion.	1
	1
9:5	1
For	1
the	1
living	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
die:	1
but	1
the	1
dead	1
know	1
not	1
any	1
thing,	1
neither	1
have	1
they	1
any	1
more	1
a	1
reward;	1
for	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
forgotten.	1
	1
9:6	1
Also	1
their	1
love,	1
and	1
their	1
hatred,	1
and	1
their	1
envy,	1
is	1
now	1
perished;	1
neither	1
have	1
they	1
any	1
more	1
a	1
portion	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
9:7	1
Go	1
thy	1
way,	1
eat	1
thy	1
bread	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
drink	1
thy	1
wine	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
heart;	1
for	1
God	1
now	1
accepteth	1
thy	1
works.	1
	1
9:8	1
Let	1
thy	1
garments	1
be	1
always	1
white;	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
head	1
lack	1
no	1
ointment.	1
	1
9:9	1
Live	1
joyfully	1
with	1
the	1
wife	1
whom	1
thou	1
lovest	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
thy	1
vanity,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
vanity:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
thy	1
portion	1
in	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
labour	1
which	1
thou	1
takest	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
9:10	1
Whatsoever	1
thy	1
hand	1
findeth	1
to	1
do,	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
thy	1
might;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
work,	1
nor	1
device,	1
nor	1
knowledge,	1
nor	1
wisdom,	1
in	1
the	1
grave,	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
9:11	1
I	1
returned,	1
and	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
that	1
the	1
race	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
swift,	1
nor	1
the	1
battle	1
to	1
the	1
strong,	1
neither	1
yet	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
wise,	1
nor	1
yet	1
riches	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
understanding,	1
nor	1
yet	1
favour	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
skill;	1
but	1
time	1
and	1
chance	1
happeneth	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
9:12	1
For	1
man	1
also	1
knoweth	1
not	1
his	1
time:	1
as	1
the	1
fishes	1
that	1
are	1
taken	1
in	1
an	1
evil	1
net,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
birds	1
that	1
are	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
snare;	1
so	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
snared	1
in	1
an	1
evil	1
time,	1
when	1
it	1
falleth	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
9:13	1
This	1
wisdom	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
also	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
great	1
unto	1
me:	1
9:14	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
city,	1
and	1
few	1
men	1
within	1
it;	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
king	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
besieged	1
it,	1
and	1
built	1
great	1
bulwarks	1
against	1
it:	1
9:15	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
poor	1
wise	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
by	1
his	1
wisdom	1
delivered	1
the	1
city;	1
yet	1
no	1
man	1
remembered	1
that	1
same	1
poor	1
man.	1
	1
9:16	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Wisdom	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
strength:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
poor	1
man's	1
wisdom	1
is	1
despised,	1
and	1
his	1
words	1
are	1
not	1
heard.	1
	1
9:17	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
wise	1
men	1
are	1
heard	1
in	1
quiet	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
ruleth	1
among	1
fools.	1
	1
9:18	1
Wisdom	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
weapons	1
of	1
war:	1
but	1
one	1
sinner	1
destroyeth	1
much	1
good.	1
	1
10:1	1
Dead	1
flies	1
cause	1
the	1
ointment	1
of	1
the	1
apothecary	1
to	1
send	1
forth	1
a	1
stinking	1
savour:	1
so	1
doth	1
a	1
little	1
folly	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
reputation	1
for	1
wisdom	1
and	1
honour.	1
	1
10:2	1
A	1
wise	1
man's	1
heart	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
right	1
hand;	1
but	1
a	1
fool's	1
heart	1
at	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
10:3	1
Yea	1
also,	1
when	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
fool	1
walketh	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
his	1
wisdom	1
faileth	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
fool.	1
	1
10:4	1
If	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
thee,	1
leave	1
not	1
thy	1
place;	1
for	1
yielding	1
pacifieth	1
great	1
offences.	1
	1
10:5	1
There	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
as	1
an	1
error	1
which	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
ruler:	1
10:6	1
Folly	1
is	1
set	1
in	1
great	1
dignity,	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
sit	1
in	1
low	1
place.	1
	1
10:7	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
servants	1
upon	1
horses,	1
and	1
princes	1
walking	1
as	1
servants	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
10:8	1
He	1
that	1
diggeth	1
a	1
pit	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
it;	1
and	1
whoso	1
breaketh	1
an	1
hedge,	1
a	1
serpent	1
shall	1
bite	1
him.	1
	1
10:9	1
Whoso	1
removeth	1
stones	1
shall	1
be	1
hurt	1
therewith;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
cleaveth	1
wood	1
shall	1
be	1
endangered	1
thereby.	1
	1
10:10	1
If	1
the	1
iron	1
be	1
blunt,	1
and	1
he	1
do	1
not	1
whet	1
the	1
edge,	1
then	1
must	1
he	1
put	1
to	1
more	1
strength:	1
but	1
wisdom	1
is	1
profitable	1
to	1
direct.	1
	1
10:11	1
Surely	1
the	1
serpent	1
will	1
bite	1
without	1
enchantment;	1
and	1
a	1
babbler	1
is	1
no	1
better.	1
	1
10:12	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
wise	1
man's	1
mouth	1
are	1
gracious;	1
but	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
will	1
swallow	1
up	1
himself.	1
	1
10:13	1
The	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
is	1
foolishness:	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
talk	1
is	1
mischievous	1
madness.	1
	1
10:14	1
A	1
fool	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
words:	1
a	1
man	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
shall	1
be;	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
after	1
him,	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
him?	1
	1
10:15	1
The	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
foolish	1
wearieth	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
because	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
10:16	1
Woe	1
to	1
thee,	1
O	1
land,	1
when	1
thy	1
king	1
is	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
thy	1
princes	1
eat	1
in	1
the	1
morning!	1
	1
10:17	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
land,	1
when	1
thy	1
king	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
nobles,	1
and	1
thy	1
princes	1
eat	1
in	1
due	1
season,	1
for	1
strength,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
drunkenness!	1
	1
10:18	1
By	1
much	1
slothfulness	1
the	1
building	1
decayeth;	1
and	1
through	1
idleness	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
the	1
house	1
droppeth	1
through.	1
	1
10:19	1
A	1
feast	1
is	1
made	1
for	1
laughter,	1
and	1
wine	1
maketh	1
merry:	1
but	1
money	1
answereth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
10:20	1
Curse	1
not	1
the	1
king,	1
no	1
not	1
in	1
thy	1
thought;	1
and	1
curse	1
not	1
the	1
rich	1
in	1
thy	1
bedchamber:	1
for	1
a	1
bird	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
shall	1
carry	1
the	1
voice,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
hath	1
wings	1
shall	1
tell	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
11:1	1
Cast	1
thy	1
bread	1
upon	1
the	1
waters:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
it	1
after	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
11:2	1
Give	1
a	1
portion	1
to	1
seven,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
eight;	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
what	1
evil	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:3	1
If	1
the	1
clouds	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
rain,	1
they	1
empty	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
tree	1
fall	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
or	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
tree	1
falleth,	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
11:4	1
He	1
that	1
observeth	1
the	1
wind	1
shall	1
not	1
sow;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
regardeth	1
the	1
clouds	1
shall	1
not	1
reap.	1
	1
11:5	1
As	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
spirit,	1
nor	1
how	1
the	1
bones	1
do	1
grow	1
in	1
the	1
womb	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
child:	1
even	1
so	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God	1
who	1
maketh	1
all.	1
	1
11:6	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
sow	1
thy	1
seed,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
withhold	1
not	1
thine	1
hand:	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
whether	1
shall	1
prosper,	1
either	1
this	1
or	1
that,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
both	1
shall	1
be	1
alike	1
good.	1
	1
11:7	1
Truly	1
the	1
light	1
is	1
sweet,	1
and	1
a	1
pleasant	1
thing	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
eyes	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
sun:	1
11:8	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
live	1
many	1
years,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
them	1
all;	1
yet	1
let	1
him	1
remember	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
darkness;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
many.	1
All	1
that	1
cometh	1
is	1
vanity.	1
	1
11:9	1
Rejoice,	1
O	1
young	1
man,	1
in	1
thy	1
youth;	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
heart	1
cheer	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
thine	1
eyes:	1
but	1
know	1
thou,	1
that	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
God	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
judgment.	1
	1
11:10	1
Therefore	1
remove	1
sorrow	1
from	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
put	1
away	1
evil	1
from	1
thy	1
flesh:	1
for	1
childhood	1
and	1
youth	1
are	1
vanity.	1
	1
12:1	1
Remember	1
now	1
thy	1
Creator	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
while	1
the	1
evil	1
days	1
come	1
not,	1
nor	1
the	1
years	1
draw	1
nigh,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
them;	1
12:2	1
While	1
the	1
sun,	1
or	1
the	1
light,	1
or	1
the	1
moon,	1
or	1
the	1
stars,	1
be	1
not	1
darkened,	1
nor	1
the	1
clouds	1
return	1
after	1
the	1
rain:	1
12:3	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
shall	1
tremble,	1
and	1
the	1
strong	1
men	1
shall	1
bow	1
themselves,	1
and	1
the	1
grinders	1
cease	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
few,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
be	1
darkened,	1
12:4	1
And	1
the	1
doors	1
shall	1
be	1
shut	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
grinding	1
is	1
low,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bird,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
musick	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
low;	1
12:5	1
Also	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
high,	1
and	1
fears	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
almond	1
tree	1
shall	1
flourish,	1
and	1
the	1
grasshopper	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
burden,	1
and	1
desire	1
shall	1
fail:	1
because	1
man	1
goeth	1
to	1
his	1
long	1
home,	1
and	1
the	1
mourners	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
streets:	1
12:6	1
Or	1
ever	1
the	1
silver	1
cord	1
be	1
loosed,	1
or	1
the	1
golden	1
bowl	1
be	1
broken,	1
or	1
the	1
pitcher	1
be	1
broken	1
at	1
the	1
fountain,	1
or	1
the	1
wheel	1
broken	1
at	1
the	1
cistern.	1
	1
12:7	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
dust	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
it	1
was:	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
God	1
who	1
gave	1
it.	1
	1
12:8	1
Vanity	1
of	1
vanities,	1
saith	1
the	1
preacher;	1
all	1
is	1
vanity.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
moreover,	1
because	1
the	1
preacher	1
was	1
wise,	1
he	1
still	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
knowledge;	1
yea,	1
he	1
gave	1
good	1
heed,	1
and	1
sought	1
out,	1
and	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
many	1
proverbs.	1
	1
12:10	1
The	1
preacher	1
sought	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
acceptable	1
words:	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
was	1
upright,	1
even	1
words	1
of	1
truth.	1
	1
12:11	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
are	1
as	1
goads,	1
and	1
as	1
nails	1
fastened	1
by	1
the	1
masters	1
of	1
assemblies,	1
which	1
are	1
given	1
from	1
one	1
shepherd.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
further,	1
by	1
these,	1
my	1
son,	1
be	1
admonished:	1
of	1
making	1
many	1
books	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
end;	1
and	1
much	1
study	1
is	1
a	1
weariness	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
12:13	1
Let	1
us	1
hear	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
matter:	1
Fear	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
duty	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
12:14	1
For	1
God	1
shall	1
bring	1
every	1
work	1
into	1
judgment,	1
with	1
every	1
secret	1
thing,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good,	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
evil.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Song	1
of	1
Solomon	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
song	1
of	1
songs,	1
which	1
is	1
Solomon's.	1
	1
1:2	1
Let	1
him	1
kiss	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
kisses	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
for	1
thy	1
love	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
wine.	1
	1
1:3	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
thy	1
good	1
ointments	1
thy	1
name	1
is	1
as	1
ointment	1
poured	1
forth,	1
therefore	1
do	1
the	1
virgins	1
love	1
thee.	1
	1
1:4	1
Draw	1
me,	1
we	1
will	1
run	1
after	1
thee:	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
brought	1
me	1
into	1
his	1
chambers:	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thee,	1
we	1
will	1
remember	1
thy	1
love	1
more	1
than	1
wine:	1
the	1
upright	1
love	1
thee.	1
	1
1:5	1
I	1
am	1
black,	1
but	1
comely,	1
O	1
ye	1
daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
as	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Kedar,	1
as	1
the	1
curtains	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
	1
1:6	1
Look	1
not	1
upon	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
black,	1
because	1
the	1
sun	1
hath	1
looked	1
upon	1
me:	1
my	1
mother's	1
children	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
me;	1
they	1
made	1
me	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards;	1
but	1
mine	1
own	1
vineyard	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
kept.	1
	1
1:7	1
Tell	1
me,	1
O	1
thou	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
loveth,	1
where	1
thou	1
feedest,	1
where	1
thou	1
makest	1
thy	1
flock	1
to	1
rest	1
at	1
noon:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
turneth	1
aside	1
by	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
thy	1
companions?	1
	1
1:8	1
If	1
thou	1
know	1
not,	1
O	1
thou	1
fairest	1
among	1
women,	1
go	1
thy	1
way	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
feed	1
thy	1
kids	1
beside	1
the	1
shepherds'	1
tents.	1
	1
1:9	1
I	1
have	1
compared	1
thee,	1
O	1
my	1
love,	1
to	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
horses	1
in	1
Pharaoh's	1
chariots.	1
	1
1:10	1
Thy	1
cheeks	1
are	1
comely	1
with	1
rows	1
of	1
jewels,	1
thy	1
neck	1
with	1
chains	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
1:11	1
We	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
borders	1
of	1
gold	1
with	1
studs	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
1:12	1
While	1
the	1
king	1
sitteth	1
at	1
his	1
table,	1
my	1
spikenard	1
sendeth	1
forth	1
the	1
smell	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:13	1
A	1
bundle	1
of	1
myrrh	1
is	1
my	1
well-beloved	1
unto	1
me;	1
he	1
shall	1
lie	1
all	1
night	1
betwixt	1
my	1
breasts.	1
	1
1:14	1
My	1
beloved	1
is	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
camphire	1
in	1
the	1
vineyards	1
of	1
Engedi.	1
	1
1:15	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
fair,	1
my	1
love;	1
behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
fair;	1
thou	1
hast	1
doves'	1
eyes.	1
	1
1:16	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
fair,	1
my	1
beloved,	1
yea,	1
pleasant:	1
also	1
our	1
bed	1
is	1
green.	1
	1
1:17	1
The	1
beams	1
of	1
our	1
house	1
are	1
cedar,	1
and	1
our	1
rafters	1
of	1
fir.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
rose	1
of	1
Sharon,	1
and	1
the	1
lily	1
of	1
the	1
valleys.	1
	1
2:2	1
As	1
the	1
lily	1
among	1
thorns,	1
so	1
is	1
my	1
love	1
among	1
the	1
daughters.	1
	1
2:3	1
As	1
the	1
apple	1
tree	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
wood,	1
so	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
among	1
the	1
sons.	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
under	1
his	1
shadow	1
with	1
great	1
delight,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
was	1
sweet	1
to	1
my	1
taste.	1
	1
2:4	1
He	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
banqueting	1
house,	1
and	1
his	1
banner	1
over	1
me	1
was	1
love.	1
	1
2:5	1
Stay	1
me	1
with	1
flagons,	1
comfort	1
me	1
with	1
apples:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
love.	1
	1
2:6	1
His	1
left	1
hand	1
is	1
under	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
doth	1
embrace	1
me.	1
	1
2:7	1
I	1
charge	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
by	1
the	1
roes,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
hinds	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
that	1
ye	1
stir	1
not	1
up,	1
nor	1
awake	1
my	1
love,	1
till	1
he	1
please.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
beloved!	1
behold,	1
he	1
cometh	1
leaping	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
skipping	1
upon	1
the	1
hills.	1
	1
2:9	1
My	1
beloved	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
roe	1
or	1
a	1
young	1
hart:	1
behold,	1
he	1
standeth	1
behind	1
our	1
wall,	1
he	1
looketh	1
forth	1
at	1
the	1
windows,	1
shewing	1
himself	1
through	1
the	1
lattice.	1
	1
2:10	1
My	1
beloved	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
my	1
love,	1
my	1
fair	1
one,	1
and	1
come	1
away.	1
	1
2:11	1
For,	1
lo,	1
the	1
winter	1
is	1
past,	1
the	1
rain	1
is	1
over	1
and	1
gone;	1
2:12	1
The	1
flowers	1
appear	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
singing	1
of	1
birds	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
turtle	1
is	1
heard	1
in	1
our	1
land;	1
2:13	1
The	1
fig	1
tree	1
putteth	1
forth	1
her	1
green	1
figs,	1
and	1
the	1
vines	1
with	1
the	1
tender	1
grape	1
give	1
a	1
good	1
smell.	1
Arise,	1
my	1
love,	1
my	1
fair	1
one,	1
and	1
come	1
away.	1
	1
2:14	1
O	1
my	1
dove,	1
that	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
clefts	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
thy	1
countenance,	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
thy	1
voice;	1
for	1
sweet	1
is	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
thy	1
countenance	1
is	1
comely.	1
	1
2:15	1
Take	1
us	1
the	1
foxes,	1
the	1
little	1
foxes,	1
that	1
spoil	1
the	1
vines:	1
for	1
our	1
vines	1
have	1
tender	1
grapes.	1
	1
2:16	1
My	1
beloved	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
his:	1
he	1
feedeth	1
among	1
the	1
lilies.	1
	1
2:17	1
Until	1
the	1
day	1
break,	1
and	1
the	1
shadows	1
flee	1
away,	1
turn,	1
my	1
beloved,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
like	1
a	1
roe	1
or	1
a	1
young	1
hart	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Bether.	1
	1
3:1	1
By	1
night	1
on	1
my	1
bed	1
I	1
sought	1
him	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
loveth:	1
I	1
sought	1
him,	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
3:2	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
now,	1
and	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
ways	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
him	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
loveth:	1
I	1
sought	1
him,	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
3:3	1
The	1
watchmen	1
that	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
found	1
me:	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
said,	1
Saw	1
ye	1
him	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
loveth?	1
	1
3:4	1
It	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
that	1
I	1
passed	1
from	1
them,	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
loveth:	1
I	1
held	1
him,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go,	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
my	1
mother's	1
house,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
conceived	1
me.	1
	1
3:5	1
I	1
charge	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
by	1
the	1
roes,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
hinds	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
that	1
ye	1
stir	1
not	1
up,	1
nor	1
awake	1
my	1
love,	1
till	1
he	1
please.	1
	1
3:6	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
like	1
pillars	1
of	1
smoke,	1
perfumed	1
with	1
myrrh	1
and	1
frankincense,	1
with	1
all	1
powders	1
of	1
the	1
merchant?	1
	1
3:7	1
Behold	1
his	1
bed,	1
which	1
is	1
Solomon's;	1
threescore	1
valiant	1
men	1
are	1
about	1
it,	1
of	1
the	1
valiant	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:8	1
They	1
all	1
hold	1
swords,	1
being	1
expert	1
in	1
war:	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
his	1
sword	1
upon	1
his	1
thigh	1
because	1
of	1
fear	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
3:9	1
King	1
Solomon	1
made	1
himself	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
3:10	1
He	1
made	1
the	1
pillars	1
thereof	1
of	1
silver,	1
the	1
bottom	1
thereof	1
of	1
gold,	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
it	1
of	1
purple,	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
being	1
paved	1
with	1
love,	1
for	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
3:11	1
Go	1
forth,	1
O	1
ye	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
behold	1
king	1
Solomon	1
with	1
the	1
crown	1
wherewith	1
his	1
mother	1
crowned	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
espousals,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
gladness	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
4:1	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
fair,	1
my	1
love;	1
behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
fair;	1
thou	1
hast	1
doves'	1
eyes	1
within	1
thy	1
locks:	1
thy	1
hair	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
goats,	1
that	1
appear	1
from	1
mount	1
Gilead.	1
	1
4:2	1
Thy	1
teeth	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep	1
that	1
are	1
even	1
shorn,	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
washing;	1
whereof	1
every	1
one	1
bear	1
twins,	1
and	1
none	1
is	1
barren	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
4:3	1
Thy	1
lips	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
thread	1
of	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
thy	1
speech	1
is	1
comely:	1
thy	1
temples	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
pomegranate	1
within	1
thy	1
locks.	1
	1
4:4	1
Thy	1
neck	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
David	1
builded	1
for	1
an	1
armoury,	1
whereon	1
there	1
hang	1
a	1
thousand	1
bucklers,	1
all	1
shields	1
of	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
4:5	1
Thy	1
two	1
breasts	1
are	1
like	1
two	1
young	1
roes	1
that	1
are	1
twins,	1
which	1
feed	1
among	1
the	1
lilies.	1
	1
4:6	1
Until	1
the	1
day	1
break,	1
and	1
the	1
shadows	1
flee	1
away,	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
myrrh,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
frankincense.	1
	1
4:7	1
Thou	1
art	1
all	1
fair,	1
my	1
love;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
spot	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
4:8	1
Come	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
Lebanon,	1
my	1
spouse,	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
Lebanon:	1
look	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Amana,	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Shenir	1
and	1
Hermon,	1
from	1
the	1
lions'	1
dens,	1
from	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
leopards.	1
	1
4:9	1
Thou	1
hast	1
ravished	1
my	1
heart,	1
my	1
sister,	1
my	1
spouse;	1
thou	1
hast	1
ravished	1
my	1
heart	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
with	1
one	1
chain	1
of	1
thy	1
neck.	1
	1
4:10	1
How	1
fair	1
is	1
thy	1
love,	1
my	1
sister,	1
my	1
spouse!	1
how	1
much	1
better	1
is	1
thy	1
love	1
than	1
wine!	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
thine	1
ointments	1
than	1
all	1
spices!	1
4:11	1
Thy	1
lips,	1
O	1
my	1
spouse,	1
drop	1
as	1
the	1
honeycomb:	1
honey	1
and	1
milk	1
are	1
under	1
thy	1
tongue;	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
thy	1
garments	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
4:12	1
A	1
garden	1
inclosed	1
is	1
my	1
sister,	1
my	1
spouse;	1
a	1
spring	1
shut	1
up,	1
a	1
fountain	1
sealed.	1
	1
4:13	1
Thy	1
plants	1
are	1
an	1
orchard	1
of	1
pomegranates,	1
with	1
pleasant	1
fruits;	1
camphire,	1
with	1
spikenard,	1
4:14	1
Spikenard	1
and	1
saffron;	1
calamus	1
and	1
cinnamon,	1
with	1
all	1
trees	1
of	1
frankincense;	1
myrrh	1
and	1
aloes,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
spices:	1
4:15	1
A	1
fountain	1
of	1
gardens,	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
living	1
waters,	1
and	1
streams	1
from	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
4:16	1
Awake,	1
O	1
north	1
wind;	1
and	1
come,	1
thou	1
south;	1
blow	1
upon	1
my	1
garden,	1
that	1
the	1
spices	1
thereof	1
may	1
flow	1
out.	1
Let	1
my	1
beloved	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
garden,	1
and	1
eat	1
his	1
pleasant	1
fruits.	1
	1
5:1	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
garden,	1
my	1
sister,	1
my	1
spouse:	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
my	1
myrrh	1
with	1
my	1
spice;	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
my	1
honeycomb	1
with	1
my	1
honey;	1
I	1
have	1
drunk	1
my	1
wine	1
with	1
my	1
milk:	1
eat,	1
O	1
friends;	1
drink,	1
yea,	1
drink	1
abundantly,	1
O	1
beloved.	1
	1
5:2	1
I	1
sleep,	1
but	1
my	1
heart	1
waketh:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
that	1
knocketh,	1
saying,	1
Open	1
to	1
me,	1
my	1
sister,	1
my	1
love,	1
my	1
dove,	1
my	1
undefiled:	1
for	1
my	1
head	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
dew,	1
and	1
my	1
locks	1
with	1
the	1
drops	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:3	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
off	1
my	1
coat;	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
put	1
it	1
on?	1
I	1
have	1
washed	1
my	1
feet;	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
defile	1
them?	1
	1
5:4	1
My	1
beloved	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
by	1
the	1
hole	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
my	1
bowels	1
were	1
moved	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
5:5	1
I	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
open	1
to	1
my	1
beloved;	1
and	1
my	1
hands	1
dropped	1
with	1
myrrh,	1
and	1
my	1
fingers	1
with	1
sweet	1
smelling	1
myrrh,	1
upon	1
the	1
handles	1
of	1
the	1
lock.	1
	1
5:6	1
I	1
opened	1
to	1
my	1
beloved;	1
but	1
my	1
beloved	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
himself,	1
and	1
was	1
gone:	1
my	1
soul	1
failed	1
when	1
he	1
spake:	1
I	1
sought	1
him,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
him;	1
I	1
called	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
watchmen	1
that	1
went	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
found	1
me,	1
they	1
smote	1
me,	1
they	1
wounded	1
me;	1
the	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
walls	1
took	1
away	1
my	1
veil	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
5:8	1
I	1
charge	1
you,	1
O	1
daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
if	1
ye	1
find	1
my	1
beloved,	1
that	1
ye	1
tell	1
him,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
love.	1
	1
5:9	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
beloved	1
more	1
than	1
another	1
beloved,	1
O	1
thou	1
fairest	1
among	1
women?	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
beloved	1
more	1
than	1
another	1
beloved,	1
that	1
thou	1
dost	1
so	1
charge	1
us?	1
	1
5:10	1
My	1
beloved	1
is	1
white	1
and	1
ruddy,	1
the	1
chiefest	1
among	1
ten	1
thousand.	1
	1
5:11	1
His	1
head	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
fine	1
gold,	1
his	1
locks	1
are	1
bushy,	1
and	1
black	1
as	1
a	1
raven.	1
	1
5:12	1
His	1
eyes	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
doves	1
by	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
waters,	1
washed	1
with	1
milk,	1
and	1
fitly	1
set.	1
	1
5:13	1
His	1
cheeks	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
spices,	1
as	1
sweet	1
flowers:	1
his	1
lips	1
like	1
lilies,	1
dropping	1
sweet	1
smelling	1
myrrh.	1
	1
5:14	1
His	1
hands	1
are	1
as	1
gold	1
rings	1
set	1
with	1
the	1
beryl:	1
his	1
belly	1
is	1
as	1
bright	1
ivory	1
overlaid	1
with	1
sapphires.	1
	1
5:15	1
His	1
legs	1
are	1
as	1
pillars	1
of	1
marble,	1
set	1
upon	1
sockets	1
of	1
fine	1
gold:	1
his	1
countenance	1
is	1
as	1
Lebanon,	1
excellent	1
as	1
the	1
cedars.	1
	1
5:16	1
His	1
mouth	1
is	1
most	1
sweet:	1
yea,	1
he	1
is	1
altogether	1
lovely.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
friend,	1
O	1
daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
6:1	1
Whither	1
is	1
thy	1
beloved	1
gone,	1
O	1
thou	1
fairest	1
among	1
women?	1
whither	1
is	1
thy	1
beloved	1
turned	1
aside?	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
seek	1
him	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
6:2	1
My	1
beloved	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
his	1
garden,	1
to	1
the	1
beds	1
of	1
spices,	1
to	1
feed	1
in	1
the	1
gardens,	1
and	1
to	1
gather	1
lilies.	1
	1
6:3	1
I	1
am	1
my	1
beloved's,	1
and	1
my	1
beloved	1
is	1
mine:	1
he	1
feedeth	1
among	1
the	1
lilies.	1
	1
6:4	1
Thou	1
art	1
beautiful,	1
O	1
my	1
love,	1
as	1
Tirzah,	1
comely	1
as	1
Jerusalem,	1
terrible	1
as	1
an	1
army	1
with	1
banners.	1
	1
6:5	1
Turn	1
away	1
thine	1
eyes	1
from	1
me,	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
overcome	1
me:	1
thy	1
hair	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
goats	1
that	1
appear	1
from	1
Gilead.	1
	1
6:6	1
Thy	1
teeth	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep	1
which	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
washing,	1
whereof	1
every	1
one	1
beareth	1
twins,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
barren	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
6:7	1
As	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
pomegranate	1
are	1
thy	1
temples	1
within	1
thy	1
locks.	1
	1
6:8	1
There	1
are	1
threescore	1
queens,	1
and	1
fourscore	1
concubines,	1
and	1
virgins	1
without	1
number.	1
	1
6:9	1
My	1
dove,	1
my	1
undefiled	1
is	1
but	1
one;	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
choice	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
bare	1
her.	1
The	1
daughters	1
saw	1
her,	1
and	1
blessed	1
her;	1
yea,	1
the	1
queens	1
and	1
the	1
concubines,	1
and	1
they	1
praised	1
her.	1
	1
6:10	1
Who	1
is	1
she	1
that	1
looketh	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
morning,	1
fair	1
as	1
the	1
moon,	1
clear	1
as	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
terrible	1
as	1
an	1
army	1
with	1
banners?	1
	1
6:11	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
nuts	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
vine	1
flourished	1
and	1
the	1
pomegranates	1
budded.	1
	1
6:12	1
Or	1
ever	1
I	1
was	1
aware,	1
my	1
soul	1
made	1
me	1
like	1
the	1
chariots	1
of	1
Amminadib.	1
	1
6:13	1
Return,	1
return,	1
O	1
Shulamite;	1
return,	1
return,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
look	1
upon	1
thee.	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
Shulamite?	1
As	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
two	1
armies.	1
	1
7:1	1
How	1
beautiful	1
are	1
thy	1
feet	1
with	1
shoes,	1
O	1
prince's	1
daughter!	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
thy	1
thighs	1
are	1
like	1
jewels,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
cunning	1
workman.	1
	1
7:2	1
Thy	1
navel	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
round	1
goblet,	1
which	1
wanteth	1
not	1
liquor:	1
thy	1
belly	1
is	1
like	1
an	1
heap	1
of	1
wheat	1
set	1
about	1
with	1
lilies.	1
	1
7:3	1
Thy	1
two	1
breasts	1
are	1
like	1
two	1
young	1
roes	1
that	1
are	1
twins.	1
	1
7:4	1
Thy	1
neck	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
tower	1
of	1
ivory;	1
thine	1
eyes	1
like	1
the	1
fishpools	1
in	1
Heshbon,	1
by	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Bathrabbim:	1
thy	1
nose	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
which	1
looketh	1
toward	1
Damascus.	1
	1
7:5	1
Thine	1
head	1
upon	1
thee	1
is	1
like	1
Carmel,	1
and	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
thine	1
head	1
like	1
purple;	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
galleries.	1
	1
7:6	1
How	1
fair	1
and	1
how	1
pleasant	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
love,	1
for	1
delights!	1
	1
7:7	1
This	1
thy	1
stature	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
a	1
palm	1
tree,	1
and	1
thy	1
breasts	1
to	1
clusters	1
of	1
grapes.	1
	1
7:8	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
palm	1
tree,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
boughs	1
thereof:	1
now	1
also	1
thy	1
breasts	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
clusters	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
thy	1
nose	1
like	1
apples;	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth	1
like	1
the	1
best	1
wine	1
for	1
my	1
beloved,	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
sweetly,	1
causing	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
asleep	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
7:10	1
I	1
am	1
my	1
beloved's,	1
and	1
his	1
desire	1
is	1
toward	1
me.	1
	1
7:11	1
Come,	1
my	1
beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
field;	1
let	1
us	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
villages.	1
	1
7:12	1
Let	1
us	1
get	1
up	1
early	1
to	1
the	1
vineyards;	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
vine	1
flourish,	1
whether	1
the	1
tender	1
grape	1
appear,	1
and	1
the	1
pomegranates	1
bud	1
forth:	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
my	1
loves.	1
	1
7:13	1
The	1
mandrakes	1
give	1
a	1
smell,	1
and	1
at	1
our	1
gates	1
are	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
pleasant	1
fruits,	1
new	1
and	1
old,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
thee,	1
O	1
my	1
beloved.	1
	1
8:1	1
O	1
that	1
thou	1
wert	1
as	1
my	1
brother,	1
that	1
sucked	1
the	1
breasts	1
of	1
my	1
mother!	1
	1
when	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
thee	1
without,	1
I	1
would	1
kiss	1
thee;	1
yea,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
despised.	1
	1
8:2	1
I	1
would	1
lead	1
thee,	1
and	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
my	1
mother's	1
house,	1
who	1
would	1
instruct	1
me:	1
I	1
would	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
drink	1
of	1
spiced	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
juice	1
of	1
my	1
pomegranate.	1
	1
8:3	1
His	1
left	1
hand	1
should	1
be	1
under	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
should	1
embrace	1
me.	1
	1
8:4	1
I	1
charge	1
you,	1
O	1
daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
ye	1
stir	1
not	1
up,	1
nor	1
awake	1
my	1
love,	1
until	1
he	1
please.	1
	1
8:5	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
cometh	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
leaning	1
upon	1
her	1
beloved?	1
I	1
raised	1
thee	1
up	1
under	1
the	1
apple	1
tree:	1
there	1
thy	1
mother	1
brought	1
thee	1
forth:	1
there	1
she	1
brought	1
thee	1
forth	1
that	1
bare	1
thee.	1
	1
8:6	1
Set	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
seal	1
upon	1
thine	1
heart,	1
as	1
a	1
seal	1
upon	1
thine	1
arm:	1
for	1
love	1
is	1
strong	1
as	1
death;	1
jealousy	1
is	1
cruel	1
as	1
the	1
grave:	1
the	1
coals	1
thereof	1
are	1
coals	1
of	1
fire,	1
which	1
hath	1
a	1
most	1
vehement	1
flame.	1
	1
8:7	1
Many	1
waters	1
cannot	1
quench	1
love,	1
neither	1
can	1
the	1
floods	1
drown	1
it:	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
would	1
give	1
all	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
for	1
love,	1
it	1
would	1
utterly	1
be	1
contemned.	1
	1
8:8	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
sister,	1
and	1
she	1
hath	1
no	1
breasts:	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
for	1
our	1
sister	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
spoken	1
for?	1
	1
8:9	1
If	1
she	1
be	1
a	1
wall,	1
we	1
will	1
build	1
upon	1
her	1
a	1
palace	1
of	1
silver:	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
a	1
door,	1
we	1
will	1
inclose	1
her	1
with	1
boards	1
of	1
cedar.	1
	1
8:10	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
wall,	1
and	1
my	1
breasts	1
like	1
towers:	1
then	1
was	1
I	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
found	1
favour.	1
	1
8:11	1
Solomon	1
had	1
a	1
vineyard	1
at	1
Baalhamon;	1
he	1
let	1
out	1
the	1
vineyard	1
unto	1
keepers;	1
every	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
was	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
8:12	1
My	1
vineyard,	1
which	1
is	1
mine,	1
is	1
before	1
me:	1
thou,	1
O	1
Solomon,	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
thousand,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
keep	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
two	1
hundred.	1
	1
8:13	1
Thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
gardens,	1
the	1
companions	1
hearken	1
to	1
thy	1
voice:	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
8:14	1
Make	1
haste,	1
my	1
beloved,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
like	1
to	1
a	1
roe	1
or	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
hart	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
spices.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Prophet	1
Isaiah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
vision	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz,	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
concerning	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah,	1
Jotham,	1
Ahaz,	1
and	1
Hezekiah,	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:2	1
Hear,	1
O	1
heavens,	1
and	1
give	1
ear,	1
O	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
I	1
have	1
nourished	1
and	1
brought	1
up	1
children,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
rebelled	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
ox	1
knoweth	1
his	1
owner,	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
his	1
master's	1
crib:	1
but	1
Israel	1
doth	1
not	1
know,	1
my	1
people	1
doth	1
not	1
consider.	1
	1
1:4	1
Ah	1
sinful	1
nation,	1
a	1
people	1
laden	1
with	1
iniquity,	1
a	1
seed	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
children	1
that	1
are	1
corrupters:	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
have	1
provoked	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
anger,	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
away	1
backward.	1
	1
1:5	1
Why	1
should	1
ye	1
be	1
stricken	1
any	1
more?	1
ye	1
will	1
revolt	1
more	1
and	1
more:	1
the	1
whole	1
head	1
is	1
sick,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
heart	1
faint.	1
	1
1:6	1
From	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
the	1
foot	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
head	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
soundness	1
in	1
it;	1
but	1
wounds,	1
and	1
bruises,	1
and	1
putrifying	1
sores:	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
closed,	1
neither	1
bound	1
up,	1
neither	1
mollified	1
with	1
ointment.	1
	1
1:7	1
Your	1
country	1
is	1
desolate,	1
your	1
cities	1
are	1
burned	1
with	1
fire:	1
your	1
land,	1
strangers	1
devour	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
presence,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
desolate,	1
as	1
overthrown	1
by	1
strangers.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion	1
is	1
left	1
as	1
a	1
cottage	1
in	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
as	1
a	1
lodge	1
in	1
a	1
garden	1
of	1
cucumbers,	1
as	1
a	1
besieged	1
city.	1
	1
1:9	1
Except	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
had	1
left	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
remnant,	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
like	1
unto	1
Gomorrah.	1
	1
1:10	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
rulers	1
of	1
Sodom;	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
ye	1
people	1
of	1
Gomorrah.	1
	1
1:11	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
is	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
your	1
sacrifices	1
unto	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
of	1
rams,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
fed	1
beasts;	1
and	1
I	1
delight	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bullocks,	1
or	1
of	1
lambs,	1
or	1
of	1
he	1
goats.	1
	1
1:12	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
to	1
appear	1
before	1
me,	1
who	1
hath	1
required	1
this	1
at	1
your	1
hand,	1
to	1
tread	1
my	1
courts?	1
	1
1:13	1
Bring	1
no	1
more	1
vain	1
oblations;	1
incense	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
me;	1
the	1
new	1
moons	1
and	1
sabbaths,	1
the	1
calling	1
of	1
assemblies,	1
I	1
cannot	1
away	1
with;	1
it	1
is	1
iniquity,	1
even	1
the	1
solemn	1
meeting.	1
	1
1:14	1
Your	1
new	1
moons	1
and	1
your	1
appointed	1
feasts	1
my	1
soul	1
hateth:	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
trouble	1
unto	1
me;	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
to	1
bear	1
them.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
spread	1
forth	1
your	1
hands,	1
I	1
will	1
hide	1
mine	1
eyes	1
from	1
you:	1
yea,	1
when	1
ye	1
make	1
many	1
prayers,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear:	1
your	1
hands	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
1:16	1
Wash	1
you,	1
make	1
you	1
clean;	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings	1
from	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes;	1
cease	1
to	1
do	1
evil;	1
1:17	1
Learn	1
to	1
do	1
well;	1
seek	1
judgment,	1
relieve	1
the	1
oppressed,	1
judge	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
plead	1
for	1
the	1
widow.	1
	1
1:18	1
Come	1
now,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
reason	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
though	1
your	1
sins	1
be	1
as	1
scarlet,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow;	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
red	1
like	1
crimson,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
wool.	1
	1
1:19	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
willing	1
and	1
obedient,	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
1:20	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
refuse	1
and	1
rebel,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
1:21	1
How	1
is	1
the	1
faithful	1
city	1
become	1
an	1
harlot!	1
it	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
judgment;	1
righteousness	1
lodged	1
in	1
it;	1
but	1
now	1
murderers.	1
	1
1:22	1
Thy	1
silver	1
is	1
become	1
dross,	1
thy	1
wine	1
mixed	1
with	1
water:	1
1:23	1
Thy	1
princes	1
are	1
rebellious,	1
and	1
companions	1
of	1
thieves:	1
every	1
one	1
loveth	1
gifts,	1
and	1
followeth	1
after	1
rewards:	1
they	1
judge	1
not	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
neither	1
doth	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
widow	1
come	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:24	1
Therefore	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
mighty	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Ah,	1
I	1
will	1
ease	1
me	1
of	1
mine	1
adversaries,	1
and	1
avenge	1
me	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
1:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
purely	1
purge	1
away	1
thy	1
dross,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
all	1
thy	1
tin:	1
1:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
thy	1
judges	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
thy	1
counsellors	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning:	1
afterward	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called,	1
The	1
city	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
the	1
faithful	1
city.	1
	1
1:27	1
Zion	1
shall	1
be	1
redeemed	1
with	1
judgment,	1
and	1
her	1
converts	1
with	1
righteousness.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
transgressors	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sinners	1
shall	1
be	1
together,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
forsake	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
1:29	1
For	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
oaks	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
desired,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded	1
for	1
the	1
gardens	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
chosen.	1
	1
1:30	1
For	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
an	1
oak	1
whose	1
leaf	1
fadeth,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
garden	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
water.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
the	1
strong	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
tow,	1
and	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
spark,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
both	1
burn	1
together,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
quench	1
them.	1
	1
2:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
saw	1
concerning	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
the	1
hills;	1
and	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
flow	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
many	1
people	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
say,	1
Come	1
ye,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
teach	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
paths:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
Zion	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
shall	1
rebuke	1
many	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
beat	1
their	1
swords	1
into	1
plowshares,	1
and	1
their	1
spears	1
into	1
pruninghooks:	1
nation	1
shall	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
sword	1
against	1
nation,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
learn	1
war	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
2:5	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
come	1
ye,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:6	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
thy	1
people	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
because	1
they	1
be	1
replenished	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
are	1
soothsayers	1
like	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
they	1
please	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
strangers.	1
	1
2:7	1
Their	1
land	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
treasures;	1
their	1
land	1
is	1
also	1
full	1
of	1
horses,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
chariots:	1
2:8	1
Their	1
land	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
idols;	1
they	1
worship	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands,	1
that	1
which	1
their	1
own	1
fingers	1
have	1
made:	1
2:9	1
And	1
the	1
mean	1
man	1
boweth	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
man	1
humbleth	1
himself:	1
therefore	1
forgive	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
2:10	1
Enter	1
into	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
hide	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
dust,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
majesty.	1
	1
2:11	1
The	1
lofty	1
looks	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
humbled,	1
and	1
the	1
haughtiness	1
of	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
bowed	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
alone	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
in	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
proud	1
and	1
lofty,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
lifted	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
low:	1
2:13	1
And	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
cedars	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
that	1
are	1
high	1
and	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
oaks	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
2:14	1
And	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
high	1
mountains,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
hills	1
that	1
are	1
lifted	1
up,	1
2:15	1
And	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
tower,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
fenced	1
wall,	1
2:16	1
And	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
pleasant	1
pictures.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
loftiness	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
bowed	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
haughtiness	1
of	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
low:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
alone	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
in	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
the	1
idols	1
he	1
shall	1
utterly	1
abolish.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
holes	1
of	1
the	1
rocks,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
caves	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
majesty,	1
when	1
he	1
ariseth	1
to	1
shake	1
terribly	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
2:20	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
cast	1
his	1
idols	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
his	1
idols	1
of	1
gold,	1
which	1
they	1
made	1
each	1
one	1
for	1
himself	1
to	1
worship,	1
to	1
the	1
moles	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
bats;	1
2:21	1
To	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
clefts	1
of	1
the	1
rocks,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
ragged	1
rocks,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
majesty,	1
when	1
he	1
ariseth	1
to	1
shake	1
terribly	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
2:22	1
Cease	1
ye	1
from	1
man,	1
whose	1
breath	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
nostrils:	1
for	1
wherein	1
is	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
accounted	1
of	1
?	1
	1
3:1	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
doth	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
from	1
Judah	1
the	1
stay	1
and	1
the	1
staff,	1
the	1
whole	1
stay	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
stay	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
3:2	1
The	1
mighty	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
war,	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
the	1
prudent,	1
and	1
the	1
ancient,	1
3:3	1
The	1
captain	1
of	1
fifty,	1
and	1
the	1
honourable	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
counsellor,	1
and	1
the	1
cunning	1
artificer,	1
and	1
the	1
eloquent	1
orator.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
children	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
princes,	1
and	1
babes	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
oppressed,	1
every	1
one	1
by	1
another,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
by	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
behave	1
himself	1
proudly	1
against	1
the	1
ancient,	1
and	1
the	1
base	1
against	1
the	1
honourable.	1
	1
3:6	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
clothing,	1
be	1
thou	1
our	1
ruler,	1
and	1
let	1
this	1
ruin	1
be	1
under	1
thy	1
hand:	1
3:7	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
he	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
an	1
healer;	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
is	1
neither	1
bread	1
nor	1
clothing:	1
make	1
me	1
not	1
a	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:8	1
For	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
ruined,	1
and	1
Judah	1
is	1
fallen:	1
because	1
their	1
tongue	1
and	1
their	1
doings	1
are	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
provoke	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
3:9	1
The	1
shew	1
of	1
their	1
countenance	1
doth	1
witness	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
declare	1
their	1
sin	1
as	1
Sodom,	1
they	1
hide	1
it	1
not.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
their	1
soul!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
rewarded	1
evil	1
unto	1
themselves.	1
	1
3:10	1
Say	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
righteous,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
3:11	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked!	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
ill	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
3:12	1
As	1
for	1
my	1
people,	1
children	1
are	1
their	1
oppressors,	1
and	1
women	1
rule	1
over	1
them.	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
they	1
which	1
lead	1
thee	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
err,	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
paths.	1
	1
3:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
standeth	1
up	1
to	1
plead,	1
and	1
standeth	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
enter	1
into	1
judgment	1
with	1
the	1
ancients	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
eaten	1
up	1
the	1
vineyard;	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
houses.	1
	1
3:15	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
that	1
ye	1
beat	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
pieces,	1
and	1
grind	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
poor?	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:16	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith,	1
Because	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zion	1
are	1
haughty,	1
and	1
walk	1
with	1
stretched	1
forth	1
necks	1
and	1
wanton	1
eyes,	1
walking	1
and	1
mincing	1
as	1
they	1
go,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
tinkling	1
with	1
their	1
feet:	1
3:17	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
with	1
a	1
scab	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
discover	1
their	1
secret	1
parts.	1
	1
3:18	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
bravery	1
of	1
their	1
tinkling	1
ornaments	1
about	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
their	1
cauls,	1
and	1
their	1
round	1
tires	1
like	1
the	1
moon,	1
3:19	1
The	1
chains,	1
and	1
the	1
bracelets,	1
and	1
the	1
mufflers,	1
3:20	1
The	1
bonnets,	1
and	1
the	1
ornaments	1
of	1
the	1
legs,	1
and	1
the	1
headbands,	1
and	1
the	1
tablets,	1
and	1
the	1
earrings,	1
3:21	1
The	1
rings,	1
and	1
nose	1
jewels,	1
3:22	1
The	1
changeable	1
suits	1
of	1
apparel,	1
and	1
the	1
mantles,	1
and	1
the	1
wimples,	1
and	1
the	1
crisping	1
pins,	1
3:23	1
The	1
glasses,	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
the	1
hoods,	1
and	1
the	1
vails.	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
sweet	1
smell	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
stink;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
girdle	1
a	1
rent;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
well	1
set	1
hair	1
baldness;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
stomacher	1
a	1
girding	1
of	1
sackcloth;	1
and	1
burning	1
instead	1
of	1
beauty.	1
	1
3:25	1
Thy	1
men	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
thy	1
mighty	1
in	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
her	1
gates	1
shall	1
lament	1
and	1
mourn;	1
and	1
she	1
being	1
desolate	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
seven	1
women	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
eat	1
our	1
own	1
bread,	1
and	1
wear	1
our	1
own	1
apparel:	1
only	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name,	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
our	1
reproach.	1
	1
4:2	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
beautiful	1
and	1
glorious,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
excellent	1
and	1
comely	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
escaped	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
remaineth	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
holy,	1
even	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
among	1
the	1
living	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
4:4	1
When	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
have	1
washed	1
away	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
purged	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
burning.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
create	1
upon	1
every	1
dwelling	1
place	1
of	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
assemblies,	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
smoke	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
shining	1
of	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire	1
by	1
night:	1
for	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
defence.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
a	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time	1
from	1
the	1
heat,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
refuge,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
covert	1
from	1
storm	1
and	1
from	1
rain.	1
	1
5:1	1
Now	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
to	1
my	1
wellbeloved	1
a	1
song	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
touching	1
his	1
vineyard.	1
My	1
wellbeloved	1
hath	1
a	1
vineyard	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
fruitful	1
hill:	1
5:2	1
And	1
he	1
fenced	1
it,	1
and	1
gathered	1
out	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof,	1
and	1
planted	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
choicest	1
vine,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
tower	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
also	1
made	1
a	1
winepress	1
therein:	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
grapes,	1
and	1
it	1
brought	1
forth	1
wild	1
grapes.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
judge,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
vineyard.	1
	1
5:4	1
What	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
vineyard,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
in	1
it?	1
wherefore,	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
grapes,	1
brought	1
it	1
forth	1
wild	1
grapes?	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
now	1
go	1
to;	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
my	1
vineyard:	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
hedge	1
thereof,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
up;	1
and	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down:	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
it	1
waste:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
pruned,	1
nor	1
digged;	1
but	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
command	1
the	1
clouds	1
that	1
they	1
rain	1
no	1
rain	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
the	1
vineyard	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
his	1
pleasant	1
plant:	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
judgment,	1
but	1
behold	1
oppression;	1
for	1
righteousness,	1
but	1
behold	1
a	1
cry.	1
	1
5:8	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
join	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
that	1
lay	1
field	1
to	1
field,	1
till	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
place,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
placed	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth!	1
	1
5:9	1
In	1
mine	1
ears	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
many	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
even	1
great	1
and	1
fair,	1
without	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
5:10	1
Yea,	1
ten	1
acres	1
of	1
vineyard	1
shall	1
yield	1
one	1
bath,	1
and	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
an	1
homer	1
shall	1
yield	1
an	1
ephah.	1
	1
5:11	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
follow	1
strong	1
drink;	1
that	1
continue	1
until	1
night,	1
till	1
wine	1
inflame	1
them!	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
the	1
harp,	1
and	1
the	1
viol,	1
the	1
tabret,	1
and	1
pipe,	1
and	1
wine,	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
feasts:	1
but	1
they	1
regard	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
consider	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
5:13	1
Therefore	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
knowledge:	1
and	1
their	1
honourable	1
men	1
are	1
famished,	1
and	1
their	1
multitude	1
dried	1
up	1
with	1
thirst.	1
	1
5:14	1
Therefore	1
hell	1
hath	1
enlarged	1
herself,	1
and	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
without	1
measure:	1
and	1
their	1
glory,	1
and	1
their	1
multitude,	1
and	1
their	1
pomp,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
rejoiceth,	1
shall	1
descend	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
mean	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
humbled,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
lofty	1
shall	1
be	1
humbled:	1
5:16	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
God	1
that	1
is	1
holy	1
shall	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
lambs	1
feed	1
after	1
their	1
manner,	1
and	1
the	1
waste	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
ones	1
shall	1
strangers	1
eat.	1
	1
5:18	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
draw	1
iniquity	1
with	1
cords	1
of	1
vanity,	1
and	1
sin	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
a	1
cart	1
rope:	1
5:19	1
That	1
say,	1
Let	1
him	1
make	1
speed,	1
and	1
hasten	1
his	1
work,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
it:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
draw	1
nigh	1
and	1
come,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
it!	1
	1
5:20	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
evil	1
good,	1
and	1
good	1
evil;	1
that	1
put	1
darkness	1
for	1
light,	1
and	1
light	1
for	1
darkness;	1
that	1
put	1
bitter	1
for	1
sweet,	1
and	1
sweet	1
for	1
bitter!	1
	1
5:21	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
wise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
prudent	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
sight!	1
	1
5:22	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
mighty	1
to	1
drink	1
wine,	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
strength	1
to	1
mingle	1
strong	1
drink:	1
5:23	1
Which	1
justify	1
the	1
wicked	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
from	1
him!	1
	1
5:24	1
Therefore	1
as	1
the	1
fire	1
devoureth	1
the	1
stubble,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
consumeth	1
the	1
chaff,	1
so	1
their	1
root	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
rottenness,	1
and	1
their	1
blossom	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
as	1
dust:	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
away	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
despised	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:25	1
Therefore	1
is	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
kindled	1
against	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
hath	1
smitten	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
did	1
tremble,	1
and	1
their	1
carcases	1
were	1
torn	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
5:26	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
an	1
ensign	1
to	1
the	1
nations	1
from	1
far,	1
and	1
will	1
hiss	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
with	1
speed	1
swiftly:	1
5:27	1
None	1
shall	1
be	1
weary	1
nor	1
stumble	1
among	1
them;	1
none	1
shall	1
slumber	1
nor	1
sleep;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
their	1
loins	1
be	1
loosed,	1
nor	1
the	1
latchet	1
of	1
their	1
shoes	1
be	1
broken:	1
5:28	1
Whose	1
arrows	1
are	1
sharp,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
bows	1
bent,	1
their	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
like	1
flint,	1
and	1
their	1
wheels	1
like	1
a	1
whirlwind:	1
5:29	1
Their	1
roaring	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
they	1
shall	1
roar	1
like	1
young	1
lions:	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
roar,	1
and	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
shall	1
carry	1
it	1
away	1
safe,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
deliver	1
it.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
shall	1
roar	1
against	1
them	1
like	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
if	1
one	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
land,	1
behold	1
darkness	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
is	1
darkened	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
thereof.	1
	1
6:1	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
king	1
Uzziah	1
died	1
I	1
saw	1
also	1
the	1
LORD	1
sitting	1
upon	1
a	1
throne,	1
high	1
and	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
train	1
filled	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
6:2	1
Above	1
it	1
stood	1
the	1
seraphims:	1
each	1
one	1
had	1
six	1
wings;	1
with	1
twain	1
he	1
covered	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
with	1
twain	1
he	1
covered	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
with	1
twain	1
he	1
did	1
fly.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
one	1
cried	1
unto	1
another,	1
and	1
said,	1
Holy,	1
holy,	1
holy,	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
the	1
posts	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
moved	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
cried,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
smoke.	1
	1
6:5	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Woe	1
is	1
me!	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
undone;	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
unclean	1
lips,	1
and	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
unclean	1
lips:	1
for	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
6:6	1
Then	1
flew	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seraphims	1
unto	1
me,	1
having	1
a	1
live	1
coal	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
tongs	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar:	1
6:7	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
this	1
hath	1
touched	1
thy	1
lips;	1
and	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
is	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
thy	1
sin	1
purged.	1
	1
6:8	1
Also	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
saying,	1
Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
send,	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
go	1
for	1
us?	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
send	1
me.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go,	1
and	1
tell	1
this	1
people,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
indeed,	1
but	1
understand	1
not;	1
and	1
see	1
ye	1
indeed,	1
but	1
perceive	1
not.	1
	1
6:10	1
Make	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
fat,	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
ears	1
heavy,	1
and	1
shut	1
their	1
eyes;	1
lest	1
they	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
convert,	1
and	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
long?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Until	1
the	1
cities	1
be	1
wasted	1
without	1
inhabitant,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
without	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
be	1
utterly	1
desolate,	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
removed	1
men	1
far	1
away,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
forsaking	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
6:13	1
But	1
yet	1
in	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
tenth,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten:	1
as	1
a	1
teil	1
tree,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
oak,	1
whose	1
substance	1
is	1
in	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
leaves:	1
so	1
the	1
holy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
substance	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Ahaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jotham,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uzziah,	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
Rezin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah,	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
went	1
up	1
toward	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
it,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Syria	1
is	1
confederate	1
with	1
Ephraim.	1
And	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
as	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
are	1
moved	1
with	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
7:3	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Isaiah,	1
Go	1
forth	1
now	1
to	1
meet	1
Ahaz,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Shearjashub	1
thy	1
son,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
conduit	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
highway	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's	1
field;	1
7:4	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
and	1
be	1
quiet;	1
fear	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
fainthearted	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
tails	1
of	1
these	1
smoking	1
firebrands,	1
for	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
Rezin	1
with	1
Syria,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah.	1
	1
7:5	1
Because	1
Syria,	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah,	1
have	1
taken	1
evil	1
counsel	1
against	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
7:6	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
Judah,	1
and	1
vex	1
it,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
breach	1
therein	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it,	1
even	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tabeal:	1
7:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
stand,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Syria	1
is	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Damascus	1
is	1
Rezin;	1
and	1
within	1
threescore	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
shall	1
Ephraim	1
be	1
broken,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
a	1
people.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Samaria	1
is	1
Remaliah's	1
son.	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe,	1
surely	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
7:10	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
again	1
unto	1
Ahaz,	1
saying,	1
7:11	1
Ask	1
thee	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
ask	1
it	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
depth,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
above.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
Ahaz	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
ask,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
tempt	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
now,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
David;	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
weary	1
men,	1
but	1
will	1
ye	1
weary	1
my	1
God	1
also?	1
	1
7:14	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
himself	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
sign;	1
Behold,	1
a	1
virgin	1
shall	1
conceive,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
shall	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Immanuel.	1
	1
7:15	1
Butter	1
and	1
honey	1
shall	1
he	1
eat,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
know	1
to	1
refuse	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
choose	1
the	1
good.	1
	1
7:16	1
For	1
before	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
know	1
to	1
refuse	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
choose	1
the	1
good,	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
thou	1
abhorrest	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken	1
of	1
both	1
her	1
kings.	1
	1
7:17	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
days	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
come,	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Ephraim	1
departed	1
from	1
Judah;	1
even	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
hiss	1
for	1
the	1
fly	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
bee	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
shall	1
rest	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
desolate	1
valleys,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
holes	1
of	1
the	1
rocks,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
thorns,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
bushes.	1
	1
7:20	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
shave	1
with	1
a	1
razor	1
that	1
is	1
hired,	1
namely,	1
by	1
them	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
by	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
feet:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
also	1
consume	1
the	1
beard.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
nourish	1
a	1
young	1
cow,	1
and	1
two	1
sheep;	1
7:22	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
for	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
milk	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
give	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
butter:	1
for	1
butter	1
and	1
honey	1
shall	1
every	1
one	1
eat	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
every	1
place	1
shall	1
be,	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
thousand	1
vines	1
at	1
a	1
thousand	1
silverlings,	1
it	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
for	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns.	1
	1
7:24	1
With	1
arrows	1
and	1
with	1
bows	1
shall	1
men	1
come	1
thither;	1
because	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
become	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
on	1
all	1
hills	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
digged	1
with	1
the	1
mattock,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
thither	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns:	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
sending	1
forth	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
treading	1
of	1
lesser	1
cattle.	1
	1
8:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
roll,	1
and	1
write	1
in	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
man's	1
pen	1
concerning	1
Mahershalalhashbaz.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
unto	1
me	1
faithful	1
witnesses	1
to	1
record,	1
Uriah	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Zechariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeberechiah.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
prophetess;	1
and	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
me,	1
Call	1
his	1
name	1
Mahershalalhashbaz.	1
	1
8:4	1
For	1
before	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
have	1
knowledge	1
to	1
cry,	1
My	1
father,	1
and	1
my	1
mother,	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
Damascus	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
8:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
spake	1
also	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
saying,	1
8:6	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
this	1
people	1
refuseth	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Shiloah	1
that	1
go	1
softly,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Rezin	1
and	1
Remaliah's	1
son;	1
8:7	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
bringeth	1
up	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
strong	1
and	1
many,	1
even	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
channels,	1
and	1
go	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
banks:	1
8:8	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
Judah;	1
he	1
shall	1
overflow	1
and	1
go	1
over,	1
he	1
shall	1
reach	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
neck;	1
and	1
the	1
stretching	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wings	1
shall	1
fill	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
O	1
Immanuel.	1
	1
8:9	1
Associate	1
yourselves,	1
O	1
ye	1
people,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces;	1
and	1
give	1
ear,	1
all	1
ye	1
of	1
far	1
countries:	1
gird	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces;	1
gird	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
8:10	1
Take	1
counsel	1
together,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
nought;	1
speak	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
8:11	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
thus	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand,	1
and	1
instructed	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
this	1
people,	1
saying,	1
8:12	1
Say	1
ye	1
not,	1
A	1
confederacy,	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
to	1
whom	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
say,	1
A	1
confederacy;	1
neither	1
fear	1
ye	1
their	1
fear,	1
nor	1
be	1
afraid.	1
	1
8:13	1
Sanctify	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
himself;	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
fear,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
dread.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
sanctuary;	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
stone	1
of	1
stumbling	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
rock	1
of	1
offence	1
to	1
both	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Israel,	1
for	1
a	1
gin	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
snare	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
many	1
among	1
them	1
shall	1
stumble,	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
be	1
snared,	1
and	1
be	1
taken.	1
	1
8:16	1
Bind	1
up	1
the	1
testimony,	1
seal	1
the	1
law	1
among	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
wait	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
hideth	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
8:18	1
Behold,	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
are	1
for	1
signs	1
and	1
for	1
wonders	1
in	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Seek	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
unto	1
wizards	1
that	1
peep,	1
and	1
that	1
mutter:	1
should	1
not	1
a	1
people	1
seek	1
unto	1
their	1
God?	1
for	1
the	1
living	1
to	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
8:20	1
To	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
testimony:	1
if	1
they	1
speak	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
word,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
it,	1
hardly	1
bestead	1
and	1
hungry:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
hungry,	1
they	1
shall	1
fret	1
themselves,	1
and	1
curse	1
their	1
king	1
and	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
look	1
upward.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
behold	1
trouble	1
and	1
darkness,	1
dimness	1
of	1
anguish;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
to	1
darkness.	1
	1
9:1	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
dimness	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
vexation,	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
lightly	1
afflicted	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zebulun	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Naphtali,	1
and	1
afterward	1
did	1
more	1
grievously	1
afflict	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
in	1
Galilee	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
9:2	1
The	1
people	1
that	1
walked	1
in	1
darkness	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
light:	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
upon	1
them	1
hath	1
the	1
light	1
shined.	1
	1
9:3	1
Thou	1
hast	1
multiplied	1
the	1
nation,	1
and	1
not	1
increased	1
the	1
joy:	1
they	1
joy	1
before	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
joy	1
in	1
harvest,	1
and	1
as	1
men	1
rejoice	1
when	1
they	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil.	1
	1
9:4	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
his	1
burden,	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
oppressor,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
9:5	1
For	1
every	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
warrior	1
is	1
with	1
confused	1
noise,	1
and	1
garments	1
rolled	1
in	1
blood;	1
but	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
burning	1
and	1
fuel	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
9:6	1
For	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
child	1
is	1
born,	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
son	1
is	1
given:	1
and	1
the	1
government	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
Wonderful,	1
Counsellor,	1
The	1
mighty	1
God,	1
The	1
everlasting	1
Father,	1
The	1
Prince	1
of	1
Peace.	1
	1
9:7	1
Of	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
his	1
government	1
and	1
peace	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
end,	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
to	1
order	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
it	1
with	1
judgment	1
and	1
with	1
justice	1
from	1
henceforth	1
even	1
for	1
ever.	1
The	1
zeal	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
will	1
perform	1
this.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
Lord	1
sent	1
a	1
word	1
into	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
lighted	1
upon	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
know,	1
even	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
that	1
say	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
and	1
stoutness	1
of	1
heart,	1
9:10	1
The	1
bricks	1
are	1
fallen	1
down,	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
build	1
with	1
hewn	1
stones:	1
the	1
sycomores	1
are	1
cut	1
down,	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
change	1
them	1
into	1
cedars.	1
	1
9:11	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
Rezin	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
join	1
his	1
enemies	1
together;	1
9:12	1
The	1
Syrians	1
before,	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
behind;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
devour	1
Israel	1
with	1
open	1
mouth.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
9:13	1
For	1
the	1
people	1
turneth	1
not	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
smiteth	1
them,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
9:14	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Israel	1
head	1
and	1
tail,	1
branch	1
and	1
rush,	1
in	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
9:15	1
The	1
ancient	1
and	1
honourable,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
head;	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
that	1
teacheth	1
lies,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
tail.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
the	1
leaders	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
err;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
led	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
destroyed.	1
	1
9:17	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
joy	1
in	1
their	1
young	1
men,	1
neither	1
shall	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
their	1
fatherless	1
and	1
widows:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
is	1
an	1
hypocrite	1
and	1
an	1
evildoer,	1
and	1
every	1
mouth	1
speaketh	1
folly.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
9:18	1
For	1
wickedness	1
burneth	1
as	1
the	1
fire:	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns,	1
and	1
shall	1
kindle	1
in	1
the	1
thickets	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
mount	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
lifting	1
up	1
of	1
smoke.	1
	1
9:19	1
Through	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
fuel	1
of	1
the	1
fire:	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
spare	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
snatch	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
be	1
hungry;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
arm:	1
9:21	1
Manasseh,	1
Ephraim;	1
and	1
Ephraim,	1
Manasseh:	1
and	1
they	1
together	1
shall	1
be	1
against	1
Judah.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
10:1	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
decree	1
unrighteous	1
decrees,	1
and	1
that	1
write	1
grievousness	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
prescribed;	1
10:2	1
To	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
needy	1
from	1
judgment,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
right	1
from	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
widows	1
may	1
be	1
their	1
prey,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
rob	1
the	1
fatherless!	1
10:3	1
And	1
what	1
will	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
visitation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
desolation	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far?	1
to	1
whom	1
will	1
ye	1
flee	1
for	1
help?	1
and	1
where	1
will	1
ye	1
leave	1
your	1
glory?	1
	1
10:4	1
Without	1
me	1
they	1
shall	1
bow	1
down	1
under	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
under	1
the	1
slain.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
10:5	1
O	1
Assyrian,	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
in	1
their	1
hand	1
is	1
mine	1
indignation.	1
	1
10:6	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
against	1
an	1
hypocritical	1
nation,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
my	1
wrath	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
charge,	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
to	1
tread	1
them	1
down	1
like	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
10:7	1
Howbeit	1
he	1
meaneth	1
not	1
so,	1
neither	1
doth	1
his	1
heart	1
think	1
so;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
destroy	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
nations	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
10:8	1
For	1
he	1
saith,	1
Are	1
not	1
my	1
princes	1
altogether	1
kings?	1
	1
10:9	1
Is	1
not	1
Calno	1
as	1
Carchemish?	1
is	1
not	1
Hamath	1
as	1
Arpad?	1
is	1
not	1
Samaria	1
as	1
Damascus?	1
	1
10:10	1
As	1
my	1
hand	1
hath	1
found	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
idols,	1
and	1
whose	1
graven	1
images	1
did	1
excel	1
them	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
of	1
Samaria;	1
10:11	1
Shall	1
I	1
not,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
Samaria	1
and	1
her	1
idols,	1
so	1
do	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
her	1
idols?	1
	1
10:12	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
performed	1
his	1
whole	1
work	1
upon	1
mount	1
Zion	1
and	1
on	1
Jerusalem,	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
stout	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
high	1
looks.	1
	1
10:13	1
For	1
he	1
saith,	1
By	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
wisdom;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
prudent:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
removed	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
have	1
robbed	1
their	1
treasures,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
like	1
a	1
valiant	1
man:	1
10:14	1
And	1
my	1
hand	1
hath	1
found	1
as	1
a	1
nest	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
as	1
one	1
gathereth	1
eggs	1
that	1
are	1
left,	1
have	1
I	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
moved	1
the	1
wing,	1
or	1
opened	1
the	1
mouth,	1
or	1
peeped.	1
	1
10:15	1
Shall	1
the	1
axe	1
boast	1
itself	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
heweth	1
therewith?	1
or	1
shall	1
the	1
saw	1
magnify	1
itself	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
shaketh	1
it?	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
rod	1
should	1
shake	1
itself	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
lift	1
it	1
up,	1
or	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
staff	1
should	1
lift	1
up	1
itself,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
no	1
wood.	1
	1
10:16	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
hosts,	1
send	1
among	1
his	1
fat	1
ones	1
leanness;	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
glory	1
he	1
shall	1
kindle	1
a	1
burning	1
like	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
a	1
fire.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
Holy	1
One	1
for	1
a	1
flame:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
burn	1
and	1
devour	1
his	1
thorns	1
and	1
his	1
briers	1
in	1
one	1
day;	1
10:18	1
And	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
forest,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
fruitful	1
field,	1
both	1
soul	1
and	1
body:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
standard-bearer	1
fainteth.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
his	1
forest	1
shall	1
be	1
few,	1
that	1
a	1
child	1
may	1
write	1
them.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
escaped	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
again	1
stay	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
them;	1
but	1
shall	1
stay	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
10:21	1
The	1
remnant	1
shall	1
return,	1
even	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
unto	1
the	1
mighty	1
God.	1
	1
10:22	1
For	1
though	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
yet	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
return:	1
the	1
consumption	1
decreed	1
shall	1
overflow	1
with	1
righteousness.	1
	1
10:23	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
make	1
a	1
consumption,	1
even	1
determined,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
10:24	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
O	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
Zion,	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
Assyrian:	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
with	1
a	1
rod,	1
and	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
staff	1
against	1
thee,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:25	1
For	1
yet	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
the	1
indignation	1
shall	1
cease,	1
and	1
mine	1
anger	1
in	1
their	1
destruction.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
a	1
scourge	1
for	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
Midian	1
at	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
Oreb:	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
rod	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
lift	1
it	1
up	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
his	1
burden	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
neck,	1
and	1
the	1
yoke	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
anointing.	1
	1
10:28	1
He	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
Aiath,	1
he	1
is	1
passed	1
to	1
Migron;	1
at	1
Michmash	1
he	1
hath	1
laid	1
up	1
his	1
carriages:	1
10:29	1
They	1
are	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
passage:	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
up	1
their	1
lodging	1
at	1
Geba;	1
Ramah	1
is	1
afraid;	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Saul	1
is	1
fled.	1
	1
10:30	1
Lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Gallim:	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
unto	1
Laish,	1
O	1
poor	1
Anathoth.	1
	1
10:31	1
Madmenah	1
is	1
removed;	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gebim	1
gather	1
themselves	1
to	1
flee.	1
	1
10:32	1
As	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
remain	1
at	1
Nob	1
that	1
day:	1
he	1
shall	1
shake	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
10:33	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
lop	1
the	1
bough	1
with	1
terror:	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
ones	1
of	1
stature	1
shall	1
be	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
haughty	1
shall	1
be	1
humbled.	1
	1
10:34	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
thickets	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
with	1
iron,	1
and	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
a	1
mighty	1
one.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
a	1
rod	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stem	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
a	1
Branch	1
shall	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
roots:	1
11:2	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
rest	1
upon	1
him,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
counsel	1
and	1
might,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
11:3	1
And	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
of	1
quick	1
understanding	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
judge	1
after	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
neither	1
reprove	1
after	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
ears:	1
11:4	1
But	1
with	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
he	1
judge	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
reprove	1
with	1
equity	1
for	1
the	1
meek	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
earth:	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
shall	1
he	1
slay	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
his	1
loins,	1
and	1
faithfulness	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
his	1
reins.	1
	1
11:6	1
The	1
wolf	1
also	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
lamb,	1
and	1
the	1
leopard	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
kid;	1
and	1
the	1
calf	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
fatling	1
together;	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
shall	1
lead	1
them.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
the	1
cow	1
and	1
the	1
bear	1
shall	1
feed;	1
their	1
young	1
ones	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
together:	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
shall	1
eat	1
straw	1
like	1
the	1
ox.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
the	1
sucking	1
child	1
shall	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
hole	1
of	1
the	1
asp,	1
and	1
the	1
weaned	1
child	1
shall	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
cockatrice'	1
den.	1
	1
11:9	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
nor	1
destroy	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
cover	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
root	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
which	1
shall	1
stand	1
for	1
an	1
ensign	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
to	1
it	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
seek:	1
and	1
his	1
rest	1
shall	1
be	1
glorious.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
set	1
his	1
hand	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
to	1
recover	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
left,	1
from	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
from	1
Pathros,	1
and	1
from	1
Cush,	1
and	1
from	1
Elam,	1
and	1
from	1
Shinar,	1
and	1
from	1
Hamath,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
islands	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
up	1
an	1
ensign	1
for	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
shall	1
assemble	1
the	1
outcasts	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
gather	1
together	1
the	1
dispersed	1
of	1
Judah	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:13	1
The	1
envy	1
also	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
depart,	1
and	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off:	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
not	1
envy	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Judah	1
shall	1
not	1
vex	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
11:14	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
fly	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
toward	1
the	1
west;	1
they	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
together:	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hand	1
upon	1
Edom	1
and	1
Moab;	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
shall	1
obey	1
them.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
sea;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
wind	1
shall	1
he	1
shake	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
shall	1
smite	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
streams,	1
and	1
make	1
men	1
go	1
over	1
dryshod.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
highway	1
for	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
left,	1
from	1
Assyria;	1
like	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee:	1
though	1
thou	1
wast	1
angry	1
with	1
me,	1
thine	1
anger	1
is	1
turned	1
away,	1
and	1
thou	1
comfortedst	1
me.	1
	1
12:2	1
Behold,	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
salvation;	1
I	1
will	1
trust,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
afraid:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
JEHOVAH	1
is	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
my	1
song;	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
become	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
12:3	1
Therefore	1
with	1
joy	1
shall	1
ye	1
draw	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wells	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
ye	1
say,	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD,	1
call	1
upon	1
his	1
name,	1
declare	1
his	1
doings	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
make	1
mention	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
exalted.	1
	1
12:5	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
excellent	1
things:	1
this	1
is	1
known	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:6	1
Cry	1
out	1
and	1
shout,	1
thou	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
13:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
which	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
did	1
see.	1
	1
13:2	1
Lift	1
ye	1
up	1
a	1
banner	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
mountain,	1
exalt	1
the	1
voice	1
unto	1
them,	1
shake	1
the	1
hand,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
nobles.	1
	1
13:3	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
my	1
sanctified	1
ones,	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
called	1
my	1
mighty	1
ones	1
for	1
mine	1
anger,	1
even	1
them	1
that	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
highness.	1
	1
13:4	1
The	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
multitude	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
like	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
people;	1
a	1
tumultuous	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
nations	1
gathered	1
together:	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
mustereth	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
13:5	1
They	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
heaven,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
his	1
indignation,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
whole	1
land.	1
	1
13:6	1
Howl	1
ye;	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
at	1
hand;	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
Almighty.	1
	1
13:7	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
all	1
hands	1
be	1
faint,	1
and	1
every	1
man's	1
heart	1
shall	1
melt:	1
13:8	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid:	1
pangs	1
and	1
sorrows	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
them;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
pain	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
travaileth:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
amazed	1
one	1
at	1
another;	1
their	1
faces	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
flames.	1
	1
13:9	1
Behold,	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh,	1
cruel	1
both	1
with	1
wrath	1
and	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
land	1
desolate:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
sinners	1
thereof	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:10	1
For	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
constellations	1
thereof	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
their	1
light:	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened	1
in	1
his	1
going	1
forth,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
cause	1
her	1
light	1
to	1
shine.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
their	1
evil,	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
arrogancy	1
of	1
the	1
proud	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
will	1
lay	1
low	1
the	1
haughtiness	1
of	1
the	1
terrible.	1
	1
13:12	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
more	1
precious	1
than	1
fine	1
gold;	1
even	1
a	1
man	1
than	1
the	1
golden	1
wedge	1
of	1
Ophir.	1
	1
13:13	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
remove	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
place,	1
in	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
chased	1
roe,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
up:	1
they	1
shall	1
every	1
man	1
turn	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
people,	1
and	1
flee	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
13:15	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
found	1
shall	1
be	1
thrust	1
through;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
joined	1
unto	1
them	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
13:16	1
Their	1
children	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
dashed	1
to	1
pieces	1
before	1
their	1
eyes;	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
ravished.	1
	1
13:17	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
Medes	1
against	1
them,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
regard	1
silver;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
gold,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
delight	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
13:18	1
Their	1
bows	1
also	1
shall	1
dash	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
pieces;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
on	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
womb;	1
their	1
eyes	1
shall	1
not	1
spare	1
children.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
Babylon,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
kingdoms,	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees'	1
excellency,	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
when	1
God	1
overthrew	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah.	1
	1
13:20	1
It	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
inhabited,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
dwelt	1
in	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation:	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
Arabian	1
pitch	1
tent	1
there;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
shepherds	1
make	1
their	1
fold	1
there.	1
	1
13:21	1
But	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
shall	1
lie	1
there;	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
doleful	1
creatures;	1
and	1
owls	1
shall	1
dwell	1
there,	1
and	1
satyrs	1
shall	1
dance	1
there.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
islands	1
shall	1
cry	1
in	1
their	1
desolate	1
houses,	1
and	1
dragons	1
in	1
their	1
pleasant	1
palaces:	1
and	1
her	1
time	1
is	1
near	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
her	1
days	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
prolonged.	1
	1
14:1	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
will	1
yet	1
choose	1
Israel,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
land:	1
and	1
the	1
strangers	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
cleave	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
take	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
place:	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
possess	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
servants	1
and	1
handmaids:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
captives,	1
whose	1
captives	1
they	1
were;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
their	1
oppressors.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
rest	1
from	1
thy	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
fear,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hard	1
bondage	1
wherein	1
thou	1
wast	1
made	1
to	1
serve,	1
14:4	1
That	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
up	1
this	1
proverb	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
say,	1
How	1
hath	1
the	1
oppressor	1
ceased!	1
the	1
golden	1
city	1
ceased!	1
	1
14:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
broken	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
the	1
rulers.	1
	1
14:6	1
He	1
who	1
smote	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
wrath	1
with	1
a	1
continual	1
stroke,	1
he	1
that	1
ruled	1
the	1
nations	1
in	1
anger,	1
is	1
persecuted,	1
and	1
none	1
hindereth.	1
	1
14:7	1
The	1
whole	1
earth	1
is	1
at	1
rest,	1
and	1
is	1
quiet:	1
they	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
singing.	1
	1
14:8	1
Yea,	1
the	1
fir	1
trees	1
rejoice	1
at	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
cedars	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
saying,	1
Since	1
thou	1
art	1
laid	1
down,	1
no	1
feller	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
us.	1
	1
14:9	1
Hell	1
from	1
beneath	1
is	1
moved	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
meet	1
thee	1
at	1
thy	1
coming:	1
it	1
stirreth	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
for	1
thee,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
ones	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
it	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
their	1
thrones	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
14:10	1
All	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Art	1
thou	1
also	1
become	1
weak	1
as	1
we?	1
art	1
thou	1
become	1
like	1
unto	1
us?	1
	1
14:11	1
Thy	1
pomp	1
is	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thy	1
viols:	1
the	1
worm	1
is	1
spread	1
under	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
worms	1
cover	1
thee.	1
	1
14:12	1
How	1
art	1
thou	1
fallen	1
from	1
heaven,	1
O	1
Lucifer,	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
morning!	1
how	1
art	1
thou	1
cut	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
which	1
didst	1
weaken	1
the	1
nations!	1
14:13	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
I	1
will	1
ascend	1
into	1
heaven,	1
I	1
will	1
exalt	1
my	1
throne	1
above	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
God:	1
I	1
will	1
sit	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
in	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
north:	1
14:14	1
I	1
will	1
ascend	1
above	1
the	1
heights	1
of	1
the	1
clouds;	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
most	1
High.	1
	1
14:15	1
Yet	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
hell,	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
14:16	1
They	1
that	1
see	1
thee	1
shall	1
narrowly	1
look	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
consider	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
tremble,	1
that	1
did	1
shake	1
kingdoms;	1
14:17	1
That	1
made	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof;	1
that	1
opened	1
not	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
prisoners?	1
	1
14:18	1
All	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
even	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
lie	1
in	1
glory,	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
14:19	1
But	1
thou	1
art	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
grave	1
like	1
an	1
abominable	1
branch,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
raiment	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
slain,	1
thrust	1
through	1
with	1
a	1
sword,	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
pit;	1
as	1
a	1
carcase	1
trodden	1
under	1
feet.	1
	1
14:20	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
joined	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
burial,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
thy	1
land,	1
and	1
slain	1
thy	1
people:	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
evildoers	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
renowned.	1
	1
14:21	1
Prepare	1
slaughter	1
for	1
his	1
children	1
for	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
their	1
fathers;	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
rise,	1
nor	1
possess	1
the	1
land,	1
nor	1
fill	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
cities.	1
	1
14:22	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Babylon	1
the	1
name,	1
and	1
remnant,	1
and	1
son,	1
and	1
nephew,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:23	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
possession	1
for	1
the	1
bittern,	1
and	1
pools	1
of	1
water:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sweep	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
besom	1
of	1
destruction,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
14:24	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sworn,	1
saying,	1
Surely	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
thought,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
purposed,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
stand:	1
14:25	1
That	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
in	1
my	1
land,	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
mountains	1
tread	1
him	1
under	1
foot:	1
then	1
shall	1
his	1
yoke	1
depart	1
from	1
off	1
them,	1
and	1
his	1
burden	1
depart	1
from	1
off	1
their	1
shoulders.	1
	1
14:26	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
purpose	1
that	1
is	1
purposed	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
earth:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
14:27	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
purposed,	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
disannul	1
it?	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out,	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
turn	1
it	1
back?	1
	1
14:28	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
died	1
was	1
this	1
burden.	1
	1
14:29	1
Rejoice	1
not	1
thou,	1
whole	1
Palestina,	1
because	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
thee	1
is	1
broken:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
serpent's	1
root	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
a	1
cockatrice,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fiery	1
flying	1
serpent.	1
	1
14:30	1
And	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
shall	1
feed,	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
safety:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
kill	1
thy	1
root	1
with	1
famine,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
thy	1
remnant.	1
	1
14:31	1
Howl,	1
O	1
gate;	1
cry,	1
O	1
city;	1
thou,	1
whole	1
Palestina,	1
art	1
dissolved:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
a	1
smoke,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
be	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
appointed	1
times.	1
	1
14:32	1
What	1
shall	1
one	1
then	1
answer	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
the	1
nation?	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
founded	1
Zion,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
shall	1
trust	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
15:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Moab.	1
Because	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
Ar	1
of	1
Moab	1
is	1
laid	1
waste,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
silence;	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
Kir	1
of	1
Moab	1
is	1
laid	1
waste,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
silence;	1
15:2	1
He	1
is	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
Bajith,	1
and	1
to	1
Dibon,	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
to	1
weep:	1
Moab	1
shall	1
howl	1
over	1
Nebo,	1
and	1
over	1
Medeba:	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
heads	1
shall	1
be	1
baldness,	1
and	1
every	1
beard	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
15:3	1
In	1
their	1
streets	1
they	1
shall	1
gird	1
themselves	1
with	1
sackcloth:	1
on	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
their	1
houses,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
streets,	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
howl,	1
weeping	1
abundantly.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Heshbon	1
shall	1
cry,	1
and	1
Elealeh:	1
their	1
voice	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
even	1
unto	1
Jahaz:	1
therefore	1
the	1
armed	1
soldiers	1
of	1
Moab	1
shall	1
cry	1
out;	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
grievous	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:5	1
My	1
heart	1
shall	1
cry	1
out	1
for	1
Moab;	1
his	1
fugitives	1
shall	1
flee	1
unto	1
Zoar,	1
an	1
heifer	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
mounting	1
up	1
of	1
Luhith	1
with	1
weeping	1
shall	1
they	1
go	1
it	1
up;	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Horonaim	1
they	1
shall	1
raise	1
up	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
destruction.	1
	1
15:6	1
For	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Nimrim	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate:	1
for	1
the	1
hay	1
is	1
withered	1
away,	1
the	1
grass	1
faileth,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
green	1
thing.	1
	1
15:7	1
Therefore	1
the	1
abundance	1
they	1
have	1
gotten,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
up,	1
shall	1
they	1
carry	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
the	1
willows.	1
	1
15:8	1
For	1
the	1
cry	1
is	1
gone	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Moab;	1
the	1
howling	1
thereof	1
unto	1
Eglaim,	1
and	1
the	1
howling	1
thereof	1
unto	1
Beerelim.	1
	1
15:9	1
For	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Dimon	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
blood:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
more	1
upon	1
Dimon,	1
lions	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
escapeth	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
16:1	1
Send	1
ye	1
the	1
lamb	1
to	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
Sela	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
16:2	1
For	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
wandering	1
bird	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nest,	1
so	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
fords	1
of	1
Arnon.	1
	1
16:3	1
Take	1
counsel,	1
execute	1
judgment;	1
make	1
thy	1
shadow	1
as	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
noonday;	1
hide	1
the	1
outcasts;	1
bewray	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
wandereth.	1
	1
16:4	1
Let	1
mine	1
outcasts	1
dwell	1
with	1
thee,	1
Moab;	1
be	1
thou	1
a	1
covert	1
to	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
spoiler:	1
for	1
the	1
extortioner	1
is	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
the	1
spoiler	1
ceaseth,	1
the	1
oppressors	1
are	1
consumed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
in	1
mercy	1
shall	1
the	1
throne	1
be	1
established:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
it	1
in	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David,	1
judging,	1
and	1
seeking	1
judgment,	1
and	1
hasting	1
righteousness.	1
	1
16:6	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Moab;	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
proud:	1
even	1
of	1
his	1
haughtiness,	1
and	1
his	1
pride,	1
and	1
his	1
wrath:	1
but	1
his	1
lies	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so.	1
	1
16:7	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
Moab	1
howl	1
for	1
Moab,	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
howl:	1
for	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
Kirhareseth	1
shall	1
ye	1
mourn;	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
stricken.	1
	1
16:8	1
For	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Heshbon	1
languish,	1
and	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
Sibmah:	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
have	1
broken	1
down	1
the	1
principal	1
plants	1
thereof,	1
they	1
are	1
come	1
even	1
unto	1
Jazer,	1
they	1
wandered	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
her	1
branches	1
are	1
stretched	1
out,	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
16:9	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
bewail	1
with	1
the	1
weeping	1
of	1
Jazer	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
Sibmah:	1
I	1
will	1
water	1
thee	1
with	1
my	1
tears,	1
O	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
Elealeh:	1
for	1
the	1
shouting	1
for	1
thy	1
summer	1
fruits	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
harvest	1
is	1
fallen.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
gladness	1
is	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
joy	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
plentiful	1
field;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
vineyards	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
singing,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
shouting:	1
the	1
treaders	1
shall	1
tread	1
out	1
no	1
wine	1
in	1
their	1
presses;	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
their	1
vintage	1
shouting	1
to	1
cease.	1
	1
16:11	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
bowels	1
shall	1
sound	1
like	1
an	1
harp	1
for	1
Moab,	1
and	1
mine	1
inward	1
parts	1
for	1
Kirharesh.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
seen	1
that	1
Moab	1
is	1
weary	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
place,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
sanctuary	1
to	1
pray;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail.	1
	1
16:13	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
Moab	1
since	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
16:14	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
saying,	1
Within	1
three	1
years,	1
as	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
contemned,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
great	1
multitude;	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
small	1
and	1
feeble.	1
	1
17:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Damascus.	1
Behold,	1
Damascus	1
is	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
ruinous	1
heap.	1
	1
17:2	1
The	1
cities	1
of	1
Aroer	1
are	1
forsaken:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
flocks,	1
which	1
shall	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:3	1
The	1
fortress	1
also	1
shall	1
cease	1
from	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
from	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Syria:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
thin,	1
and	1
the	1
fatness	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
shall	1
wax	1
lean.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
harvestman	1
gathereth	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
reapeth	1
the	1
ears	1
with	1
his	1
arm;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
ears	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
17:6	1
Yet	1
gleaning	1
grapes	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
an	1
olive	1
tree,	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
berries	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
uppermost	1
bough,	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
outmost	1
fruitful	1
branches	1
thereof,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:7	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
look	1
to	1
his	1
Maker,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
shall	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
altars,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
neither	1
shall	1
respect	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
fingers	1
have	1
made,	1
either	1
the	1
groves,	1
or	1
the	1
images.	1
	1
17:9	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
his	1
strong	1
cities	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
forsaken	1
bough,	1
and	1
an	1
uppermost	1
branch,	1
which	1
they	1
left	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
desolation.	1
	1
17:10	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
thy	1
strength,	1
therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
plant	1
pleasant	1
plants,	1
and	1
shalt	1
set	1
it	1
with	1
strange	1
slips:	1
17:11	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
thy	1
plant	1
to	1
grow,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
thy	1
seed	1
to	1
flourish:	1
but	1
the	1
harvest	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
heap	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
of	1
desperate	1
sorrow.	1
	1
17:12	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
many	1
people,	1
which	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
seas;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rushing	1
of	1
nations,	1
that	1
make	1
a	1
rushing	1
like	1
the	1
rushing	1
of	1
mighty	1
waters!	1
	1
17:13	1
The	1
nations	1
shall	1
rush	1
like	1
the	1
rushing	1
of	1
many	1
waters:	1
but	1
God	1
shall	1
rebuke	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
flee	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
chased	1
as	1
the	1
chaff	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
before	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
rolling	1
thing	1
before	1
the	1
whirlwind.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
behold	1
at	1
eveningtide	1
trouble;	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
is	1
not.	1
	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
spoil	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
rob	1
us.	1
	1
18:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
shadowing	1
with	1
wings,	1
which	1
is	1
beyond	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Ethiopia:	1
18:2	1
That	1
sendeth	1
ambassadors	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
even	1
in	1
vessels	1
of	1
bulrushes	1
upon	1
the	1
waters,	1
saying,	1
Go,	1
ye	1
swift	1
messengers,	1
to	1
a	1
nation	1
scattered	1
and	1
peeled,	1
to	1
a	1
people	1
terrible	1
from	1
their	1
beginning	1
hitherto;	1
a	1
nation	1
meted	1
out	1
and	1
trodden	1
down,	1
whose	1
land	1
the	1
rivers	1
have	1
spoiled!	1
	1
18:3	1
All	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
dwellers	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
see	1
ye,	1
when	1
he	1
lifteth	1
up	1
an	1
ensign	1
on	1
the	1
mountains;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
bloweth	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
hear	1
ye.	1
	1
18:4	1
For	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
my	1
rest,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
consider	1
in	1
my	1
dwelling	1
place	1
like	1
a	1
clear	1
heat	1
upon	1
herbs,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
dew	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
harvest.	1
	1
18:5	1
For	1
afore	1
the	1
harvest,	1
when	1
the	1
bud	1
is	1
perfect,	1
and	1
the	1
sour	1
grape	1
is	1
ripening	1
in	1
the	1
flower,	1
he	1
shall	1
both	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
sprigs	1
with	1
pruning	1
hooks,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
branches.	1
	1
18:6	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
shall	1
summer	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
winter	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
18:7	1
In	1
that	1
time	1
shall	1
the	1
present	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
scattered	1
and	1
peeled,	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
people	1
terrible	1
from	1
their	1
beginning	1
hitherto;	1
a	1
nation	1
meted	1
out	1
and	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot,	1
whose	1
land	1
the	1
rivers	1
have	1
spoiled,	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
mount	1
Zion.	1
	1
19:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
rideth	1
upon	1
a	1
swift	1
cloud,	1
and	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
be	1
moved	1
at	1
his	1
presence,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
melt	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
against	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fight	1
every	1
one	1
against	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
city	1
against	1
city,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
fail	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
counsel	1
thereof:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
seek	1
to	1
the	1
idols,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
charmers,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wizards.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
cruel	1
lord;	1
and	1
a	1
fierce	1
king	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
fail	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
be	1
wasted	1
and	1
dried	1
up.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
turn	1
the	1
rivers	1
far	1
away;	1
and	1
the	1
brooks	1
of	1
defence	1
shall	1
be	1
emptied	1
and	1
dried	1
up:	1
the	1
reeds	1
and	1
flags	1
shall	1
wither.	1
	1
19:7	1
The	1
paper	1
reeds	1
by	1
the	1
brooks,	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
brooks,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
sown	1
by	1
the	1
brooks,	1
shall	1
wither,	1
be	1
driven	1
away,	1
and	1
be	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
19:8	1
The	1
fishers	1
also	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
cast	1
angle	1
into	1
the	1
brooks	1
shall	1
lament,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
spread	1
nets	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
languish.	1
	1
19:9	1
Moreover	1
they	1
that	1
work	1
in	1
fine	1
flax,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
weave	1
networks,	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
the	1
purposes	1
thereof,	1
all	1
that	1
make	1
sluices	1
and	1
ponds	1
for	1
fish.	1
	1
19:11	1
Surely	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Zoan	1
are	1
fools,	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
counsellors	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
is	1
become	1
brutish:	1
how	1
say	1
ye	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
ancient	1
kings?	1
	1
19:12	1
Where	1
are	1
they?	1
where	1
are	1
thy	1
wise	1
men?	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
tell	1
thee	1
now,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
purposed	1
upon	1
Egypt.	1
	1
19:13	1
The	1
princes	1
of	1
Zoan	1
are	1
become	1
fools,	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Noph	1
are	1
deceived;	1
they	1
have	1
also	1
seduced	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
stay	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
thereof.	1
	1
19:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
mingled	1
a	1
perverse	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
caused	1
Egypt	1
to	1
err	1
in	1
every	1
work	1
thereof,	1
as	1
a	1
drunken	1
man	1
staggereth	1
in	1
his	1
vomit.	1
	1
19:15	1
Neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
work	1
for	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
the	1
head	1
or	1
tail,	1
branch	1
or	1
rush,	1
may	1
do.	1
	1
19:16	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
Egypt	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
women:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
and	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
he	1
shaketh	1
over	1
it.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
terror	1
unto	1
Egypt,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
maketh	1
mention	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
in	1
himself,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
determined	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
19:18	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
five	1
cities	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
speak	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
swear	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
called,	1
The	1
city	1
of	1
destruction.	1
	1
19:19	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
altar	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
a	1
pillar	1
at	1
the	1
border	1
thereof	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
oppressors,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
them	1
a	1
saviour,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
one,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
deliver	1
them.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
oblation;	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
vow	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
perform	1
it.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
smite	1
Egypt:	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
and	1
heal	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
intreated	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
19:23	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
highway	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
into	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
serve	1
with	1
the	1
Assyrians.	1
	1
19:24	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
Israel	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
with	1
Egypt	1
and	1
with	1
Assyria,	1
even	1
a	1
blessing	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
19:25	1
Whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
bless,	1
saying,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
Egypt	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
Assyria	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
Israel	1
mine	1
inheritance.	1
	1
20:1	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
Tartan	1
came	1
unto	1
Ashdod,	1
(when	1
Sargon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
sent	1
him,)	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
took	1
it;	1
20:2	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
spake	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
loose	1
the	1
sackcloth	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
put	1
off	1
thy	1
shoe	1
from	1
thy	1
foot.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
walking	1
naked	1
and	1
barefoot.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Like	1
as	1
my	1
servant	1
Isaiah	1
hath	1
walked	1
naked	1
and	1
barefoot	1
three	1
years	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
and	1
wonder	1
upon	1
Egypt	1
and	1
upon	1
Ethiopia;	1
20:4	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
captives,	1
young	1
and	1
old,	1
naked	1
and	1
barefoot,	1
even	1
with	1
their	1
buttocks	1
uncovered,	1
to	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
and	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Ethiopia	1
their	1
expectation,	1
and	1
of	1
Egypt	1
their	1
glory.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
this	1
isle	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
Behold,	1
such	1
is	1
our	1
expectation,	1
whither	1
we	1
flee	1
for	1
help	1
to	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
escape?	1
	1
21:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
As	1
whirlwinds	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
pass	1
through;	1
so	1
it	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
desert,	1
from	1
a	1
terrible	1
land.	1
	1
21:2	1
A	1
grievous	1
vision	1
is	1
declared	1
unto	1
me;	1
the	1
treacherous	1
dealer	1
dealeth	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
the	1
spoiler	1
spoileth.	1
Go	1
up,	1
O	1
Elam:	1
besiege,	1
O	1
Media;	1
all	1
the	1
sighing	1
thereof	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
to	1
cease.	1
	1
21:3	1
Therefore	1
are	1
my	1
loins	1
filled	1
with	1
pain:	1
pangs	1
have	1
taken	1
hold	1
upon	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
travaileth:	1
I	1
was	1
bowed	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
it;	1
I	1
was	1
dismayed	1
at	1
the	1
seeing	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:4	1
My	1
heart	1
panted,	1
fearfulness	1
affrighted	1
me:	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
my	1
pleasure	1
hath	1
he	1
turned	1
into	1
fear	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
21:5	1
Prepare	1
the	1
table,	1
watch	1
in	1
the	1
watchtower,	1
eat,	1
drink:	1
arise,	1
ye	1
princes,	1
and	1
anoint	1
the	1
shield.	1
	1
21:6	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go,	1
set	1
a	1
watchman,	1
let	1
him	1
declare	1
what	1
he	1
seeth.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
chariot	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
horsemen,	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
asses,	1
and	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
camels;	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
diligently	1
with	1
much	1
heed:	1
21:8	1
And	1
he	1
cried,	1
A	1
lion:	1
My	1
lord,	1
I	1
stand	1
continually	1
upon	1
the	1
watchtower	1
in	1
the	1
daytime,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
set	1
in	1
my	1
ward	1
whole	1
nights:	1
21:9	1
And,	1
behold,	1
here	1
cometh	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
men,	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
horsemen.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Babylon	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
graven	1
images	1
of	1
her	1
gods	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
unto	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
21:10	1
O	1
my	1
threshing,	1
and	1
the	1
corn	1
of	1
my	1
floor:	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
have	1
I	1
declared	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
21:11	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Dumah.	1
He	1
calleth	1
to	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
Seir,	1
Watchman,	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
night?	1
Watchman,	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
night?	1
	1
21:12	1
The	1
watchman	1
said,	1
The	1
morning	1
cometh,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
night:	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
enquire,	1
enquire	1
ye:	1
return,	1
come.	1
	1
21:13	1
The	1
burden	1
upon	1
Arabia.	1
In	1
the	1
forest	1
in	1
Arabia	1
shall	1
ye	1
lodge,	1
O	1
ye	1
travelling	1
companies	1
of	1
Dedanim.	1
	1
21:14	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Tema	1
brought	1
water	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
they	1
prevented	1
with	1
their	1
bread	1
him	1
that	1
fled.	1
	1
21:15	1
For	1
they	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
swords,	1
from	1
the	1
drawn	1
sword,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
bent	1
bow,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
grievousness	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
21:16	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Within	1
a	1
year,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Kedar	1
shall	1
fail:	1
21:17	1
And	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
archers,	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Kedar,	1
shall	1
be	1
diminished:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
22:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
vision.	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee	1
now,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
wholly	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
housetops?	1
	1
22:2	1
Thou	1
that	1
art	1
full	1
of	1
stirs,	1
a	1
tumultuous	1
city,	1
joyous	1
city:	1
thy	1
slain	1
men	1
are	1
not	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
nor	1
dead	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
22:3	1
All	1
thy	1
rulers	1
are	1
fled	1
together,	1
they	1
are	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
archers:	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
found	1
in	1
thee	1
are	1
bound	1
together,	1
which	1
have	1
fled	1
from	1
far.	1
	1
22:4	1
Therefore	1
said	1
I,	1
Look	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
I	1
will	1
weep	1
bitterly,	1
labour	1
not	1
to	1
comfort	1
me,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
spoiling	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
22:5	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
trouble,	1
and	1
of	1
treading	1
down,	1
and	1
of	1
perplexity	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
vision,	1
breaking	1
down	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
of	1
crying	1
to	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
Elam	1
bare	1
the	1
quiver	1
with	1
chariots	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
Kir	1
uncovered	1
the	1
shield.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
thy	1
choicest	1
valleys	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
chariots,	1
and	1
the	1
horsemen	1
shall	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
at	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
he	1
discovered	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
look	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
22:9	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
also	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
many:	1
and	1
ye	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
pool.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
numbered	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
have	1
ye	1
broken	1
down	1
to	1
fortify	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
22:11	1
Ye	1
made	1
also	1
a	1
ditch	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
walls	1
for	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
pool:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
looked	1
unto	1
the	1
maker	1
thereof,	1
neither	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
fashioned	1
it	1
long	1
ago.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
did	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
call	1
to	1
weeping,	1
and	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
to	1
baldness,	1
and	1
to	1
girding	1
with	1
sackcloth:	1
22:13	1
And	1
behold	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness,	1
slaying	1
oxen,	1
and	1
killing	1
sheep,	1
eating	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drinking	1
wine:	1
let	1
us	1
eat	1
and	1
drink;	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
revealed	1
in	1
mine	1
ears	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Surely	1
this	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
purged	1
from	1
you	1
till	1
ye	1
die,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
22:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Go,	1
get	1
thee	1
unto	1
this	1
treasurer,	1
even	1
unto	1
Shebna,	1
which	1
is	1
over	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
say,	1
22:16	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
here?	1
and	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
here,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
hewed	1
thee	1
out	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
here,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
heweth	1
him	1
out	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
that	1
graveth	1
an	1
habitation	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
rock?	1
	1
22:17	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
carry	1
thee	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
captivity,	1
and	1
will	1
surely	1
cover	1
thee.	1
	1
22:18	1
He	1
will	1
surely	1
violently	1
turn	1
and	1
toss	1
thee	1
like	1
a	1
ball	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
country:	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
die,	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
chariots	1
of	1
thy	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
thy	1
lord's	1
house.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
thee	1
from	1
thy	1
station,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
state	1
shall	1
he	1
pull	1
thee	1
down.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
my	1
servant	1
Eliakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah:	1
22:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
clothe	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
robe,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
girdle,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
commit	1
thy	1
government	1
into	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
will	1
I	1
lay	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder;	1
so	1
he	1
shall	1
open,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
shut;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
shut,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
open.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
fasten	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
nail	1
in	1
a	1
sure	1
place;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
glorious	1
throne	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
22:24	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
hang	1
upon	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
the	1
offspring	1
and	1
the	1
issue,	1
all	1
vessels	1
of	1
small	1
quantity,	1
from	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
cups,	1
even	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
flagons.	1
	1
22:25	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
the	1
nail	1
that	1
is	1
fastened	1
in	1
the	1
sure	1
place	1
be	1
removed,	1
and	1
be	1
cut	1
down,	1
and	1
fall;	1
and	1
the	1
burden	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
23:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Tyre.	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
laid	1
waste,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
house,	1
no	1
entering	1
in:	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Chittim	1
it	1
is	1
revealed	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
23:2	1
Be	1
still,	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
isle;	1
thou	1
whom	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
that	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
have	1
replenished.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
by	1
great	1
waters	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Sihor,	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
is	1
her	1
revenue;	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
mart	1
of	1
nations.	1
	1
23:4	1
Be	1
thou	1
ashamed,	1
O	1
Zidon:	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
even	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
saying,	1
I	1
travail	1
not,	1
nor	1
bring	1
forth	1
children,	1
neither	1
do	1
I	1
nourish	1
up	1
young	1
men,	1
nor	1
bring	1
up	1
virgins.	1
	1
23:5	1
As	1
at	1
the	1
report	1
concerning	1
Egypt,	1
so	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
sorely	1
pained	1
at	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
Tyre.	1
	1
23:6	1
Pass	1
ye	1
over	1
to	1
Tarshish;	1
howl,	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
isle.	1
	1
23:7	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
joyous	1
city,	1
whose	1
antiquity	1
is	1
of	1
ancient	1
days?	1
her	1
own	1
feet	1
shall	1
carry	1
her	1
afar	1
off	1
to	1
sojourn.	1
	1
23:8	1
Who	1
hath	1
taken	1
this	1
counsel	1
against	1
Tyre,	1
the	1
crowning	1
city,	1
whose	1
merchants	1
are	1
princes,	1
whose	1
traffickers	1
are	1
the	1
honourable	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
23:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
purposed	1
it,	1
to	1
stain	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
all	1
glory,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
into	1
contempt	1
all	1
the	1
honourable	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
23:10	1
Pass	1
through	1
thy	1
land	1
as	1
a	1
river,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Tarshish:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
strength.	1
	1
23:11	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
he	1
shook	1
the	1
kingdoms:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
a	1
commandment	1
against	1
the	1
merchant	1
city,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
strong	1
holds	1
thereof.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
rejoice,	1
O	1
thou	1
oppressed	1
virgin,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zidon:	1
arise,	1
pass	1
over	1
to	1
Chittim;	1
there	1
also	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
no	1
rest.	1
	1
23:13	1
Behold	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans;	1
this	1
people	1
was	1
not,	1
till	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
founded	1
it	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
they	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
towers	1
thereof,	1
they	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof;	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
ruin.	1
	1
23:14	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish:	1
for	1
your	1
strength	1
is	1
laid	1
waste.	1
	1
23:15	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
Tyre	1
shall	1
be	1
forgotten	1
seventy	1
years,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
one	1
king:	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
seventy	1
years	1
shall	1
Tyre	1
sing	1
as	1
an	1
harlot.	1
	1
23:16	1
Take	1
an	1
harp,	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
city,	1
thou	1
harlot	1
that	1
hast	1
been	1
forgotten;	1
make	1
sweet	1
melody,	1
sing	1
many	1
songs,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
remembered.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
seventy	1
years,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
visit	1
Tyre,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
her	1
hire,	1
and	1
shall	1
commit	1
fornication	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
23:18	1
And	1
her	1
merchandise	1
and	1
her	1
hire	1
shall	1
be	1
holiness	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
treasured	1
nor	1
laid	1
up;	1
for	1
her	1
merchandise	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
eat	1
sufficiently,	1
and	1
for	1
durable	1
clothing.	1
	1
24:1	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
maketh	1
the	1
earth	1
empty,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
waste,	1
and	1
turneth	1
it	1
upside	1
down,	1
and	1
scattereth	1
abroad	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
people,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
priest;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
servant,	1
so	1
with	1
his	1
master;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
maid,	1
so	1
with	1
her	1
mistress;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
buyer,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
seller;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
lender,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
borrower;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
taker	1
of	1
usury,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
giver	1
of	1
usury	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
24:3	1
The	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
emptied,	1
and	1
utterly	1
spoiled:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
this	1
word.	1
	1
24:4	1
The	1
earth	1
mourneth	1
and	1
fadeth	1
away,	1
the	1
world	1
languisheth	1
and	1
fadeth	1
away,	1
the	1
haughty	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
languish.	1
	1
24:5	1
The	1
earth	1
also	1
is	1
defiled	1
under	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
the	1
laws,	1
changed	1
the	1
ordinance,	1
broken	1
the	1
everlasting	1
covenant.	1
	1
24:6	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
curse	1
devoured	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
are	1
desolate:	1
therefore	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
burned,	1
and	1
few	1
men	1
left.	1
	1
24:7	1
The	1
new	1
wine	1
mourneth,	1
the	1
vine	1
languisheth,	1
all	1
the	1
merryhearted	1
do	1
sigh.	1
	1
24:8	1
The	1
mirth	1
of	1
tabrets	1
ceaseth,	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
rejoice	1
endeth,	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
harp	1
ceaseth.	1
	1
24:9	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
drink	1
wine	1
with	1
a	1
song;	1
strong	1
drink	1
shall	1
be	1
bitter	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
drink	1
it.	1
	1
24:10	1
The	1
city	1
of	1
confusion	1
is	1
broken	1
down:	1
every	1
house	1
is	1
shut	1
up,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
may	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
24:11	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
crying	1
for	1
wine	1
in	1
the	1
streets;	1
all	1
joy	1
is	1
darkened,	1
the	1
mirth	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
gone.	1
	1
24:12	1
In	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
left	1
desolation,	1
and	1
the	1
gate	1
is	1
smitten	1
with	1
destruction.	1
	1
24:13	1
When	1
thus	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
an	1
olive	1
tree,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
gleaning	1
grapes	1
when	1
the	1
vintage	1
is	1
done.	1
	1
24:14	1
They	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
they	1
shall	1
sing	1
for	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
aloud	1
from	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
24:15	1
Wherefore	1
glorify	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
fires,	1
even	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
24:16	1
From	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
we	1
heard	1
songs,	1
even	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
righteous.	1
But	1
I	1
said,	1
My	1
leanness,	1
my	1
leanness,	1
woe	1
unto	1
me!	1
the	1
treacherous	1
dealers	1
have	1
dealt	1
treacherously;	1
yea,	1
the	1
treacherous	1
dealers	1
have	1
dealt	1
very	1
treacherously.	1
	1
24:17	1
Fear,	1
and	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
the	1
snare,	1
are	1
upon	1
thee,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
fleeth	1
from	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
pit;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
snare:	1
for	1
the	1
windows	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
are	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
shake.	1
	1
24:19	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
utterly	1
broken	1
down,	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
clean	1
dissolved,	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
moved	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
24:20	1
The	1
earth	1
shall	1
reel	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
like	1
a	1
drunkard,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
removed	1
like	1
a	1
cottage;	1
and	1
the	1
transgression	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
heavy	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
not	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
punish	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
ones	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
as	1
prisoners	1
are	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
after	1
many	1
days	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
visited.	1
	1
24:23	1
Then	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
reign	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
ancients	1
gloriously.	1
	1
25:1	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
God;	1
I	1
will	1
exalt	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thy	1
name;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
wonderful	1
things;	1
thy	1
counsels	1
of	1
old	1
are	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
25:2	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
city	1
an	1
heap;	1
of	1
a	1
defenced	1
city	1
a	1
ruin:	1
a	1
palace	1
of	1
strangers	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
city;	1
it	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
built.	1
	1
25:3	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
strong	1
people	1
glorify	1
thee,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
nations	1
shall	1
fear	1
thee.	1
	1
25:4	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
a	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
a	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
needy	1
in	1
his	1
distress,	1
a	1
refuge	1
from	1
the	1
storm,	1
a	1
shadow	1
from	1
the	1
heat,	1
when	1
the	1
blast	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
ones	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
storm	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
25:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
strangers,	1
as	1
the	1
heat	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
place;	1
even	1
the	1
heat	1
with	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
cloud:	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
ones	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
low.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
mountain	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
make	1
unto	1
all	1
people	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
fat	1
things,	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
wines	1
on	1
the	1
lees,	1
of	1
fat	1
things	1
full	1
of	1
marrow,	1
of	1
wines	1
on	1
the	1
lees	1
well	1
refined.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
destroy	1
in	1
this	1
mountain	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
covering	1
cast	1
over	1
all	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
vail	1
that	1
is	1
spread	1
over	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
25:8	1
He	1
will	1
swallow	1
up	1
death	1
in	1
victory;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
wipe	1
away	1
tears	1
from	1
off	1
all	1
faces;	1
and	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
shall	1
he	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
25:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
Lo,	1
this	1
is	1
our	1
God;	1
we	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
save	1
us:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
LORD;	1
we	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
him,	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
salvation.	1
	1
25:10	1
For	1
in	1
this	1
mountain	1
shall	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
rest,	1
and	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
under	1
him,	1
even	1
as	1
straw	1
is	1
trodden	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
dunghill.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
spread	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
swimmeth	1
spreadeth	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
swim:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
their	1
pride	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
25:12	1
And	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
fort	1
of	1
thy	1
walls	1
shall	1
he	1
bring	1
down,	1
lay	1
low,	1
and	1
bring	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
26:1	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
this	1
song	1
be	1
sung	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah;	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
city;	1
salvation	1
will	1
God	1
appoint	1
for	1
walls	1
and	1
bulwarks.	1
	1
26:2	1
Open	1
ye	1
the	1
gates,	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
nation	1
which	1
keepeth	1
the	1
truth	1
may	1
enter	1
in.	1
	1
26:3	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
keep	1
him	1
in	1
perfect	1
peace,	1
whose	1
mind	1
is	1
stayed	1
on	1
thee:	1
because	1
he	1
trusteth	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
26:4	1
Trust	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
JEHOVAH	1
is	1
everlasting	1
strength:	1
26:5	1
For	1
he	1
bringeth	1
down	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
high;	1
the	1
lofty	1
city,	1
he	1
layeth	1
it	1
low;	1
he	1
layeth	1
it	1
low,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
he	1
bringeth	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
26:6	1
The	1
foot	1
shall	1
tread	1
it	1
down,	1
even	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
needy.	1
	1
26:7	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
is	1
uprightness:	1
thou,	1
most	1
upright,	1
dost	1
weigh	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
just.	1
	1
26:8	1
Yea,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
have	1
we	1
waited	1
for	1
thee;	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
our	1
soul	1
is	1
to	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
26:9	1
With	1
my	1
soul	1
have	1
I	1
desired	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
yea,	1
with	1
my	1
spirit	1
within	1
me	1
will	1
I	1
seek	1
thee	1
early:	1
for	1
when	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
learn	1
righteousness.	1
	1
26:10	1
Let	1
favour	1
be	1
shewed	1
to	1
the	1
wicked,	1
yet	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
learn	1
righteousness:	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
uprightness	1
will	1
he	1
deal	1
unjustly,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
behold	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:11	1
LORD,	1
when	1
thy	1
hand	1
is	1
lifted	1
up,	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
see:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
be	1
ashamed	1
for	1
their	1
envy	1
at	1
the	1
people;	1
yea,	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
devour	1
them.	1
	1
26:12	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
ordain	1
peace	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
thou	1
also	1
hast	1
wrought	1
all	1
our	1
works	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
26:13	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
other	1
lords	1
beside	1
thee	1
have	1
had	1
dominion	1
over	1
us:	1
but	1
by	1
thee	1
only	1
will	1
we	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
thy	1

	1
26:14	1
They	1
are	1
dead,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
live;	1
they	1
are	1
deceased,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
rise:	1
therefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
visited	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
their	1
memory	1
to	1
perish.	1
	1
26:15	1
Thou	1
hast	1
increased	1
the	1
nation,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
increased	1
the	1
nation:	1
thou	1
art	1
glorified:	1
thou	1
hadst	1
removed	1
it	1
far	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
26:16	1
LORD,	1
in	1
trouble	1
have	1
they	1
visited	1
thee,	1
they	1
poured	1
out	1
a	1
prayer	1
when	1
thy	1
chastening	1
was	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
26:17	1
Like	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
child,	1
that	1
draweth	1
near	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
delivery,	1
is	1
in	1
pain,	1
and	1
crieth	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
pangs;	1
so	1
have	1
we	1
been	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:18	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
child,	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
pain,	1
we	1
have	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
brought	1
forth	1
wind;	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
wrought	1
any	1
deliverance	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
neither	1
have	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
fallen.	1
	1
26:19	1
Thy	1
dead	1
men	1
shall	1
live,	1
together	1
with	1
my	1
dead	1
body	1
shall	1
they	1
arise.	1
Awake	1
and	1
sing,	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
dust:	1
for	1
thy	1
dew	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
herbs,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
26:20	1
Come,	1
my	1
people,	1
enter	1
thou	1
into	1
thy	1
chambers,	1
and	1
shut	1
thy	1
doors	1
about	1
thee:	1
hide	1
thyself	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
moment,	1
until	1
the	1
indignation	1
be	1
overpast.	1
	1
26:21	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
the	1
earth	1
also	1
shall	1
disclose	1
her	1
blood,	1
and	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
cover	1
her	1
slain.	1
	1
27:1	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
his	1
sore	1
and	1
great	1
and	1
strong	1
sword	1
shall	1
punish	1
leviathan	1
the	1
piercing	1
serpent,	1
even	1
leviathan	1
that	1
crooked	1
serpent;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
the	1
dragon	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
27:2	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
sing	1
ye	1
unto	1
her,	1
A	1
vineyard	1
of	1
red	1
wine.	1
	1
27:3	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
keep	1
it;	1
I	1
will	1
water	1
it	1
every	1
moment:	1
lest	1
any	1
hurt	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
it	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
27:4	1
Fury	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
me:	1
who	1
would	1
set	1
the	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns	1
against	1
me	1
in	1
battle?	1
I	1
would	1
go	1
through	1
them,	1
I	1
would	1
burn	1
them	1
together.	1
	1
27:5	1
Or	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
strength,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
make	1
peace	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
peace	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
27:6	1
He	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
that	1
come	1
of	1
Jacob	1
to	1
take	1
root:	1
Israel	1
shall	1
blossom	1
and	1
bud,	1
and	1
fill	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
fruit.	1
	1
27:7	1
Hath	1
he	1
smitten	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
smote	1
those	1
that	1
smote	1
him?	1
or	1
is	1
he	1
slain	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
slain	1
by	1
him?	1
	1
27:8	1
In	1
measure,	1
when	1
it	1
shooteth	1
forth,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
debate	1
with	1
it:	1
he	1
stayeth	1
his	1
rough	1
wind	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
wind.	1
	1
27:9	1
By	1
this	1
therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Jacob	1
be	1
purged;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
sin;	1
when	1
he	1
maketh	1
all	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
as	1
chalkstones	1
that	1
are	1
beaten	1
in	1
sunder,	1
the	1
groves	1
and	1
images	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
up.	1
	1
27:10	1
Yet	1
the	1
defenced	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
habitation	1
forsaken,	1
and	1
left	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness:	1
there	1
shall	1
the	1
calf	1
feed,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
he	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
consume	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof.	1
	1
27:11	1
When	1
the	1
boughs	1
thereof	1
are	1
withered,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
off:	1
the	1
women	1
come,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
on	1
fire:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
no	1
understanding:	1
therefore	1
he	1
that	1
made	1
them	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
formed	1
them	1
will	1
shew	1
them	1
no	1
favour.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
beat	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
channel	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
unto	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
trumpet	1
shall	1
be	1
blown,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
which	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
outcasts	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
shall	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
mount	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
28:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
pride,	1
to	1
the	1
drunkards	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
whose	1
glorious	1
beauty	1
is	1
a	1
fading	1
flower,	1
which	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
valleys	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
overcome	1
with	1
wine!	1
	1
28:2	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
a	1
mighty	1
and	1
strong	1
one,	1
which	1
as	1
a	1
tempest	1
of	1
hail	1
and	1
a	1
destroying	1
storm,	1
as	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
mighty	1
waters	1
overflowing,	1
shall	1
cast	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
28:3	1
The	1
crown	1
of	1
pride,	1
the	1
drunkards	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
feet:	1
28:4	1
And	1
the	1
glorious	1
beauty,	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
valley,	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fading	1
flower,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
hasty	1
fruit	1
before	1
the	1
summer;	1
which	1
when	1
he	1
that	1
looketh	1
upon	1
it	1
seeth,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
eateth	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
28:5	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
diadem	1
of	1
beauty,	1
unto	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
28:6	1
And	1
for	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
judgment	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
for	1
strength	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
turn	1
the	1
battle	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
28:7	1
But	1
they	1
also	1
have	1
erred	1
through	1
wine,	1
and	1
through	1
strong	1
drink	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
have	1
erred	1
through	1
strong	1
drink,	1
they	1
are	1
swallowed	1
up	1
of	1
wine,	1
they	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
through	1
strong	1
drink;	1
they	1
err	1
in	1
vision,	1
they	1
stumble	1
in	1
judgment.	1
	1
28:8	1
For	1
all	1
tables	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
vomit	1
and	1
filthiness,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
clean.	1
	1
28:9	1
Whom	1
shall	1
he	1
teach	1
knowledge?	1
and	1
whom	1
shall	1
he	1
make	1
to	1
understand	1
doctrine?	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
weaned	1
from	1
the	1
milk,	1
and	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
breasts.	1
	1
28:10	1
For	1
precept	1
must	1
be	1
upon	1
precept,	1
precept	1
upon	1
precept;	1
line	1
upon	1
line,	1
line	1
upon	1
line;	1
here	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
little:	1
28:11	1
For	1
with	1
stammering	1
lips	1
and	1
another	1
tongue	1
will	1
he	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
28:12	1
To	1
whom	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
rest	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
may	1
cause	1
the	1
weary	1
to	1
rest;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
refreshing:	1
yet	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
28:13	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
unto	1
them	1
precept	1
upon	1
precept,	1
precept	1
upon	1
precept;	1
line	1
upon	1
line,	1
line	1
upon	1
line;	1
here	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
little;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
go,	1
and	1
fall	1
backward,	1
and	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
snared,	1
and	1
taken.	1
	1
28:14	1
Wherefore	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
scornful	1
men,	1
that	1
rule	1
this	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
28:15	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
death,	1
and	1
with	1
hell	1
are	1
we	1
at	1
agreement;	1
when	1
the	1
overflowing	1
scourge	1
shall	1
pass	1
through,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
lies	1
our	1
refuge,	1
and	1
under	1
falsehood	1
have	1
we	1
hid	1
ourselves:	1
28:16	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Zion	1
for	1
a	1
foundation	1
a	1
stone,	1
a	1
tried	1
stone,	1
a	1
precious	1
corner	1
stone,	1
a	1
sure	1
foundation:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
haste.	1
	1
28:17	1
Judgment	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
lay	1
to	1
the	1
line,	1
and	1
righteousness	1
to	1
the	1
plummet:	1
and	1
the	1
hail	1
shall	1
sweep	1
away	1
the	1
refuge	1
of	1
lies,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
overflow	1
the	1
hiding	1
place.	1
	1
28:18	1
And	1
your	1
covenant	1
with	1
death	1
shall	1
be	1
disannulled,	1
and	1
your	1
agreement	1
with	1
hell	1
shall	1
not	1
stand;	1
when	1
the	1
overflowing	1
scourge	1
shall	1
pass	1
through,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
28:19	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
goeth	1
forth	1
it	1
shall	1
take	1
you:	1
for	1
morning	1
by	1
morning	1
shall	1
it	1
pass	1
over,	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
night:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
vexation	1
only	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
report.	1
	1
28:20	1
For	1
the	1
bed	1
is	1
shorter	1
than	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
stretch	1
himself	1
on	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
covering	1
narrower	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
wrap	1
himself	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
28:21	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
as	1
in	1
mount	1
Perazim,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
wroth	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gibeon,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
his	1
work,	1
his	1
strange	1
work;	1
and	1
bring	1
to	1
pass	1
his	1
act,	1
his	1
strange	1
act.	1
	1
28:22	1
Now	1
therefore	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
mockers,	1
lest	1
your	1
bands	1
be	1
made	1
strong:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
a	1
consumption,	1
even	1
determined	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
28:23	1
Give	1
ye	1
ear,	1
and	1
hear	1
my	1
voice;	1
hearken,	1
and	1
hear	1
my	1
speech.	1
	1
28:24	1
Doth	1
the	1
plowman	1
plow	1
all	1
day	1
to	1
sow?	1
doth	1
he	1
open	1
and	1
break	1
the	1
clods	1
of	1
his	1
ground?	1
	1
28:25	1
When	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
plain	1
the	1
face	1
thereof,	1
doth	1
he	1
not	1
cast	1
abroad	1
the	1
fitches,	1
and	1
scatter	1
the	1
cummin,	1
and	1
cast	1
in	1
the	1
principal	1
wheat	1
and	1
the	1
appointed	1
barley	1
and	1
the	1
rie	1
in	1
their	1
place?	1
	1
28:26	1
For	1
his	1
God	1
doth	1
instruct	1
him	1
to	1
discretion,	1
and	1
doth	1
teach	1
him.	1
	1
28:27	1
For	1
the	1
fitches	1
are	1
not	1
threshed	1
with	1
a	1
threshing	1
instrument,	1
neither	1
is	1
a	1
cart	1
wheel	1
turned	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
cummin;	1
but	1
the	1
fitches	1
are	1
beaten	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
staff,	1
and	1
the	1
cummin	1
with	1
a	1
rod.	1
	1
28:28	1
Bread	1
corn	1
is	1
bruised;	1
because	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
ever	1
be	1
threshing	1
it,	1
nor	1
break	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
his	1
cart,	1
nor	1
bruise	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
28:29	1
This	1
also	1
cometh	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
is	1
wonderful	1
in	1
counsel,	1
and	1
excellent	1
in	1
working.	1
	1
29:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
Ariel,	1
to	1
Ariel,	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
David	1
dwelt!	1
add	1
ye	1
year	1
to	1
year;	1
let	1
them	1
kill	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
29:2	1
Yet	1
I	1
will	1
distress	1
Ariel,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
heaviness	1
and	1
sorrow:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
Ariel.	1
	1
29:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
camp	1
against	1
thee	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
will	1
lay	1
siege	1
against	1
thee	1
with	1
a	1
mount,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
forts	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
29:4	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
brought	1
down,	1
and	1
shalt	1
speak	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
thy	1
speech	1
shall	1
be	1
low	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
thy	1
voice	1
shall	1
be,	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
thy	1
speech	1
shall	1
whisper	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
29:5	1
Moreover	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
strangers	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
small	1
dust,	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
ones	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
chaff	1
that	1
passeth	1
away:	1
yea,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
an	1
instant	1
suddenly.	1
	1
29:6	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
visited	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
with	1
thunder,	1
and	1
with	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
great	1
noise,	1
with	1
storm	1
and	1
tempest,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
devouring	1
fire.	1
	1
29:7	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
Ariel,	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
munition,	1
and	1
that	1
distress	1
her,	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
dream	1
of	1
a	1
night	1
vision.	1
	1
29:8	1
It	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
as	1
when	1
an	1
hungry	1
man	1
dreameth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
eateth;	1
but	1
he	1
awaketh,	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
empty:	1
or	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
thirsty	1
man	1
dreameth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
drinketh;	1
but	1
he	1
awaketh,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
faint,	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
hath	1
appetite:	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
be,	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
mount	1
Zion.	1
	1
29:9	1
Stay	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
wonder;	1
cry	1
ye	1
out,	1
and	1
cry:	1
they	1
are	1
drunken,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
wine;	1
they	1
stagger,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
strong	1
drink.	1
	1
29:10	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
deep	1
sleep,	1
and	1
hath	1
closed	1
your	1
eyes:	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
your	1
rulers,	1
the	1
seers	1
hath	1
he	1
covered.	1
	1
29:11	1
And	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
become	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
that	1
is	1
sealed,	1
which	1
men	1
deliver	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
learned,	1
saying,	1
Read	1
this,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee:	1
and	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
cannot;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
sealed:	1
29:12	1
And	1
the	1
book	1
is	1
delivered	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
learned,	1
saying,	1
Read	1
this,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee:	1
and	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
learned.	1
	1
29:13	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
this	1
people	1
draw	1
near	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
lips	1
do	1
honour	1
me,	1
but	1
have	1
removed	1
their	1
heart	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
their	1
fear	1
toward	1
me	1
is	1
taught	1
by	1
the	1
precept	1
of	1
men:	1
29:14	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
marvellous	1
work	1
among	1
this	1
people,	1
even	1
a	1
marvellous	1
work	1
and	1
a	1
wonder:	1
for	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
their	1
wise	1
men	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
their	1
prudent	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
29:15	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
deep	1
to	1
hide	1
their	1
counsel	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
works	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
and	1
they	1
say,	1
Who	1
seeth	1
us?	1
and	1
who	1
knoweth	1
us?	1
	1
29:16	1
Surely	1
your	1
turning	1
of	1
things	1
upside	1
down	1
shall	1
be	1
esteemed	1
as	1
the	1
potter's	1
clay:	1
for	1
shall	1
the	1
work	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
it,	1
He	1
made	1
me	1
not?	1
or	1
shall	1
the	1
thing	1
framed	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
framed	1
it,	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
understanding?	1
	1
29:17	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
yet	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
fruitful	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
fruitful	1
field	1
shall	1
be	1
esteemed	1
as	1
a	1
forest?	1
	1
29:18	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
shall	1
see	1
out	1
of	1
obscurity,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
29:19	1
The	1
meek	1
also	1
shall	1
increase	1
their	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
among	1
men	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:20	1
For	1
the	1
terrible	1
one	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
nought,	1
and	1
the	1
scorner	1
is	1
consumed,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
watch	1
for	1
iniquity	1
are	1
cut	1
off:	1
29:21	1
That	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
an	1
offender	1
for	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
lay	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
reproveth	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
just	1
for	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought.	1
	1
29:22	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
redeemed	1
Abraham,	1
concerning	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
neither	1
shall	1
his	1
face	1
now	1
wax	1
pale.	1
	1
29:23	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
his	1
children,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
mine	1
hands,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:24	1
They	1
also	1
that	1
erred	1
in	1
spirit	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
understanding,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
murmured	1
shall	1
learn	1
doctrine.	1
	1
30:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
rebellious	1
children,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
take	1
counsel,	1
but	1
not	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
that	1
cover	1
with	1
a	1
covering,	1
but	1
not	1
of	1
my	1
spirit,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
add	1
sin	1
to	1
sin:	1
30:2	1
That	1
walk	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
asked	1
at	1
my	1
mouth;	1
to	1
strengthen	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Egypt!	1
	1
30:3	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
be	1
your	1
shame,	1
and	1
the	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Egypt	1
your	1
confusion.	1
	1
30:4	1
For	1
his	1
princes	1
were	1
at	1
Zoan,	1
and	1
his	1
ambassadors	1
came	1
to	1
Hanes.	1
	1
30:5	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
ashamed	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
profit	1
them,	1
nor	1
be	1
an	1
help	1
nor	1
profit,	1
but	1
a	1
shame,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
reproach.	1
	1
30:6	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
south:	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
anguish,	1
from	1
whence	1
come	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
lion,	1
the	1
viper	1
and	1
fiery	1
flying	1
serpent,	1
they	1
will	1
carry	1
their	1
riches	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
young	1
asses,	1
and	1
their	1
treasures	1
upon	1
the	1
bunches	1
of	1
camels,	1
to	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
profit	1
them.	1
	1
30:7	1
For	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
help	1
in	1
vain,	1
and	1
to	1
no	1
purpose:	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
cried	1
concerning	1
this,	1
Their	1
strength	1
is	1
to	1
sit	1
still.	1
	1
30:8	1
Now	1
go,	1
write	1
it	1
before	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
table,	1
and	1
note	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
30:9	1
That	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
rebellious	1
people,	1
lying	1
children,	1
children	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
30:10	1
Which	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
seers,	1
See	1
not;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets,	1
Prophesy	1
not	1
unto	1
us	1
right	1
things,	1
speak	1
unto	1
us	1
smooth	1
things,	1
prophesy	1
deceits:	1
30:11	1
Get	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
turn	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
path,	1
cause	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
before	1
us.	1
	1
30:12	1
Wherefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Because	1
ye	1
despise	1
this	1
word,	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
oppression	1
and	1
perverseness,	1
and	1
stay	1
thereon:	1
30:13	1
Therefore	1
this	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
breach	1
ready	1
to	1
fall,	1
swelling	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
wall,	1
whose	1
breaking	1
cometh	1
suddenly	1
at	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
30:14	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
break	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
breaking	1
of	1
the	1
potters'	1
vessel	1
that	1
is	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
spare:	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
bursting	1
of	1
it	1
a	1
sherd	1
to	1
take	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
hearth,	1
or	1
to	1
take	1
water	1
withal	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
30:15	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
In	1
returning	1
and	1
rest	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
saved;	1
in	1
quietness	1
and	1
in	1
confidence	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
strength:	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not.	1
	1
30:16	1
But	1
ye	1
said,	1
No;	1
for	1
we	1
will	1
flee	1
upon	1
horses;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
flee:	1
and,	1
We	1
will	1
ride	1
upon	1
the	1
swift;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
pursue	1
you	1
be	1
swift.	1
	1
30:17	1
One	1
thousand	1
shall	1
flee	1
at	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
one;	1
at	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
five	1
shall	1
ye	1
flee:	1
till	1
ye	1
be	1
left	1
as	1
a	1
beacon	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
ensign	1
on	1
an	1
hill.	1
	1
30:18	1
And	1
therefore	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
wait,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
therefore	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
exalted,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
judgment:	1
blessed	1
are	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
30:19	1
For	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
Zion	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
weep	1
no	1
more:	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
gracious	1
unto	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
cry;	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
it,	1
he	1
will	1
answer	1
thee.	1
	1
30:20	1
And	1
though	1
the	1
Lord	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
adversity,	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
affliction,	1
yet	1
shall	1
not	1
thy	1
teachers	1
be	1
removed	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
any	1
more,	1
but	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see	1
thy	1
teachers:	1
30:21	1
And	1
thine	1
ears	1
shall	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
behind	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
way,	1
walk	1
ye	1
in	1
it,	1
when	1
ye	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
30:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
defile	1
also	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
thy	1
graven	1
images	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
ornament	1
of	1
thy	1
molten	1
images	1
of	1
gold:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cast	1
them	1
away	1
as	1
a	1
menstruous	1
cloth;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
it,	1
Get	1
thee	1
hence.	1
	1
30:23	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
give	1
the	1
rain	1
of	1
thy	1
seed,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sow	1
the	1
ground	1
withal;	1
and	1
bread	1
of	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
fat	1
and	1
plenteous:	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
thy	1
cattle	1
feed	1
in	1
large	1
pastures.	1
	1
30:24	1
The	1
oxen	1
likewise	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
asses	1
that	1
ear	1
the	1
ground	1
shall	1
eat	1
clean	1
provender,	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
winnowed	1
with	1
the	1
shovel	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
fan.	1
	1
30:25	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
hill,	1
rivers	1
and	1
streams	1
of	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
slaughter,	1
when	1
the	1
towers	1
fall.	1
	1
30:26	1
Moreover	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
sevenfold,	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
seven	1
days,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
bindeth	1
up	1
the	1
breach	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
healeth	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
their	1
wound.	1
	1
30:27	1
Behold,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh	1
from	1
far,	1
burning	1
with	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
burden	1
thereof	1
is	1
heavy:	1
his	1
lips	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
indignation,	1
and	1
his	1
tongue	1
as	1
a	1
devouring	1
fire:	1
30:28	1
And	1
his	1
breath,	1
as	1
an	1
overflowing	1
stream,	1
shall	1
reach	1
to	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
neck,	1
to	1
sift	1
the	1
nations	1
with	1
the	1
sieve	1
of	1
vanity:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
bridle	1
in	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
causing	1
them	1
to	1
err.	1
	1
30:29	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
song,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
a	1
holy	1
solemnity	1
is	1
kept;	1
and	1
gladness	1
of	1
heart,	1
as	1
when	1
one	1
goeth	1
with	1
a	1
pipe	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
the	1
mighty	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
30:30	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
cause	1
his	1
glorious	1
voice	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
the	1
lighting	1
down	1
of	1
his	1
arm,	1
with	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
a	1
devouring	1
fire,	1
with	1
scattering,	1
and	1
tempest,	1
and	1
hailstones.	1
	1
30:31	1
For	1
through	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
be	1
beaten	1
down,	1
which	1
smote	1
with	1
a	1
rod.	1
	1
30:32	1
And	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
grounded	1
staff	1
shall	1
pass,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
lay	1
upon	1
him,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
tabrets	1
and	1
harps:	1
and	1
in	1
battles	1
of	1
shaking	1
will	1
he	1
fight	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
30:33	1
For	1
Tophet	1
is	1
ordained	1
of	1
old;	1
yea,	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
it	1
is	1
prepared;	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
it	1
deep	1
and	1
large:	1
the	1
pile	1
thereof	1
is	1
fire	1
and	1
much	1
wood;	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
like	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
brimstone,	1
doth	1
kindle	1
it.	1
	1
31:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Egypt	1
for	1
help;	1
and	1
stay	1
on	1
horses,	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
chariots,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
many;	1
and	1
in	1
horsemen,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
strong;	1
but	1
they	1
look	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
neither	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD!	1
	1
31:2	1
Yet	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
wise,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
evil,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
call	1
back	1
his	1
words:	1
but	1
will	1
arise	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
evildoers,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity.	1
	1
31:3	1
Now	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
are	1
men,	1
and	1
not	1
God;	1
and	1
their	1
horses	1
flesh,	1
and	1
not	1
spirit.	1
When	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
stretch	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
helpeth	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holpen	1
shall	1
fall	1
down,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
fail	1
together.	1
	1
31:4	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me,	1
Like	1
as	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lion	1
roaring	1
on	1
his	1
prey,	1
when	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
shepherds	1
is	1
called	1
forth	1
against	1
him,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
voice,	1
nor	1
abase	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
them:	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
hill	1
thereof.	1
	1
31:5	1
As	1
birds	1
flying,	1
so	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
defend	1
Jerusalem;	1
defending	1
also	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
it;	1
and	1
passing	1
over	1
he	1
will	1
preserve	1
it.	1
	1
31:6	1
Turn	1
ye	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
whom	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
deeply	1
revolted.	1
	1
31:7	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
idols	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
his	1
idols	1
of	1
gold,	1
which	1
your	1
own	1
hands	1
have	1
made	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
sin.	1
	1
31:8	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
fall	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
man;	1
and	1
the	1
sword,	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
mean	1
man,	1
shall	1
devour	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
his	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
discomfited.	1
	1
31:9	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
to	1
his	1
strong	1
hold	1
for	1
fear,	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
ensign,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whose	1
fire	1
is	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
his	1
furnace	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
32:1	1
Behold,	1
a	1
king	1
shall	1
reign	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
princes	1
shall	1
rule	1
in	1
judgment.	1
	1
32:2	1
And	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
an	1
hiding	1
place	1
from	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
a	1
covert	1
from	1
the	1
tempest;	1
as	1
rivers	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
place,	1
as	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
rock	1
in	1
a	1
weary	1
land.	1
	1
32:3	1
And	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
see	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
dim,	1
and	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hear	1
shall	1
hearken.	1
	1
32:4	1
The	1
heart	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
rash	1
shall	1
understand	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
stammerers	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
speak	1
plainly.	1
	1
32:5	1
The	1
vile	1
person	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
called	1
liberal,	1
nor	1
the	1
churl	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
bountiful.	1
	1
32:6	1
For	1
the	1
vile	1
person	1
will	1
speak	1
villany,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
will	1
work	1
iniquity,	1
to	1
practise	1
hypocrisy,	1
and	1
to	1
utter	1
error	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
empty	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
hungry,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
thirsty	1
to	1
fail.	1
	1
32:7	1
The	1
instruments	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
churl	1
are	1
evil:	1
he	1
deviseth	1
wicked	1
devices	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
poor	1
with	1
lying	1
words,	1
even	1
when	1
the	1
needy	1
speaketh	1
right.	1
	1
32:8	1
But	1
the	1
liberal	1
deviseth	1
liberal	1
things;	1
and	1
by	1
liberal	1
things	1
shall	1
he	1
stand.	1
	1
32:9	1
Rise	1
up,	1
ye	1
women	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease;	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
ye	1
careless	1
daughters;	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
speech.	1
	1
32:10	1
Many	1
days	1
and	1
years	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
troubled,	1
ye	1
careless	1
women:	1
for	1
the	1
vintage	1
shall	1
fail,	1
the	1
gathering	1
shall	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
32:11	1
Tremble,	1
ye	1
women	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease;	1
be	1
troubled,	1
ye	1
careless	1
ones:	1
strip	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
bare,	1
and	1
gird	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
your	1
loins.	1
	1
32:12	1
They	1
shall	1
lament	1
for	1
the	1
teats,	1
for	1
the	1
pleasant	1
fields,	1
for	1
the	1
fruitful	1
vine.	1
	1
32:13	1
Upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
thorns	1
and	1
briers;	1
yea,	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
joyous	1
city:	1
32:14	1
Because	1
the	1
palaces	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken;	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
left;	1
the	1
forts	1
and	1
towers	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
dens	1
for	1
ever,	1
a	1
joy	1
of	1
wild	1
asses,	1
a	1
pasture	1
of	1
flocks;	1
32:15	1
Until	1
the	1
spirit	1
be	1
poured	1
upon	1
us	1
from	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
the	1
wilderness	1
be	1
a	1
fruitful	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
fruitful	1
field	1
be	1
counted	1
for	1
a	1
forest.	1
	1
32:16	1
Then	1
judgment	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
righteousness	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
fruitful	1
field.	1
	1
32:17	1
And	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
be	1
peace;	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
righteousness	1
quietness	1
and	1
assurance	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
32:18	1
And	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1
peaceable	1
habitation,	1
and	1
in	1
sure	1
dwellings,	1
and	1
in	1
quiet	1
resting	1
places;	1
32:19	1
When	1
it	1
shall	1
hail,	1
coming	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
forest;	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
low	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
place.	1
	1
32:20	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
that	1
sow	1
beside	1
all	1
waters,	1
that	1
send	1
forth	1
thither	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
ox	1
and	1
the	1
ass.	1
	1
33:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
thee	1
that	1
spoilest,	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
not	1
spoiled;	1
and	1
dealest	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
they	1
dealt	1
not	1
treacherously	1
with	1
thee!	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cease	1
to	1
spoil,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
spoiled;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
deal	1
treacherously,	1
they	1
shall	1
deal	1
treacherously	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
33:2	1
O	1
LORD,	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
us;	1
we	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
thee:	1
be	1
thou	1
their	1
arm	1
every	1
morning,	1
our	1
salvation	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
33:3	1
At	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
tumult	1
the	1
people	1
fled;	1
at	1
the	1
lifting	1
up	1
of	1
thyself	1
the	1
nations	1
were	1
scattered.	1
	1
33:4	1
And	1
your	1
spoil	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
like	1
the	1
gathering	1
of	1
the	1
caterpiller:	1
as	1
the	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
of	1
locusts	1
shall	1
he	1
run	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
33:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
exalted;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
on	1
high:	1
he	1
hath	1
filled	1
Zion	1
with	1
judgment	1
and	1
righteousness.	1
	1
33:6	1
And	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
thy	1
times,	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
salvation:	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
treasure.	1
	1
33:7	1
Behold,	1
their	1
valiant	1
ones	1
shall	1
cry	1
without:	1
the	1
ambassadors	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
weep	1
bitterly.	1
	1
33:8	1
The	1
highways	1
lie	1
waste,	1
the	1
wayfaring	1
man	1
ceaseth:	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
the	1
covenant,	1
he	1
hath	1
despised	1
the	1
cities,	1
he	1
regardeth	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
33:9	1
The	1
earth	1
mourneth	1
and	1
languisheth:	1
Lebanon	1
is	1
ashamed	1
and	1
hewn	1
down:	1
Sharon	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
Bashan	1
and	1
Carmel	1
shake	1
off	1
their	1
fruits.	1
	1
33:10	1
Now	1
will	1
I	1
rise,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
exalted;	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
lift	1
up	1
myself.	1
	1
33:11	1
Ye	1
shall	1
conceive	1
chaff,	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
stubble:	1
your	1
breath,	1
as	1
fire,	1
shall	1
devour	1
you.	1
	1
33:12	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
burnings	1
of	1
lime:	1
as	1
thorns	1
cut	1
up	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
33:13	1
Hear,	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done;	1
and,	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
near,	1
acknowledge	1
my	1
might.	1
	1
33:14	1
The	1
sinners	1
in	1
Zion	1
are	1
afraid;	1
fearfulness	1
hath	1
surprised	1
the	1
hypocrites.	1
Who	1
among	1
us	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
devouring	1
fire?	1
who	1
among	1
us	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
everlasting	1
burnings?	1
	1
33:15	1
He	1
that	1
walketh	1
righteously,	1
and	1
speaketh	1
uprightly;	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
the	1
gain	1
of	1
oppressions,	1
that	1
shaketh	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
holding	1
of	1
bribes,	1
that	1
stoppeth	1
his	1
ears	1
from	1
hearing	1
of	1
blood,	1
and	1
shutteth	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
seeing	1
evil;	1
33:16	1
He	1
shall	1
dwell	1
on	1
high:	1
his	1
place	1
of	1
defence	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
munitions	1
of	1
rocks:	1
bread	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
him;	1
his	1
waters	1
shall	1
be	1
sure.	1
	1
33:17	1
Thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
beauty:	1
they	1
shall	1
behold	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
far	1
off.	1
	1
33:18	1
Thine	1
heart	1
shall	1
meditate	1
terror.	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
scribe?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
receiver?	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
counted	1
the	1
towers?	1
	1
33:19	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
a	1
fierce	1
people,	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
a	1
deeper	1
speech	1
than	1
thou	1
canst	1
perceive;	1
of	1
a	1
stammering	1
tongue,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
33:20	1
Look	1
upon	1
Zion,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
our	1
solemnities:	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
quiet	1
habitation,	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
down;	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
stakes	1
thereof	1
shall	1
ever	1
be	1
removed,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
cords	1
thereof	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
33:21	1
But	1
there	1
the	1
glorious	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
broad	1
rivers	1
and	1
streams;	1
wherein	1
shall	1
go	1
no	1
galley	1
with	1
oars,	1
neither	1
shall	1
gallant	1
ship	1
pass	1
thereby.	1
	1
33:22	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
our	1
judge,	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
our	1
lawgiver,	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
our	1
king;	1
he	1
will	1
save	1
us.	1
	1
33:23	1
Thy	1
tacklings	1
are	1
loosed;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
strengthen	1
their	1
mast,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
spread	1
the	1
sail:	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
spoil	1
divided;	1
the	1
lame	1
take	1
the	1
prey.	1
	1
33:24	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
shall	1
not	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
sick:	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
34:1	1
Come	1
near,	1
ye	1
nations,	1
to	1
hear;	1
and	1
hearken,	1
ye	1
people:	1
let	1
the	1
earth	1
hear,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein;	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
come	1
forth	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
34:2	1
For	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
his	1
fury	1
upon	1
all	1
their	1
armies:	1
he	1
hath	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
he	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter.	1
	1
34:3	1
Their	1
slain	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out,	1
and	1
their	1
stink	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
carcases,	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
be	1
melted	1
with	1
their	1
blood.	1
	1
34:4	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
be	1
rolled	1
together	1
as	1
a	1
scroll:	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
host	1
shall	1
fall	1
down,	1
as	1
the	1
leaf	1
falleth	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
falling	1
fig	1
from	1
the	1
fig	1
tree.	1
	1
34:5	1
For	1
my	1
sword	1
shall	1
be	1
bathed	1
in	1
heaven:	1
behold,	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
upon	1
Idumea,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
my	1
curse,	1
to	1
judgment.	1
	1
34:6	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
blood,	1
it	1
is	1
made	1
fat	1
with	1
fatness,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
lambs	1
and	1
goats,	1
with	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
kidneys	1
of	1
rams:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
Bozrah,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Idumea.	1
	1
34:7	1
And	1
the	1
unicorns	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
bullocks	1
with	1
the	1
bulls;	1
and	1
their	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
soaked	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
their	1
dust	1
made	1
fat	1
with	1
fatness.	1
	1
34:8	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
vengeance,	1
and	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
recompences	1
for	1
the	1
controversy	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
34:9	1
And	1
the	1
streams	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
pitch,	1
and	1
the	1
dust	1
thereof	1
into	1
brimstone,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
thereof	1
shall	1
become	1
burning	1
pitch.	1
	1
34:10	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched	1
night	1
nor	1
day;	1
the	1
smoke	1
thereof	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
for	1
ever:	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
it	1
shall	1
lie	1
waste;	1
none	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
it	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
34:11	1
But	1
the	1
cormorant	1
and	1
the	1
bittern	1
shall	1
possess	1
it;	1
the	1
owl	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
raven	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
stretch	1
out	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
confusion,	1
and	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
emptiness.	1
	1
34:12	1
They	1
shall	1
call	1
the	1
nobles	1
thereof	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
but	1
none	1
shall	1
be	1
there,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
princes	1
shall	1
be	1
nothing.	1
	1
34:13	1
And	1
thorns	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
palaces,	1
nettles	1
and	1
brambles	1
in	1
the	1
fortresses	1
thereof:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
habitation	1
of	1
dragons,	1
and	1
a	1
court	1
for	1
owls.	1
	1
34:14	1
The	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
shall	1
also	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
island,	1
and	1
the	1
satyr	1
shall	1
cry	1
to	1
his	1
fellow;	1
the	1
screech	1
owl	1
also	1
shall	1
rest	1
there,	1
and	1
find	1
for	1
herself	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
rest.	1
	1
34:15	1
There	1
shall	1
the	1
great	1
owl	1
make	1
her	1
nest,	1
and	1
lay,	1
and	1
hatch,	1
and	1
gather	1
under	1
her	1
shadow:	1
there	1
shall	1
the	1
vultures	1
also	1
be	1
gathered,	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
her	1
mate.	1
	1
34:16	1
Seek	1
ye	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
read:	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
shall	1
fail,	1
none	1
shall	1
want	1
her	1
mate:	1
for	1
my	1
mouth	1
it	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
and	1
his	1
spirit	1
it	1
hath	1
gathered	1
them.	1
	1
34:17	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
cast	1
the	1
lot	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
hath	1
divided	1
it	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
line:	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
it	1
for	1
ever,	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
shall	1
they	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
35:1	1
The	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
solitary	1
place	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
for	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
desert	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
blossom	1
as	1
the	1
rose.	1
	1
35:2	1
It	1
shall	1
blossom	1
abundantly,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
even	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
singing:	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
it,	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Carmel	1
and	1
Sharon,	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
35:3	1
Strengthen	1
ye	1
the	1
weak	1
hands,	1
and	1
confirm	1
the	1
feeble	1
knees.	1
	1
35:4	1
Say	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
fearful	1
heart,	1
Be	1
strong,	1
fear	1
not:	1
behold,	1
your	1
God	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
vengeance,	1
even	1
God	1
with	1
a	1
recompence;	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
save	1
you.	1
	1
35:5	1
Then	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
shall	1
be	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
deaf	1
shall	1
be	1
unstopped.	1
	1
35:6	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
lame	1
man	1
leap	1
as	1
an	1
hart,	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
dumb	1
sing:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
shall	1
waters	1
break	1
out,	1
and	1
streams	1
in	1
the	1
desert.	1
	1
35:7	1
And	1
the	1
parched	1
ground	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
pool,	1
and	1
the	1
thirsty	1
land	1
springs	1
of	1
water:	1
in	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
dragons,	1
where	1
each	1
lay,	1
shall	1
be	1
grass	1
with	1
reeds	1
and	1
rushes.	1
	1
35:8	1
And	1
an	1
highway	1
shall	1
be	1
there,	1
and	1
a	1
way,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
holiness;	1
the	1
unclean	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
it;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
those:	1
the	1
wayfaring	1
men,	1
though	1
fools,	1
shall	1
not	1
err	1
therein.	1
	1
35:9	1
No	1
lion	1
shall	1
be	1
there,	1
nor	1
any	1
ravenous	1
beast	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
thereon,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
there;	1
but	1
the	1
redeemed	1
shall	1
walk	1
there:	1
35:10	1
And	1
the	1
ransomed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
Zion	1
with	1
songs	1
and	1
everlasting	1
joy	1
upon	1
their	1
heads:	1
they	1
shall	1
obtain	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness,	1
and	1
sorrow	1
and	1
sighing	1
shall	1
flee	1
away.	1
	1
36:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Hezekiah,	1
that	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
defenced	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
took	1
them.	1
	1
36:2	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
sent	1
Rabshakeh	1
from	1
Lachish	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
army.	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
conduit	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
highway	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's	1
field.	1
	1
36:3	1
Then	1
came	1
forth	1
unto	1
him	1
Eliakim,	1
Hilkiah's	1
son,	1
which	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Joah,	1
Asaph's	1
son,	1
the	1
recorder.	1
	1
36:4	1
And	1
Rabshakeh	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Say	1
ye	1
now	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
great	1
king,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
What	1
confidence	1
is	1
this	1
wherein	1
thou	1
trustest?	1
	1
36:5	1
I	1
say,	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
(but	1
they	1
are	1
but	1
vain	1
words)	1
I	1
have	1
counsel	1
and	1
strength	1
for	1
war:	1
now	1
on	1
whom	1
dost	1
thou	1
trust,	1
that	1
thou	1
rebellest	1
against	1
me?	1
	1
36:6	1
Lo,	1
thou	1
trustest	1
in	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
this	1
broken	1
reed,	1
on	1
Egypt;	1
whereon	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lean,	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
pierce	1
it:	1
so	1
is	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
36:7	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
We	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God:	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
he,	1
whose	1
high	1
places	1
and	1
whose	1
altars	1
Hezekiah	1
hath	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Judah	1
and	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
worship	1
before	1
this	1
altar?	1
36:8	1
Now	1
therefore	1
give	1
pledges,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
two	1
thousand	1
horses,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
able	1
on	1
thy	1
part	1
to	1
set	1
riders	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
36:9	1
How	1
then	1
wilt	1
thou	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
one	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
my	1
master's	1
servants,	1
and	1
put	1
thy	1
trust	1
on	1
Egypt	1
for	1
chariots	1
and	1
for	1
horsemen?	1
	1
36:10	1
And	1
am	1
I	1
now	1
come	1
up	1
without	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
this	1
land	1
to	1
destroy	1
it?	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
up	1
against	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
36:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Eliakim	1
and	1
Shebna	1
and	1
Joah	1
unto	1
Rabshakeh,	1
Speak,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
in	1
the	1
Syrian	1
language;	1
for	1
we	1
understand	1
it:	1
and	1
speak	1
not	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
language,	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
36:12	1
But	1
Rabshakeh	1
said,	1
Hath	1
my	1
master	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
thy	1
master	1
and	1
to	1
thee	1
to	1
speak	1
these	1
words?	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat	1
their	1
own	1
dung,	1
and	1
drink	1
their	1
own	1
piss	1
with	1
you?	1
	1
36:13	1
Then	1
Rabshakeh	1
stood,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
language,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
king,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
36:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
not	1
Hezekiah	1
deceive	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
you.	1
	1
36:15	1
Neither	1
let	1
Hezekiah	1
make	1
you	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
surely	1
deliver	1
us:	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
36:16	1
Hearken	1
not	1
to	1
Hezekiah:	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
Make	1
an	1
agreement	1
with	1
me	1
by	1
a	1
present,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
me:	1
and	1
eat	1
ye	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
vine,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
drink	1
ye	1
every	1
one	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
cistern;	1
36:17	1
Until	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
like	1
your	1
own	1
land,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
wine,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
vineyards.	1
	1
36:18	1
Beware	1
lest	1
Hezekiah	1
persuade	1
you,	1
saying,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
deliver	1
us.	1
	1
Hath	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
delivered	1
his	1
land	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria?	1
	1
36:19	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Hamath	1
and	1
Arphad?	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Sepharvaim?	1
and	1
have	1
they	1
delivered	1
Samaria	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand?	1
	1
36:20	1
Who	1
are	1
they	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
these	1
lands,	1
that	1
have	1
delivered	1
their	1
land	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
should	1
deliver	1
Jerusalem	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand?	1
	1
36:21	1
But	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
answered	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
word:	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
was,	1
saying,	1
Answer	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
36:22	1
Then	1
came	1
Eliakim,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Joah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Asaph,	1
the	1
recorder,	1
to	1
Hezekiah	1
with	1
their	1
clothes	1
rent,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rabshakeh.	1
	1
37:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
heard	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
covered	1
himself	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:2	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
Eliakim,	1
who	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
covered	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
unto	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz.	1
	1
37:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Hezekiah,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
trouble,	1
and	1
of	1
rebuke,	1
and	1
of	1
blasphemy:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
birth,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
strength	1
to	1
bring	1
forth.	1
	1
37:4	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rabshakeh,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
his	1
master	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
reproach	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
and	1
will	1
reprove	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
heard:	1
wherefore	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
remnant	1
that	1
is	1
left.	1
	1
37:5	1
So	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
came	1
to	1
Isaiah.	1
	1
37:6	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
your	1
master,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard,	1
wherewith	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
blasphemed	1
me.	1
	1
37:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
blast	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
a	1
rumour,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
37:8	1
So	1
Rabshakeh	1
returned,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
warring	1
against	1
Libnah:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
departed	1
from	1
Lachish.	1
	1
37:9	1
And	1
he	1
heard	1
say	1
concerning	1
Tirhakah	1
king	1
of	1
Ethiopia,	1
He	1
is	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
thee.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
saying,	1
37:10	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
speak	1
to	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
not	1
thy	1
God,	1
in	1
whom	1
thou	1
trustest,	1
deceive	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
37:11	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
all	1
lands	1
by	1
destroying	1
them	1
utterly;	1
and	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
delivered?	1
37:12	1
Have	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
delivered	1
them	1
which	1
my	1
fathers	1
have	1
destroyed,	1
as	1
Gozan,	1
and	1
Haran,	1
and	1
Rezeph,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Eden	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Telassar?	1
	1
37:13	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Hamath,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Arphad,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sepharvaim,	1
Hena,	1
and	1
Ivah?	1
	1
37:14	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
received	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
messengers,	1
and	1
read	1
it:	1
and	1
Hezekiah	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
spread	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:15	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
37:16	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
dwellest	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
God,	1
even	1
thou	1
alone,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth.	1
	1
37:17	1
Incline	1
thine	1
ear,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hear;	1
open	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
see:	1
and	1
hear	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Sennacherib,	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
reproach	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
37:18	1
Of	1
a	1
truth,	1
LORD,	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
laid	1
waste	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
their	1
countries,	1
37:19	1
And	1
have	1
cast	1
their	1
gods	1
into	1
the	1
fire:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
gods,	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
men's	1
hands,	1
wood	1
and	1
stone:	1
therefore	1
they	1
have	1
destroyed	1
them.	1
	1
37:20	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
save	1
us	1
from	1
his	1
hand,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
thou	1
only.	1
	1
37:21	1
Then	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
sent	1
unto	1
Hezekiah,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Whereas	1
thou	1
hast	1
prayed	1
to	1
me	1
against	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
37:22	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
him;	1
The	1
virgin,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
hath	1
despised	1
thee,	1
and	1
laughed	1
thee	1
to	1
scorn;	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
hath	1
shaken	1
her	1
head	1
at	1
thee.	1
	1
37:23	1
Whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
reproached	1
and	1
blasphemed?	1
and	1
against	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
exalted	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
on	1
high?	1
even	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
37:24	1
By	1
thy	1
servants	1
hast	1
thou	1
reproached	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
hast	1
said,	1
By	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
my	1
chariots	1
am	1
I	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
Lebanon;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
tall	1
cedars	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
choice	1
fir	1
trees	1
thereof:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
border,	1
and	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
his	1
Carmel.	1
	1
37:25	1
I	1
have	1
digged,	1
and	1
drunk	1
water;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
my	1
feet	1
have	1
I	1
dried	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
the	1
besieged	1
places.	1
	1
37:26	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
heard	1
long	1
ago,	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
it;	1
and	1
of	1
ancient	1
times,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
formed	1
it?	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
to	1
lay	1
waste	1
defenced	1
cities	1
into	1
ruinous	1
heaps.	1
	1
37:27	1
Therefore	1
their	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
of	1
small	1
power,	1
they	1
were	1
dismayed	1
and	1
confounded:	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
green	1
herb,	1
as	1
the	1
grass	1
on	1
the	1
housetops,	1
and	1
as	1
corn	1
blasted	1
before	1
it	1
be	1
grown	1
up.	1
	1
37:28	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
abode,	1
and	1
thy	1
going	1
out,	1
and	1
thy	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
thy	1
rage	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
37:29	1
Because	1
thy	1
rage	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
thy	1
tumult,	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
mine	1
ears,	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
hook	1
in	1
thy	1
nose,	1
and	1
my	1
bridle	1
in	1
thy	1
lips,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
thee	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
which	1
thou	1
camest.	1
	1
37:30	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
this	1
year	1
such	1
as	1
groweth	1
of	1
itself;	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
that	1
which	1
springeth	1
of	1
the	1
same:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
sow	1
ye,	1
and	1
reap,	1
and	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof.	1
	1
37:31	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
that	1
is	1
escaped	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
again	1
take	1
root	1
downward,	1
and	1
bear	1
fruit	1
upward:	1
37:32	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
a	1
remnant,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
mount	1
Zion:	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
do	1
this.	1
	1
37:33	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
city,	1
nor	1
shoot	1
an	1
arrow	1
there,	1
nor	1
come	1
before	1
it	1
with	1
shields,	1
nor	1
cast	1
a	1
bank	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
37:34	1
By	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
came,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
he	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
city,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:35	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
defend	1
this	1
city	1
to	1
save	1
it	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
servant	1
David's	1
sake.	1
	1
37:36	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
smote	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Assyrians	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
and	1
five	1
thousand:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
dead	1
corpses.	1
	1
37:37	1
So	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
returned,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Nineveh.	1
	1
37:38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
worshipping	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Nisroch	1
his	1
god,	1
that	1
Adrammelech	1
and	1
Sharezer	1
his	1
sons	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
they	1
escaped	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Armenia:	1
and	1
Esarhaddon	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
38:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
was	1
Hezekiah	1
sick	1
unto	1
death.	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Set	1
thine	1
house	1
in	1
order:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die,	1
and	1
not	1
live.	1
	1
38:2	1
Then	1
Hezekiah	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
38:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Remember	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
wept	1
sore.	1
	1
38:4	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Isaiah,	1
saying,	1
38:5	1
Go,	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
David	1
thy	1
father,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
prayer,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
tears:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
add	1
unto	1
thy	1
days	1
fifteen	1
years.	1
	1
38:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
defend	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
38:7	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken;	1
38:8	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
degrees,	1
which	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
dial	1
of	1
Ahaz,	1
ten	1
degrees	1
backward.	1
So	1
the	1
sun	1
returned	1
ten	1
degrees,	1
by	1
which	1
degrees	1
it	1
was	1
gone	1
down.	1
	1
38:9	1
The	1
writing	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sick,	1
and	1
was	1
recovered	1
of	1
his	1
sickness:	1
38:10	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
cutting	1
off	1
of	1
my	1
days,	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
grave:	1
I	1
am	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
my	1
years.	1
	1
38:11	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
I	1
shall	1
behold	1
man	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
38:12	1
Mine	1
age	1
is	1
departed,	1
and	1
is	1
removed	1
from	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd's	1
tent:	1
I	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
like	1
a	1
weaver	1
my	1
life:	1
he	1
will	1
cut	1
me	1
off	1
with	1
pining	1
sickness:	1
from	1
day	1
even	1
to	1
night	1
wilt	1
thou	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
38:13	1
I	1
reckoned	1
till	1
morning,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
so	1
will	1
he	1
break	1
all	1
my	1
bones:	1
from	1
day	1
even	1
to	1
night	1
wilt	1
thou	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
38:14	1
Like	1
a	1
crane	1
or	1
a	1
swallow,	1
so	1
did	1
I	1
chatter:	1
I	1
did	1
mourn	1
as	1
a	1
dove:	1
mine	1
eyes	1
fail	1
with	1
looking	1
upward:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
am	1
oppressed;	1
undertake	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
38:15	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
say?	1
he	1
hath	1
both	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
himself	1
hath	1
done	1
it:	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
softly	1
all	1
my	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
38:16	1
O	1
LORD,	1
by	1
these	1
things	1
men	1
live,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
spirit:	1
so	1
wilt	1
thou	1
recover	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
38:17	1
Behold,	1
for	1
peace	1
I	1
had	1
great	1
bitterness:	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
in	1
love	1
to	1
my	1
soul	1
delivered	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
corruption:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
cast	1
all	1
my	1
sins	1
behind	1
thy	1
back.	1
	1
38:18	1
For	1
the	1
grave	1
cannot	1
praise	1
thee,	1
death	1
can	1
not	1
celebrate	1
thee:	1
they	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
pit	1
cannot	1
hope	1
for	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
38:19	1
The	1
living,	1
the	1
living,	1
he	1
shall	1
praise	1
thee,	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
day:	1
the	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
38:20	1
The	1
LORD	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
save	1
me:	1
therefore	1
we	1
will	1
sing	1
my	1
songs	1
to	1
the	1
stringed	1
instruments	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
38:21	1
For	1
Isaiah	1
had	1
said,	1
Let	1
them	1
take	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
figs,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
plaister	1
upon	1
the	1
boil,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
recover.	1
	1
38:22	1
Hezekiah	1
also	1
had	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
sign	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
39:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Merodachbaladan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Baladan,	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
sent	1
letters	1
and	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
Hezekiah:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sick,	1
and	1
was	1
recovered.	1
	1
39:2	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
shewed	1
them	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
precious	1
things,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
spices,	1
and	1
the	1
precious	1
ointment,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
treasures:	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
nor	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
dominion,	1
that	1
Hezekiah	1
shewed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
39:3	1
Then	1
came	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
king	1
Hezekiah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
said	1
these	1
men?	1
and	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
they	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
said,	1
They	1
are	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
from	1
Babylon.	1
	1
39:4	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
seen	1
in	1
thine	1
house?	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
answered,	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
house	1
have	1
they	1
seen:	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
among	1
my	1
treasures	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
shewed	1
them.	1
	1
39:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Isaiah	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
39:6	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
thy	1
fathers	1
have	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
until	1
this	1
day,	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
Babylon:	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
left,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
39:7	1
And	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
that	1
shall	1
issue	1
from	1
thee,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beget,	1
shall	1
they	1
take	1
away;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
eunuchs	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
39:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Hezekiah	1
to	1
Isaiah,	1
Good	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken.	1
He	1
said	1
moreover,	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
peace	1
and	1
truth	1
in	1
my	1
days.	1
	1
40:1	1
Comfort	1
ye,	1
comfort	1
ye	1
my	1
people,	1
saith	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
40:2	1
Speak	1
ye	1
comfortably	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
her,	1
that	1
her	1
warfare	1
is	1
accomplished,	1
that	1
her	1
iniquity	1
is	1
pardoned:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand	1
double	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
sins.	1
	1
40:3	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
crieth	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
make	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
a	1
highway	1
for	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
40:4	1
Every	1
valley	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted,	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
hill	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
low:	1
and	1
the	1
crooked	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
straight,	1
and	1
the	1
rough	1
places	1
plain:	1
40:5	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed,	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
see	1
it	1
together:	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
40:6	1
The	1
voice	1
said,	1
Cry.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
cry?	1
All	1
flesh	1
is	1
grass,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
goodliness	1
thereof	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
40:7	1
The	1
grass	1
withereth,	1
the	1
flower	1
fadeth:	1
because	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
bloweth	1
upon	1
it:	1
surely	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
grass.	1
	1
40:8	1
The	1
grass	1
withereth,	1
the	1
flower	1
fadeth:	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
stand	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
40:9	1
O	1
Zion,	1
that	1
bringest	1
good	1
tidings,	1
get	1
thee	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
high	1
mountain;	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
bringest	1
good	1
tidings,	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice	1
with	1
strength;	1
lift	1
it	1
up,	1
be	1
not	1
afraid;	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Behold	1
your	1
God!	1
	1
40:10	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
strong	1
hand,	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
shall	1
rule	1
for	1
him:	1
behold,	1
his	1
reward	1
is	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
work	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
40:11	1
He	1
shall	1
feed	1
his	1
flock	1
like	1
a	1
shepherd:	1
he	1
shall	1
gather	1
the	1
lambs	1
with	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and	1
shall	1
gently	1
lead	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
young.	1
	1
40:12	1
Who	1
hath	1
measured	1
the	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
meted	1
out	1
heaven	1
with	1
the	1
span,	1
and	1
comprehended	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
a	1
measure,	1
and	1
weighed	1
the	1
mountains	1
in	1
scales,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
in	1
a	1
balance?	1
	1
40:13	1
Who	1
hath	1
directed	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
or	1
being	1
his	1
counsellor	1
hath	1
taught	1
him?	1
	1
40:14	1
With	1
whom	1
took	1
he	1
counsel,	1
and	1
who	1
instructed	1
him,	1
and	1
taught	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
taught	1
him	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
shewed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
understanding?	1
	1
40:15	1
Behold,	1
the	1
nations	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
a	1
bucket,	1
and	1
are	1
counted	1
as	1
the	1
small	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
balance:	1
behold,	1
he	1
taketh	1
up	1
the	1
isles	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
thing.	1
	1
40:16	1
And	1
Lebanon	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
burn,	1
nor	1
the	1
beasts	1
thereof	1
sufficient	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
40:17	1
All	1
nations	1
before	1
him	1
are	1
as	1
nothing;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
counted	1
to	1
him	1
less	1
than	1
nothing,	1
and	1
vanity.	1
	1
40:18	1
To	1
whom	1
then	1
will	1
ye	1
liken	1
God?	1
or	1
what	1
likeness	1
will	1
ye	1
compare	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
40:19	1
The	1
workman	1
melteth	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
the	1
goldsmith	1
spreadeth	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
casteth	1
silver	1
chains.	1
	1
40:20	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
impoverished	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
oblation	1
chooseth	1
a	1
tree	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
rot;	1
he	1
seeketh	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
cunning	1
workman	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
40:21	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
known?	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
heard?	1
hath	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
told	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
beginning?	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
understood	1
from	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
40:22	1
It	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
are	1
as	1
grasshoppers;	1
that	1
stretcheth	1
out	1
the	1
heavens	1
as	1
a	1
curtain,	1
and	1
spreadeth	1
them	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
tent	1
to	1
dwell	1
in:	1
40:23	1
That	1
bringeth	1
the	1
princes	1
to	1
nothing;	1
he	1
maketh	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
vanity.	1
	1
40:24	1
Yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
planted;	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
sown:	1
yea,	1
their	1
stock	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
root	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
also	1
blow	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
wither,	1
and	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
away	1
as	1
stubble.	1
	1
40:25	1
To	1
whom	1
then	1
will	1
ye	1
liken	1
me,	1
or	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
equal?	1
saith	1
the	1
Holy	1
One.	1
	1
40:26	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
behold	1
who	1
hath	1
created	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
bringeth	1
out	1
their	1
host	1
by	1
number:	1
he	1
calleth	1
them	1
all	1
by	1
names	1
by	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
might,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
strong	1
in	1
power;	1
not	1
one	1
faileth.	1
	1
40:27	1
Why	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
speakest,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
My	1
way	1
is	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
passed	1
over	1
from	1
my	1
God?	1
	1
40:28	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
known?	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
heard,	1
that	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God,	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Creator	1
of	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
fainteth	1
not,	1
neither	1
is	1
weary?	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
searching	1
of	1
his	1
understanding.	1
	1
40:29	1
He	1
giveth	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
faint;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
might	1
he	1
increaseth	1
strength.	1
	1
40:30	1
Even	1
the	1
youths	1
shall	1
faint	1
and	1
be	1
weary,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
utterly	1
fall:	1
40:31	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
wait	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
renew	1
their	1
strength;	1
they	1
shall	1
mount	1
up	1
with	1
wings	1
as	1
eagles;	1
they	1
shall	1
run,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
weary;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk,	1
and	1
not	1
faint.	1
	1
41:1	1
Keep	1
silence	1
before	1
me,	1
O	1
islands;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
renew	1
their	1
strength:	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
near;	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
speak:	1
let	1
us	1
come	1
near	1
together	1
to	1
judgment.	1
	1
41:2	1
Who	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
righteous	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
foot,	1
gave	1
the	1
nations	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
rule	1
over	1
kings?	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
to	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
as	1
driven	1
stubble	1
to	1
his	1
bow.	1
	1
41:3	1
He	1
pursued	1
them,	1
and	1
passed	1
safely;	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
with	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
41:4	1
Who	1
hath	1
wrought	1
and	1
done	1
it,	1
calling	1
the	1
generations	1
from	1
the	1
beginning?	1
I	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
last;	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
41:5	1
The	1
isles	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
feared;	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
were	1
afraid,	1
drew	1
near,	1
and	1
came.	1
	1
41:6	1
They	1
helped	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
courage.	1
	1
41:7	1
So	1
the	1
carpenter	1
encouraged	1
the	1
goldsmith,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
smootheth	1
with	1
the	1
hammer	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
the	1
anvil,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
sodering:	1
and	1
he	1
fastened	1
it	1
with	1
nails,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
41:8	1
But	1
thou,	1
Israel,	1
art	1
my	1
servant,	1
Jacob	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen,	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham	1
my	1
friend.	1
	1
41:9	1
Thou	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
called	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
men	1
thereof,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant;	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
and	1
not	1
cast	1
thee	1
away.	1
	1
41:10	1
Fear	1
thou	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee:	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
God:	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
thee;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
uphold	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
righteousness.	1
	1
41:11	1
Behold,	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
incensed	1
against	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
nothing;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
strive	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
41:12	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
seek	1
them,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
find	1
them,	1
even	1
them	1
that	1
contended	1
with	1
thee:	1
they	1
that	1
war	1
against	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
nothing,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought.	1
	1
41:13	1
For	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
hold	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
saying	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee.	1
	1
41:14	1
Fear	1
not,	1
thou	1
worm	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thy	1
redeemer,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
41:15	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
new	1
sharp	1
threshing	1
instrument	1
having	1
teeth:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
thresh	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
beat	1
them	1
small,	1
and	1
shalt	1
make	1
the	1
hills	1
as	1
chaff.	1
	1
41:16	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
fan	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
shall	1
scatter	1
them:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shalt	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
41:17	1
When	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy	1
seek	1
water,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
faileth	1
for	1
thirst,	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
hear	1
them,	1
I	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
them.	1
	1
41:18	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
rivers	1
in	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
fountains	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
valleys:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
wilderness	1
a	1
pool	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
springs	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
41:19	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
the	1
cedar,	1
the	1
shittah	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
myrtle,	1
and	1
the	1
oil	1
tree;	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
the	1
fir	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
pine,	1
and	1
the	1
box	1
tree	1
together:	1
41:20	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
see,	1
and	1
know,	1
and	1
consider,	1
and	1
understand	1
together,	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
this,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
created	1
it.	1
	1
41:21	1
Produce	1
your	1
cause,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
bring	1
forth	1
your	1
strong	1
reasons,	1
saith	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
41:22	1
Let	1
them	1
bring	1
them	1
forth,	1
and	1
shew	1
us	1
what	1
shall	1
happen:	1
let	1
them	1
shew	1
the	1
former	1
things,	1
what	1
they	1
be,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
consider	1
them,	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
them;	1
or	1
declare	1
us	1
things	1
for	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
41:23	1
Shew	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
hereafter,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
gods:	1
yea,	1
do	1
good,	1
or	1
do	1
evil,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
and	1
behold	1
it	1
together.	1
	1
41:24	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
nothing,	1
and	1
your	1
work	1
of	1
nought:	1
an	1
abomination	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
chooseth	1
you.	1
	1
41:25	1
I	1
have	1
raised	1
up	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come:	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
he	1
call	1
upon	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
princes	1
as	1
upon	1
morter,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
potter	1
treadeth	1
clay.	1
	1
41:26	1
Who	1
hath	1
declared	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know?	1
and	1
beforetime,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
say,	1
He	1
is	1
righteous?	1
yea,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
sheweth,	1
yea,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
declareth,	1
yea,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
heareth	1
your	1
words.	1
	1
41:27	1
The	1
first	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
Zion,	1
Behold,	1
behold	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
one	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings.	1
	1
41:28	1
For	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man;	1
even	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
counsellor,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
asked	1
of	1
them,	1
could	1
answer	1
a	1
word.	1
	1
41:29	1
Behold,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
vanity;	1
their	1
works	1
are	1
nothing:	1
their	1
molten	1
images	1
are	1
wind	1
and	1
confusion.	1
	1
42:1	1
Behold	1
my	1
servant,	1
whom	1
I	1
uphold;	1
mine	1
elect,	1
in	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
delighteth;	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
him:	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
judgment	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
42:2	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
cry,	1
nor	1
lift	1
up,	1
nor	1
cause	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
42:3	1
A	1
bruised	1
reed	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
break,	1
and	1
the	1
smoking	1
flax	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
quench:	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
judgment	1
unto	1
truth.	1
	1
42:4	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
fail	1
nor	1
be	1
discouraged,	1
till	1
he	1
have	1
set	1
judgment	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
isles	1
shall	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
law.	1
	1
42:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
God	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
that	1
created	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
stretched	1
them	1
out;	1
he	1
that	1
spread	1
forth	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
it;	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
breath	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
spirit	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
walk	1
therein:	1
42:6	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
called	1
thee	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
will	1
hold	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
42:7	1
To	1
open	1
the	1
blind	1
eyes,	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
prisoners	1
from	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
house.	1
	1
42:8	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
my	1
glory	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
give	1
to	1
another,	1
neither	1
my	1
praise	1
to	1
graven	1
images.	1
	1
42:9	1
Behold,	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
new	1
things	1
do	1
I	1
declare:	1
before	1
they	1
spring	1
forth	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
42:10	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
new	1
song,	1
and	1
his	1
praise	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
ye	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein;	1
the	1
isles,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof.	1
	1
42:11	1
Let	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
the	1
villages	1
that	1
Kedar	1
doth	1
inhabit:	1
let	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
sing,	1
let	1
them	1
shout	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
42:12	1
Let	1
them	1
give	1
glory	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
declare	1
his	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
islands.	1
	1
42:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
man,	1
he	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
jealousy	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war:	1
he	1
shall	1
cry,	1
yea,	1
roar;	1
he	1
shall	1
prevail	1
against	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
42:14	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
time	1
holden	1
my	1
peace;	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
still,	1
and	1
refrained	1
myself:	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
cry	1
like	1
a	1
travailing	1
woman;	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
and	1
devour	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
42:15	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
waste	1
mountains	1
and	1
hills,	1
and	1
dry	1
up	1
all	1
their	1
herbs;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
rivers	1
islands,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dry	1
up	1
the	1
pools.	1
	1
42:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
blind	1
by	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
not;	1
I	1
will	1
lead	1
them	1
in	1
paths	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
darkness	1
light	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
crooked	1
things	1
straight.	1
These	1
things	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
not	1
forsake	1
them.	1
	1
42:17	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
back,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
greatly	1
ashamed,	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
graven	1
images,	1
that	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
molten	1
images,	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
gods.	1
	1
42:18	1
Hear,	1
ye	1
deaf;	1
and	1
look,	1
ye	1
blind,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
see.	1
	1
42:19	1
Who	1
is	1
blind,	1
but	1
my	1
servant?	1
or	1
deaf,	1
as	1
my	1
messenger	1
that	1
I	1
sent?	1
	1
who	1
is	1
blind	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
perfect,	1
and	1
blind	1
as	1
the	1
LORD's	1
servant?	1
	1
42:20	1
Seeing	1
many	1
things,	1
but	1
thou	1
observest	1
not;	1
opening	1
the	1
ears,	1
but	1
he	1
heareth	1
not.	1
	1
42:21	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
well	1
pleased	1
for	1
his	1
righteousness'	1
sake;	1
he	1
will	1
magnify	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
honourable.	1
	1
42:22	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
robbed	1
and	1
spoiled;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
snared	1
in	1
holes,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
in	1
prison	1
houses:	1
they	1
are	1
for	1
a	1
prey,	1
and	1
none	1
delivereth;	1
for	1
a	1
spoil,	1
and	1
none	1
saith,	1
Restore.	1
	1
42:23	1
Who	1
among	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
this?	1
who	1
will	1
hearken	1
and	1
hear	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
come?	1
	1
42:24	1
Who	1
gave	1
Jacob	1
for	1
a	1
spoil,	1
and	1
Israel	1
to	1
the	1
robbers?	1
did	1
not	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
against	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
sinned?	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
neither	1
were	1
they	1
obedient	1
unto	1
his	1
law.	1
	1
42:25	1
Therefore	1
he	1
hath	1
poured	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
battle:	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
fire	1
round	1
about,	1
yet	1
he	1
knew	1
not;	1
and	1
it	1
burned	1
him,	1
yet	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
heart.	1
	1
43:1	1
But	1
now	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
created	1
thee,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
formed	1
thee,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
thee,	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
thee	1
by	1
thy	1
name;	1
thou	1
art	1
mine.	1
	1
43:2	1
When	1
thou	1
passest	1
through	1
the	1
waters,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
rivers,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
overflow	1
thee:	1
when	1
thou	1
walkest	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
burned;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
flame	1
kindle	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
43:3	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thy	1
Saviour:	1
I	1
gave	1
Egypt	1
for	1
thy	1
ransom,	1
Ethiopia	1
and	1
Seba	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
43:4	1
Since	1
thou	1
wast	1
precious	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
honourable,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
men	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
people	1
for	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
43:5	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee:	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thy	1
seed	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
gather	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
west;	1
43:6	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
north,	1
Give	1
up;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
south,	1
Keep	1
not	1
back:	1
bring	1
my	1
sons	1
from	1
far,	1
and	1
my	1
daughters	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
43:7	1
Even	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
him	1
for	1
my	1
glory,	1
I	1
have	1
formed	1
him;	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
him.	1
	1
43:8	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
blind	1
people	1
that	1
have	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
deaf	1
that	1
have	1
ears.	1
	1
43:9	1
Let	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
be	1
assembled:	1
who	1
among	1
them	1
can	1
declare	1
this,	1
and	1
shew	1
us	1
former	1
things?	1
let	1
them	1
bring	1
forth	1
their	1
witnesses,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
justified:	1
or	1
let	1
them	1
hear,	1
and	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
43:10	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
witnesses,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
and	1
believe	1
me,	1
and	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he:	1
before	1
me	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
God	1
formed,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
43:11	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
am	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
beside	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
saviour.	1
	1
43:12	1
I	1
have	1
declared,	1
and	1
have	1
saved,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
shewed,	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
strange	1
god	1
among	1
you:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
witnesses,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
God.	1
	1
43:13	1
Yea,	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
I	1
am	1
he;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
can	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand:	1
I	1
will	1
work,	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
let	1
it?	1
	1
43:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
your	1
redeemer,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
For	1
your	1
sake	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
down	1
all	1
their	1
nobles,	1
and	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
whose	1
cry	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
ships.	1
	1
43:15	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
your	1
Holy	1
One,	1
the	1
creator	1
of	1
Israel,	1
your	1
King.	1
	1
43:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
maketh	1
a	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
a	1
path	1
in	1
the	1
mighty	1
waters;	1
43:17	1
Which	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
the	1
chariot	1
and	1
horse,	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
power;	1
they	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
together,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
rise:	1
they	1
are	1
extinct,	1
they	1
are	1
quenched	1
as	1
tow.	1
	1
43:18	1
Remember	1
ye	1
not	1
the	1
former	1
things,	1
neither	1
consider	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
43:19	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
a	1
new	1
thing;	1
now	1
it	1
shall	1
spring	1
forth;	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
it?	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
make	1
a	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
rivers	1
in	1
the	1
desert.	1
	1
43:20	1
The	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
honour	1
me,	1
the	1
dragons	1
and	1
the	1
owls:	1
because	1
I	1
give	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
rivers	1
in	1
the	1
desert,	1
to	1
give	1
drink	1
to	1
my	1
people,	1
my	1
chosen.	1
	1
43:21	1
This	1
people	1
have	1
I	1
formed	1
for	1
myself;	1
they	1
shall	1
shew	1
forth	1
my	1
praise.	1
	1
43:22	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
called	1
upon	1
me,	1
O	1
Jacob;	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
weary	1
of	1
me,	1
O	1
Israel.	1
	1
43:23	1
Thou	1
hast	1
not	1
brought	1
me	1
the	1
small	1
cattle	1
of	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offerings;	1
neither	1
hast	1
thou	1
honoured	1
me	1
with	1
thy	1
sacrifices.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
caused	1
thee	1
to	1
serve	1
with	1
an	1
offering,	1
nor	1
wearied	1
thee	1
with	1
incense.	1
	1
43:24	1
Thou	1
hast	1
bought	1
me	1
no	1
sweet	1
cane	1
with	1
money,	1
neither	1
hast	1
thou	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
thy	1
sacrifices:	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
to	1
serve	1
with	1
thy	1
sins,	1
thou	1
hast	1
wearied	1
me	1
with	1
thine	1
iniquities.	1
	1
43:25	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
blotteth	1
out	1
thy	1
transgressions	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
remember	1
thy	1
sins.	1
	1
43:26	1
Put	1
me	1
in	1
remembrance:	1
let	1
us	1
plead	1
together:	1
declare	1
thou,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
43:27	1
Thy	1
first	1
father	1
hath	1
sinned,	1
and	1
thy	1
teachers	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
43:28	1
Therefore	1
I	1
have	1
profaned	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
Jacob	1
to	1
the	1
curse,	1
and	1
Israel	1
to	1
reproaches.	1
	1
44:1	1
Yet	1
now	1
hear,	1
O	1
Jacob	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen:	1
44:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
made	1
thee,	1
and	1
formed	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
womb,	1
which	1
will	1
help	1
thee;	1
Fear	1
not,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
thou,	1
Jesurun,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen.	1
	1
44:3	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
water	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
floods	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
ground:	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
thy	1
seed,	1
and	1
my	1
blessing	1
upon	1
thine	1
offspring:	1
44:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
spring	1
up	1
as	1
among	1
the	1
grass,	1
as	1
willows	1
by	1
the	1
water	1
courses.	1
	1
44:5	1
One	1
shall	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD's;	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
call	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
subscribe	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
surname	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
44:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
his	1
redeemer	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
last;	1
and	1
beside	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God.	1
	1
44:7	1
And	1
who,	1
as	1
I,	1
shall	1
call,	1
and	1
shall	1
declare	1
it,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
for	1
me,	1
since	1
I	1
appointed	1
the	1
ancient	1
people?	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
coming,	1
and	1
shall	1
come,	1
let	1
them	1
shew	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
44:8	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
afraid:	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
from	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
have	1
declared	1
it?	1
ye	1
are	1
even	1
my	1
witnesses.	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
God	1
beside	1
me?	1
yea,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God;	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
any.	1
	1
44:9	1
They	1
that	1
make	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
vanity;	1
and	1
their	1
delectable	1
things	1
shall	1
not	1
profit;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
their	1
own	1
witnesses;	1
they	1
see	1
not,	1
nor	1
know;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
44:10	1
Who	1
hath	1
formed	1
a	1
god,	1
or	1
molten	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
that	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
nothing?	1
	1
44:11	1
Behold,	1
all	1
his	1
fellows	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
and	1
the	1
workmen,	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
men:	1
let	1
them	1
all	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
let	1
them	1
stand	1
up;	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
fear,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
together.	1
	1
44:12	1
The	1
smith	1
with	1
the	1
tongs	1
both	1
worketh	1
in	1
the	1
coals,	1
and	1
fashioneth	1
it	1
with	1
hammers,	1
and	1
worketh	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
arms:	1
yea,	1
he	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
his	1
strength	1
faileth:	1
he	1
drinketh	1
no	1
water,	1
and	1
is	1
faint.	1
	1
44:13	1
The	1
carpenter	1
stretcheth	1
out	1
his	1
rule;	1
he	1
marketh	1
it	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
line;	1
he	1
fitteth	1
it	1
with	1
planes,	1
and	1
he	1
marketh	1
it	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
compass,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
after	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
man;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
44:14	1
He	1
heweth	1
him	1
down	1
cedars,	1
and	1
taketh	1
the	1
cypress	1
and	1
the	1
oak,	1
which	1
he	1
strengtheneth	1
for	1
himself	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
forest:	1
he	1
planteth	1
an	1
ash,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
doth	1
nourish	1
it.	1
	1
44:15	1
Then	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
burn:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
thereof,	1
and	1
warm	1
himself;	1
yea,	1
he	1
kindleth	1
it,	1
and	1
baketh	1
bread;	1
yea,	1
he	1
maketh	1
a	1
god,	1
and	1
worshippeth	1
it;	1
he	1
maketh	1
it	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
falleth	1
down	1
thereto.	1
	1
44:16	1
He	1
burneth	1
part	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
with	1
part	1
thereof	1
he	1
eateth	1
flesh;	1
he	1
roasteth	1
roast,	1
and	1
is	1
satisfied:	1
yea,	1
he	1
warmeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Aha,	1
I	1
am	1
warm,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
fire:	1
44:17	1
And	1
the	1
residue	1
thereof	1
he	1
maketh	1
a	1
god,	1
even	1
his	1
graven	1
image:	1
he	1
falleth	1
down	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
worshippeth	1
it,	1
and	1
prayeth	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Deliver	1
me;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
god.	1
	1
44:18	1
They	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
nor	1
understood:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
shut	1
their	1
eyes,	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
see;	1
and	1
their	1
hearts,	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
understand.	1
	1
44:19	1
And	1
none	1
considereth	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
knowledge	1
nor	1
understanding	1
to	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
burned	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
yea,	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
baked	1
bread	1
upon	1
the	1
coals	1
thereof;	1
I	1
have	1
roasted	1
flesh,	1
and	1
eaten	1
it:	1
and	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
residue	1
thereof	1
an	1
abomination?	1
shall	1
I	1
fall	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
a	1
tree?	1
	1
44:20	1
He	1
feedeth	1
on	1
ashes:	1
a	1
deceived	1
heart	1
hath	1
turned	1
him	1
aside,	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
deliver	1
his	1
soul,	1
nor	1
say,	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
a	1
lie	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand?	1
	1
44:21	1
Remember	1
these,	1
O	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Israel;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant:	1
I	1
have	1
formed	1
thee;	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant:	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
44:22	1
I	1
have	1
blotted	1
out,	1
as	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud,	1
thy	1
transgressions,	1
and,	1
as	1
a	1
cloud,	1
thy	1
sins:	1
return	1
unto	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
thee.	1
	1
44:23	1
Sing,	1
O	1
ye	1
heavens;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
it:	1
shout,	1
ye	1
lower	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
singing,	1
ye	1
mountains,	1
O	1
forest,	1
and	1
every	1
tree	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
glorified	1
himself	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
44:24	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thy	1
redeemer,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
formed	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
womb,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
maketh	1
all	1
things;	1
that	1
stretcheth	1
forth	1
the	1
heavens	1
alone;	1
that	1
spreadeth	1
abroad	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
myself;	1
44:25	1
That	1
frustrateth	1
the	1
tokens	1
of	1
the	1
liars,	1
and	1
maketh	1
diviners	1
mad;	1
that	1
turneth	1
wise	1
men	1
backward,	1
and	1
maketh	1
their	1
knowledge	1
foolish;	1
44:26	1
That	1
confirmeth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
performeth	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
his	1
messengers;	1
that	1
saith	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
inhabited;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
be	1
built,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
decayed	1
places	1
thereof:	1
44:27	1
That	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
deep,	1
Be	1
dry,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dry	1
up	1
thy	1
rivers:	1
44:28	1
That	1
saith	1
of	1
Cyrus,	1
He	1
is	1
my	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
shall	1
perform	1
all	1
my	1
pleasure:	1
even	1
saying	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
built;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
temple,	1
Thy	1
foundation	1
shall	1
be	1
laid.	1
	1
45:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
his	1
anointed,	1
to	1
Cyrus,	1
whose	1
right	1
hand	1
I	1
have	1
holden,	1
to	1
subdue	1
nations	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
loose	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
kings,	1
to	1
open	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
two	1
leaved	1
gates;	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut;	1
45:2	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
crooked	1
places	1
straight:	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
cut	1
in	1
sunder	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
iron:	1
45:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
hidden	1
riches	1
of	1
secret	1
places,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
that	1
I,	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
call	1
thee	1
by	1
thy	1
name,	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
45:4	1
For	1
Jacob	1
my	1
servant's	1
sake,	1
and	1
Israel	1
mine	1
elect,	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
called	1
thee	1
by	1
thy	1
name:	1
I	1
have	1
surnamed	1
thee,	1
though	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
known	1
me.	1
	1
45:5	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
beside	1
me:	1
I	1
girded	1
thee,	1
though	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
known	1
me:	1
45:6	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else.	1
	1
45:7	1
I	1
form	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
create	1
darkness:	1
I	1
make	1
peace,	1
and	1
create	1
evil:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
45:8	1
Drop	1
down,	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
skies	1
pour	1
down	1
righteousness:	1
let	1
the	1
earth	1
open,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
bring	1
forth	1
salvation,	1
and	1
let	1
righteousness	1
spring	1
up	1
together;	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
created	1
it.	1
	1
45:9	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
striveth	1
with	1
his	1
Maker!	1
Let	1
the	1
potsherd	1
strive	1
with	1
the	1
potsherds	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Shall	1
the	1
clay	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
fashioneth	1
it,	1
What	1
makest	1
thou?	1
or	1
thy	1
work,	1
He	1
hath	1
no	1
hands?	1
	1
45:10	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
What	1
begettest	1
thou?	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
brought	1
forth?	1
	1
45:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
his	1
Maker,	1
Ask	1
me	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
concerning	1
my	1
sons,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
command	1
ye	1
me.	1
	1
45:12	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
created	1
man	1
upon	1
it:	1
I,	1
even	1
my	1
hands,	1
have	1
stretched	1
out	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
host	1
have	1
I	1
commanded.	1
	1
45:13	1
I	1
have	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
direct	1
all	1
his	1
ways:	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
my	1
city,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
go	1
my	1
captives,	1
not	1
for	1
price	1
nor	1
reward,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
45:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
labour	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
merchandise	1
of	1
Ethiopia	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sabeans,	1
men	1
of	1
stature,	1
shall	1
come	1
over	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
thine:	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
after	1
thee;	1
in	1
chains	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
over,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
unto	1
thee,	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
supplication	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Surely	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God.	1
	1
45:15	1
Verily	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
God	1
that	1
hidest	1
thyself,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
Saviour.	1
	1
45:16	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
also	1
confounded,	1
all	1
of	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
confusion	1
together	1
that	1
are	1
makers	1
of	1
idols.	1
	1
45:17	1
But	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
an	1
everlasting	1
salvation:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
nor	1
confounded	1
world	1
without	1
end.	1
	1
45:18	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
created	1
the	1
heavens;	1
God	1
himself	1
that	1
formed	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
made	1
it;	1
he	1
hath	1
established	1
it,	1
he	1
created	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
vain,	1
he	1
formed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
inhabited:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else.	1
	1
45:19	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
in	1
secret,	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
I	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Seek	1
ye	1
me	1
in	1
vain:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
speak	1
righteousness,	1
I	1
declare	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
right.	1
	1
45:20	1
Assemble	1
yourselves	1
and	1
come;	1
draw	1
near	1
together,	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
escaped	1
of	1
the	1
nations:	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
knowledge	1
that	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
their	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
a	1
god	1
that	1
cannot	1
save.	1
	1
45:21	1
Tell	1
ye,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
near;	1
yea,	1
let	1
them	1
take	1
counsel	1
together:	1
who	1
hath	1
declared	1
this	1
from	1
ancient	1
time?	1
who	1
hath	1
told	1
it	1
from	1
that	1
time?	1
	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
the	1
LORD?	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
else	1
beside	1
me;	1
a	1
just	1
God	1
and	1
a	1
Saviour;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
me.	1
	1
45:22	1
Look	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
saved,	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else.	1
	1
45:23	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
by	1
myself,	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
return,	1
That	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
knee	1
shall	1
bow,	1
every	1
tongue	1
shall	1
swear.	1
	1
45:24	1
Surely,	1
shall	1
one	1
say,	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
I	1
righteousness	1
and	1
strength:	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
men	1
come;	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
incensed	1
against	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
45:25	1
In	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
justified,	1
and	1
shall	1
glory.	1
	1
46:1	1
Bel	1
boweth	1
down,	1
Nebo	1
stoopeth,	1
their	1
idols	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
beasts,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
cattle:	1
your	1
carriages	1
were	1
heavy	1
loaden;	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
the	1
weary	1
beast.	1
	1
46:2	1
They	1
stoop,	1
they	1
bow	1
down	1
together;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
deliver	1
the	1
burden,	1
but	1
themselves	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity.	1
	1
46:3	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
are	1
borne	1
by	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
belly,	1
which	1
are	1
carried	1
from	1
the	1
womb:	1
46:4	1
And	1
even	1
to	1
your	1
old	1
age	1
I	1
am	1
he;	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
hoar	1
hairs	1
will	1
I	1
carry	1
you:	1
I	1
have	1
made,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bear;	1
even	1
I	1
will	1
carry,	1
and	1
will	1
deliver	1
you.	1
	1
46:5	1
To	1
whom	1
will	1
ye	1
liken	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
equal,	1
and	1
compare	1
me,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
like?	1
	1
46:6	1
They	1
lavish	1
gold	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bag,	1
and	1
weigh	1
silver	1
in	1
the	1
balance,	1
and	1
hire	1
a	1
goldsmith;	1
and	1
he	1
maketh	1
it	1
a	1
god:	1
they	1
fall	1
down,	1
yea,	1
they	1
worship.	1
	1
46:7	1
They	1
bear	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
they	1
carry	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
he	1
standeth;	1
from	1
his	1
place	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
remove:	1
yea,	1
one	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
him,	1
yet	1
can	1
he	1
not	1
answer,	1
nor	1
save	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
trouble.	1
	1
46:8	1
Remember	1
this,	1
and	1
shew	1
yourselves	1
men:	1
bring	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
mind,	1
O	1
ye	1
transgressors.	1
	1
46:9	1
Remember	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
of	1
old:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else;	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
me,	1
46:10	1
Declaring	1
the	1
end	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
from	1
ancient	1
times	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
yet	1
done,	1
saying,	1
My	1
counsel	1
shall	1
stand,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
my	1
pleasure:	1
46:11	1
Calling	1
a	1
ravenous	1
bird	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
executeth	1
my	1
counsel	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country:	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
pass;	1
I	1
have	1
purposed	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
46:12	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
ye	1
stouthearted,	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
from	1
righteousness:	1
46:13	1
I	1
bring	1
near	1
my	1
righteousness;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
my	1
salvation	1
shall	1
not	1
tarry:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
place	1
salvation	1
in	1
Zion	1
for	1
Israel	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
47:1	1
Come	1
down,	1
and	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
dust,	1
O	1
virgin	1
daughter	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
throne,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
tender	1
and	1
delicate.	1
	1
47:2	1
Take	1
the	1
millstones,	1
and	1
grind	1
meal:	1
uncover	1
thy	1
locks,	1
make	1
bare	1
the	1
leg,	1
uncover	1
the	1
thigh,	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
rivers.	1
	1
47:3	1
Thy	1
nakedness	1
shall	1
be	1
uncovered,	1
yea,	1
thy	1
shame	1
shall	1
be	1
seen:	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
vengeance,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
47:4	1
As	1
for	1
our	1
redeemer,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
47:5	1
Sit	1
thou	1
silent,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
into	1
darkness,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called,	1
The	1
lady	1
of	1
kingdoms.	1
	1
47:6	1
I	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
my	1
people,	1
I	1
have	1
polluted	1
mine	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
given	1
them	1
into	1
thine	1
hand:	1
thou	1
didst	1
shew	1
them	1
no	1
mercy;	1
upon	1
the	1
ancient	1
hast	1
thou	1
very	1
heavily	1
laid	1
thy	1
yoke.	1
	1
47:7	1
And	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
lady	1
for	1
ever:	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
lay	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
thy	1
heart,	1
neither	1
didst	1
remember	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
47:8	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
now	1
this,	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
given	1
to	1
pleasures,	1
that	1
dwellest	1
carelessly,	1
that	1
sayest	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
none	1
else	1
beside	1
me;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
sit	1
as	1
a	1
widow,	1
neither	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
children:	1
47:9	1
But	1
these	1
two	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
children,	1
and	1
widowhood:	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee	1
in	1
their	1
perfection	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
sorceries,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
abundance	1
of	1
thine	1
enchantments.	1
	1
47:10	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
trusted	1
in	1
thy	1
wickedness:	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
None	1
seeth	1
me.	1
Thy	1
wisdom	1
and	1
thy	1
knowledge,	1
it	1
hath	1
perverted	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
none	1
else	1
beside	1
me.	1
	1
47:11	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
evil	1
come	1
upon	1
thee;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know	1
from	1
whence	1
it	1
riseth:	1
and	1
mischief	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
thee;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
off:	1
and	1
desolation	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee	1
suddenly,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know.	1
	1
47:12	1
Stand	1
now	1
with	1
thine	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
sorceries,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
laboured	1
from	1
thy	1
youth;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
profit,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prevail.	1
	1
47:13	1
Thou	1
art	1
wearied	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
counsels.	1
Let	1
now	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
stargazers,	1
the	1
monthly	1
prognosticators,	1
stand	1
up,	1
and	1
save	1
thee	1
from	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
47:14	1
Behold,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
stubble;	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
burn	1
them;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
deliver	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
flame:	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
coal	1
to	1
warm	1
at,	1
nor	1
fire	1
to	1
sit	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
47:15	1
Thus	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
laboured,	1
even	1
thy	1
merchants,	1
from	1
thy	1
youth:	1
they	1
shall	1
wander	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
quarter;	1
none	1
shall	1
save	1
thee.	1
	1
48:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
this,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
are	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
truth,	1
nor	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
48:2	1
For	1
they	1
call	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
stay	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
48:3	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
beginning;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
I	1
shewed	1
them;	1
I	1
did	1
them	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
48:4	1
Because	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
obstinate,	1
and	1
thy	1
neck	1
is	1
an	1
iron	1
sinew,	1
and	1
thy	1
brow	1
brass;	1
48:5	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
declared	1
it	1
to	1
thee;	1
before	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
I	1
shewed	1
it	1
thee:	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say,	1
Mine	1
idol	1
hath	1
done	1
them,	1
and	1
my	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
my	1
molten	1
image,	1
hath	1
commanded	1
them.	1
	1
48:6	1
Thou	1
hast	1
heard,	1
see	1
all	1
this;	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
ye	1
declare	1
it?	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
thee	1
new	1
things	1
from	1
this	1
time,	1
even	1
hidden	1
things,	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
48:7	1
They	1
are	1
created	1
now,	1
and	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
beginning;	1
even	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
thou	1
heardest	1
them	1
not;	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
knew	1
them.	1
	1
48:8	1
Yea,	1
thou	1
heardest	1
not;	1
yea,	1
thou	1
knewest	1
not;	1
yea,	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
that	1
thine	1
ear	1
was	1
not	1
opened:	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
deal	1
very	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
wast	1
called	1
a	1
transgressor	1
from	1
the	1
womb.	1
	1
48:9	1
For	1
my	1
name's	1
sake	1
will	1
I	1
defer	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
praise	1
will	1
I	1
refrain	1
for	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
cut	1
thee	1
not	1
off.	1
	1
48:10	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
refined	1
thee,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
silver;	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
furnace	1
of	1
affliction.	1
	1
48:11	1
For	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
even	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
it:	1
for	1
how	1
should	1
my	1
name	1
be	1
polluted?	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
my	1
glory	1
unto	1
another.	1
	1
48:12	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Israel,	1
my	1
called;	1
I	1
am	1
he;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first,	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
the	1
last.	1
	1
48:13	1
Mine	1
hand	1
also	1
hath	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
hath	1
spanned	1
the	1
heavens:	1
when	1
I	1
call	1
unto	1
them,	1
they	1
stand	1
up	1
together.	1
	1
48:14	1
All	1
ye,	1
assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
hear;	1
which	1
among	1
them	1
hath	1
declared	1
these	1
things?	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
loved	1
him:	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
his	1
pleasure	1
on	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
48:15	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
have	1
spoken;	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
him:	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
his	1
way	1
prosperous.	1
	1
48:16	1
Come	1
ye	1
near	1
unto	1
me,	1
hear	1
ye	1
this;	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
in	1
secret	1
from	1
the	1
beginning;	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
was,	1
there	1
am	1
I:	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
and	1
his	1
Spirit,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
48:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thy	1
Redeemer,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
which	1
teacheth	1
thee	1
to	1
profit,	1
which	1
leadeth	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
go.	1
	1
48:18	1
O	1
that	1
thou	1
hadst	1
hearkened	1
to	1
my	1
commandments!	1
then	1
had	1
thy	1
peace	1
been	1
as	1
a	1
river,	1
and	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
as	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
48:19	1
Thy	1
seed	1
also	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
the	1
sand,	1
and	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
thy	1
bowels	1
like	1
the	1
gravel	1
thereof;	1
his	1
name	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
cut	1
off	1
nor	1
destroyed	1
from	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
48:20	1
Go	1
ye	1
forth	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
flee	1
ye	1
from	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
singing	1
declare	1
ye,	1
tell	1
this,	1
utter	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
say	1
ye,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
his	1
servant	1
Jacob.	1
	1
48:21	1
And	1
they	1
thirsted	1
not	1
when	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
deserts:	1
he	1
caused	1
the	1
waters	1
to	1
flow	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
for	1
them:	1
he	1
clave	1
the	1
rock	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
gushed	1
out.	1
	1
48:22	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
peace,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
49:1	1
Listen,	1
O	1
isles,	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
hearken,	1
ye	1
people,	1
from	1
far;	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
womb;	1
from	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
hath	1
he	1
made	1
mention	1
of	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
49:2	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
my	1
mouth	1
like	1
a	1
sharp	1
sword;	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
hath	1
he	1
hid	1
me,	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
polished	1
shaft;	1
in	1
his	1
quiver	1
hath	1
he	1
hid	1
me;	1
49:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
49:4	1
Then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
laboured	1
in	1
vain,	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
my	1
strength	1
for	1
nought,	1
and	1
in	1
vain:	1
yet	1
surely	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
my	1
work	1
with	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
49:5	1
And	1
now,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
formed	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
womb	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
servant,	1
to	1
bring	1
Jacob	1
again	1
to	1
him,	1
Though	1
Israel	1
be	1
not	1
gathered,	1
yet	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
glorious	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
strength.	1
	1
49:6	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
light	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
my	1
servant	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
preserved	1
of	1
Israel:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
my	1
salvation	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
49:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
his	1
Holy	1
One,	1
to	1
him	1
whom	1
man	1
despiseth,	1
to	1
him	1
whom	1
the	1
nation	1
abhorreth,	1
to	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
rulers,	1
Kings	1
shall	1
see	1
and	1
arise,	1
princes	1
also	1
shall	1
worship,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
is	1
faithful,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
choose	1
thee.	1
	1
49:8	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
In	1
an	1
acceptable	1
time	1
have	1
I	1
heard	1
thee,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
salvation	1
have	1
I	1
helped	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
preserve	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
cause	1
to	1
inherit	1
the	1
desolate	1
heritages;	1
49:9	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
Go	1
forth;	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
darkness,	1
Shew	1
yourselves.	1
They	1
shall	1
feed	1
in	1
the	1
ways,	1
and	1
their	1
pastures	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
49:10	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
hunger	1
nor	1
thirst;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
heat	1
nor	1
sun	1
smite	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
mercy	1
on	1
them	1
shall	1
lead	1
them,	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
water	1
shall	1
he	1
guide	1
them.	1
	1
49:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
all	1
my	1
mountains	1
a	1
way,	1
and	1
my	1
highways	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
49:12	1
Behold,	1
these	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
these	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west;	1
and	1
these	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sinim.	1
	1
49:13	1
Sing,	1
O	1
heavens;	1
and	1
be	1
joyful,	1
O	1
earth;	1
and	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
singing,	1
O	1
mountains:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
comforted	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
his	1
afflicted.	1
	1
49:14	1
But	1
Zion	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
Lord	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
	1
49:15	1
Can	1
a	1
woman	1
forget	1
her	1
sucking	1
child,	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
her	1
womb?	1
yea,	1
they	1
may	1
forget,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
forget	1
thee.	1
	1
49:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
graven	1
thee	1
upon	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
my	1
hands;	1
thy	1
walls	1
are	1
continually	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
49:17	1
Thy	1
children	1
shall	1
make	1
haste;	1
thy	1
destroyers	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
made	1
thee	1
waste	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
49:18	1
Lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
behold:	1
all	1
these	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
thee.	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
clothe	1
thee	1
with	1
them	1
all,	1
as	1
with	1
an	1
ornament,	1
and	1
bind	1
them	1
on	1
thee,	1
as	1
a	1
bride	1
doeth.	1
	1
49:19	1
For	1
thy	1
waste	1
and	1
thy	1
desolate	1
places,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
destruction,	1
shall	1
even	1
now	1
be	1
too	1
narrow	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
swallowed	1
thee	1
up	1
shall	1
be	1
far	1
away.	1
	1
49:20	1
The	1
children	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have,	1
after	1
thou	1
hast	1
lost	1
the	1
other,	1
shall	1
say	1
again	1
in	1
thine	1
ears,	1
The	1
place	1
is	1
too	1
strait	1
for	1
me:	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
dwell.	1
	1
49:21	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
Who	1
hath	1
begotten	1
me	1
these,	1
seeing	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
children,	1
and	1
am	1
desolate,	1
a	1
captive,	1
and	1
removing	1
to	1
and	1
fro?	1
and	1
who	1
hath	1
brought	1
up	1
these?	1
Behold,	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
alone;	1
these,	1
where	1
had	1
they	1
been?	1
	1
49:22	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
my	1
standard	1
to	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
thy	1
sons	1
in	1
their	1
arms,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders.	1
	1
49:23	1
And	1
kings	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
nursing	1
fathers,	1
and	1
their	1
queens	1
thy	1
nursing	1
mothers:	1
they	1
shall	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
thee	1
with	1
their	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
lick	1
up	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
thy	1
feet;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
49:24	1
Shall	1
the	1
prey	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
mighty,	1
or	1
the	1
lawful	1
captive	1
delivered?	1
	1
49:25	1
But	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Even	1
the	1
captives	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
contend	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
contendeth	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
thy	1
children.	1
	1
49:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
that	1
oppress	1
thee	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
flesh;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
drunken	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
blood,	1
as	1
with	1
sweet	1
wine:	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
am	1
thy	1
Saviour	1
and	1
thy	1
Redeemer,	1
the	1
mighty	1
One	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
50:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
bill	1
of	1
your	1
mother's	1
divorcement,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
away?	1
or	1
which	1
of	1
my	1
creditors	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
sold	1
you?	1
	1
Behold,	1
for	1
your	1
iniquities	1
have	1
ye	1
sold	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
transgressions	1
is	1
your	1
mother	1
put	1
away.	1
	1
50:2	1
Wherefore,	1
when	1
I	1
came,	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
man?	1
when	1
I	1
called,	1
was	1
there	1
none	1
to	1
answer?	1
Is	1
my	1
hand	1
shortened	1
at	1
all,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
redeem?	1
or	1
have	1
I	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
deliver?	1
behold,	1
at	1
my	1
rebuke	1
I	1
dry	1
up	1
the	1
sea,	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
rivers	1
a	1
wilderness:	1
their	1
fish	1
stinketh,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
water,	1
and	1
dieth	1
for	1
thirst.	1
	1
50:3	1
I	1
clothe	1
the	1
heavens	1
with	1
blackness,	1
and	1
I	1
make	1
sackcloth	1
their	1
covering.	1
	1
50:4	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
learned,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
season	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
weary:	1
he	1
wakeneth	1
morning	1
by	1
morning,	1
he	1
wakeneth	1
mine	1
ear	1
to	1
hear	1
as	1
the	1
learned.	1
	1
50:5	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
opened	1
mine	1
ear,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
rebellious,	1
neither	1
turned	1
away	1
back.	1
	1
50:6	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
smiters,	1
and	1
my	1
cheeks	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
plucked	1
off	1
the	1
hair:	1
I	1
hid	1
not	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
shame	1
and	1
spitting.	1
	1
50:7	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
help	1
me;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
be	1
confounded:	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
flint,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
50:8	1
He	1
is	1
near	1
that	1
justifieth	1
me;	1
who	1
will	1
contend	1
with	1
me?	1
let	1
us	1
stand	1
together:	1
who	1
is	1
mine	1
adversary?	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
50:9	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
help	1
me;	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
condemn	1
me?	1
	1
lo,	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
as	1
a	1
garment;	1
the	1
moth	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
up.	1
	1
50:10	1
Who	1
is	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
feareth	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
obeyeth	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
hath	1
no	1
light?	1
let	1
him	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
stay	1
upon	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
50:11	1
Behold,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire,	1
that	1
compass	1
yourselves	1
about	1
with	1
sparks:	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
your	1
fire,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sparks	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
kindled.	1
This	1
shall	1
ye	1
have	1
of	1
mine	1
hand;	1
ye	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
sorrow.	1
	1
51:1	1
Hearken	1
to	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
follow	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
ye	1
that	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD:	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
rock	1
whence	1
ye	1
are	1
hewn,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hole	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
whence	1
ye	1
are	1
digged.	1
	1
51:2	1
Look	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
your	1
father,	1
and	1
unto	1
Sarah	1
that	1
bare	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
called	1
him	1
alone,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
increased	1
him.	1
	1
51:3	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
comfort	1
Zion:	1
he	1
will	1
comfort	1
all	1
her	1
waste	1
places;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
wilderness	1
like	1
Eden,	1
and	1
her	1
desert	1
like	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
therein,	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
melody.	1
	1
51:4	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
nation:	1
for	1
a	1
law	1
shall	1
proceed	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
judgment	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
51:5	1
My	1
righteousness	1
is	1
near;	1
my	1
salvation	1
is	1
gone	1
forth,	1
and	1
mine	1
arms	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
people;	1
the	1
isles	1
shall	1
wait	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
on	1
mine	1
arm	1
shall	1
they	1
trust.	1
	1
51:6	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath:	1
for	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
vanish	1
away	1
like	1
smoke,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
like	1
a	1
garment,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
like	1
manner:	1
but	1
my	1
salvation	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
my	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
abolished.	1
	1
51:7	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
know	1
righteousness,	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
whose	1
heart	1
is	1
my	1
law;	1
fear	1
ye	1
not	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
men,	1
neither	1
be	1
ye	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
revilings.	1
	1
51:8	1
For	1
the	1
moth	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
garment,	1
and	1
the	1
worm	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
like	1
wool:	1
but	1
my	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
my	1
salvation	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
51:9	1
Awake,	1
awake,	1
put	1
on	1
strength,	1
O	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
awake,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
ancient	1
days,	1
in	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
old.	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
it	1
that	1
hath	1
cut	1
Rahab,	1
and	1
wounded	1
the	1
dragon?	1
	1
51:10	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
it	1
which	1
hath	1
dried	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
deep;	1
that	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
a	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
ransomed	1
to	1
pass	1
over?	1
	1
51:11	1
Therefore	1
the	1
redeemed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
singing	1
unto	1
Zion;	1
and	1
everlasting	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
their	1
head:	1
they	1
shall	1
obtain	1
gladness	1
and	1
joy;	1
and	1
sorrow	1
and	1
mourning	1
shall	1
flee	1
away.	1
	1
51:12	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
comforteth	1
you:	1
who	1
art	1
thou,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
die,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
as	1
grass;	1
51:13	1
And	1
forgettest	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
maker,	1
that	1
hath	1
stretched	1
forth	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
hast	1
feared	1
continually	1
every	1
day	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
destroy?	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor?	1
	1
51:14	1
The	1
captive	1
exile	1
hasteneth	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
loosed,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
pit,	1
nor	1
that	1
his	1
bread	1
should	1
fail.	1
	1
51:15	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
divided	1
the	1
sea,	1
whose	1
waves	1
roared:	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
51:16	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
covered	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
mine	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
plant	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
Zion,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
51:17	1
Awake,	1
awake,	1
stand	1
up,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
hast	1
drunk	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
his	1
fury;	1
thou	1
hast	1
drunken	1
the	1
dregs	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
trembling,	1
and	1
wrung	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
51:18	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
guide	1
her	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
whom	1
she	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
that	1
taketh	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
brought	1
up.	1
	1
51:19	1
These	1
two	1
things	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
thee;	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
thee?	1
	1
desolation,	1
and	1
destruction,	1
and	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
the	1
sword:	1
by	1
whom	1
shall	1
I	1
comfort	1
thee?	1
	1
51:20	1
Thy	1
sons	1
have	1
fainted,	1
they	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
streets,	1
as	1
a	1
wild	1
bull	1
in	1
a	1
net:	1
they	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
51:21	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
now	1
this,	1
thou	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
drunken,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
wine:	1
51:22	1
Thus	1
saith	1
thy	1
Lord	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thy	1
God	1
that	1
pleadeth	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
trembling,	1
even	1
the	1
dregs	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
my	1
fury;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
drink	1
it	1
again:	1
51:23	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
afflict	1
thee;	1
which	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
thy	1
soul,	1
Bow	1
down,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
go	1
over:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
thy	1
body	1
as	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
street,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
went	1
over.	1
	1
52:1	1
Awake,	1
awake;	1
put	1
on	1
thy	1
strength,	1
O	1
Zion;	1
put	1
on	1
thy	1
beautiful	1
garments,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
holy	1
city:	1
for	1
henceforth	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
come	1
into	1
thee	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
and	1
the	1
unclean.	1
	1
52:2	1
Shake	1
thyself	1
from	1
the	1
dust;	1
arise,	1
and	1
sit	1
down,	1
O	1
Jerusalem:	1
loose	1
thyself	1
from	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
thy	1
neck,	1
O	1
captive	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
52:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Ye	1
have	1
sold	1
yourselves	1
for	1
nought;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
redeemed	1
without	1
money.	1
	1
52:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
My	1
people	1
went	1
down	1
aforetime	1
into	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there;	1
and	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
oppressed	1
them	1
without	1
cause.	1
	1
52:5	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
here,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
taken	1
away	1
for	1
nought?	1
they	1
that	1
rule	1
over	1
them	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
howl,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
my	1
name	1
continually	1
every	1
day	1
is	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
52:6	1
Therefore	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
know	1
my	1
name:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
doth	1
speak:	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
I.	1
	1
52:7	1
How	1
beautiful	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings,	1
that	1
publisheth	1
peace;	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
good,	1
that	1
publisheth	1
salvation;	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
Zion,	1
Thy	1
God	1
reigneth!	1
	1
52:8	1
Thy	1
watchmen	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
voice;	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
together	1
shall	1
they	1
sing:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
eye	1
to	1
eye,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
Zion.	1
	1
52:9	1
Break	1
forth	1
into	1
joy,	1
sing	1
together,	1
ye	1
waste	1
places	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
comforted	1
his	1
people,	1
he	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
52:10	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
bare	1
his	1
holy	1
arm	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
52:11	1
Depart	1
ye,	1
depart	1
ye,	1
go	1
ye	1
out	1
from	1
thence,	1
touch	1
no	1
unclean	1
thing;	1
go	1
ye	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her;	1
be	1
ye	1
clean,	1
that	1
bear	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
52:12	1
For	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
haste,	1
nor	1
go	1
by	1
flight:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
you;	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
rereward.	1
	1
52:13	1
Behold,	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
deal	1
prudently,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
and	1
extolled,	1
and	1
be	1
very	1
high.	1
	1
52:14	1
As	1
many	1
were	1
astonied	1
at	1
thee;	1
his	1
visage	1
was	1
so	1
marred	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
man,	1
and	1
his	1
form	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men:	1
52:15	1
So	1
shall	1
he	1
sprinkle	1
many	1
nations;	1
the	1
kings	1
shall	1
shut	1
their	1
mouths	1
at	1
him:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
told	1
them	1
shall	1
they	1
see;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
shall	1
they	1
consider.	1
	1
53:1	1
Who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
revealed?	1
	1
53:2	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
up	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
tender	1
plant,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
root	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
dry	1
ground:	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
form	1
nor	1
comeliness;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
him,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
beauty	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
desire	1
him.	1
	1
53:3	1
He	1
is	1
despised	1
and	1
rejected	1
of	1
men;	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sorrows,	1
and	1
acquainted	1
with	1
grief:	1
and	1
we	1
hid	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
our	1
faces	1
from	1
him;	1
he	1
was	1
despised,	1
and	1
we	1
esteemed	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
53:4	1
Surely	1
he	1
hath	1
borne	1
our	1
griefs,	1
and	1
carried	1
our	1
sorrows:	1
yet	1
we	1
did	1
esteem	1
him	1
stricken,	1
smitten	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
afflicted.	1
	1
53:5	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
wounded	1
for	1
our	1
transgressions,	1
he	1
was	1
bruised	1
for	1
our	1
iniquities:	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
our	1
peace	1
was	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
stripes	1
we	1
are	1
healed.	1
	1
53:6	1
All	1
we	1
like	1
sheep	1
have	1
gone	1
astray;	1
we	1
have	1
turned	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
way;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
laid	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
us	1
all.	1
	1
53:7	1
He	1
was	1
oppressed,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
afflicted,	1
yet	1
he	1
opened	1
not	1
his	1
mouth:	1
he	1
is	1
brought	1
as	1
a	1
lamb	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
before	1
her	1
shearers	1
is	1
dumb,	1
so	1
he	1
openeth	1
not	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
53:8	1
He	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
prison	1
and	1
from	1
judgment:	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
generation?	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
for	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
was	1
he	1
stricken.	1
	1
53:9	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
grave	1
with	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
in	1
his	1
death;	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
no	1
violence,	1
neither	1
was	1
any	1
deceit	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
53:10	1
Yet	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
bruise	1
him;	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
grief:	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
his	1
soul	1
an	1
offering	1
for	1
sin,	1
he	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
seed,	1
he	1
shall	1
prolong	1
his	1
days,	1
and	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
53:11	1
He	1
shall	1
see	1
of	1
the	1
travail	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied:	1
by	1
his	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
my	1
righteous	1
servant	1
justify	1
many;	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquities.	1
	1
53:12	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
divide	1
him	1
a	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
great,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil	1
with	1
the	1
strong;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
soul	1
unto	1
death:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
transgressors;	1
and	1
he	1
bare	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
many,	1
and	1
made	1
intercession	1
for	1
the	1
transgressors.	1
	1
54:1	1
Sing,	1
O	1
barren,	1
thou	1
that	1
didst	1
not	1
bear;	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
singing,	1
and	1
cry	1
aloud,	1
thou	1
that	1
didst	1
not	1
travail	1
with	1
child:	1
for	1
more	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
desolate	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
married	1
wife,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
54:2	1
Enlarge	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
thy	1
tent,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
stretch	1
forth	1
the	1
curtains	1
of	1
thine	1
habitations:	1
spare	1
not,	1
lengthen	1
thy	1
cords,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
thy	1
stakes;	1
54:3	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
break	1
forth	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left;	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
desolate	1
cities	1
to	1
be	1
inhabited.	1
	1
54:4	1
Fear	1
not;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
neither	1
be	1
thou	1
confounded;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
shame:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
forget	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
thy	1
widowhood	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
54:5	1
For	1
thy	1
Maker	1
is	1
thine	1
husband;	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name;	1
and	1
thy	1
Redeemer	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
called.	1
	1
54:6	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
forsaken	1
and	1
grieved	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
youth,	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
refused,	1
saith	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
54:7	1
For	1
a	1
small	1
moment	1
have	1
I	1
forsaken	1
thee;	1
but	1
with	1
great	1
mercies	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
thee.	1
	1
54:8	1
In	1
a	1
little	1
wrath	1
I	1
hid	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
moment;	1
but	1
with	1
everlasting	1
kindness	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
Redeemer.	1
	1
54:9	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Noah	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Noah	1
should	1
no	1
more	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
earth;	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
sworn	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
wroth	1
with	1
thee,	1
nor	1
rebuke	1
thee.	1
	1
54:10	1
For	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
depart,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
be	1
removed;	1
but	1
my	1
kindness	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
thee,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
my	1
peace	1
be	1
removed,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
hath	1
mercy	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
54:11	1
O	1
thou	1
afflicted,	1
tossed	1
with	1
tempest,	1
and	1
not	1
comforted,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
thy	1
stones	1
with	1
fair	1
colours,	1
and	1
lay	1
thy	1
foundations	1
with	1
sapphires.	1
	1
54:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
windows	1
of	1
agates,	1
and	1
thy	1
gates	1
of	1
carbuncles,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
borders	1
of	1
pleasant	1
stones.	1
	1
54:13	1
And	1
all	1
thy	1
children	1
shall	1
be	1
taught	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
great	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
thy	1
children.	1
	1
54:14	1
In	1
righteousness	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
established:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
oppression;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
fear:	1
and	1
from	1
terror;	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
near	1
thee.	1
	1
54:15	1
Behold,	1
they	1
shall	1
surely	1
gather	1
together,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
me:	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
gather	1
together	1
against	1
thee	1
shall	1
fall	1
for	1
thy	1
sake.	1
	1
54:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
the	1
smith	1
that	1
bloweth	1
the	1
coals	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
that	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
an	1
instrument	1
for	1
his	1
work;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
the	1
waster	1
to	1
destroy.	1
	1
54:17	1
No	1
weapon	1
that	1
is	1
formed	1
against	1
thee	1
shall	1
prosper;	1
and	1
every	1
tongue	1
that	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
thee	1
in	1
judgment	1
thou	1
shalt	1
condemn.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heritage	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
righteousness	1
is	1
of	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
55:1	1
Ho,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
thirsteth,	1
come	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
money;	1
come	1
ye,	1
buy,	1
and	1
eat;	1
yea,	1
come,	1
buy	1
wine	1
and	1
milk	1
without	1
money	1
and	1
without	1
price.	1
	1
55:2	1
Wherefore	1
do	1
ye	1
spend	1
money	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
bread?	1
and	1
your	1
labour	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
satisfieth	1
not?	1
hearken	1
diligently	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
eat	1
ye	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
soul	1
delight	1
itself	1
in	1
fatness.	1
	1
55:3	1
Incline	1
your	1
ear,	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
hear,	1
and	1
your	1
soul	1
shall	1
live;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant	1
with	1
you,	1
even	1
the	1
sure	1
mercies	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
55:4	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
a	1
leader	1
and	1
commander	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
55:5	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not,	1
and	1
nations	1
that	1
knew	1
not	1
thee	1
shall	1
run	1
unto	1
thee	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
glorified	1
thee.	1
	1
55:6	1
Seek	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD	1
while	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
found,	1
call	1
ye	1
upon	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
near:	1
55:7	1
Let	1
the	1
wicked	1
forsake	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
man	1
his	1
thoughts:	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
God,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
abundantly	1
pardon.	1
	1
55:8	1
For	1
my	1
thoughts	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
thoughts,	1
neither	1
are	1
your	1
ways	1
my	1
ways,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
55:9	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
earth,	1
so	1
are	1
my	1
ways	1
higher	1
than	1
your	1
ways,	1
and	1
my	1
thoughts	1
than	1
your	1
thoughts.	1
	1
55:10	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
rain	1
cometh	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
snow	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
returneth	1
not	1
thither,	1
but	1
watereth	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
bring	1
forth	1
and	1
bud,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
give	1
seed	1
to	1
the	1
sower,	1
and	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
eater:	1
55:11	1
So	1
shall	1
my	1
word	1
be	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
unto	1
me	1
void,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
accomplish	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
please,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
thing	1
whereto	1
I	1
sent	1
it.	1
	1
55:12	1
For	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
be	1
led	1
forth	1
with	1
peace:	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
shall	1
break	1
forth	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
singing,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
clap	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
55:13	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
thorn	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
the	1
fir	1
tree,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
brier	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
the	1
myrtle	1
tree:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
a	1
name,	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
sign	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
56:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Keep	1
ye	1
judgment,	1
and	1
do	1
justice:	1
for	1
my	1
salvation	1
is	1
near	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
my	1
righteousness	1
to	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
56:2	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
this,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
layeth	1
hold	1
on	1
it;	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sabbath	1
from	1
polluting	1
it,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
doing	1
any	1
evil.	1
	1
56:3	1
Neither	1
let	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
stranger,	1
that	1
hath	1
joined	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
speak,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
utterly	1
separated	1
me	1
from	1
his	1
people:	1
neither	1
let	1
the	1
eunuch	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
dry	1
tree.	1
	1
56:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
that	1
keep	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
choose	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
please	1
me,	1
and	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
covenant;	1
56:5	1
Even	1
unto	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
in	1
mine	1
house	1
and	1
within	1
my	1
walls	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
a	1
name	1
better	1
than	1
of	1
sons	1
and	1
of	1
daughters:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
everlasting	1
name,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
56:6	1
Also	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
stranger,	1
that	1
join	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
servants,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sabbath	1
from	1
polluting	1
it,	1
and	1
taketh	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
covenant;	1
56:7	1
Even	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
to	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
joyful	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
of	1
prayer:	1
their	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
their	1
sacrifices	1
shall	1
be	1
accepted	1
upon	1
mine	1
altar;	1
for	1
mine	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
prayer	1
for	1
all	1
people.	1
	1
56:8	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
which	1
gathereth	1
the	1
outcasts	1
of	1
Israel	1
saith,	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
others	1
to	1
him,	1
beside	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
56:9	1
All	1
ye	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
come	1
to	1
devour,	1
yea,	1
all	1
ye	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
56:10	1
His	1
watchmen	1
are	1
blind:	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
ignorant,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
dumb	1
dogs,	1
they	1
cannot	1
bark;	1
sleeping,	1
lying	1
down,	1
loving	1
to	1
slumber.	1
	1
56:11	1
Yea,	1
they	1
are	1
greedy	1
dogs	1
which	1
can	1
never	1
have	1
enough,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
shepherds	1
that	1
cannot	1
understand:	1
they	1
all	1
look	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
way,	1
every	1
one	1
for	1
his	1
gain,	1
from	1
his	1
quarter.	1
	1
56:12	1
Come	1
ye,	1
say	1
they,	1
I	1
will	1
fetch	1
wine,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
fill	1
ourselves	1
with	1
strong	1
drink;	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
abundant.	1
	1
57:1	1
The	1
righteous	1
perisheth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
layeth	1
it	1
to	1
heart:	1
and	1
merciful	1
men	1
are	1
taken	1
away,	1
none	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
is	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
57:2	1
He	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
peace:	1
they	1
shall	1
rest	1
in	1
their	1
beds,	1
each	1
one	1
walking	1
in	1
his	1
uprightness.	1
	1
57:3	1
But	1
draw	1
near	1
hither,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
sorceress,	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
adulterer	1
and	1
the	1
whore.	1
	1
57:4	1
Against	1
whom	1
do	1
ye	1
sport	1
yourselves?	1
against	1
whom	1
make	1
ye	1
a	1
wide	1
mouth,	1
and	1
draw	1
out	1
the	1
tongue?	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
children	1
of	1
transgression,	1
a	1
seed	1
of	1
falsehood.	1
	1
57:5	1
Enflaming	1
yourselves	1
with	1
idols	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree,	1
slaying	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
valleys	1
under	1
the	1
clifts	1
of	1
the	1
rocks?	1
	1
57:6	1
Among	1
the	1
smooth	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
is	1
thy	1
portion;	1
they,	1
they	1
are	1
thy	1
lot:	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
hast	1
thou	1
poured	1
a	1
drink	1
offering,	1
thou	1
hast	1
offered	1
a	1
meat	1
offering.	1
Should	1
I	1
receive	1
comfort	1
in	1
these?	1
	1
57:7	1
Upon	1
a	1
lofty	1
and	1
high	1
mountain	1
hast	1
thou	1
set	1
thy	1
bed:	1
even	1
thither	1
wentest	1
thou	1
up	1
to	1
offer	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
57:8	1
Behind	1
the	1
doors	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
posts	1
hast	1
thou	1
set	1
up	1
thy	1
remembrance:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
discovered	1
thyself	1
to	1
another	1
than	1
me,	1
and	1
art	1
gone	1
up;	1
thou	1
hast	1
enlarged	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
them;	1
thou	1
lovedst	1
their	1
bed	1
where	1
thou	1
sawest	1
it.	1
	1
57:9	1
And	1
thou	1
wentest	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
with	1
ointment,	1
and	1
didst	1
increase	1
thy	1
perfumes,	1
and	1
didst	1
send	1
thy	1
messengers	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
didst	1
debase	1
thyself	1
even	1
unto	1
hell.	1
	1
57:10	1
Thou	1
art	1
wearied	1
in	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thy	1
way;	1
yet	1
saidst	1
thou	1
not,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
hope:	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
thine	1
hand;	1
therefore	1
thou	1
wast	1
not	1
grieved.	1
	1
57:11	1
And	1
of	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
been	1
afraid	1
or	1
feared,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
lied,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
remembered	1
me,	1
nor	1
laid	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
heart?	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
held	1
my	1
peace	1
even	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
thou	1
fearest	1
me	1
not?	1
	1
57:12	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
thy	1
works;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
profit	1
thee.	1
	1
57:13	1
When	1
thou	1
criest,	1
let	1
thy	1
companies	1
deliver	1
thee;	1
but	1
the	1
wind	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
all	1
away;	1
vanity	1
shall	1
take	1
them:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
putteth	1
his	1
trust	1
in	1
me	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
inherit	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain;	1
57:14	1
And	1
shall	1
say,	1
Cast	1
ye	1
up,	1
cast	1
ye	1
up,	1
prepare	1
the	1
way,	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
stumblingblock	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
57:15	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
lofty	1
One	1
that	1
inhabiteth	1
eternity,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
Holy;	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
holy	1
place,	1
with	1
him	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
contrite	1
and	1
humble	1
spirit,	1
to	1
revive	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
humble,	1
and	1
to	1
revive	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
contrite	1
ones.	1
	1
57:16	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
contend	1
for	1
ever,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
always	1
wroth:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
should	1
fail	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
souls	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made.	1
	1
57:17	1
For	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
his	1
covetousness	1
was	1
I	1
wroth,	1
and	1
smote	1
him:	1
I	1
hid	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
frowardly	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
57:18	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
will	1
heal	1
him:	1
I	1
will	1
lead	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
restore	1
comforts	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
mourners.	1
	1
57:19	1
I	1
create	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
lips;	1
Peace,	1
peace	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
near,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
him.	1
	1
57:20	1
But	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
troubled	1
sea,	1
when	1
it	1
cannot	1
rest,	1
whose	1
waters	1
cast	1
up	1
mire	1
and	1
dirt.	1
	1
57:21	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
peace,	1
saith	1
my	1
God,	1
to	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
58:1	1
Cry	1
aloud,	1
spare	1
not,	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice	1
like	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
shew	1
my	1
people	1
their	1
transgression,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
58:2	1
Yet	1
they	1
seek	1
me	1
daily,	1
and	1
delight	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
ways,	1
as	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
did	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
forsook	1
not	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
their	1
God:	1
they	1
ask	1
of	1
me	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
justice;	1
they	1
take	1
delight	1
in	1
approaching	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
58:3	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
we	1
fasted,	1
say	1
they,	1
and	1
thou	1
seest	1
not?	1
wherefore	1
have	1
we	1
afflicted	1
our	1
soul,	1
and	1
thou	1
takest	1
no	1
knowledge?	1
Behold,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
fast	1
ye	1
find	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
exact	1
all	1
your	1
labours.	1
	1
58:4	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
fast	1
for	1
strife	1
and	1
debate,	1
and	1
to	1
smite	1
with	1
the	1
fist	1
of	1
wickedness:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fast	1
as	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
voice	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
58:5	1
Is	1
it	1
such	1
a	1
fast	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
chosen?	1
a	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
afflict	1
his	1
soul?	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
a	1
bulrush,	1
and	1
to	1
spread	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes	1
under	1
him?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
call	1
this	1
a	1
fast,	1
and	1
an	1
acceptable	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
58:6	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
fast	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
chosen?	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
wickedness,	1
to	1
undo	1
the	1
heavy	1
burdens,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
oppressed	1
go	1
free,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
break	1
every	1
yoke?	1
	1
58:7	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
deal	1
thy	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
hungry,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
bring	1
the	1
poor	1
that	1
are	1
cast	1
out	1
to	1
thy	1
house?	1
when	1
thou	1
seest	1
the	1
naked,	1
that	1
thou	1
cover	1
him;	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
hide	1
not	1
thyself	1
from	1
thine	1
own	1
flesh?	1
58:8	1
Then	1
shall	1
thy	1
light	1
break	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
thine	1
health	1
shall	1
spring	1
forth	1
speedily:	1
and	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
thee;	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
rereward.	1
	1
58:9	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
call,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
answer;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cry,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
Here	1
I	1
am.	1
If	1
thou	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
the	1
yoke,	1
the	1
putting	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
finger,	1
and	1
speaking	1
vanity;	1
58:10	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
draw	1
out	1
thy	1
soul	1
to	1
the	1
hungry,	1
and	1
satisfy	1
the	1
afflicted	1
soul;	1
then	1
shall	1
thy	1
light	1
rise	1
in	1
obscurity,	1
and	1
thy	1
darkness	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
noon	1
day:	1
58:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
guide	1
thee	1
continually,	1
and	1
satisfy	1
thy	1
soul	1
in	1
drought,	1
and	1
make	1
fat	1
thy	1
bones:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
watered	1
garden,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
spring	1
of	1
water,	1
whose	1
waters	1
fail	1
not.	1
	1
58:12	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
old	1
waste	1
places:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
many	1
generations;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called,	1
The	1
repairer	1
of	1
the	1
breach,	1
The	1
restorer	1
of	1
paths	1
to	1
dwell	1
in.	1
	1
58:13	1
If	1
thou	1
turn	1
away	1
thy	1
foot	1
from	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
from	1
doing	1
thy	1
pleasure	1
on	1
my	1
holy	1
day;	1
and	1
call	1
the	1
sabbath	1
a	1
delight,	1
the	1
holy	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
honourable;	1
and	1
shalt	1
honour	1
him,	1
not	1
doing	1
thine	1
own	1
ways,	1
nor	1
finding	1
thine	1
own	1
pleasure,	1
nor	1
speaking	1
thine	1
own	1
words:	1
58:14	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
delight	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
ride	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
feed	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
heritage	1
of	1
Jacob	1
thy	1
father:	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
59:1	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand	1
is	1
not	1
shortened,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
save;	1
neither	1
his	1
ear	1
heavy,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
hear:	1
59:2	1
But	1
your	1
iniquities	1
have	1
separated	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
your	1
sins	1
have	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
59:3	1
For	1
your	1
hands	1
are	1
defiled	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
your	1
fingers	1
with	1
iniquity;	1
your	1
lips	1
have	1
spoken	1
lies,	1
your	1
tongue	1
hath	1
muttered	1
perverseness.	1
	1
59:4	1
None	1
calleth	1
for	1
justice,	1
nor	1
any	1
pleadeth	1
for	1
truth:	1
they	1
trust	1
in	1
vanity,	1
and	1
speak	1
lies;	1
they	1
conceive	1
mischief,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
iniquity.	1
	1
59:5	1
They	1
hatch	1
cockatrice'	1
eggs,	1
and	1
weave	1
the	1
spider's	1
web:	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
their	1
eggs	1
dieth,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
crushed	1
breaketh	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
viper.	1
	1
59:6	1
Their	1
webs	1
shall	1
not	1
become	1
garments,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
cover	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
works:	1
their	1
works	1
are	1
works	1
of	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
violence	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
59:7	1
Their	1
feet	1
run	1
to	1
evil,	1
and	1
they	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood:	1
their	1
thoughts	1
are	1
thoughts	1
of	1
iniquity;	1
wasting	1
and	1
destruction	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
paths.	1
	1
59:8	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
peace	1
they	1
know	1
not;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
judgment	1
in	1
their	1
goings:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
crooked	1
paths:	1
whosoever	1
goeth	1
therein	1
shall	1
not	1
know	1
peace.	1
	1
59:9	1
Therefore	1
is	1
judgment	1
far	1
from	1
us,	1
neither	1
doth	1
justice	1
overtake	1
us:	1
we	1
wait	1
for	1
light,	1
but	1
behold	1
obscurity;	1
for	1
brightness,	1
but	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness.	1
	1
59:10	1
We	1
grope	1
for	1
the	1
wall	1
like	1
the	1
blind,	1
and	1
we	1
grope	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
no	1
eyes:	1
we	1
stumble	1
at	1
noon	1
day	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
desolate	1
places	1
as	1
dead	1
men.	1
	1
59:11	1
We	1
roar	1
all	1
like	1
bears,	1
and	1
mourn	1
sore	1
like	1
doves:	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
judgment,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
none;	1
for	1
salvation,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
59:12	1
For	1
our	1
transgressions	1
are	1
multiplied	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
our	1
sins	1
testify	1
against	1
us:	1
for	1
our	1
transgressions	1
are	1
with	1
us;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
our	1
iniquities,	1
we	1
know	1
them;	1
59:13	1
In	1
transgressing	1
and	1
lying	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
departing	1
away	1
from	1
our	1
God,	1
speaking	1
oppression	1
and	1
revolt,	1
conceiving	1
and	1
uttering	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
words	1
of	1
falsehood.	1
	1
59:14	1
And	1
judgment	1
is	1
turned	1
away	1
backward,	1
and	1
justice	1
standeth	1
afar	1
off:	1
for	1
truth	1
is	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
equity	1
cannot	1
enter.	1
	1
59:15	1
Yea,	1
truth	1
faileth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
departeth	1
from	1
evil	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
prey:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
displeased	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
judgment.	1
	1
59:16	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man,	1
and	1
wondered	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
intercessor:	1
therefore	1
his	1
arm	1
brought	1
salvation	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness,	1
it	1
sustained	1
him.	1
	1
59:17	1
For	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
righteousness	1
as	1
a	1
breastplate,	1
and	1
an	1
helmet	1
of	1
salvation	1
upon	1
his	1
head;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
vengeance	1
for	1
clothing,	1
and	1
was	1
clad	1
with	1
zeal	1
as	1
a	1
cloak.	1
	1
59:18	1
According	1
to	1
their	1
deeds,	1
accordingly	1
he	1
will	1
repay,	1
fury	1
to	1
his	1
adversaries,	1
recompence	1
to	1
his	1
enemies;	1
to	1
the	1
islands	1
he	1
will	1
repay	1
recompence.	1
	1
59:19	1
So	1
shall	1
they	1
fear	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
his	1
glory	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
When	1
the	1
enemy	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
like	1
a	1
flood,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
standard	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
59:20	1
And	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
Zion,	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
turn	1
from	1
transgression	1
in	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
59:21	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
My	1
spirit	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
my	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
nor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thy	1
seed,	1
nor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thy	1
seed's	1
seed,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
from	1
henceforth	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
60:1	1
Arise,	1
shine;	1
for	1
thy	1
light	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
risen	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
60:2	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
darkness	1
shall	1
cover	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
gross	1
darkness	1
the	1
people:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
arise	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
his	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
60:3	1
And	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
thy	1
light,	1
and	1
kings	1
to	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
thy	1
rising.	1
	1
60:4	1
Lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
see:	1
all	1
they	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together,	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
thee:	1
thy	1
sons	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
be	1
nursed	1
at	1
thy	1
side.	1
	1
60:5	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see,	1
and	1
flow	1
together,	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
shall	1
fear,	1
and	1
be	1
enlarged;	1
because	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
shall	1
be	1
converted	1
unto	1
thee,	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
60:6	1
The	1
multitude	1
of	1
camels	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee,	1
the	1
dromedaries	1
of	1
Midian	1
and	1
Ephah;	1
all	1
they	1
from	1
Sheba	1
shall	1
come:	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
gold	1
and	1
incense;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
shew	1
forth	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
60:7	1
All	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
Kedar	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
thee,	1
the	1
rams	1
of	1
Nebaioth	1
shall	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee:	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
with	1
acceptance	1
on	1
mine	1
altar,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
glorify	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
60:8	1
Who	1
are	1
these	1
that	1
fly	1
as	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
doves	1
to	1
their	1
windows?	1
	1
60:9	1
Surely	1
the	1
isles	1
shall	1
wait	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish	1
first,	1
to	1
bring	1
thy	1
sons	1
from	1
far,	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
with	1
them,	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
glorified	1
thee.	1
	1
60:10	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
strangers	1
shall	1
build	1
up	1
thy	1
walls,	1
and	1
their	1
kings	1
shall	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
wrath	1
I	1
smote	1
thee,	1
but	1
in	1
my	1
favour	1
have	1
I	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
60:11	1
Therefore	1
thy	1
gates	1
shall	1
be	1
open	1
continually;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut	1
day	1
nor	1
night;	1
that	1
men	1
may	1
bring	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
kings	1
may	1
be	1
brought.	1
	1
60:12	1
For	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
kingdom	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
thee	1
shall	1
perish;	1
yea,	1
those	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
wasted.	1
	1
60:13	1
The	1
glory	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
the	1
fir	1
tree,	1
the	1
pine	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
box	1
together,	1
to	1
beautify	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
sanctuary;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
feet	1
glorious.	1
	1
60:14	1
The	1
sons	1
also	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
afflicted	1
thee	1
shall	1
come	1
bending	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
despised	1
thee	1
shall	1
bow	1
themselves	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
thy	1
feet;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
thee;	1
The	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
Zion	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
60:15	1
Whereas	1
thou	1
has	1
been	1
forsaken	1
and	1
hated,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
went	1
through	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
an	1
eternal	1
excellency,	1
a	1
joy	1
of	1
many	1
generations.	1
	1
60:16	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
suck	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
shalt	1
suck	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
kings:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
am	1
thy	1
Saviour	1
and	1
thy	1
Redeemer,	1
the	1
mighty	1
One	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
60:17	1
For	1
brass	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
gold,	1
and	1
for	1
iron	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
wood	1
brass,	1
and	1
for	1
stones	1
iron:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
make	1
thy	1
officers	1
peace,	1
and	1
thine	1
exactors	1
righteousness.	1
	1
60:18	1
Violence	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
thy	1
land,	1
wasting	1
nor	1
destruction	1
within	1
thy	1
borders;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
thy	1
walls	1
Salvation,	1
and	1
thy	1
gates	1
Praise.	1
	1
60:19	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
thy	1
light	1
by	1
day;	1
neither	1
for	1
brightness	1
shall	1
the	1
moon	1
give	1
light	1
unto	1
thee:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
an	1
everlasting	1
light,	1
and	1
thy	1
God	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
60:20	1
Thy	1
sun	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
go	1
down;	1
neither	1
shall	1
thy	1
moon	1
withdraw	1
itself:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
thine	1
everlasting	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
mourning	1
shall	1
be	1
ended.	1
	1
60:21	1
Thy	1
people	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
righteous:	1
they	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
ever,	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
my	1
planting,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
60:22	1
A	1
little	1
one	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
thousand,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
one	1
a	1
strong	1
nation:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
hasten	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
time.	1
	1
61:1	1
The	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
is	1
upon	1
me;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
anointed	1
me	1
to	1
preach	1
good	1
tidings	1
unto	1
the	1
meek;	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
bind	1
up	1
the	1
brokenhearted,	1
to	1
proclaim	1
liberty	1
to	1
the	1
captives,	1
and	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
bound;	1
61:2	1
To	1
proclaim	1
the	1
acceptable	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
vengeance	1
of	1
our	1
God;	1
to	1
comfort	1
all	1
that	1
mourn;	1
61:3	1
To	1
appoint	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
mourn	1
in	1
Zion,	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
beauty	1
for	1
ashes,	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
joy	1
for	1
mourning,	1
the	1
garment	1
of	1
praise	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
heaviness;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
trees	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
the	1
planting	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
61:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
old	1
wastes,	1
they	1
shall	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
former	1
desolations,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
repair	1
the	1
waste	1
cities,	1
the	1
desolations	1
of	1
many	1
generations.	1
	1
61:5	1
And	1
strangers	1
shall	1
stand	1
and	1
feed	1
your	1
flocks,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
alien	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
plowmen	1
and	1
your	1
vinedressers.	1
	1
61:6	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
named	1
the	1
Priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
men	1
shall	1
call	1
you	1
the	1
Ministers	1
of	1
our	1
God:	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
glory	1
shall	1
ye	1
boast	1
yourselves.	1
	1
61:7	1
For	1
your	1
shame	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
double;	1
and	1
for	1
confusion	1
they	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
their	1
portion:	1
therefore	1
in	1
their	1
land	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
double:	1
everlasting	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
61:8	1
For	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
love	1
judgment,	1
I	1
hate	1
robbery	1
for	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
direct	1
their	1
work	1
in	1
truth,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
61:9	1
And	1
their	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
their	1
offspring	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
all	1
that	1
see	1
them	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
seed	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed.	1
	1
61:10	1
I	1
will	1
greatly	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
joyful	1
in	1
my	1
God;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
clothed	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
salvation,	1
he	1
hath	1
covered	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
robe	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
as	1
a	1
bridegroom	1
decketh	1
himself	1
with	1
ornaments,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
bride	1
adorneth	1
herself	1
with	1
her	1
jewels.	1
	1
61:11	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
earth	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
her	1
bud,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
garden	1
causeth	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
sown	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
spring	1
forth;	1
so	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
cause	1
righteousness	1
and	1
praise	1
to	1
spring	1
forth	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
62:1	1
For	1
Zion's	1
sake	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
hold	1
my	1
peace,	1
and	1
for	1
Jerusalem's	1
sake	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
rest,	1
until	1
the	1
righteousness	1
thereof	1
go	1
forth	1
as	1
brightness,	1
and	1
the	1
salvation	1
thereof	1
as	1
a	1
lamp	1
that	1
burneth.	1
	1
62:2	1
And	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
see	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
all	1
kings	1
thy	1
glory:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
name,	1
which	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
name.	1
	1
62:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
be	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
a	1
royal	1
diadem	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
62:4	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
termed	1
Forsaken;	1
neither	1
shall	1
thy	1
land	1
any	1
more	1
be	1
termed	1
Desolate:	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
Hephzibah,	1
and	1
thy	1
land	1
Beulah:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
delighteth	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
married.	1
	1
62:5	1
For	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
marrieth	1
a	1
virgin,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
sons	1
marry	1
thee:	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
rejoiceth	1
over	1
the	1
bride,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
God	1
rejoice	1
over	1
thee.	1
	1
62:6	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
watchmen	1
upon	1
thy	1
walls,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
shall	1
never	1
hold	1
their	1
peace	1
day	1
nor	1
night:	1
ye	1
that	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
keep	1
not	1
silence,	1
62:7	1
And	1
give	1
him	1
no	1
rest,	1
till	1
he	1
establish,	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
62:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
his	1
strength,	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
give	1
thy	1
corn	1
to	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
thine	1
enemies;	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
shall	1
not	1
drink	1
thy	1
wine,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
laboured:	1
62:9	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
gathered	1
it	1
shall	1
eat	1
it,	1
and	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
brought	1
it	1
together	1
shall	1
drink	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
my	1
holiness.	1
	1
62:10	1
Go	1
through,	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
gates;	1
prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
cast	1
up,	1
cast	1
up	1
the	1
highway;	1
gather	1
out	1
the	1
stones;	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
standard	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
62:11	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
proclaimed	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
Say	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
salvation	1
cometh;	1
behold,	1
his	1
reward	1
is	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
work	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
62:12	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
them,	1
The	1
holy	1
people,	1
The	1
redeemed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called,	1
Sought	1
out,	1
A	1
city	1
not	1
forsaken.	1
	1
63:1	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
Edom,	1
with	1
dyed	1
garments	1
from	1
Bozrah?	1
	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
glorious	1
in	1
his	1
apparel,	1
travelling	1
in	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
strength?	1
I	1
that	1
speak	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
mighty	1
to	1
save.	1
	1
63:2	1
Wherefore	1
art	1
thou	1
red	1
in	1
thine	1
apparel,	1
and	1
thy	1
garments	1
like	1
him	1
that	1
treadeth	1
in	1
the	1
winefat?	1
	1
63:3	1
I	1
have	1
trodden	1
the	1
winepress	1
alone;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
with	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
tread	1
them	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
trample	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
fury;	1
and	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
sprinkled	1
upon	1
my	1
garments,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stain	1
all	1
my	1
raiment.	1
	1
63:4	1
For	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
vengeance	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
my	1
redeemed	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
63:5	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
help;	1
and	1
I	1
wondered	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
uphold:	1
therefore	1
mine	1
own	1
arm	1
brought	1
salvation	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
my	1
fury,	1
it	1
upheld	1
me.	1
	1
63:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
tread	1
down	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
drunk	1
in	1
my	1
fury,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
down	1
their	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
63:7	1
I	1
will	1
mention	1
the	1
lovingkindnesses	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
goodness	1
toward	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
on	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
mercies,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
lovingkindnesses.	1
	1
63:8	1
For	1
he	1
said,	1
Surely	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
people,	1
children	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
lie:	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
their	1
Saviour.	1
	1
63:9	1
In	1
all	1
their	1
affliction	1
he	1
was	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
saved	1
them:	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
pity	1
he	1
redeemed	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
bare	1
them,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
63:10	1
But	1
they	1
rebelled,	1
and	1
vexed	1
his	1
holy	1
Spirit:	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
enemy,	1
and	1
he	1
fought	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
63:11	1
Then	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
Moses,	1
and	1
his	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
the	1
shepherd	1
of	1
his	1
flock?	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
put	1
his	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
within	1
him?	1
	1
63:12	1
That	1
led	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses	1
with	1
his	1
glorious	1
arm,	1
dividing	1
the	1
water	1
before	1
them,	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
an	1
everlasting	1
name?	1
	1
63:13	1
That	1
led	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
deep,	1
as	1
an	1
horse	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
stumble?	1
	1
63:14	1
As	1
a	1
beast	1
goeth	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
rest:	1
so	1
didst	1
thou	1
lead	1
thy	1
people,	1
to	1
make	1
thyself	1
a	1
glorious	1
name.	1
	1
63:15	1
Look	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
behold	1
from	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
thy	1
holiness	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
glory:	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
zeal	1
and	1
thy	1
strength,	1
the	1
sounding	1
of	1
thy	1
bowels	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
mercies	1
toward	1
me?	1
are	1
they	1
restrained?	1
	1
63:16	1
Doubtless	1
thou	1
art	1
our	1
father,	1
though	1
Abraham	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
Israel	1
acknowledge	1
us	1
not:	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
art	1
our	1
father,	1
our	1
redeemer;	1
thy	1
name	1
is	1
from	1
everlasting.	1
	1
63:17	1
O	1
LORD,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
made	1
us	1
to	1
err	1
from	1
thy	1
ways,	1
and	1
hardened	1
our	1
heart	1
from	1
thy	1
fear?	1
Return	1
for	1
thy	1
servants'	1
sake,	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
thine	1
inheritance.	1
	1
63:18	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
thy	1
holiness	1
have	1
possessed	1
it	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
while:	1
our	1
adversaries	1
have	1
trodden	1
down	1
thy	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
63:19	1
We	1
are	1
thine:	1
thou	1
never	1
barest	1
rule	1
over	1
them;	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
64:1	1
Oh	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
rend	1
the	1
heavens,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
come	1
down,	1
that	1
the	1
mountains	1
might	1
flow	1
down	1
at	1
thy	1
presence,	1
64:2	1
As	1
when	1
the	1
melting	1
fire	1
burneth,	1
the	1
fire	1
causeth	1
the	1
waters	1
to	1
boil,	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
name	1
known	1
to	1
thine	1
adversaries,	1
that	1
the	1
nations	1
may	1
tremble	1
at	1
thy	1
presence!	1
	1
64:3	1
When	1
thou	1
didst	1
terrible	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
looked	1
not	1
for,	1
thou	1
camest	1
down,	1
the	1
mountains	1
flowed	1
down	1
at	1
thy	1
presence.	1
	1
64:4	1
For	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
men	1
have	1
not	1
heard,	1
nor	1
perceived	1
by	1
the	1
ear,	1
neither	1
hath	1
the	1
eye	1
seen,	1
O	1
God,	1
beside	1
thee,	1
what	1
he	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
waiteth	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
64:5	1
Thou	1
meetest	1
him	1
that	1
rejoiceth	1
and	1
worketh	1
righteousness,	1
those	1
that	1
remember	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
ways:	1
behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
wroth;	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
sinned:	1
in	1
those	1
is	1
continuance,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
64:6	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
as	1
an	1
unclean	1
thing,	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
righteousnesses	1
are	1
as	1
filthy	1
rags;	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
do	1
fade	1
as	1
a	1
leaf;	1
and	1
our	1
iniquities,	1
like	1
the	1
wind,	1
have	1
taken	1
us	1
away.	1
	1
64:7	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
calleth	1
upon	1
thy	1
name,	1
that	1
stirreth	1
up	1
himself	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
thy	1
face	1
from	1
us,	1
and	1
hast	1
consumed	1
us,	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
iniquities.	1
	1
64:8	1
But	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
art	1
our	1
father;	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
clay,	1
and	1
thou	1
our	1
potter;	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
are	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thy	1
hand.	1
	1
64:9	1
Be	1
not	1
wroth	1
very	1
sore,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
remember	1
iniquity	1
for	1
ever:	1
behold,	1
see,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
64:10	1
Thy	1
holy	1
cities	1
are	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
Zion	1
is	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
desolation.	1
	1
64:11	1
Our	1
holy	1
and	1
our	1
beautiful	1
house,	1
where	1
our	1
fathers	1
praised	1
thee,	1
is	1
burned	1
up	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
pleasant	1
things	1
are	1
laid	1
waste.	1
	1
64:12	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
refrain	1
thyself	1
for	1
these	1
things,	1
O	1
LORD?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
afflict	1
us	1
very	1
sore?	1
	1
65:1	1
I	1
am	1
sought	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
asked	1
not	1
for	1
me;	1
I	1
am	1
found	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sought	1
me	1
not:	1
I	1
said,	1
Behold	1
me,	1
behold	1
me,	1
unto	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
65:2	1
I	1
have	1
spread	1
out	1
my	1
hands	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
unto	1
a	1
rebellious	1
people,	1
which	1
walketh	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
good,	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
thoughts;	1
65:3	1
A	1
people	1
that	1
provoketh	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
continually	1
to	1
my	1
face;	1
that	1
sacrificeth	1
in	1
gardens,	1
and	1
burneth	1
incense	1
upon	1
altars	1
of	1
brick;	1
65:4	1
Which	1
remain	1
among	1
the	1
graves,	1
and	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
monuments,	1
which	1
eat	1
swine's	1
flesh,	1
and	1
broth	1
of	1
abominable	1
things	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
vessels;	1
65:5	1
Which	1
say,	1
Stand	1
by	1
thyself,	1
come	1
not	1
near	1
to	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holier	1
than	1
thou.	1
These	1
are	1
a	1
smoke	1
in	1
my	1
nose,	1
a	1
fire	1
that	1
burneth	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
65:6	1
Behold,	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
before	1
me:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
silence,	1
but	1
will	1
recompense,	1
even	1
recompense	1
into	1
their	1
bosom,	1
65:7	1
Your	1
iniquities,	1
and	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
blasphemed	1
me	1
upon	1
the	1
hills:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
measure	1
their	1
former	1
work	1
into	1
their	1
bosom.	1
	1
65:8	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
As	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
cluster,	1
and	1
one	1
saith,	1
Destroy	1
it	1
not;	1
for	1
a	1
blessing	1
is	1
in	1
it:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
my	1
servants'	1
sakes,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
destroy	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
65:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
seed	1
out	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Judah	1
an	1
inheritor	1
of	1
my	1
mountains:	1
and	1
mine	1
elect	1
shall	1
inherit	1
it,	1
and	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
dwell	1
there.	1
	1
65:10	1
And	1
Sharon	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fold	1
of	1
flocks,	1
and	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Achor	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
herds	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
in,	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
have	1
sought	1
me.	1
	1
65:11	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
forsake	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
forget	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
that	1
prepare	1
a	1
table	1
for	1
that	1
troop,	1
and	1
that	1
furnish	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
unto	1
that	1
number.	1
	1
65:12	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
number	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter:	1
because	1
when	1
I	1
called,	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
answer;	1
when	1
I	1
spake,	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
hear;	1
but	1
did	1
evil	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
did	1
choose	1
that	1
wherein	1
I	1
delighted	1
not.	1
	1
65:13	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
eat,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hungry:	1
behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
drink,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
thirsty:	1
behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
65:14	1
Behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
sing	1
for	1
joy	1
of	1
heart,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
cry	1
for	1
sorrow	1
of	1
heart,	1
and	1
shall	1
howl	1
for	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
65:15	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
leave	1
your	1
name	1
for	1
a	1
curse	1
unto	1
my	1
chosen:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shall	1
slay	1
thee,	1
and	1
call	1
his	1
servants	1
by	1
another	1
name:	1
65:16	1
That	1
he	1
who	1
blesseth	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
bless	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
truth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sweareth	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
truth;	1
because	1
the	1
former	1
troubles	1
are	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
65:17	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
create	1
new	1
heavens	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
former	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
remembered,	1
nor	1
come	1
into	1
mind.	1
	1
65:18	1
But	1
be	1
ye	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
create:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
create	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
rejoicing,	1
and	1
her	1
people	1
a	1
joy.	1
	1
65:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
joy	1
in	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
weeping	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
heard	1
in	1
her,	1
nor	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
crying.	1
	1
65:20	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
thence	1
an	1
infant	1
of	1
days,	1
nor	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
filled	1
his	1
days:	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
die	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old;	1
but	1
the	1
sinner	1
being	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old	1
shall	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
65:21	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
build	1
houses,	1
and	1
inhabit	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
65:22	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
build,	1
and	1
another	1
inhabit;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
plant,	1
and	1
another	1
eat:	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
are	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
mine	1
elect	1
shall	1
long	1
enjoy	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
65:23	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
labour	1
in	1
vain,	1
nor	1
bring	1
forth	1
for	1
trouble;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
offspring	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
65:24	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
before	1
they	1
call,	1
I	1
will	1
answer;	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
yet	1
speaking,	1
I	1
will	1
hear.	1
	1
65:25	1
The	1
wolf	1
and	1
the	1
lamb	1
shall	1
feed	1
together,	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
shall	1
eat	1
straw	1
like	1
the	1
bullock:	1
and	1
dust	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
serpent's	1
meat.	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
nor	1
destroy	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
heaven	1
is	1
my	1
throne,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
my	1
footstool:	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
ye	1
build	1
unto	1
me?	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
rest?	1
	1
66:2	1
For	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
hath	1
mine	1
hand	1
made,	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
have	1
been,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
to	1
this	1
man	1
will	1
I	1
look,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
poor	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
contrite	1
spirit,	1
and	1
trembleth	1
at	1
my	1
word.	1
	1
66:3	1
He	1
that	1
killeth	1
an	1
ox	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
slew	1
a	1
man;	1
he	1
that	1
sacrificeth	1
a	1
lamb,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
cut	1
off	1
a	1
dog's	1
neck;	1
he	1
that	1
offereth	1
an	1
oblation,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
offered	1
swine's	1
blood;	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
incense,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
blessed	1
an	1
idol.	1
	1
Yea,	1
they	1
have	1
chosen	1
their	1
own	1
ways,	1
and	1
their	1
soul	1
delighteth	1
in	1
their	1
abominations.	1
	1
66:4	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
choose	1
their	1
delusions,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
their	1
fears	1
upon	1
them;	1
because	1
when	1
I	1
called,	1
none	1
did	1
answer;	1
when	1
I	1
spake,	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hear:	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
evil	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
chose	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
delighted	1
not.	1
	1
66:5	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
that	1
tremble	1
at	1
his	1
word;	1
Your	1
brethren	1
that	1
hated	1
you,	1
that	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
glorified:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
appear	1
to	1
your	1
joy,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
66:6	1
A	1
voice	1
of	1
noise	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
temple,	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
rendereth	1
recompence	1
to	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
66:7	1
Before	1
she	1
travailed,	1
she	1
brought	1
forth;	1
before	1
her	1
pain	1
came,	1
she	1
was	1
delivered	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
child.	1
	1
66:8	1
Who	1
hath	1
heard	1
such	1
a	1
thing?	1
who	1
hath	1
seen	1
such	1
things?	1
Shall	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
in	1
one	1
day?	1
or	1
shall	1
a	1
nation	1
be	1
born	1
at	1
once?	1
	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Zion	1
travailed,	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
66:9	1
Shall	1
I	1
bring	1
to	1
the	1
birth,	1
and	1
not	1
cause	1
to	1
bring	1
forth?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
shall	1
I	1
cause	1
to	1
bring	1
forth,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
womb?	1
saith	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
66:10	1
Rejoice	1
ye	1
with	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
be	1
glad	1
with	1
her,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
love	1
her:	1
rejoice	1
for	1
joy	1
with	1
her,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
mourn	1
for	1
her:	1
66:11	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
suck,	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
breasts	1
of	1
her	1
consolations;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
milk	1
out,	1
and	1
be	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
her	1
glory.	1
	1
66:12	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
extend	1
peace	1
to	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
like	1
a	1
flowing	1
stream:	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
suck,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
borne	1
upon	1
her	1
sides,	1
and	1
be	1
dandled	1
upon	1
her	1
knees.	1
	1
66:13	1
As	1
one	1
whom	1
his	1
mother	1
comforteth,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
comfort	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
comforted	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
66:14	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
this,	1
your	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
your	1
bones	1
shall	1
flourish	1
like	1
an	1
herb:	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
toward	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
his	1
indignation	1
toward	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
66:15	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
chariots	1
like	1
a	1
whirlwind,	1
to	1
render	1
his	1
anger	1
with	1
fury,	1
and	1
his	1
rebuke	1
with	1
flames	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
66:16	1
For	1
by	1
fire	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
sword	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
plead	1
with	1
all	1
flesh:	1
and	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
many.	1
	1
66:17	1
They	1
that	1
sanctify	1
themselves,	1
and	1
purify	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
gardens	1
behind	1
one	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
eating	1
swine's	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
abomination,	1
and	1
the	1
mouse,	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:18	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
works	1
and	1
their	1
thoughts:	1
it	1
shall	1
come,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
nations	1
and	1
tongues;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
66:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
sign	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
those	1
that	1
escape	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
nations,	1
to	1
Tarshish,	1
Pul,	1
and	1
Lud,	1
that	1
draw	1
the	1
bow,	1
to	1
Tubal,	1
and	1
Javan,	1
to	1
the	1
isles	1
afar	1
off,	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
my	1
fame,	1
neither	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
glory;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
declare	1
my	1
glory	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
66:20	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
all	1
your	1
brethren	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
upon	1
horses,	1
and	1
in	1
chariots,	1
and	1
in	1
litters,	1
and	1
upon	1
mules,	1
and	1
upon	1
swift	1
beasts,	1
to	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain	1
Jerusalem,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
bring	1
an	1
offering	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
vessel	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
take	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
priests	1
and	1
for	1
Levites,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:22	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
new	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
earth,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
make,	1
shall	1
remain	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
so	1
shall	1
your	1
seed	1
and	1
your	1
name	1
remain.	1
	1
66:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
from	1
one	1
new	1
moon	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
from	1
one	1
sabbath	1
to	1
another,	1
shall	1
all	1
flesh	1
come	1
to	1
worship	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:24	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
their	1
worm	1
shall	1
not	1
die,	1
neither	1
shall	1
their	1
fire	1
be	1
quenched;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abhorring	1
unto	1
all	1
flesh.	1

	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Anathoth	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
1:2	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amon	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
in	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
	1
1:3	1
It	1
came	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
unto	1
the	1
carrying	1
away	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
captive	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month.	1
	1
1:4	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
1:5	1
Before	1
I	1
formed	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
belly	1
I	1
knew	1
thee;	1
and	1
before	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
womb	1
I	1
sanctified	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
ordained	1
thee	1
a	1
prophet	1
unto	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
1:6	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Ah,	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
behold,	1
I	1
cannot	1
speak:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
1:7	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Say	1
not,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
child:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
thee,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak.	1
	1
1:8	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
faces:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
my	1
mouth.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
1:10	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
day	1
set	1
thee	1
over	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
kingdoms,	1
to	1
root	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
pull	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy,	1
and	1
to	1
throw	1
down,	1
to	1
build,	1
and	1
to	1
plant.	1
	1
1:11	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Jeremiah,	1
what	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
an	1
almond	1
tree.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
well	1
seen:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
hasten	1
my	1
word	1
to	1
perform	1
it.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
saying,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
seething	1
pot;	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
thereof	1
is	1
toward	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
1:14	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
an	1
evil	1
shall	1
break	1
forth	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
1:15	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
set	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
throne	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
utter	1
my	1
judgments	1
against	1
them	1
touching	1
all	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
who	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
1:17	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
gird	1
up	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
arise,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee:	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed	1
at	1
their	1
faces,	1
lest	1
I	1
confound	1
thee	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
1:18	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
a	1
defenced	1
city,	1
and	1
an	1
iron	1
pillar,	1
and	1
brasen	1
walls	1
against	1
the	1
whole	1
land,	1
against	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
against	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof,	1
against	1
the	1
priests	1
thereof,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fight	1
against	1
thee;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
thee;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee.	1
	1
2:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
2:2	1
Go	1
and	1
cry	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
remember	1
thee,	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
thine	1
espousals,	1
when	1
thou	1
wentest	1
after	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
sown.	1
	1
2:3	1
Israel	1
was	1
holiness	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
his	1
increase:	1
all	1
that	1
devour	1
him	1
shall	1
offend;	1
evil	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:4	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
2:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
What	1
iniquity	1
have	1
your	1
fathers	1
found	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
walked	1
after	1
vanity,	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
vain?	1
	1
2:6	1
Neither	1
said	1
they,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
led	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
through	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
deserts	1
and	1
of	1
pits,	1
through	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
drought,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
through	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
passed	1
through,	1
and	1
where	1
no	1
man	1
dwelt?	1
2:7	1
And	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
into	1
a	1
plentiful	1
country,	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
goodness	1
thereof;	1
but	1
when	1
ye	1
entered,	1
ye	1
defiled	1
my	1
land,	1
and	1
made	1
mine	1
heritage	1
an	1
abomination.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
priests	1
said	1
not,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
LORD?	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
handle	1
the	1
law	1
knew	1
me	1
not:	1
the	1
pastors	1
also	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
prophesied	1
by	1
Baal,	1
and	1
walked	1
after	1
things	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
profit.	1
	1
2:9	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
yet	1
plead	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
children's	1
children	1
will	1
I	1
plead.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
Chittim,	1
and	1
see;	1
and	1
send	1
unto	1
Kedar,	1
and	1
consider	1
diligently,	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
thing.	1
	1
2:11	1
Hath	1
a	1
nation	1
changed	1
their	1
gods,	1
which	1
are	1
yet	1
no	1
gods?	1
but	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
changed	1
their	1
glory	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
doth	1
not	1
profit.	1
	1
2:12	1
Be	1
astonished,	1
O	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
at	1
this,	1
and	1
be	1
horribly	1
afraid,	1
be	1
ye	1
very	1
desolate,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
committed	1
two	1
evils;	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
living	1
waters,	1
and	1
hewed	1
them	1
out	1
cisterns,	1
broken	1
cisterns,	1
that	1
can	1
hold	1
no	1
water.	1
	1
2:14	1
Is	1
Israel	1
a	1
servant?	1
is	1
he	1
a	1
homeborn	1
slave?	1
why	1
is	1
he	1
spoiled?	1
2:15	1
The	1
young	1
lions	1
roared	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
yelled,	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
his	1
land	1
waste:	1
his	1
cities	1
are	1
burned	1
without	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
2:16	1
Also	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Noph	1
and	1
Tahapanes	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
thy	1
head.	1
	1
2:17	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
procured	1
this	1
unto	1
thyself,	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
when	1
he	1
led	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
now	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sihor?	1
or	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river?	1
	1
2:19	1
Thine	1
own	1
wickedness	1
shall	1
correct	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
backslidings	1
shall	1
reprove	1
thee:	1
know	1
therefore	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
thing	1
and	1
bitter,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
fear	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
thy	1
yoke,	1
and	1
burst	1
thy	1
bands;	1
and	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
transgress;	1
when	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
hill	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree	1
thou	1
wanderest,	1
playing	1
the	1
harlot.	1
	1
2:21	1
Yet	1
I	1
had	1
planted	1
thee	1
a	1
noble	1
vine,	1
wholly	1
a	1
right	1
seed:	1
how	1
then	1
art	1
thou	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
degenerate	1
plant	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
vine	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
2:22	1
For	1
though	1
thou	1
wash	1
thee	1
with	1
nitre,	1
and	1
take	1
thee	1
much	1
soap,	1
yet	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
is	1
marked	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
2:23	1
How	1
canst	1
thou	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
polluted,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
gone	1
after	1
Baalim?	1
	1
see	1
thy	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
know	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
done:	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
swift	1
dromedary	1
traversing	1
her	1
ways;	1
2:24	1
A	1
wild	1
ass	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
snuffeth	1
up	1
the	1
wind	1
at	1
her	1
pleasure;	1
in	1
her	1
occasion	1
who	1
can	1
turn	1
her	1
away?	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
her	1
will	1
not	1
weary	1
themselves;	1
in	1
her	1
month	1
they	1
shall	1
find	1
her.	1
	1
2:25	1
Withhold	1
thy	1
foot	1
from	1
being	1
unshod,	1
and	1
thy	1
throat	1
from	1
thirst:	1
but	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
hope:	1
no;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
strangers,	1
and	1
after	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
2:26	1
As	1
the	1
thief	1
is	1
ashamed	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
found,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
ashamed;	1
they,	1
their	1
kings,	1
their	1
princes,	1
and	1
their	1
priests,	1
and	1
their	1
prophets.	1
	1
2:27	1
Saying	1
to	1
a	1
stock,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
father;	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
stone,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
me	1
forth:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
turned	1
their	1
back	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
their	1
face:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
trouble	1
they	1
will	1
say,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
save	1
us.	1
	1
2:28	1
But	1
where	1
are	1
thy	1
gods	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
thee?	1
let	1
them	1
arise,	1
if	1
they	1
can	1
save	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thy	1
trouble:	1
for	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thy	1
cities	1
are	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Judah.	1
	1
2:29	1
Wherefore	1
will	1
ye	1
plead	1
with	1
me?	1
ye	1
all	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:30	1
In	1
vain	1
have	1
I	1
smitten	1
your	1
children;	1
they	1
received	1
no	1
correction:	1
your	1
own	1
sword	1
hath	1
devoured	1
your	1
prophets,	1
like	1
a	1
destroying	1
lion.	1
	1
2:31	1
O	1
generation,	1
see	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Have	1
I	1
been	1
a	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
Israel?	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
darkness?	1
wherefore	1
say	1
my	1
people,	1
We	1
are	1
lords;	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
no	1
more	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
2:32	1
Can	1
a	1
maid	1
forget	1
her	1
ornaments,	1
or	1
a	1
bride	1
her	1
attire?	1
yet	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
forgotten	1
me	1
days	1
without	1
number.	1
	1
2:33	1
Why	1
trimmest	1
thou	1
thy	1
way	1
to	1
seek	1
love?	1
therefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
also	1
taught	1
the	1
wicked	1
ones	1
thy	1
ways.	1
	1
2:34	1
Also	1
in	1
thy	1
skirts	1
is	1
found	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
innocents:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
it	1
by	1
secret	1
search,	1
but	1
upon	1
all	1
these.	1
	1
2:35	1
Yet	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
innocent,	1
surely	1
his	1
anger	1
shall	1
turn	1
from	1
me.	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sinned.	1
	1
2:36	1
Why	1
gaddest	1
thou	1
about	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
change	1
thy	1
way?	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
as	1
thou	1
wast	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
2:37	1
Yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
thine	1
hands	1
upon	1
thine	1
head:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rejected	1
thy	1
confidences,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
prosper	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:1	1
They	1
say,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
she	1
go	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
become	1
another	1
man's,	1
shall	1
he	1
return	1
unto	1
her	1
again?	1
shall	1
not	1
that	1
land	1
be	1
greatly	1
polluted?	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
played	1
the	1
harlot	1
with	1
many	1
lovers;	1
yet	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:2	1
Lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
see	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
been	1
lien	1
with.	1
In	1
the	1
ways	1
hast	1
thou	1
sat	1
for	1
them,	1
as	1
the	1
Arabian	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
polluted	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
thy	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
wickedness.	1
	1
3:3	1
Therefore	1
the	1
showers	1
have	1
been	1
withholden,	1
and	1
there	1
hath	1
been	1
no	1
latter	1
rain;	1
and	1
thou	1
hadst	1
a	1
whore's	1
forehead,	1
thou	1
refusedst	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
3:4	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
cry	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
father,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
guide	1
of	1
my	1
youth?	1
	1
3:5	1
Will	1
he	1
reserve	1
his	1
anger	1
for	1
ever?	1
will	1
he	1
keep	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
end?	1
	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
and	1
done	1
evil	1
things	1
as	1
thou	1
couldest.	1
	1
3:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
also	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
king,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
that	1
which	1
backsliding	1
Israel	1
hath	1
done?	1
she	1
is	1
gone	1
up	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
mountain	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree,	1
and	1
there	1
hath	1
played	1
the	1
harlot.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
Turn	1
thou	1
unto	1
me.	1
But	1
she	1
returned	1
not.	1
And	1
her	1
treacherous	1
sister	1
Judah	1
saw	1
it.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
when	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
causes	1
whereby	1
backsliding	1
Israel	1
committed	1
adultery	1
I	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
away,	1
and	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
divorce;	1
yet	1
her	1
treacherous	1
sister	1
Judah	1
feared	1
not,	1
but	1
went	1
and	1
played	1
the	1
harlot	1
also.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
lightness	1
of	1
her	1
whoredom,	1
that	1
she	1
defiled	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
committed	1
adultery	1
with	1
stones	1
and	1
with	1
stocks.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
her	1
treacherous	1
sister	1
Judah	1
hath	1
not	1
turned	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
heart,	1
but	1
feignedly,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
backsliding	1
Israel	1
hath	1
justified	1
herself	1
more	1
than	1
treacherous	1
Judah.	1
	1
3:12	1
Go	1
and	1
proclaim	1
these	1
words	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
say,	1
Return,	1
thou	1
backsliding	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
cause	1
mine	1
anger	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
merciful,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
anger	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
3:13	1
Only	1
acknowledge	1
thine	1
iniquity,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
transgressed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
hast	1
scattered	1
thy	1
ways	1
to	1
the	1
strangers	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:14	1
Turn,	1
O	1
backsliding	1
children,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
married	1
unto	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
a	1
family,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
Zion:	1
3:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
pastors	1
according	1
to	1
mine	1
heart,	1
which	1
shall	1
feed	1
you	1
with	1
knowledge	1
and	1
understanding.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
multiplied	1
and	1
increased	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
no	1
more,	1
The	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
mind:	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
remember	1
it;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
visit	1
it;	1
neither	1
shall	1
that	1
be	1
done	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
3:17	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
it,	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
walk	1
any	1
more	1
after	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
evil	1
heart.	1
	1
3:18	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
walk	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
3:19	1
But	1
I	1
said,	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
put	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
pleasant	1
land,	1
a	1
goodly	1
heritage	1
of	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
nations?	1
and	1
I	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
me,	1
My	1
father;	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
3:20	1
Surely	1
as	1
a	1
wife	1
treacherously	1
departeth	1
from	1
her	1
husband,	1
so	1
have	1
ye	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
with	1
me,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:21	1
A	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
weeping	1
and	1
supplications	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
perverted	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
Return,	1
ye	1
backsliding	1
children,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
your	1
backslidings.	1
	1
Behold,	1
we	1
come	1
unto	1
thee;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
3:23	1
Truly	1
in	1
vain	1
is	1
salvation	1
hoped	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
mountains:	1
truly	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:24	1
For	1
shame	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
from	1
our	1
youth;	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds,	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters.	1
	1
3:25	1
We	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
our	1
shame,	1
and	1
our	1
confusion	1
covereth	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
we	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
from	1
our	1
youth	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
4:1	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
return,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
return	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
put	1
away	1
thine	1
abominations	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
remove.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
swear,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
in	1
truth,	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
bless	1
themselves	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
they	1
glory.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
Break	1
up	1
your	1
fallow	1
ground,	1
and	1
sow	1
not	1
among	1
thorns.	1
	1
4:4	1
Circumcise	1
yourselves	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
foreskins	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
lest	1
my	1
fury	1
come	1
forth	1
like	1
fire,	1
and	1
burn	1
that	1
none	1
can	1
quench	1
it,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings.	1
	1
4:5	1
Declare	1
ye	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
publish	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
say,	1
Blow	1
ye	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
cry,	1
gather	1
together,	1
and	1
say,	1
Assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
defenced	1
cities.	1
	1
4:6	1
Set	1
up	1
the	1
standard	1
toward	1
Zion:	1
retire,	1
stay	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
destruction.	1
	1
4:7	1
The	1
lion	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
thicket,	1
and	1
the	1
destroyer	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
is	1
on	1
his	1
way;	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
forth	1
from	1
his	1
place	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
land	1
desolate;	1
and	1
thy	1
cities	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
waste,	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
this	1
gird	1
you	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
lament	1
and	1
howl:	1
for	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
princes;	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
shall	1
wonder.	1
	1
4:10	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Ah,	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
surely	1
thou	1
hast	1
greatly	1
deceived	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
peace;	1
whereas	1
the	1
sword	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
the	1
soul.	1
	1
4:11	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
A	1
dry	1
wind	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
toward	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
not	1
to	1
fan,	1
nor	1
to	1
cleanse,	1
4:12	1
Even	1
a	1
full	1
wind	1
from	1
those	1
places	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
now	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
sentence	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
4:13	1
Behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
as	1
clouds,	1
and	1
his	1
chariots	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
whirlwind:	1
his	1
horses	1
are	1
swifter	1
than	1
eagles.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
us!	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
spoiled.	1
	1
4:14	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
wash	1
thine	1
heart	1
from	1
wickedness,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
saved.	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
thy	1
vain	1
thoughts	1
lodge	1
within	1
thee?	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
a	1
voice	1
declareth	1
from	1
Dan,	1
and	1
publisheth	1
affliction	1
from	1
mount	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
4:16	1
Make	1
ye	1
mention	1
to	1
the	1
nations;	1
behold,	1
publish	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
watchers	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
and	1
give	1
out	1
their	1
voice	1
against	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
4:17	1
As	1
keepers	1
of	1
a	1
field,	1
are	1
they	1
against	1
her	1
round	1
about;	1
because	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
rebellious	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:18	1
Thy	1
way	1
and	1
thy	1
doings	1
have	1
procured	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
thee;	1
this	1
is	1
thy	1
wickedness,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
bitter,	1
because	1
it	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
4:19	1
My	1
bowels,	1
my	1
bowels!	1
I	1
am	1
pained	1
at	1
my	1
very	1
heart;	1
my	1
heart	1
maketh	1
a	1
noise	1
in	1
me;	1
I	1
cannot	1
hold	1
my	1
peace,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard,	1
O	1
my	1
soul,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
the	1
alarm	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
4:20	1
Destruction	1
upon	1
destruction	1
is	1
cried;	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
is	1
spoiled:	1
suddenly	1
are	1
my	1
tents	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
my	1
curtains	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
4:21	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
standard,	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
foolish,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
me;	1
they	1
are	1
sottish	1
children,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
none	1
understanding:	1
they	1
are	1
wise	1
to	1
do	1
evil,	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
knowledge.	1
	1
4:23	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
earth,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
form,	1
and	1
void;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
light.	1
	1
4:24	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
they	1
trembled,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hills	1
moved	1
lightly.	1
	1
4:25	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
fled.	1
	1
4:26	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
fruitful	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
were	1
broken	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
The	1
whole	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate;	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end.	1
	1
4:28	1
For	1
this	1
shall	1
the	1
earth	1
mourn,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
above	1
be	1
black;	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
I	1
have	1
purposed	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
repent,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
turn	1
back	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
4:29	1
The	1
whole	1
city	1
shall	1
flee	1
for	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
and	1
bowmen;	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
thickets,	1
and	1
climb	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
rocks:	1
every	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
spoiled,	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
do?	1
Though	1
thou	1
clothest	1
thyself	1
with	1
crimson,	1
though	1
thou	1
deckest	1
thee	1
with	1
ornaments	1
of	1
gold,	1
though	1
thou	1
rentest	1
thy	1
face	1
with	1
painting,	1
in	1
vain	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
thyself	1
fair;	1
thy	1
lovers	1
will	1
despise	1
thee,	1
they	1
will	1
seek	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
4:31	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail,	1
and	1
the	1
anguish	1
as	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
her	1
first	1
child,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
that	1
bewaileth	1
herself,	1
that	1
spreadeth	1
her	1
hands,	1
saying,	1
Woe	1
is	1
me	1
now!	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
wearied	1
because	1
of	1
murderers.	1
	1
5:1	1
Run	1
ye	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
see	1
now,	1
and	1
know,	1
and	1
seek	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
places	1
thereof,	1
if	1
ye	1
can	1
find	1
a	1
man,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
that	1
executeth	1
judgment,	1
that	1
seeketh	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pardon	1
it.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth;	1
surely	1
they	1
swear	1
falsely.	1
	1
5:3	1
O	1
LORD,	1
are	1
not	1
thine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
truth?	1
thou	1
hast	1
stricken	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
grieved;	1
thou	1
hast	1
consumed	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
refused	1
to	1
receive	1
correction:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
their	1
faces	1
harder	1
than	1
a	1
rock;	1
they	1
have	1
refused	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
5:4	1
Therefore	1
I	1
said,	1
Surely	1
these	1
are	1
poor;	1
they	1
are	1
foolish:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
men,	1
and	1
will	1
speak	1
unto	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
their	1
God:	1
but	1
these	1
have	1
altogether	1
broken	1
the	1
yoke,	1
and	1
burst	1
the	1
bonds.	1
	1
5:6	1
Wherefore	1
a	1
lion	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
shall	1
slay	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
wolf	1
of	1
the	1
evenings	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them,	1
a	1
leopard	1
shall	1
watch	1
over	1
their	1
cities:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
goeth	1
out	1
thence	1
shall	1
be	1
torn	1
in	1
pieces:	1
because	1
their	1
transgressions	1
are	1
many,	1
and	1
their	1
backslidings	1
are	1
increased.	1
	1
5:7	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
pardon	1
thee	1
for	1
this?	1
thy	1
children	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
sworn	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
no	1
gods:	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
fed	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
they	1
then	1
committed	1
adultery,	1
and	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
by	1
troops	1
in	1
the	1
harlots'	1
houses.	1
	1
5:8	1
They	1
were	1
as	1
fed	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
every	1
one	1
neighed	1
after	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife.	1
	1
5:9	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
visit	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
nation	1
as	1
this?	1
	1
5:10	1
Go	1
ye	1
up	1
upon	1
her	1
walls,	1
and	1
destroy;	1
but	1
make	1
not	1
a	1
full	1
end:	1
take	1
away	1
her	1
battlements;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
5:11	1
For	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
dealt	1
very	1
treacherously	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:12	1
They	1
have	1
belied	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
he;	1
neither	1
shall	1
evil	1
come	1
upon	1
us;	1
neither	1
shall	1
we	1
see	1
sword	1
nor	1
famine:	1
5:13	1
And	1
the	1
prophets	1
shall	1
become	1
wind,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
them:	1
thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
5:14	1
Wherefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Because	1
ye	1
speak	1
this	1
word,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth	1
fire,	1
and	1
this	1
people	1
wood,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
them.	1
	1
5:15	1
Lo,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
a	1
nation	1
upon	1
you	1
from	1
far,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
nation,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
ancient	1
nation,	1
a	1
nation	1
whose	1
language	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not,	1
neither	1
understandest	1
what	1
they	1
say.	1
	1
5:16	1
Their	1
quiver	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
open	1
sepulchre,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
thine	1
harvest,	1
and	1
thy	1
bread,	1
which	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
should	1
eat:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
thy	1
flocks	1
and	1
thine	1
herds:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
thy	1
vines	1
and	1
thy	1
fig	1
trees:	1
they	1
shall	1
impoverish	1
thy	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
trustedst,	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
5:18	1
Nevertheless	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Wherefore	1
doeth	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
us?	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
answer	1
them,	1
Like	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
served	1
strange	1
gods	1
in	1
your	1
land,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
serve	1
strangers	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
your's.	1
	1
5:20	1
Declare	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
publish	1
it	1
in	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
5:21	1
Hear	1
now	1
this,	1
O	1
foolish	1
people,	1
and	1
without	1
understanding;	1
which	1
have	1
eyes,	1
and	1
see	1
not;	1
which	1
have	1
ears,	1
and	1
hear	1
not:	1
5:22	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
will	1
ye	1
not	1
tremble	1
at	1
my	1
presence,	1
which	1
have	1
placed	1
the	1
sand	1
for	1
the	1
bound	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
a	1
perpetual	1
decree,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
pass	1
it:	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
waves	1
thereof	1
toss	1
themselves,	1
yet	1
can	1
they	1
not	1
prevail;	1
though	1
they	1
roar,	1
yet	1
can	1
they	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
it?	1
	1
5:23	1
But	1
this	1
people	1
hath	1
a	1
revolting	1
and	1
a	1
rebellious	1
heart;	1
they	1
are	1
revolted	1
and	1
gone.	1
	1
5:24	1
Neither	1
say	1
they	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
that	1
giveth	1
rain,	1
both	1
the	1
former	1
and	1
the	1
latter,	1
in	1
his	1
season:	1
he	1
reserveth	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
appointed	1
weeks	1
of	1
the	1
harvest.	1
	1
5:25	1
Your	1
iniquities	1
have	1
turned	1
away	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
your	1
sins	1
have	1
withholden	1
good	1
things	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
5:26	1
For	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
found	1
wicked	1
men:	1
they	1
lay	1
wait,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
setteth	1
snares;	1
they	1
set	1
a	1
trap,	1
they	1
catch	1
men.	1
	1
5:27	1
As	1
a	1
cage	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
birds,	1
so	1
are	1
their	1
houses	1
full	1
of	1
deceit:	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
become	1
great,	1
and	1
waxen	1
rich.	1
	1
5:28	1
They	1
are	1
waxen	1
fat,	1
they	1
shine:	1
yea,	1
they	1
overpass	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
they	1
judge	1
not	1
the	1
cause,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
yet	1
they	1
prosper;	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
needy	1
do	1
they	1
not	1
judge.	1
	1
5:29	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
visit	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
shall	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
nation	1
as	1
this?	1
	1
5:30	1
A	1
wonderful	1
and	1
horrible	1
thing	1
is	1
committed	1
in	1
the	1
land;	1
5:31	1
The	1
prophets	1
prophesy	1
falsely,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
bear	1
rule	1
by	1
their	1
means;	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
love	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
so:	1
and	1
what	1
will	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
thereof?	1
	1
6:1	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
to	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
blow	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Tekoa,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
Bethhaccerem:	1
for	1
evil	1
appeareth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
great	1
destruction.	1
	1
6:2	1
I	1
have	1
likened	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion	1
to	1
a	1
comely	1
and	1
delicate	1
woman.	1
	1
6:3	1
The	1
shepherds	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
her;	1
they	1
shall	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
against	1
her	1
round	1
about;	1
they	1
shall	1
feed	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
6:4	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
war	1
against	1
her;	1
arise,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
at	1
noon.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
us!	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
goeth	1
away,	1
for	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
are	1
stretched	1
out.	1
	1
6:5	1
Arise,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
destroy	1
her	1
palaces.	1
	1
6:6	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
said,	1
Hew	1
ye	1
down	1
trees,	1
and	1
cast	1
a	1
mount	1
against	1
Jerusalem:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
be	1
visited;	1
she	1
is	1
wholly	1
oppression	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
6:7	1
As	1
a	1
fountain	1
casteth	1
out	1
her	1
waters,	1
so	1
she	1
casteth	1
out	1
her	1
wickedness:	1
violence	1
and	1
spoil	1
is	1
heard	1
in	1
her;	1
before	1
me	1
continually	1
is	1
grief	1
and	1
wounds.	1
	1
6:8	1
Be	1
thou	1
instructed,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
lest	1
my	1
soul	1
depart	1
from	1
thee;	1
lest	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
desolate,	1
a	1
land	1
not	1
inhabited.	1
	1
6:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
They	1
shall	1
throughly	1
glean	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel	1
as	1
a	1
vine:	1
turn	1
back	1
thine	1
hand	1
as	1
a	1
grapegatherer	1
into	1
the	1
baskets.	1
	1
6:10	1
To	1
whom	1
shall	1
I	1
speak,	1
and	1
give	1
warning,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
hear?	1
behold,	1
their	1
ear	1
is	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
they	1
cannot	1
hearken:	1
behold,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
unto	1
them	1
a	1
reproach;	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
delight	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
6:11	1
Therefore	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
with	1
holding	1
in:	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
abroad,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
together:	1
for	1
even	1
the	1
husband	1
with	1
the	1
wife	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
the	1
aged	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
days.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
others,	1
with	1
their	1
fields	1
and	1
wives	1
together:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
them	1
every	1
one	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
covetousness;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
prophet	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
every	1
one	1
dealeth	1
falsely.	1
	1
6:14	1
They	1
have	1
healed	1
also	1
the	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
slightly,	1
saying,	1
Peace,	1
peace;	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
peace.	1
	1
6:15	1
Were	1
they	1
ashamed	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
committed	1
abomination?	1
nay,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
ashamed,	1
neither	1
could	1
they	1
blush:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
fall:	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
visit	1
them	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
down,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Stand	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
ways,	1
and	1
see,	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
paths,	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
good	1
way,	1
and	1
walk	1
therein,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
rest	1
for	1
your	1
souls.	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
walk	1
therein.	1
	1
6:17	1
Also	1
I	1
set	1
watchmen	1
over	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Hearken	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet.	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
hearken.	1
	1
6:18	1
Therefore	1
hear,	1
ye	1
nations,	1
and	1
know,	1
O	1
congregation,	1
what	1
is	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
6:19	1
Hear,	1
O	1
earth:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
this	1
people,	1
even	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
my	1
words,	1
nor	1
to	1
my	1
law,	1
but	1
rejected	1
it.	1
	1
6:20	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
cometh	1
there	1
to	1
me	1
incense	1
from	1
Sheba,	1
and	1
the	1
sweet	1
cane	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country?	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
are	1
not	1
acceptable,	1
nor	1
your	1
sacrifices	1
sweet	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
6:21	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
stumblingblocks	1
before	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
fathers	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
together	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
them;	1
the	1
neighbour	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
6:22	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
a	1
people	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
country,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
nation	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:23	1
They	1
shall	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
bow	1
and	1
spear;	1
they	1
are	1
cruel,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
mercy;	1
their	1
voice	1
roareth	1
like	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
they	1
ride	1
upon	1
horses,	1
set	1
in	1
array	1
as	1
men	1
for	1
war	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
6:24	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
fame	1
thereof:	1
our	1
hands	1
wax	1
feeble:	1
anguish	1
hath	1
taken	1
hold	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
pain,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail.	1
	1
6:25	1
Go	1
not	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
nor	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
way;	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
fear	1
is	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
6:26	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
gird	1
thee	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
wallow	1
thyself	1
in	1
ashes:	1
make	1
thee	1
mourning,	1
as	1
for	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
most	1
bitter	1
lamentation:	1
for	1
the	1
spoiler	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
come	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
6:27	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
tower	1
and	1
a	1
fortress	1
among	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
and	1
try	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
6:28	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
grievous	1
revolters,	1
walking	1
with	1
slanders:	1
they	1
are	1
brass	1
and	1
iron;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
corrupters.	1
	1
6:29	1
The	1
bellows	1
are	1
burned,	1
the	1
lead	1
is	1
consumed	1
of	1
the	1
fire;	1
the	1
founder	1
melteth	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
not	1
plucked	1
away.	1
	1
6:30	1
Reprobate	1
silver	1
shall	1
men	1
call	1
them,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rejected	1
them.	1
	1
7:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
7:2	1
Stand	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
there	1
this	1
word,	1
and	1
say,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
these	1
gates	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Amend	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
your	1
doings,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
7:4	1
Trust	1
ye	1
not	1
in	1
lying	1
words,	1
saying,	1
The	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
are	1
these.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
throughly	1
amend	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
your	1
doings;	1
if	1
ye	1
throughly	1
execute	1
judgment	1
between	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
7:6	1
If	1
ye	1
oppress	1
not	1
the	1
stranger,	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
the	1
widow,	1
and	1
shed	1
not	1
innocent	1
blood	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
neither	1
walk	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
your	1
hurt:	1
7:7	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
your	1
fathers,	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
7:8	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
trust	1
in	1
lying	1
words,	1
that	1
cannot	1
profit.	1
	1
7:9	1
Will	1
ye	1
steal,	1
murder,	1
and	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
and	1
swear	1
falsely,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
Baal,	1
and	1
walk	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not;	1
7:10	1
And	1
come	1
and	1
stand	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
say,	1
We	1
are	1
delivered	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
abominations?	1
	1
7:11	1
Is	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
become	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
robbers	1
in	1
your	1
eyes?	1
Behold,	1
even	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
go	1
ye	1
now	1
unto	1
my	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Shiloh,	1
where	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
name	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
did	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
now,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
works,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you,	1
rising	1
up	1
early	1
and	1
speaking,	1
but	1
ye	1
heard	1
not;	1
and	1
I	1
called	1
you,	1
but	1
ye	1
answered	1
not;	1
7:14	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
trust,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
fathers,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
Shiloh.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
cast	1
out	1
all	1
your	1
brethren,	1
even	1
the	1
whole	1
seed	1
of	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
7:16	1
Therefore	1
pray	1
not	1
thou	1
for	1
this	1
people,	1
neither	1
lift	1
up	1
cry	1
nor	1
prayer	1
for	1
them,	1
neither	1
make	1
intercession	1
to	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
thee.	1
	1
7:17	1
Seest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
they	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
7:18	1
The	1
children	1
gather	1
wood,	1
and	1
the	1
fathers	1
kindle	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
knead	1
their	1
dough,	1
to	1
make	1
cakes	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
7:19	1
Do	1
they	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
do	1
they	1
not	1
provoke	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
faces?	1
	1
7:20	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
mine	1
anger	1
and	1
my	1
fury	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
this	1
place,	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
burn,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched.	1
	1
7:21	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Put	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
your	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
eat	1
flesh.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
I	1
spake	1
not	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers,	1
nor	1
commanded	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
concerning	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
or	1
sacrifices:	1
7:23	1
But	1
this	1
thing	1
commanded	1
I	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Obey	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
walk	1
ye	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
ways	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
7:24	1
But	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear,	1
but	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
counsels	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
evil	1
heart,	1
and	1
went	1
backward,	1
and	1
not	1
forward.	1
	1
7:25	1
Since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
your	1
fathers	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
this	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
daily	1
rising	1
up	1
early	1
and	1
sending	1
them:	1
7:26	1
Yet	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
me,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear,	1
but	1
hardened	1
their	1
neck:	1
they	1
did	1
worse	1
than	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
7:27	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
thee:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
call	1
unto	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
answer	1
thee.	1
	1
7:28	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
obeyeth	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
nor	1
receiveth	1
correction:	1
truth	1
is	1
perished,	1
and	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
7:29	1
Cut	1
off	1
thine	1
hair,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
away,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
lamentation	1
on	1
high	1
places;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rejected	1
and	1
forsaken	1
the	1
generation	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
7:30	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
done	1
evil	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
they	1
have	1
set	1
their	1
abominations	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
to	1
pollute	1
it.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
built	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Tophet,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
to	1
burn	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them	1
not,	1
neither	1
came	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
7:32	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
Tophet,	1
nor	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
but	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
slaughter:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
bury	1
in	1
Tophet,	1
till	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
place.	1
	1
7:33	1
And	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
fray	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
7:34	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mirth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
gladness,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bride:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate.	1
	1
8:1	1
At	1
that	1
time,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
graves:	1
8:2	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
spread	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
loved,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
served,	1
and	1
after	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
walked,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
sought,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
worshipped:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
gathered,	1
nor	1
be	1
buried;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
death	1
shall	1
be	1
chosen	1
rather	1
than	1
life	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
remain	1
of	1
this	1
evil	1
family,	1
which	1
remain	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
8:4	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Shall	1
they	1
fall,	1
and	1
not	1
arise?	1
shall	1
he	1
turn	1
away,	1
and	1
not	1
return?	1
	1
8:5	1
Why	1
then	1
is	1
this	1
people	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
slidden	1
back	1
by	1
a	1
perpetual	1
backsliding?	1
they	1
hold	1
fast	1
deceit,	1
they	1
refuse	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
8:6	1
I	1
hearkened	1
and	1
heard,	1
but	1
they	1
spake	1
not	1
aright:	1
no	1
man	1
repented	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
wickedness,	1
saying,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
every	1
one	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
course,	1
as	1
the	1
horse	1
rusheth	1
into	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
8:7	1
Yea,	1
the	1
stork	1
in	1
the	1
heaven	1
knoweth	1
her	1
appointed	1
times;	1
and	1
the	1
turtle	1
and	1
the	1
crane	1
and	1
the	1
swallow	1
observe	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
coming;	1
but	1
my	1
people	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:8	1
How	1
do	1
ye	1
say,	1
We	1
are	1
wise,	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
us?	1
Lo,	1
certainly	1
in	1
vain	1
made	1
he	1
it;	1
the	1
pen	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
is	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
8:9	1
The	1
wise	1
men	1
are	1
ashamed,	1
they	1
are	1
dismayed	1
and	1
taken:	1
lo,	1
they	1
have	1
rejected	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
what	1
wisdom	1
is	1
in	1
them?	1
	1
8:10	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
their	1
wives	1
unto	1
others,	1
and	1
their	1
fields	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
shall	1
inherit	1
them:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
greatest	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
covetousness,	1
from	1
the	1
prophet	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
every	1
one	1
dealeth	1
falsely.	1
	1
8:11	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
healed	1
the	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
slightly,	1
saying,	1
Peace,	1
peace;	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
peace.	1
	1
8:12	1
Were	1
they	1
ashamed	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
committed	1
abomination?	1
nay,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
ashamed,	1
neither	1
could	1
they	1
blush:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
fall	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
fall:	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
visitation	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
down,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:13	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
consume	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
grapes	1
on	1
the	1
vine,	1
nor	1
figs	1
on	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
leaf	1
shall	1
fade;	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
8:14	1
Why	1
do	1
we	1
sit	1
still?	1
assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
defenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
silent	1
there:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
hath	1
put	1
us	1
to	1
silence,	1
and	1
given	1
us	1
water	1
of	1
gall	1
to	1
drink,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:15	1
We	1
looked	1
for	1
peace,	1
but	1
no	1
good	1
came;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
health,	1
and	1
behold	1
trouble!	1
	1
8:16	1
The	1
snorting	1
of	1
his	1
horses	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
Dan:	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
trembled	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
neighing	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
ones;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
come,	1
and	1
have	1
devoured	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
it;	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
8:17	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
serpents,	1
cockatrices,	1
among	1
you,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
charmed,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bite	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:18	1
When	1
I	1
would	1
comfort	1
myself	1
against	1
sorrow,	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
faint	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
8:19	1
Behold	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1
far	1
country:	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Zion?	1
is	1
not	1
her	1
king	1
in	1
her?	1
Why	1
have	1
they	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
their	1
graven	1
images,	1
and	1
with	1
strange	1
vanities?	1
	1
8:20	1
The	1
harvest	1
is	1
past,	1
the	1
summer	1
is	1
ended,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
saved.	1
	1
8:21	1
For	1
the	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
am	1
I	1
hurt;	1
I	1
am	1
black;	1
astonishment	1
hath	1
taken	1
hold	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
8:22	1
Is	1
there	1
no	1
balm	1
in	1
Gilead;	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
physician	1
there?	1
why	1
then	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
recovered?	1
	1
9:1	1
Oh	1
that	1
my	1
head	1
were	1
waters,	1
and	1
mine	1
eyes	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
tears,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
weep	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
for	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people!	1
	1
9:2	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
a	1
lodging	1
place	1
of	1
wayfaring	1
men;	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
leave	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
go	1
from	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
all	1
adulterers,	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
treacherous	1
men.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
they	1
bend	1
their	1
tongues	1
like	1
their	1
bow	1
for	1
lies:	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
valiant	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
they	1
proceed	1
from	1
evil	1
to	1
evil,	1
and	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:4	1
Take	1
ye	1
heed	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
trust	1
ye	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
brother:	1
for	1
every	1
brother	1
will	1
utterly	1
supplant,	1
and	1
every	1
neighbour	1
will	1
walk	1
with	1
slanders.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
deceive	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
the	1
truth:	1
they	1
have	1
taught	1
their	1
tongue	1
to	1
speak	1
lies,	1
and	1
weary	1
themselves	1
to	1
commit	1
iniquity.	1
	1
9:6	1
Thine	1
habitation	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
deceit;	1
through	1
deceit	1
they	1
refuse	1
to	1
know	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:7	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
melt	1
them,	1
and	1
try	1
them;	1
for	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people?	1
	1
9:8	1
Their	1
tongue	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
arrow	1
shot	1
out;	1
it	1
speaketh	1
deceit:	1
one	1
speaketh	1
peaceably	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour	1
with	1
his	1
mouth,	1
but	1
in	1
heart	1
he	1
layeth	1
his	1
wait.	1
	1
9:9	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
visit	1
them	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
shall	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
nation	1
as	1
this?	1
	1
9:10	1
For	1
the	1
mountains	1
will	1
I	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
a	1
lamentation,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
burned	1
up,	1
so	1
that	1
none	1
can	1
pass	1
through	1
them;	1
neither	1
can	1
men	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
cattle;	1
both	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
beast	1
are	1
fled;	1
they	1
are	1
gone.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
heaps,	1
and	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
dragons;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
desolate,	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
9:12	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
wise	1
man,	1
that	1
may	1
understand	1
this?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
declare	1
it,	1
for	1
what	1
the	1
land	1
perisheth	1
and	1
is	1
burned	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
none	1
passeth	1
through?	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
my	1
law	1
which	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice,	1
neither	1
walked	1
therein;	1
9:14	1
But	1
have	1
walked	1
after	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
after	1
Baalim,	1
which	1
their	1
fathers	1
taught	1
them:	1
9:15	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them,	1
even	1
this	1
people,	1
with	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
water	1
of	1
gall	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
9:16	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
them	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whom	1
neither	1
they	1
nor	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
known:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
sword	1
after	1
them,	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
consumed	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Consider	1
ye,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
mourning	1
women,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come;	1
and	1
send	1
for	1
cunning	1
women,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come:	1
9:18	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
make	1
haste,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
wailing	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
our	1
eyes	1
may	1
run	1
down	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
our	1
eyelids	1
gush	1
out	1
with	1
waters.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
wailing	1
is	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
Zion,	1
How	1
are	1
we	1
spoiled!	1
we	1
are	1
greatly	1
confounded,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
land,	1
because	1
our	1
dwellings	1
have	1
cast	1
us	1
out.	1
	1
9:20	1
Yet	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
ye	1
women,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
ear	1
receive	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
teach	1
your	1
daughters	1
wailing,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
her	1
neighbour	1
lamentation.	1
	1
9:21	1
For	1
death	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
our	1
windows,	1
and	1
is	1
entered	1
into	1
our	1
palaces,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
children	1
from	1
without,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
9:22	1
Speak,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Even	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
men	1
shall	1
fall	1
as	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
handful	1
after	1
the	1
harvestman,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
gather	1
them.	1
	1
9:23	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
wise	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
neither	1
let	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
might,	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
riches:	1
9:24	1
But	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
glorieth	1
glory	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
he	1
understandeth	1
and	1
knoweth	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
exercise	1
lovingkindness,	1
judgment,	1
and	1
righteousness,	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
delight,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:25	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
circumcised	1
with	1
the	1
uncircumcised;	1
9:26	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Edom,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
Moab,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
corners,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
nations	1
are	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
10:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
you,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
10:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Learn	1
not	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed	1
at	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
heaven;	1
for	1
the	1
heathen	1
are	1
dismayed	1
at	1
them.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
the	1
customs	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
vain:	1
for	1
one	1
cutteth	1
a	1
tree	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
workman,	1
with	1
the	1
axe.	1
	1
10:4	1
They	1
deck	1
it	1
with	1
silver	1
and	1
with	1
gold;	1
they	1
fasten	1
it	1
with	1
nails	1
and	1
with	1
hammers,	1
that	1
it	1
move	1
not.	1
	1
10:5	1
They	1
are	1
upright	1
as	1
the	1
palm	1
tree,	1
but	1
speak	1
not:	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
borne,	1
because	1
they	1
cannot	1
go.	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
cannot	1
do	1
evil,	1
neither	1
also	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
good.	1
	1
10:6	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
thou	1
art	1
great,	1
and	1
thy	1
name	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
might.	1
	1
10:7	1
Who	1
would	1
not	1
fear	1
thee,	1
O	1
King	1
of	1
nations?	1
for	1
to	1
thee	1
doth	1
it	1
appertain:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
kingdoms,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:8	1
But	1
they	1
are	1
altogether	1
brutish	1
and	1
foolish:	1
the	1
stock	1
is	1
a	1
doctrine	1
of	1
vanities.	1
	1
10:9	1
Silver	1
spread	1
into	1
plates	1
is	1
brought	1
from	1
Tarshish,	1
and	1
gold	1
from	1
Uphaz,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
workman,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
founder:	1
blue	1
and	1
purple	1
is	1
their	1
clothing:	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
cunning	1
men.	1
	1
10:10	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
God,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
and	1
an	1
everlasting	1
king:	1
at	1
his	1
wrath	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
tremble,	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
abide	1
his	1
indignation.	1
	1
10:11	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
gods	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
from	1
under	1
these	1
heavens.	1
	1
10:12	1
He	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
his	1
power,	1
he	1
hath	1
established	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
hath	1
stretched	1
out	1
the	1
heavens	1
by	1
his	1
discretion.	1
	1
10:13	1
When	1
he	1
uttereth	1
his	1
voice,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
he	1
causeth	1
the	1
vapours	1
to	1
ascend	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
he	1
maketh	1
lightnings	1
with	1
rain,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
the	1
wind	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
treasures.	1
	1
10:14	1
Every	1
man	1
is	1
brutish	1
in	1
his	1
knowledge:	1
every	1
founder	1
is	1
confounded	1
by	1
the	1
graven	1
image:	1
for	1
his	1
molten	1
image	1
is	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
breath	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
10:15	1
They	1
are	1
vanity,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
errors:	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
visitation	1
they	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
10:16	1
The	1
portion	1
of	1
Jacob	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
former	1
of	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance:	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
10:17	1
Gather	1
up	1
thy	1
wares	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
the	1
fortress.	1
	1
10:18	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
sling	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
at	1
this	1
once,	1
and	1
will	1
distress	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
find	1
it	1
so.	1
	1
10:19	1
Woe	1
is	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
hurt!	1
my	1
wound	1
is	1
grievous;	1
but	1
I	1
said,	1
Truly	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
grief,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
bear	1
it.	1
	1
10:20	1
My	1
tabernacle	1
is	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
cords	1
are	1
broken:	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
gone	1
forth	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
not:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
stretch	1
forth	1
my	1
tent	1
any	1
more,	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
my	1
curtains.	1
	1
10:21	1
For	1
the	1
pastors	1
are	1
become	1
brutish,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
flocks	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered.	1
	1
10:22	1
Behold,	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
bruit	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
commotion	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
country,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
desolate,	1
and	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
dragons.	1
	1
10:23	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
himself:	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
man	1
that	1
walketh	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
steps.	1
	1
10:24	1
O	1
LORD,	1
correct	1
me,	1
but	1
with	1
judgment;	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
anger,	1
lest	1
thou	1
bring	1
me	1
to	1
nothing.	1
	1
10:25	1
Pour	1
out	1
thy	1
fury	1
upon	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
know	1
thee	1
not,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
families	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
on	1
thy	1
name:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
eaten	1
up	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
devoured	1
him,	1
and	1
consumed	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
his	1
habitation	1
desolate.	1
	1
11:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
saying,	1
11:2	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
11:3	1
And	1
say	1
thou	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
obeyeth	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
11:4	1
Which	1
I	1
commanded	1
your	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
iron	1
furnace,	1
saying,	1
Obey	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
do	1
them,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you:	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God:	1
11:5	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
perform	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
Then	1
answered	1
I,	1
and	1
said,	1
So	1
be	1
it,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:6	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Proclaim	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
and	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
11:7	1
For	1
I	1
earnestly	1
protested	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
rising	1
early	1
and	1
protesting,	1
saying,	1
Obey	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
11:8	1
Yet	1
they	1
obeyed	1
not,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear,	1
but	1
walked	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
evil	1
heart:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
do:	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
A	1
conspiracy	1
is	1
found	1
among	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
11:10	1
They	1
are	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
their	1
forefathers,	1
which	1
refused	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
words;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
serve	1
them:	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
broken	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
11:11	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
them,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
escape;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
11:12	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
go,	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
gods	1
unto	1
whom	1
they	1
offer	1
incense:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
save	1
them	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
trouble.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thy	1
cities	1
were	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Judah;	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
have	1
ye	1
set	1
up	1
altars	1
to	1
that	1
shameful	1
thing,	1
even	1
altars	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
Baal.	1
	1
11:14	1
Therefore	1
pray	1
not	1
thou	1
for	1
this	1
people,	1
neither	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
cry	1
or	1
prayer	1
for	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
their	1
trouble.	1
	1
11:15	1
What	1
hath	1
my	1
beloved	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
seeing	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
lewdness	1
with	1
many,	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
flesh	1
is	1
passed	1
from	1
thee?	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
evil,	1
then	1
thou	1
rejoicest.	1
	1
11:16	1
The	1
LORD	1
called	1
thy	1
name,	1
A	1
green	1
olive	1
tree,	1
fair,	1
and	1
of	1
goodly	1
fruit:	1
with	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
tumult	1
he	1
hath	1
kindled	1
fire	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
broken.	1
	1
11:17	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
planted	1
thee,	1
hath	1
pronounced	1
evil	1
against	1
thee,	1
for	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
against	1
themselves	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
in	1
offering	1
incense	1
unto	1
Baal.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it:	1
then	1
thou	1
shewedst	1
me	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
11:19	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lamb	1
or	1
an	1
ox	1
that	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
devised	1
devices	1
against	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
destroy	1
the	1
tree	1
with	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
remembered.	1
	1
11:20	1
But,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
judgest	1
righteously,	1
that	1
triest	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
the	1
heart,	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
thy	1
vengeance	1
on	1
them:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
revealed	1
my	1
cause.	1
	1
11:21	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Anathoth,	1
that	1
seek	1
thy	1
life,	1
saying,	1
Prophesy	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thou	1
die	1
not	1
by	1
our	1
hand:	1
11:22	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
them:	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword;	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
famine:	1
11:23	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
remnant	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Anathoth,	1
even	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
their	1
visitation.	1
	1
12:1	1
Righteous	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
plead	1
with	1
thee:	1
yet	1
let	1
me	1
talk	1
with	1
thee	1
of	1
thy	1
judgments:	1
Wherefore	1
doth	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
prosper?	1
	1
wherefore	1
are	1
all	1
they	1
happy	1
that	1
deal	1
very	1
treacherously?	1
12:2	1
Thou	1
hast	1
planted	1
them,	1
yea,	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
root:	1
they	1
grow,	1
yea,	1
they	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit:	1
thou	1
art	1
near	1
in	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
their	1
reins.	1
	1
12:3	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
knowest	1
me:	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
me,	1
and	1
tried	1
mine	1
heart	1
toward	1
thee:	1
pull	1
them	1
out	1
like	1
sheep	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter,	1
and	1
prepare	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
slaughter.	1
	1
12:4	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
mourn,	1
and	1
the	1
herbs	1
of	1
every	1
field	1
wither,	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein?	1
the	1
beasts	1
are	1
consumed,	1
and	1
the	1
birds;	1
because	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
our	1
last	1
end.	1
	1
12:5	1
If	1
thou	1
hast	1
run	1
with	1
the	1
footmen,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
wearied	1
thee,	1
then	1
how	1
canst	1
thou	1
contend	1
with	1
horses?	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
peace,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
trustedst,	1
they	1
wearied	1
thee,	1
then	1
how	1
wilt	1
thou	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
swelling	1
of	1
Jordan?	1
	1
12:6	1
For	1
even	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
even	1
they	1
have	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
with	1
thee;	1
yea,	1
they	1
have	1
called	1
a	1
multitude	1
after	1
thee:	1
believe	1
them	1
not,	1
though	1
they	1
speak	1
fair	1
words	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
12:7	1
I	1
have	1
forsaken	1
mine	1
house,	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
mine	1
heritage;	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
her	1
enemies.	1
	1
12:8	1
Mine	1
heritage	1
is	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
in	1
the	1
forest;	1
it	1
crieth	1
out	1
against	1
me:	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
hated	1
it.	1
	1
12:9	1
Mine	1
heritage	1
is	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
speckled	1
bird,	1
the	1
birds	1
round	1
about	1
are	1
against	1
her;	1
come	1
ye,	1
assemble	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
come	1
to	1
devour.	1
	1
12:10	1
Many	1
pastors	1
have	1
destroyed	1
my	1
vineyard,	1
they	1
have	1
trodden	1
my	1
portion	1
under	1
foot,	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
pleasant	1
portion	1
a	1
desolate	1
wilderness.	1
	1
12:11	1
They	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
desolate,	1
and	1
being	1
desolate	1
it	1
mourneth	1
unto	1
me;	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
is	1
made	1
desolate,	1
because	1
no	1
man	1
layeth	1
it	1
to	1
heart.	1
	1
12:12	1
The	1
spoilers	1
are	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
high	1
places	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
devour	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
no	1
flesh	1
shall	1
have	1
peace.	1
	1
12:13	1
They	1
have	1
sown	1
wheat,	1
but	1
shall	1
reap	1
thorns:	1
they	1
have	1
put	1
themselves	1
to	1
pain,	1
but	1
shall	1
not	1
profit:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
your	1
revenues	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
all	1
mine	1
evil	1
neighbours,	1
that	1
touch	1
the	1
inheritance	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
to	1
inherit;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
pluck	1
out	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
from	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
plucked	1
them	1
out	1
I	1
will	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
heritage,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
diligently	1
learn	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
to	1
swear	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth;	1
as	1
they	1
taught	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
swear	1
by	1
Baal;	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
built	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
12:17	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
obey,	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
pluck	1
up	1
and	1
destroy	1
that	1
nation,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
a	1
linen	1
girdle,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
water.	1
	1
13:2	1
So	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
girdle	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
loins.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
saying,	1
13:4	1
Take	1
the	1
girdle	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
got,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Euphrates,	1
and	1
hide	1
it	1
there	1
in	1
a	1
hole	1
of	1
the	1
rock.	1
	1
13:5	1
So	1
I	1
went,	1
and	1
hid	1
it	1
by	1
Euphrates,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
me.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
many	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Euphrates,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
girdle	1
from	1
thence,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee	1
to	1
hide	1
there.	1
	1
13:7	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Euphrates,	1
and	1
digged,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
girdle	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
hid	1
it:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
girdle	1
was	1
marred,	1
it	1
was	1
profitable	1
for	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:8	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
13:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
After	1
this	1
manner	1
will	1
I	1
mar	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
pride	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:10	1
This	1
evil	1
people,	1
which	1
refuse	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
which	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
walk	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
to	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
worship	1
them,	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
as	1
this	1
girdle,	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
girdle	1
cleaveth	1
to	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
caused	1
to	1
cleave	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
people,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
name,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
praise,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
glory:	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
13:12	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
this	1
word;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Every	1
bottle	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
wine:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Do	1
we	1
not	1
certainly	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
bottle	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
wine?	1
	1
13:13	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
land,	1
even	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
sit	1
upon	1
David's	1
throne,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
with	1
drunkenness.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
dash	1
them	1
one	1
against	1
another,	1
even	1
the	1
fathers	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
pity,	1
nor	1
spare,	1
nor	1
have	1
mercy,	1
but	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
13:15	1
Hear	1
ye,	1
and	1
give	1
ear;	1
be	1
not	1
proud:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken.	1
	1
13:16	1
Give	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
before	1
he	1
cause	1
darkness,	1
and	1
before	1
your	1
feet	1
stumble	1
upon	1
the	1
dark	1
mountains,	1
and,	1
while	1
ye	1
look	1
for	1
light,	1
he	1
turn	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
gross	1
darkness.	1
	1
13:17	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
it,	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
weep	1
in	1
secret	1
places	1
for	1
your	1
pride;	1
and	1
mine	1
eye	1
shall	1
weep	1
sore,	1
and	1
run	1
down	1
with	1
tears,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD's	1
flock	1
is	1
carried	1
away	1
captive.	1
	1
13:18	1
Say	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
queen,	1
Humble	1
yourselves,	1
sit	1
down:	1
for	1
your	1
principalities	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
even	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
your	1
glory.	1
	1
13:19	1
The	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
shut	1
up,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
open	1
them:	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
all	1
of	1
it,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
wholly	1
carried	1
away	1
captive.	1
	1
13:20	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
behold	1
them	1
that	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
north:	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
flock	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
thee,	1
thy	1
beautiful	1
flock?	1
	1
13:21	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
punish	1
thee?	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
captains,	1
and	1
as	1
chief	1
over	1
thee:	1
shall	1
not	1
sorrows	1
take	1
thee,	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail?	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
say	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
Wherefore	1
come	1
these	1
things	1
upon	1
me?	1
	1
For	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
are	1
thy	1
skirts	1
discovered,	1
and	1
thy	1
heels	1
made	1
bare.	1
	1
13:23	1
Can	1
the	1
Ethiopian	1
change	1
his	1
skin,	1
or	1
the	1
leopard	1
his	1
spots?	1
then	1
may	1
ye	1
also	1
do	1
good,	1
that	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
13:24	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
scatter	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
stubble	1
that	1
passeth	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
wind	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:25	1
This	1
is	1
thy	1
lot,	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
thy	1
measures	1
from	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
me,	1
and	1
trusted	1
in	1
falsehood.	1
	1
13:26	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
discover	1
thy	1
skirts	1
upon	1
thy	1
face,	1
that	1
thy	1
shame	1
may	1
appear.	1
	1
13:27	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thine	1
adulteries,	1
and	1
thy	1
neighings,	1
the	1
lewdness	1
of	1
thy	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
thine	1
abominations	1
on	1
the	1
hills	1
in	1
the	1
fields.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Jerusalem!	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
clean?	1
when	1
shall	1
it	1
once	1
be?	1
	1
14:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
concerning	1
the	1
dearth.	1
	1
14:2	1
Judah	1
mourneth,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof	1
languish;	1
they	1
are	1
black	1
unto	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
gone	1
up.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
their	1
nobles	1
have	1
sent	1
their	1
little	1
ones	1
to	1
the	1
waters:	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
pits,	1
and	1
found	1
no	1
water;	1
they	1
returned	1
with	1
their	1
vessels	1
empty;	1
they	1
were	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded,	1
and	1
covered	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
14:4	1
Because	1
the	1
ground	1
is	1
chapt,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
plowmen	1
were	1
ashamed,	1
they	1
covered	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
14:5	1
Yea,	1
the	1
hind	1
also	1
calved	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
forsook	1
it,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
grass.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
the	1
wild	1
asses	1
did	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
they	1
snuffed	1
up	1
the	1
wind	1
like	1
dragons;	1
their	1
eyes	1
did	1
fail,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
grass.	1
	1
14:7	1
O	1
LORD,	1
though	1
our	1
iniquities	1
testify	1
against	1
us,	1
do	1
thou	1
it	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake:	1
for	1
our	1
backslidings	1
are	1
many;	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
14:8	1
O	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
saviour	1
thereof	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
trouble,	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
wayfaring	1
man	1
that	1
turneth	1
aside	1
to	1
tarry	1
for	1
a	1
night?	1
	1
14:9	1
Why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
astonied,	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
that	1
cannot	1
save?	1
yet	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name;	1
leave	1
us	1
not.	1
	1
14:10	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
this	1
people,	1
Thus	1
have	1
they	1
loved	1
to	1
wander,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
refrained	1
their	1
feet,	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
not	1
accept	1
them;	1
he	1
will	1
now	1
remember	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
visit	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
14:11	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Pray	1
not	1
for	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
their	1
good.	1
	1
14:12	1
When	1
they	1
fast,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
their	1
cry;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
an	1
oblation,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
accept	1
them:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
consume	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence.	1
	1
14:13	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Ah,	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
behold,	1
the	1
prophets	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
sword,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
have	1
famine;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
assured	1
peace	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
14:14	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
prophets	1
prophesy	1
lies	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
I	1
sent	1
them	1
not,	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
commanded	1
them,	1
neither	1
spake	1
unto	1
them:	1
they	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
false	1
vision	1
and	1
divination,	1
and	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought,	1
and	1
the	1
deceit	1
of	1
their	1
heart.	1
	1
14:15	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
them	1
not,	1
yet	1
they	1
say,	1
Sword	1
and	1
famine	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
land;	1
By	1
sword	1
and	1
famine	1
shall	1
those	1
prophets	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
prophesy	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
famine	1
and	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
none	1
to	1
bury	1
them,	1
them,	1
their	1
wives,	1
nor	1
their	1
sons,	1
nor	1
their	1
daughters:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
their	1
wickedness	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
14:17	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
them;	1
Let	1
mine	1
eyes	1
run	1
down	1
with	1
tears	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
cease:	1
for	1
the	1
virgin	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
broken	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
breach,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
grievous	1
blow.	1
	1
14:18	1
If	1
I	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
then	1
behold	1
the	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword!	1
	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
then	1
behold	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sick	1
with	1
famine!	1
	1
yea,	1
both	1
the	1
prophet	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
go	1
about	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
14:19	1
Hast	1
thou	1
utterly	1
rejected	1
Judah?	1
hath	1
thy	1
soul	1
lothed	1
Zion?	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
smitten	1
us,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
healing	1
for	1
us?	1
we	1
looked	1
for	1
peace,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
good;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
healing,	1
and	1
behold	1
trouble!	1
	1
14:20	1
We	1
acknowledge,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
our	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
our	1
fathers:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
14:21	1
Do	1
not	1
abhor	1
us,	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake,	1
do	1
not	1
disgrace	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
thy	1
glory:	1
remember,	1
break	1
not	1
thy	1
covenant	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
14:22	1
Are	1
there	1
any	1
among	1
the	1
vanities	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
can	1
cause	1
rain?	1
or	1
can	1
the	1
heavens	1
give	1
showers?	1
art	1
not	1
thou	1
he,	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God?	1
	1
therefore	1
we	1
will	1
wait	1
upon	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Though	1
Moses	1
and	1
Samuel	1
stood	1
before	1
me,	1
yet	1
my	1
mind	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
toward	1
this	1
people:	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
forth.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Whither	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
forth?	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
tell	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
death,	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
sword,	1
to	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
famine,	1
to	1
the	1
famine;	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
captivity,	1
to	1
the	1
captivity.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
appoint	1
over	1
them	1
four	1
kinds,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
slay,	1
and	1
the	1
dogs	1
to	1
tear,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
devour	1
and	1
destroy.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
into	1
all	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
because	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:5	1
For	1
who	1
shall	1
have	1
pity	1
upon	1
thee,	1
O	1
Jerusalem?	1
or	1
who	1
shall	1
bemoan	1
thee?	1
or	1
who	1
shall	1
go	1
aside	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
thou	1
doest?	1
	1
15:6	1
Thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
art	1
gone	1
backward:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
destroy	1
thee;	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
with	1
repenting.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
fan	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
fan	1
in	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
I	1
will	1
bereave	1
them	1
of	1
children,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
my	1
people	1
since	1
they	1
return	1
not	1
from	1
their	1
ways.	1
	1
15:8	1
Their	1
widows	1
are	1
increased	1
to	1
me	1
above	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
seas:	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
upon	1
them	1
against	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
a	1
spoiler	1
at	1
noonday:	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
it	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
terrors	1
upon	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
15:9	1
She	1
that	1
hath	1
borne	1
seven	1
languisheth:	1
she	1
hath	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
ghost;	1
her	1
sun	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
day:	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded:	1
and	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
to	1
the	1
sword	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:10	1
Woe	1
is	1
me,	1
my	1
mother,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
borne	1
me	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
strife	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
contention	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
earth!	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
lent	1
on	1
usury,	1
nor	1
men	1
have	1
lent	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
usury;	1
yet	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
doth	1
curse	1
me.	1
	1
15:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Verily	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thy	1
remnant;	1
verily	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
enemy	1
to	1
entreat	1
thee	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
evil	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
affliction.	1
	1
15:12	1
Shall	1
iron	1
break	1
the	1
northern	1
iron	1
and	1
the	1
steel?	1
	1
15:13	1
Thy	1
substance	1
and	1
thy	1
treasures	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
spoil	1
without	1
price,	1
and	1
that	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
sins,	1
even	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
borders.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
pass	1
with	1
thine	1
enemies	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not:	1
for	1
a	1
fire	1
is	1
kindled	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
which	1
shall	1
burn	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
15:15	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
knowest:	1
remember	1
me,	1
and	1
visit	1
me,	1
and	1
revenge	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
persecutors;	1
take	1
me	1
not	1
away	1
in	1
thy	1
longsuffering:	1
know	1
that	1
for	1
thy	1
sake	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
rebuke.	1
	1
15:16	1
Thy	1
words	1
were	1
found,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
eat	1
them;	1
and	1
thy	1
word	1
was	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
joy	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
of	1
mine	1
heart:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
15:17	1
I	1
sat	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
mockers,	1
nor	1
rejoiced;	1
I	1
sat	1
alone	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
hand:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
indignation.	1
	1
15:18	1
Why	1
is	1
my	1
pain	1
perpetual,	1
and	1
my	1
wound	1
incurable,	1
which	1
refuseth	1
to	1
be	1
healed?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
altogether	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
as	1
waters	1
that	1
fail?	1
	1
15:19	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
If	1
thou	1
return,	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
again,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stand	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
take	1
forth	1
the	1
precious	1
from	1
the	1
vile,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
as	1
my	1
mouth:	1
let	1
them	1
return	1
unto	1
thee;	1
but	1
return	1
not	1
thou	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
a	1
fenced	1
brasen	1
wall:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fight	1
against	1
thee,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
thee:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
save	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
terrible.	1
	1
16:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
also	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
16:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
thee	1
a	1
wife,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
sons	1
or	1
daughters	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
16:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
sons	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
daughters	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
concerning	1
their	1
mothers	1
that	1
bare	1
them,	1
and	1
concerning	1
their	1
fathers	1
that	1
begat	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
land;	1
16:4	1
They	1
shall	1
die	1
of	1
grievous	1
deaths;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
lamented;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
buried;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
famine;	1
and	1
their	1
carcases	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
16:5	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Enter	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning,	1
neither	1
go	1
to	1
lament	1
nor	1
bemoan	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
peace	1
from	1
this	1
people,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
lovingkindness	1
and	1
mercies.	1
	1
16:6	1
Both	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
the	1
small	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
this	1
land:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
buried,	1
neither	1
shall	1
men	1
lament	1
for	1
them,	1
nor	1
cut	1
themselves,	1
nor	1
make	1
themselves	1
bald	1
for	1
them:	1
16:7	1
Neither	1
shall	1
men	1
tear	1
themselves	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
mourning,	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
dead;	1
neither	1
shall	1
men	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
consolation	1
to	1
drink	1
for	1
their	1
father	1
or	1
for	1
their	1
mother.	1
	1
16:8	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
also	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
feasting,	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
16:9	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mirth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
gladness,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bride.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shew	1
this	1
people	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
pronounced	1
all	1
this	1
great	1
evil	1
against	1
us?	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
our	1
iniquity?	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
our	1
sin	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God?	1
16:11	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
your	1
fathers	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
walked	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
have	1
served	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
worshipped	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
my	1
law;	1
16:12	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
worse	1
than	1
your	1
fathers;	1
for,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
walk	1
every	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
heart,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
16:13	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not,	1
neither	1
ye	1
nor	1
your	1
fathers;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
serve	1
other	1
gods	1
day	1
and	1
night;	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
shew	1
you	1
favour.	1
	1
16:14	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
that	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
16:15	1
But,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
that	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
lands	1
whither	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
into	1
their	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
16:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
for	1
many	1
fishers,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fish	1
them;	1
and	1
after	1
will	1
I	1
send	1
for	1
many	1
hunters,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hunt	1
them	1
from	1
every	1
mountain,	1
and	1
from	1
every	1
hill,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holes	1
of	1
the	1
rocks.	1
	1
16:17	1
For	1
mine	1
eyes	1
are	1
upon	1
all	1
their	1
ways:	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
hid	1
from	1
my	1
face,	1
neither	1
is	1
their	1
iniquity	1
hid	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
first	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
their	1
sin	1
double;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
defiled	1
my	1
land,	1
they	1
have	1
filled	1
mine	1
inheritance	1
with	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
their	1
detestable	1
and	1
abominable	1
things.	1
	1
16:19	1
O	1
LORD,	1
my	1
strength,	1
and	1
my	1
fortress,	1
and	1
my	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
affliction,	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
shall	1
say,	1
Surely	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
inherited	1
lies,	1
vanity,	1
and	1
things	1
wherein	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
profit.	1
	1
16:20	1
Shall	1
a	1
man	1
make	1
gods	1
unto	1
himself,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
gods?	1
	1
16:21	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
this	1
once	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
know,	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
know	1
mine	1
hand	1
and	1
my	1
might;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
The	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:1	1
The	1
sin	1
of	1
Judah	1
is	1
written	1
with	1
a	1
pen	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
diamond:	1
it	1
is	1
graven	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
your	1
altars;	1
17:2	1
Whilst	1
their	1
children	1
remember	1
their	1
altars	1
and	1
their	1
groves	1
by	1
the	1
green	1
trees	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
hills.	1
	1
17:3	1
O	1
my	1
mountain	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
substance	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
treasures	1
to	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
thy	1
high	1
places	1
for	1
sin,	1
throughout	1
all	1
thy	1
borders.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
thou,	1
even	1
thyself,	1
shalt	1
discontinue	1
from	1
thine	1
heritage	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
serve	1
thine	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
which	1
shall	1
burn	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
17:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
man,	1
and	1
maketh	1
flesh	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
whose	1
heart	1
departeth	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:6	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
heath	1
in	1
the	1
desert,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
when	1
good	1
cometh;	1
but	1
shall	1
inhabit	1
the	1
parched	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
a	1
salt	1
land	1
and	1
not	1
inhabited.	1
	1
17:7	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
whose	1
hope	1
the	1
LORD	1
is.	1
	1
17:8	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
tree	1
planted	1
by	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
that	1
spreadeth	1
out	1
her	1
roots	1
by	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
when	1
heat	1
cometh,	1
but	1
her	1
leaf	1
shall	1
be	1
green;	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
careful	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
drought,	1
neither	1
shall	1
cease	1
from	1
yielding	1
fruit.	1
	1
17:9	1
The	1
heart	1
is	1
deceitful	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
desperately	1
wicked:	1
who	1
can	1
know	1
it?	1
	1
17:10	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
search	1
the	1
heart,	1
I	1
try	1
the	1
reins,	1
even	1
to	1
give	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
doings.	1
	1
17:11	1
As	1
the	1
partridge	1
sitteth	1
on	1
eggs,	1
and	1
hatcheth	1
them	1
not;	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
getteth	1
riches,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
right,	1
shall	1
leave	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
days,	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fool.	1
	1
17:12	1
A	1
glorious	1
high	1
throne	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
our	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
17:13	1
O	1
LORD,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Israel,	1
all	1
that	1
forsake	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
depart	1
from	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
living	1
waters.	1
	1
17:14	1
Heal	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
healed;	1
save	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
praise.	1
	1
17:15	1
Behold,	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
now.	1
	1
17:16	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
hastened	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
pastor	1
to	1
follow	1
thee:	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
desired	1
the	1
woeful	1
day;	1
thou	1
knowest:	1
that	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
lips	1
was	1
right	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
17:17	1
Be	1
not	1
a	1
terror	1
unto	1
me:	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
hope	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
17:18	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
confounded	1
that	1
persecute	1
me,	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
me	1
be	1
confounded:	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
me	1
be	1
dismayed:	1
bring	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
evil,	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
with	1
double	1
destruction.	1
	1
17:19	1
Thus	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me;	1
Go	1
and	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
whereby	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
go	1
out,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
17:20	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
all	1
Judah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
enter	1
in	1
by	1
these	1
gates:	1
17:21	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
bear	1
no	1
burden	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
nor	1
bring	1
it	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
17:22	1
Neither	1
carry	1
forth	1
a	1
burden	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
houses	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
any	1
work,	1
but	1
hallow	1
ye	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
17:23	1
But	1
they	1
obeyed	1
not,	1
neither	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear,	1
but	1
made	1
their	1
neck	1
stiff,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
hear,	1
nor	1
receive	1
instruction.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
ye	1
diligently	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
no	1
burden	1
through	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
this	1
city	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
but	1
hallow	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
to	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
therein;	1
17:25	1
Then	1
shall	1
there	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
this	1
city	1
kings	1
and	1
princes	1
sitting	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
riding	1
in	1
chariots	1
and	1
on	1
horses,	1
they,	1
and	1
their	1
princes,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
remain	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
places	1
about	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
south,	1
bringing	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
and	1
incense,	1
and	1
bringing	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
praise,	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:27	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
hallow	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
bear	1
a	1
burden,	1
even	1
entering	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched.	1
	1
18:1	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
18:2	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
potter's	1
house,	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
words.	1
	1
18:3	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
potter's	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
wrought	1
a	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
wheels.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
the	1
vessel	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
of	1
clay	1
was	1
marred	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
potter:	1
so	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
again	1
another	1
vessel,	1
as	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
potter	1
to	1
make	1
it.	1
	1
18:5	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
18:6	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
cannot	1
I	1
do	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
this	1
potter?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Behold,	1
as	1
the	1
clay	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
potter's	1
hand,	1
so	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:7	1
At	1
what	1
instant	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
concerning	1
a	1
nation,	1
and	1
concerning	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
to	1
pluck	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
pull	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
it;	1
18:8	1
If	1
that	1
nation,	1
against	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced,	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
evil,	1
I	1
will	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
at	1
what	1
instant	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
concerning	1
a	1
nation,	1
and	1
concerning	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
to	1
build	1
and	1
to	1
plant	1
it;	1
18:10	1
If	1
it	1
do	1
evil	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
that	1
it	1
obey	1
not	1
my	1
voice,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
good,	1
wherewith	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
would	1
benefit	1
them.	1
	1
18:11	1
Now	1
therefore	1
go	1
to,	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
frame	1
evil	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
devise	1
a	1
device	1
against	1
you:	1
return	1
ye	1
now	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
make	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
your	1
doings	1
good.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
hope:	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
after	1
our	1
own	1
devices,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
every	1
one	1
do	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
heart.	1
	1
18:13	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Ask	1
ye	1
now	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
who	1
hath	1
heard	1
such	1
things:	1
the	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
done	1
a	1
very	1
horrible	1
thing.	1
	1
18:14	1
Will	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
the	1
snow	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
which	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
the	1
field?	1
or	1
shall	1
the	1
cold	1
flowing	1
waters	1
that	1
come	1
from	1
another	1
place	1
be	1
forsaken?	1
	1
18:15	1
Because	1
my	1
people	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
me,	1
they	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
vanity,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
stumble	1
in	1
their	1
ways	1
from	1
the	1
ancient	1
paths,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
paths,	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
not	1
cast	1
up;	1
18:16	1
To	1
make	1
their	1
land	1
desolate,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
hissing;	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
thereby	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished,	1
and	1
wag	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
18:17	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
them	1
as	1
with	1
an	1
east	1
wind	1
before	1
the	1
enemy;	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
them	1
the	1
back,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
face,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity.	1
	1
18:18	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
Come	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
devise	1
devices	1
against	1
Jeremiah;	1
for	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
not	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
priest,	1
nor	1
counsel	1
from	1
the	1
wise,	1
nor	1
the	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
prophet.	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
smite	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
tongue,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
18:19	1
Give	1
heed	1
to	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
contend	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
18:20	1
Shall	1
evil	1
be	1
recompensed	1
for	1
good?	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
digged	1
a	1
pit	1
for	1
my	1
soul.	1
Remember	1
that	1
I	1
stood	1
before	1
thee	1
to	1
speak	1
good	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
thy	1
wrath	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
18:21	1
Therefore	1
deliver	1
up	1
their	1
children	1
to	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
their	1
blood	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
let	1
their	1
wives	1
be	1
bereaved	1
of	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
be	1
widows;	1
and	1
let	1
their	1
men	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
let	1
their	1
young	1
men	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
18:22	1
Let	1
a	1
cry	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
their	1
houses,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
a	1
troop	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
them:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
digged	1
a	1
pit	1
to	1
take	1
me,	1
and	1
hid	1
snares	1
for	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
18:23	1
Yet,	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
their	1
counsel	1
against	1
me	1
to	1
slay	1
me:	1
forgive	1
not	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
neither	1
blot	1
out	1
their	1
sin	1
from	1
thy	1
sight,	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
overthrown	1
before	1
thee;	1
deal	1
thus	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thine	1
anger.	1
	1
19:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Go	1
and	1
get	1
a	1
potter's	1
earthen	1
bottle,	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
of	1
the	1
priests;	1
19:2	1
And	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
gate,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
there	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee,	1
19:3	1
And	1
say,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
this	1
place,	1
the	1
which	1
whosoever	1
heareth,	1
his	1
ears	1
shall	1
tingle.	1
	1
19:4	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
estranged	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
in	1
it	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
whom	1
neither	1
they	1
nor	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
known,	1
nor	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
have	1
filled	1
this	1
place	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
innocents;	1
19:5	1
They	1
have	1
built	1
also	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Baal,	1
to	1
burn	1
their	1
sons	1
with	1
fire	1
for	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
Baal,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
not,	1
nor	1
spake	1
it,	1
neither	1
came	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
mind:	1
19:6	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
this	1
place	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
Tophet,	1
nor	1
The	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
but	1
The	1
valley	1
of	1
slaughter.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
void	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
this	1
place;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
lives:	1
and	1
their	1
carcases	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
this	1
city	1
desolate,	1
and	1
an	1
hissing;	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
thereby	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished	1
and	1
hiss	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
plagues	1
thereof.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
their	1
daughters,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
every	1
one	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
siege	1
and	1
straitness,	1
wherewith	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
lives,	1
shall	1
straiten	1
them.	1
	1
19:10	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
break	1
the	1
bottle	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
19:11	1
And	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Even	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
this	1
city,	1
as	1
one	1
breaketh	1
a	1
potter's	1
vessel,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
whole	1
again:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bury	1
them	1
in	1
Tophet,	1
till	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
place	1
to	1
bury.	1
	1
19:12	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
this	1
place,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof,	1
and	1
even	1
make	1
this	1
city	1
as	1
Tophet:	1
19:13	1
And	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
shall	1
be	1
defiled	1
as	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Tophet,	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
upon	1
whose	1
roofs	1
they	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
have	1
poured	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
19:14	1
Then	1
came	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
Tophet,	1
whither	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
prophesy;	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house;	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
19:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
this	1
city	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
her	1
towns	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced	1
against	1
it,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
hardened	1
their	1
necks,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
hear	1
my	1
words.	1
	1
20:1	1
Now	1
Pashur	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Immer	1
the	1
priest,	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
chief	1
governor	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
heard	1
that	1
Jeremiah	1
prophesied	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
Pashur	1
smote	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
stocks	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
gate	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Pashur	1
brought	1
forth	1
Jeremiah	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stocks.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
called	1
thy	1
name	1
Pashur,	1
but	1
Magormissabib.	1
	1
20:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
terror	1
to	1
thyself,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
thy	1
friends:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
it:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
all	1
Judah	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
captive	1
into	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
shall	1
slay	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:5	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
labours	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
which	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them,	1
and	1
take	1
them,	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
thou,	1
Pashur,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
there	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
buried	1
there,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
friends,	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
prophesied	1
lies.	1
	1
20:7	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
deceived	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
deceived;	1
thou	1
art	1
stronger	1
than	1
I,	1
and	1
hast	1
prevailed:	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
derision	1
daily,	1
every	1
one	1
mocketh	1
me.	1
	1
20:8	1
For	1
since	1
I	1
spake,	1
I	1
cried	1
out,	1
I	1
cried	1
violence	1
and	1
spoil;	1
because	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
reproach	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
a	1
derision,	1
daily.	1
	1
20:9	1
Then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
him,	1
nor	1
speak	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
his	1
name.	1
But	1
his	1
word	1
was	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
as	1
a	1
burning	1
fire	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
bones,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
weary	1
with	1
forbearing,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
stay.	1
	1
20:10	1
For	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
defaming	1
of	1
many,	1
fear	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
Report,	1
say	1
they,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
report	1
it.	1
All	1
my	1
familiars	1
watched	1
for	1
my	1
halting,	1
saying,	1
Peradventure	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
enticed,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
take	1
our	1
revenge	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
20:11	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
terrible	1
one:	1
therefore	1
my	1
persecutors	1
shall	1
stumble,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
greatly	1
ashamed;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper:	1
their	1
everlasting	1
confusion	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
	1
20:12	1
But,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
triest	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
seest	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
the	1
heart,	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
thy	1
vengeance	1
on	1
them:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
cause.	1
	1
20:13	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
delivered	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
evildoers.	1
	1
20:14	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
day	1
wherein	1
I	1
was	1
born:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
day	1
wherein	1
my	1
mother	1
bare	1
me	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
20:15	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
brought	1
tidings	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
saying,	1
A	1
man	1
child	1
is	1
born	1
unto	1
thee;	1
making	1
him	1
very	1
glad.	1
	1
20:16	1
And	1
let	1
that	1
man	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
overthrew,	1
and	1
repented	1
not:	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
the	1
cry	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
at	1
noontide;	1
20:17	1
Because	1
he	1
slew	1
me	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
womb;	1
or	1
that	1
my	1
mother	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
grave,	1
and	1
her	1
womb	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
great	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
20:18	1
Wherefore	1
came	1
I	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
womb	1
to	1
see	1
labour	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
that	1
my	1
days	1
should	1
be	1
consumed	1
with	1
shame?	1
	1
21:1	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
king	1
Zedekiah	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
Pashur	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Melchiah,	1
and	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
priest,	1
saying,	1
21:2	1
Enquire,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
us;	1
for	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
maketh	1
war	1
against	1
us;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
deal	1
with	1
us	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
wondrous	1
works,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
21:3	1
Then	1
said	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
Zedekiah:	1
21:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
back	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
your	1
hands,	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
which	1
besiege	1
you	1
without	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
assemble	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
fight	1
against	1
you	1
with	1
an	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
arm,	1
even	1
in	1
anger,	1
and	1
in	1
fury,	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
wrath.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
city,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast:	1
they	1
shall	1
die	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
pestilence.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
afterward,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
from	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
from	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
famine,	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
life:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
spare	1
them,	1
neither	1
have	1
pity,	1
nor	1
have	1
mercy.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
you	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
21:9	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
goeth	1
out,	1
and	1
falleth	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
that	1
besiege	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
prey.	1
	1
21:10	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
this	1
city	1
for	1
evil,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
good,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
touching	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
say,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
21:12	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Execute	1
judgment	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
deliver	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
spoiled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor,	1
lest	1
my	1
fury	1
go	1
out	1
like	1
fire,	1
and	1
burn	1
that	1
none	1
can	1
quench	1
it,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings.	1
	1
21:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
rock	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
which	1
say,	1
Who	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
us?	1
or	1
who	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
our	1
habitations?	1
	1
21:14	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
your	1
doings,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
thereof,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
all	1
things	1
round	1
about	1
it.	1
	1
22:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
speak	1
there	1
this	1
word,	1
22:2	1
And	1
say,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
sittest	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
that	1
enter	1
in	1
by	1
these	1
gates:	1
22:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Execute	1
ye	1
judgment	1
and	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
deliver	1
the	1
spoiled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor:	1
and	1
do	1
no	1
wrong,	1
do	1
no	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
stranger,	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
nor	1
the	1
widow,	1
neither	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
22:4	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
indeed,	1
then	1
shall	1
there	1
enter	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
kings	1
sitting	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
riding	1
in	1
chariots	1
and	1
on	1
horses,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
22:5	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
these	1
words,	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
myself,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
this	1
house	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
desolation.	1
	1
22:6	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
house	1
of	1
Judah;	1
Thou	1
art	1
Gilead	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Lebanon:	1
yet	1
surely	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
cities	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
inhabited.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
prepare	1
destroyers	1
against	1
thee,	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
weapons:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
cut	1
down	1
thy	1
choice	1
cedars,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
many	1
nations	1
shall	1
pass	1
by	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
Wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
done	1
thus	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city?	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
they	1
shall	1
answer,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
served	1
them.	1
	1
22:10	1
Weep	1
ye	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
neither	1
bemoan	1
him:	1
but	1
weep	1
sore	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
goeth	1
away:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
return	1
no	1
more,	1
nor	1
see	1
his	1
native	1
country.	1
	1
22:11	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
touching	1
Shallum	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
reigned	1
instead	1
of	1
Josiah	1
his	1
father,	1
which	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place;	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
thither	1
any	1
more:	1
22:12	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
they	1
have	1
led	1
him	1
captive,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
this	1
land	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
22:13	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
buildeth	1
his	1
house	1
by	1
unrighteousness,	1
and	1
his	1
chambers	1
by	1
wrong;	1
that	1
useth	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
service	1
without	1
wages,	1
and	1
giveth	1
him	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
work;	1
22:14	1
That	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
me	1
a	1
wide	1
house	1
and	1
large	1
chambers,	1
and	1
cutteth	1
him	1
out	1
windows;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
cieled	1
with	1
cedar,	1
and	1
painted	1
with	1
vermilion.	1
	1
22:15	1
Shalt	1
thou	1
reign,	1
because	1
thou	1
closest	1
thyself	1
in	1
cedar?	1
did	1
not	1
thy	1
father	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
do	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
22:16	1
He	1
judged	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy;	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
him:	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
to	1
know	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:17	1
But	1
thine	1
eyes	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
are	1
not	1
but	1
for	1
thy	1
covetousness,	1
and	1
for	1
to	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood,	1
and	1
for	1
oppression,	1
and	1
for	1
violence,	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
22:18	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah;	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
lament	1
for	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Ah	1
my	1
brother!	1
or,	1
Ah	1
sister!	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
lament	1
for	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Ah	1
lord!	1
or,	1
Ah	1
his	1
glory!	1
	1
22:19	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
buried	1
with	1
the	1
burial	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
drawn	1
and	1
cast	1
forth	1
beyond	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
22:20	1
Go	1
up	1
to	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
cry;	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice	1
in	1
Bashan,	1
and	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
passages:	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
lovers	1
are	1
destroyed.	1
	1
22:21	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
prosperity;	1
but	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear.	1
This	1
hath	1
been	1
thy	1
manner	1
from	1
thy	1
youth,	1
that	1
thou	1
obeyedst	1
not	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
22:22	1
The	1
wind	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
all	1
thy	1
pastors,	1
and	1
thy	1
lovers	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
surely	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
wickedness.	1
	1
22:23	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
that	1
makest	1
thy	1
nest	1
in	1
the	1
cedars,	1
how	1
gracious	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
when	1
pangs	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
the	1
pain	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail!	1
	1
22:24	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
though	1
Coniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
the	1
signet	1
upon	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
yet	1
would	1
I	1
pluck	1
thee	1
thence;	1
22:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
thy	1
life,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
whose	1
face	1
thou	1
fearest,	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
22:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
thee	1
out,	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
that	1
bare	1
thee,	1
into	1
another	1
country,	1
where	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
born;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
die.	1
	1
22:27	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
whereunto	1
they	1
desire	1
to	1
return,	1
thither	1
shall	1
they	1
not	1
return.	1
	1
22:28	1
Is	1
this	1
man	1
Coniah	1
a	1
despised	1
broken	1
idol?	1
is	1
he	1
a	1
vessel	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
pleasure?	1
wherefore	1
are	1
they	1
cast	1
out,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
seed,	1
and	1
are	1
cast	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
they	1
know	1
not?	1
	1
22:29	1
O	1
earth,	1
earth,	1
earth,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:30	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Write	1
ye	1
this	1
man	1
childless,	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
days:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
shall	1
prosper,	1
sitting	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
ruling	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
Judah.	1
	1
23:1	1
Woe	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
pastors	1
that	1
destroy	1
and	1
scatter	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
my	1
pasture!	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:2	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
against	1
the	1
pastors	1
that	1
feed	1
my	1
people;	1
Ye	1
have	1
scattered	1
my	1
flock,	1
and	1
driven	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
visited	1
them:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
my	1
flock	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
countries	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
their	1
folds;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
fruitful	1
and	1
increase.	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
up	1
shepherds	1
over	1
them	1
which	1
shall	1
feed	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fear	1
no	1
more,	1
nor	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
lacking,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:5	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
unto	1
David	1
a	1
righteous	1
Branch,	1
and	1
a	1
King	1
shall	1
reign	1
and	1
prosper,	1
and	1
shall	1
execute	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
23:6	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
whereby	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called,	1
THE	1
LORD	1
OUR	1
RIGHTEOUSNESS.	1
	1
23:7	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
which	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
23:8	1
But,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
which	1
brought	1
up	1
and	1
which	1
led	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
countries	1
whither	1
I	1
had	1
driven	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
23:9	1
Mine	1
heart	1
within	1
me	1
is	1
broken	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
prophets;	1
all	1
my	1
bones	1
shake;	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
drunken	1
man,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
wine	1
hath	1
overcome,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
23:10	1
For	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
adulterers;	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
swearing	1
the	1
land	1
mourneth;	1
the	1
pleasant	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
are	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
their	1
course	1
is	1
evil,	1
and	1
their	1
force	1
is	1
not	1
right.	1
	1
23:11	1
For	1
both	1
prophet	1
and	1
priest	1
are	1
profane;	1
yea,	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
have	1
I	1
found	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:12	1
Wherefore	1
their	1
way	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
slippery	1
ways	1
in	1
the	1
darkness:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
on,	1
and	1
fall	1
therein:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
them,	1
even	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
their	1
visitation,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
folly	1
in	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Samaria;	1
they	1
prophesied	1
in	1
Baal,	1
and	1
caused	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
to	1
err.	1
	1
23:14	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
an	1
horrible	1
thing:	1
they	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
lies:	1
they	1
strengthen	1
also	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
that	1
none	1
doth	1
return	1
from	1
his	1
wickedness;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
as	1
Gomorrah.	1
	1
23:15	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophets;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
with	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
drink	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
gall:	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
profaneness	1
gone	1
forth	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Hearken	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you:	1
they	1
make	1
you	1
vain:	1
they	1
speak	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:17	1
They	1
say	1
still	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
despise	1
me,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
peace;	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
walketh	1
after	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
No	1
evil	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
23:18	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hath	1
perceived	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
word?	1
who	1
hath	1
marked	1
his	1
word,	1
and	1
heard	1
it?	1
23:19	1
Behold,	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
gone	1
forth	1
in	1
fury,	1
even	1
a	1
grievous	1
whirlwind:	1
it	1
shall	1
fall	1
grievously	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
23:20	1
The	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
not	1
return,	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
executed,	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
have	1
performed	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
his	1
heart:	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
consider	1
it	1
perfectly.	1
	1
23:21	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sent	1
these	1
prophets,	1
yet	1
they	1
ran:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
to	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
prophesied.	1
	1
23:22	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
stood	1
in	1
my	1
counsel,	1
and	1
had	1
caused	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
then	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
turned	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
23:23	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
God	1
at	1
hand,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
God	1
afar	1
off?	1
23:24	1
Can	1
any	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
secret	1
places	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
him?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Do	1
not	1
I	1
fill	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:25	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
prophets	1
said,	1
that	1
prophesy	1
lies	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed.	1
	1
23:26	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
this	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
lies?	1
yea,	1
they	1
are	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
deceit	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
heart;	1
23:27	1
Which	1
think	1
to	1
cause	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
forget	1
my	1
name	1
by	1
their	1
dreams	1
which	1
they	1
tell	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
as	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
forgotten	1
my	1
name	1
for	1
Baal.	1
	1
23:28	1
The	1
prophet	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
dream,	1
let	1
him	1
tell	1
a	1
dream;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
my	1
word,	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
my	1
word	1
faithfully.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
chaff	1
to	1
the	1
wheat?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:29	1
Is	1
not	1
my	1
word	1
like	1
as	1
a	1
fire?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
hammer	1
that	1
breaketh	1
the	1
rock	1
in	1
pieces?	1
	1
23:30	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
steal	1
my	1
words	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
23:31	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
use	1
their	1
tongues,	1
and	1
say,	1
He	1
saith.	1
	1
23:32	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
prophesy	1
false	1
dreams,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
do	1
tell	1
them,	1
and	1
cause	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
err	1
by	1
their	1
lies,	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
lightness;	1
yet	1
I	1
sent	1
them	1
not,	1
nor	1
commanded	1
them:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
profit	1
this	1
people	1
at	1
all,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:33	1
And	1
when	1
this	1
people,	1
or	1
the	1
prophet,	1
or	1
a	1
priest,	1
shall	1
ask	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
thou	1
shalt	1
then	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
burden?	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
forsake	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:34	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
punish	1
that	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
23:35	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered?	1
and,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken?	1
	1
23:36	1
And	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
ye	1
mention	1
no	1
more:	1
for	1
every	1
man's	1
word	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
burden;	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
perverted	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
23:37	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
prophet,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
thee?	1
and,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken?	1
	1
23:38	1
But	1
since	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Because	1
ye	1
say	1
this	1
word,	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
say,	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
23:39	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
utterly	1
forget	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
forsake	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
fathers,	1
and	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
presence:	1
23:40	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
an	1
everlasting	1
reproach	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
shame,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
	1
24:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
me,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
two	1
baskets	1
of	1
figs	1
were	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
after	1
that	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
Jeconiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah,	1
with	1
the	1
carpenters	1
and	1
smiths,	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
24:2	1
One	1
basket	1
had	1
very	1
good	1
figs,	1
even	1
like	1
the	1
figs	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
ripe:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
basket	1
had	1
very	1
naughty	1
figs,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
bad.	1
	1
24:3	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou,	1
Jeremiah?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Figs;	1
the	1
good	1
figs,	1
very	1
good;	1
and	1
the	1
evil,	1
very	1
evil,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
evil.	1
	1
24:4	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
24:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Like	1
these	1
good	1
figs,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
of	1
Judah,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
for	1
their	1
good.	1
	1
24:6	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
good,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
this	1
land:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
them,	1
and	1
not	1
pull	1
them	1
down;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
them,	1
and	1
not	1
pluck	1
them	1
up.	1
	1
24:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
heart	1
to	1
know	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
whole	1
heart.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
evil	1
figs,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
evil;	1
surely	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
So	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
24:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
their	1
hurt,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
reproach	1
and	1
a	1
proverb,	1
a	1
taunt	1
and	1
a	1
curse,	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
whither	1
I	1
shall	1
drive	1
them.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
the	1
sword,	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
among	1
them,	1
till	1
they	1
be	1
consumed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
25:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
concerning	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
25:2	1
The	1
which	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
25:3	1
From	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amon	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
three	1
and	1
twentieth	1
year,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
rising	1
early	1
and	1
speaking;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened.	1
	1
25:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
rising	1
early	1
and	1
sending	1
them;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
your	1
ear	1
to	1
hear.	1
	1
25:5	1
They	1
said,	1
Turn	1
ye	1
again	1
now	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
fathers	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
25:6	1
And	1
go	1
not	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
worship	1
them,	1
and	1
provoke	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
your	1
hands;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
you	1
no	1
hurt.	1
	1
25:7	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
your	1
hands	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
hurt.	1
	1
25:8	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
my	1
words,	1
25:9	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
and	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
my	1
servant,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
against	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
these	1
nations	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
will	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
an	1
hissing,	1
and	1
perpetual	1
desolations.	1
	1
25:10	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
from	1
them	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mirth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
gladness,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bride,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
millstones,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
candle.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
this	1
whole	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment;	1
and	1
these	1
nations	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
seventy	1
years.	1
	1
25:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
seventy	1
years	1
are	1
accomplished,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
that	1
nation,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
perpetual	1
desolations.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
that	1
land	1
all	1
my	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced	1
against	1
it,	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book,	1
which	1
Jeremiah	1
hath	1
prophesied	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
25:14	1
For	1
many	1
nations	1
and	1
great	1
kings	1
shall	1
serve	1
themselves	1
of	1
them	1
also:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
deeds,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
25:15	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
me;	1
Take	1
the	1
wine	1
cup	1
of	1
this	1
fury	1
at	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
cause	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
send	1
thee,	1
to	1
drink	1
it.	1
	1
25:16	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
drink,	1
and	1
be	1
moved,	1
and	1
be	1
mad,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
25:17	1
Then	1
took	1
I	1
the	1
cup	1
at	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand,	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
to	1
drink,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
sent	1
me:	1
25:18	1
To	1
wit,	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof,	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
a	1
desolation,	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
an	1
hissing,	1
and	1
a	1
curse;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day;	1
25:19	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people;	1
25:20	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
mingled	1
people,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Uz,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
Ashkelon,	1
and	1
Azzah,	1
and	1
Ekron,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Ashdod,	1
25:21	1
Edom,	1
and	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
25:22	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
isles	1
which	1
are	1
beyond	1
the	1
sea,	1
25:23	1
Dedan,	1
and	1
Tema,	1
and	1
Buz,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
corners,	1
25:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
mingled	1
people	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
desert,	1
25:25	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Zimri,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Elam,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Medes,	1
25:26	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
far	1
and	1
near,	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sheshach	1
shall	1
drink	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
25:27	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Drink	1
ye,	1
and	1
be	1
drunken,	1
and	1
spue,	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
rise	1
no	1
more,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
25:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
they	1
refuse	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
cup	1
at	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
drink,	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Ye	1
shall	1
certainly	1
drink.	1
	1
25:29	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
bring	1
evil	1
on	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
should	1
ye	1
be	1
utterly	1
unpunished?	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unpunished:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
a	1
sword	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
25:30	1
Therefore	1
prophesy	1
thou	1
against	1
them	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
roar	1
from	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
his	1
holy	1
habitation;	1
he	1
shall	1
mightily	1
roar	1
upon	1
his	1
habitation;	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
a	1
shout,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
tread	1
the	1
grapes,	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
25:31	1
A	1
noise	1
shall	1
come	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
the	1
nations,	1
he	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
all	1
flesh;	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
wicked	1
to	1
the	1
sword,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:32	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Behold,	1
evil	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
nation	1
to	1
nation,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
whirlwind	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
25:33	1
And	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
lamented,	1
neither	1
gathered,	1
nor	1
buried;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
25:34	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
cry;	1
and	1
wallow	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
ashes,	1
ye	1
principal	1
of	1
the	1
flock:	1
for	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
slaughter	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
dispersions	1
are	1
accomplished;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
fall	1
like	1
a	1
pleasant	1
vessel.	1
	1
25:35	1
And	1
the	1
shepherds	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
flee,	1
nor	1
the	1
principal	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
to	1
escape.	1
	1
25:36	1
A	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
an	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
shall	1
be	1
heard:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoiled	1
their	1
pasture.	1
	1
25:37	1
And	1
the	1
peaceable	1
habitations	1
are	1
cut	1
down	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:38	1
He	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
his	1
covert,	1
as	1
the	1
lion:	1
for	1
their	1
land	1
is	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger.	1
	1
26:1	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
this	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
26:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Stand	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
worship	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them;	1
diminish	1
not	1
a	1
word:	1
26:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
they	1
will	1
hearken,	1
and	1
turn	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
repent	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
which	1
I	1
purpose	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
26:4	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
law,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
you,	1
26:5	1
To	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
whom	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you,	1
both	1
rising	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
sending	1
them,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened;	1
26:6	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
this	1
house	1
like	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
this	1
city	1
a	1
curse	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
26:7	1
So	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
Jeremiah	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:8	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jeremiah	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
26:9	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
This	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant?	1
	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
against	1
Jeremiah	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:10	1
When	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
then	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
king's	1
house	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house.	1
	1
26:11	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
unto	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
die;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
prophesied	1
against	1
this	1
city,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
with	1
your	1
ears.	1
	1
26:12	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
prophesy	1
against	1
this	1
house	1
and	1
against	1
this	1
city	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
heard.	1
	1
26:13	1
Therefore	1
now	1
amend	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
your	1
doings,	1
and	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
repent	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
pronounced	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
26:14	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
your	1
hand:	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
seemeth	1
good	1
and	1
meet	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
26:15	1
But	1
know	1
ye	1
for	1
certain,	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
put	1
me	1
to	1
death,	1
ye	1
shall	1
surely	1
bring	1
innocent	1
blood	1
upon	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
upon	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof:	1
for	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
speak	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
your	1
ears.	1
	1
26:16	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets;	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
die:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
26:17	1
Then	1
rose	1
up	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
26:18	1
Micah	1
the	1
Morasthite	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Zion	1
shall	1
be	1
plowed	1
like	1
a	1
field,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
become	1
heaps,	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
a	1
forest.	1
	1
26:19	1
Did	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
all	1
Judah	1
put	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
death?	1
	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
besought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
repented	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
pronounced	1
against	1
them?	1
Thus	1
might	1
we	1
procure	1
great	1
evil	1
against	1
our	1
souls.	1
	1
26:20	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Urijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shemaiah	1
of	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
who	1
prophesied	1
against	1
this	1
city	1
and	1
against	1
this	1
land	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jeremiah.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
when	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
king,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
princes,	1
heard	1
his	1
words,	1
the	1
king	1
sought	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death:	1
but	1
when	1
Urijah	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
26:22	1
And	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
men	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
namely,	1
Elnathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Achbor,	1
and	1
certain	1
men	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
they	1
fetched	1
forth	1
Urijah	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
king;	1
who	1
slew	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
cast	1
his	1
dead	1
body	1
into	1
the	1
graves	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
people.	1
	1
26:24	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan	1
was	1
with	1
Jeremiah,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
27:1	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
27:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
me;	1
Make	1
thee	1
bonds	1
and	1
yokes,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
thy	1
neck,	1
27:3	1
And	1
send	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
messengers	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah;	1
27:4	1
And	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
their	1
masters,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
your	1
masters;	1
27:5	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
by	1
my	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
outstretched	1
arm,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
unto	1
whom	1
it	1
seemed	1
meet	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
all	1
these	1
lands	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
him	1
also	1
to	1
serve	1
him.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
his	1
son's	1
son,	1
until	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
come:	1
and	1
then	1
many	1
nations	1
and	1
great	1
kings	1
shall	1
serve	1
themselves	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
27:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
kingdom	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
the	1
same	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
put	1
their	1
neck	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
nation	1
will	1
I	1
punish,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
consumed	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
27:9	1
Therefore	1
hearken	1
not	1
ye	1
to	1
your	1
prophets,	1
nor	1
to	1
your	1
diviners,	1
nor	1
to	1
your	1
dreamers,	1
nor	1
to	1
your	1
enchanters,	1
nor	1
to	1
your	1
sorcerers,	1
which	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
27:10	1
For	1
they	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
you,	1
to	1
remove	1
you	1
far	1
from	1
your	1
land;	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
drive	1
you	1
out,	1
and	1
ye	1
should	1
perish.	1
	1
27:11	1
But	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
bring	1
their	1
neck	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
serve	1
him,	1
those	1
will	1
I	1
let	1
remain	1
still	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
till	1
it,	1
and	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
27:12	1
I	1
spake	1
also	1
to	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
saying,	1
Bring	1
your	1
necks	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
live.	1
	1
27:13	1
Why	1
will	1
ye	1
die,	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
people,	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
against	1
the	1
nation	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon?	1
	1
27:14	1
Therefore	1
hearken	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
for	1
they	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
27:15	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sent	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
yet	1
they	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
in	1
my	1
name;	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
drive	1
you	1
out,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
perish,	1
ye,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
27:16	1
Also	1
I	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Hearken	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
your	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
shall	1
now	1
shortly	1
be	1
brought	1
again	1
from	1
Babylon:	1
for	1
they	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
27:17	1
Hearken	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
live:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
this	1
city	1
be	1
laid	1
waste?	1
	1
27:18	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
prophets,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
them,	1
let	1
them	1
now	1
make	1
intercession	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
the	1
vessels	1
which	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
go	1
not	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
27:19	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
concerning	1
the	1
pillars,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
bases,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
27:20	1
Which	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
took	1
not,	1
when	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
Jeconiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem;	1
27:21	1
Yea,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
concerning	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
27:22	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
visit	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
restore	1
them	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
that	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azur	1
the	1
prophet,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Gibeon,	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
28:2	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
28:3	1
Within	1
two	1
full	1
years	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
again	1
into	1
this	1
place	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
took	1
away	1
from	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
to	1
Babylon:	1
28:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
to	1
this	1
place	1
Jeconiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
captives	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
went	1
into	1
Babylon,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
28:5	1
Then	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
prophet	1
Hananiah	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
28:6	1
Even	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
said,	1
Amen:	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
so:	1
the	1
LORD	1
perform	1
thy	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
prophesied,	1
to	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
carried	1
away	1
captive,	1
from	1
Babylon	1
into	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
28:7	1
Nevertheless	1
hear	1
thou	1
now	1
this	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
thine	1
ears,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people;	1
28:8	1
The	1
prophets	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
before	1
thee	1
of	1
old	1
prophesied	1
both	1
against	1
many	1
countries,	1
and	1
against	1
great	1
kingdoms,	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
of	1
evil,	1
and	1
of	1
pestilence.	1
	1
28:9	1
The	1
prophet	1
which	1
prophesieth	1
of	1
peace,	1
when	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
prophet	1
be	1
known,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
truly	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
28:10	1
Then	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
took	1
the	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah's	1
neck,	1
and	1
brake	1
it.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
Hananiah	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Even	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
from	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
within	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
full	1
years.	1
And	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
28:12	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
after	1
that	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
28:13	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
Hananiah,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
the	1
yokes	1
of	1
wood;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
for	1
them	1
yokes	1
of	1
iron.	1
	1
28:14	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
a	1
yoke	1
of	1
iron	1
upon	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
nations,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
serve	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
also.	1
	1
28:15	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
Hear	1
now,	1
Hananiah;	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
sent	1
thee;	1
but	1
thou	1
makest	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
a	1
lie.	1
	1
28:16	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
thee	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
this	1
year	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
rebellion	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:17	1
So	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
died	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month.	1
	1
29:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
that	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
sent	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
which	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
captives,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
whom	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
had	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Babylon;	1
29:2	1
(After	1
that	1
Jeconiah	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
the	1
queen,	1
and	1
the	1
eunuchs,	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
carpenters,	1
and	1
the	1
smiths,	1
were	1
departed	1
from	1
Jerusalem;)	1
29:3	1
By	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Elasah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
and	1
Gemariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
(whom	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
sent	1
unto	1
Babylon	1
to	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon)	1
saying,	1
29:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
away	1
captives,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Babylon;	1
29:5	1
Build	1
ye	1
houses,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
plant	1
gardens,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them;	1
29:6	1
Take	1
ye	1
wives,	1
and	1
beget	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters;	1
and	1
take	1
wives	1
for	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
give	1
your	1
daughters	1
to	1
husbands,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
bear	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
increased	1
there,	1
and	1
not	1
diminished.	1
	1
29:7	1
And	1
seek	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captives,	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
it:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
peace	1
thereof	1
shall	1
ye	1
have	1
peace.	1
	1
29:8	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
prophets	1
and	1
your	1
diviners,	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
you,	1
deceive	1
you,	1
neither	1
hearken	1
to	1
your	1
dreams	1
which	1
ye	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
dreamed.	1
	1
29:9	1
For	1
they	1
prophesy	1
falsely	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sent	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:10	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
That	1
after	1
seventy	1
years	1
be	1
accomplished	1
at	1
Babylon	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
you,	1
and	1
perform	1
my	1
good	1
word	1
toward	1
you,	1
in	1
causing	1
you	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
29:11	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
toward	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thoughts	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
evil,	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
expected	1
end.	1
	1
29:12	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
call	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
29:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
find	1
me,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
search	1
for	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
29:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
away	1
your	1
captivity,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
you	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
whence	1
I	1
caused	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captive.	1
	1
29:15	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
raised	1
us	1
up	1
prophets	1
in	1
Babylon;	1
29:16	1
Know	1
that	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
gone	1
forth	1
with	1
you	1
into	1
captivity;	1
29:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
sword,	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
like	1
vile	1
figs,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
evil.	1
	1
29:18	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
persecute	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
with	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
curse,	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
an	1
hissing,	1
and	1
a	1
reproach,	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
them:	1
29:19	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
to	1
my	1
words,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
rising	1
up	1
early	1
and	1
sending	1
them;	1
but	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
hear,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:20	1
Hear	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Babylon:	1
29:21	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
of	1
Ahab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kolaiah,	1
and	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah,	1
which	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
name;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
them	1
before	1
your	1
eyes;	1
29:22	1
And	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
up	1
a	1
curse	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Babylon,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
make	1
thee	1
like	1
Zedekiah	1
and	1
like	1
Ahab,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
roasted	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
29:23	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
villany	1
in	1
Israel,	1
and	1
have	1
committed	1
adultery	1
with	1
their	1
neighbours'	1
wives,	1
and	1
have	1
spoken	1
lying	1
words	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
commanded	1
them;	1
even	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
am	1
a	1
witness,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:24	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
also	1
speak	1
to	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
Nehelamite,	1
saying,	1
29:25	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
letters	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
29:26	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
priest	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
officers	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
mad,	1
and	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
prophet,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stocks.	1
	1
29:27	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
reproved	1
Jeremiah	1
of	1
Anathoth,	1
which	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
prophet	1
to	1
you?	1
	1
29:28	1
For	1
therefore	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
Babylon,	1
saying,	1
This	1
captivity	1
is	1
long:	1
build	1
ye	1
houses,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
plant	1
gardens,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
29:29	1
And	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
priest	1
read	1
this	1
letter	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
29:30	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
29:31	1
Send	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
Nehelamite;	1
Because	1
that	1
Shemaiah	1
hath	1
prophesied	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
not,	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
you	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
a	1
lie:	1
29:32	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
Nehelamite,	1
and	1
his	1
seed:	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
dwell	1
among	1
this	1
people;	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
behold	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
my	1
people,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
taught	1
rebellion	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
30:2	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Write	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
book.	1
	1
30:3	1
For,	1
lo,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
30:4	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
concerning	1
Israel	1
and	1
concerning	1
Judah.	1
	1
30:5	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
trembling,	1
of	1
fear,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
30:6	1
Ask	1
ye	1
now,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
a	1
man	1
doth	1
travail	1
with	1
child?	1
wherefore	1
do	1
I	1
see	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
loins,	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail,	1
and	1
all	1
faces	1
are	1
turned	1
into	1
paleness?	1
	1
30:7	1
Alas!	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
is	1
great,	1
so	1
that	1
none	1
is	1
like	1
it:	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Jacob's	1
trouble,	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
30:8	1
For	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
neck,	1
and	1
will	1
burst	1
thy	1
bonds,	1
and	1
strangers	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
serve	1
themselves	1
of	1
him:	1
30:9	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
David	1
their	1
king,	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
30:10	1
Therefore	1
fear	1
thou	1
not,	1
O	1
my	1
servant	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
neither	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
for,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
thee	1
from	1
afar,	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
captivity;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
rest,	1
and	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
afraid.	1
	1
30:11	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
save	1
thee:	1
though	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
scattered	1
thee,	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
of	1
thee:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
correct	1
thee	1
in	1
measure,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
thee	1
altogether	1
unpunished.	1
	1
30:12	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thy	1
bruise	1
is	1
incurable,	1
and	1
thy	1
wound	1
is	1
grievous.	1
	1
30:13	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
plead	1
thy	1
cause,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
bound	1
up:	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
healing	1
medicines.	1
	1
30:14	1
All	1
thy	1
lovers	1
have	1
forgotten	1
thee;	1
they	1
seek	1
thee	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
wounded	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
wound	1
of	1
an	1
enemy,	1
with	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
a	1
cruel	1
one,	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity;	1
because	1
thy	1
sins	1
were	1
increased.	1
	1
30:15	1
Why	1
criest	1
thou	1
for	1
thine	1
affliction?	1
thy	1
sorrow	1
is	1
incurable	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity:	1
because	1
thy	1
sins	1
were	1
increased,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
30:16	1
Therefore	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
devour	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured;	1
and	1
all	1
thine	1
adversaries,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
spoil	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
spoil,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
prey	1
upon	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
for	1
a	1
prey.	1
	1
30:17	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
health	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
thee	1
of	1
thy	1
wounds,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
because	1
they	1
called	1
thee	1
an	1
Outcast,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
Zion,	1
whom	1
no	1
man	1
seeketh	1
after.	1
	1
30:18	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jacob's	1
tents,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
his	1
dwellingplaces;	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
builded	1
upon	1
her	1
own	1
heap,	1
and	1
the	1
palace	1
shall	1
remain	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
thereof.	1
	1
30:19	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
proceed	1
thanksgiving	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
make	1
merry:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
few;	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
glorify	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
small.	1
	1
30:20	1
Their	1
children	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
aforetime,	1
and	1
their	1
congregation	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
all	1
that	1
oppress	1
them.	1
	1
30:21	1
And	1
their	1
nobles	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
themselves,	1
and	1
their	1
governor	1
shall	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
draw	1
near,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
approach	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
engaged	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
approach	1
unto	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
30:23	1
Behold,	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
goeth	1
forth	1
with	1
fury,	1
a	1
continuing	1
whirlwind:	1
it	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
pain	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
30:24	1
The	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
not	1
return,	1
until	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
it,	1
and	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
performed	1
the	1
intents	1
of	1
his	1
heart:	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
consider	1
it.	1
	1
31:1	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
31:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
people	1
which	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
even	1
Israel,	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
rest.	1
	1
31:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
appeared	1
of	1
old	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Yea,	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee	1
with	1
an	1
everlasting	1
love:	1
therefore	1
with	1
lovingkindness	1
have	1
I	1
drawn	1
thee.	1
	1
31:4	1
Again	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
built,	1
O	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
again	1
be	1
adorned	1
with	1
thy	1
tabrets,	1
and	1
shalt	1
go	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
dances	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
make	1
merry.	1
	1
31:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
yet	1
plant	1
vines	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
the	1
planters	1
shall	1
plant,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
as	1
common	1
things.	1
	1
31:6	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
watchmen	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
cry,	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Zion	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
31:7	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Sing	1
with	1
gladness	1
for	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
shout	1
among	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
nations:	1
publish	1
ye,	1
praise	1
ye,	1
and	1
say,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
save	1
thy	1
people,	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
31:8	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
country,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame,	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
child	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
travaileth	1
with	1
child	1
together:	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
shall	1
return	1
thither.	1
	1
31:9	1
They	1
shall	1
come	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
with	1
supplications	1
will	1
I	1
lead	1
them:	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
waters	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
way,	1
wherein	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
stumble:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
Israel,	1
and	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
my	1
firstborn.	1
	1
31:10	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
ye	1
nations,	1
and	1
declare	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
isles	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
say,	1
He	1
that	1
scattered	1
Israel	1
will	1
gather	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd	1
doth	1
his	1
flock.	1
	1
31:11	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
ransomed	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
31:12	1
Therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
sing	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
shall	1
flow	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
wheat,	1
and	1
for	1
wine,	1
and	1
for	1
oil,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
herd:	1
and	1
their	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
watered	1
garden;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
sorrow	1
any	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
31:13	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
virgin	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
dance,	1
both	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
old	1
together:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
their	1
mourning	1
into	1
joy,	1
and	1
will	1
comfort	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
rejoice	1
from	1
their	1
sorrow.	1
	1
31:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
satiate	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
with	1
fatness,	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
my	1
goodness,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
A	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
Ramah,	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
bitter	1
weeping;	1
Rahel	1
weeping	1
for	1
her	1
children	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
comforted	1
for	1
her	1
children,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not.	1
	1
31:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Refrain	1
thy	1
voice	1
from	1
weeping,	1
and	1
thine	1
eyes	1
from	1
tears:	1
for	1
thy	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
rewarded,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
31:17	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
hope	1
in	1
thine	1
end,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thy	1
children	1
shall	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
border.	1
	1
31:18	1
I	1
have	1
surely	1
heard	1
Ephraim	1
bemoaning	1
himself	1
thus;	1
Thou	1
hast	1
chastised	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
chastised,	1
as	1
a	1
bullock	1
unaccustomed	1
to	1
the	1
yoke:	1
turn	1
thou	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
turned;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
31:19	1
Surely	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
turned,	1
I	1
repented;	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
instructed,	1
I	1
smote	1
upon	1
my	1
thigh:	1
I	1
was	1
ashamed,	1
yea,	1
even	1
confounded,	1
because	1
I	1
did	1
bear	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
31:20	1
Is	1
Ephraim	1
my	1
dear	1
son?	1
is	1
he	1
a	1
pleasant	1
child?	1
for	1
since	1
I	1
spake	1
against	1
him,	1
I	1
do	1
earnestly	1
remember	1
him	1
still:	1
therefore	1
my	1
bowels	1
are	1
troubled	1
for	1
him;	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
him,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:21	1
Set	1
thee	1
up	1
waymarks,	1
make	1
thee	1
high	1
heaps:	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
toward	1
the	1
highway,	1
even	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
thou	1
wentest:	1
turn	1
again,	1
O	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel,	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
these	1
thy	1
cities.	1
	1
31:22	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
about,	1
O	1
thou	1
backsliding	1
daughter?	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
created	1
a	1
new	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
A	1
woman	1
shall	1
compass	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
31:23	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
As	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
use	1
this	1
speech	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
their	1
captivity;	1
The	1
LORD	1
bless	1
thee,	1
O	1
habitation	1
of	1
justice,	1
and	1
mountain	1
of	1
holiness.	1
	1
31:24	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
Judah	1
itself,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
together,	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
flocks.	1
	1
31:25	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
satiated	1
the	1
weary	1
soul,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
replenished	1
every	1
sorrowful	1
soul.	1
	1
31:26	1
Upon	1
this	1
I	1
awaked,	1
and	1
beheld;	1
and	1
my	1
sleep	1
was	1
sweet	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
31:27	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
sow	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
with	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
beast.	1
	1
31:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
like	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
watched	1
over	1
them,	1
to	1
pluck	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
break	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
throw	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy,	1
and	1
to	1
afflict;	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
watch	1
over	1
them,	1
to	1
build,	1
and	1
to	1
plant,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:29	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
no	1
more,	1
The	1
fathers	1
have	1
eaten	1
a	1
sour	1
grape,	1
and	1
the	1
children's	1
teeth	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
edge.	1
	1
31:30	1
But	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
die	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
iniquity:	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
eateth	1
the	1
sour	1
grape,	1
his	1
teeth	1
shall	1
be	1
set	1
on	1
edge.	1
	1
31:31	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
31:32	1
Not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
which	1
my	1
covenant	1
they	1
brake,	1
although	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
husband	1
unto	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
31:33	1
But	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
After	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
law	1
in	1
their	1
inward	1
parts,	1
and	1
write	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
hearts;	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
31:34	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
teach	1
no	1
more	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
Know	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
all	1
know	1
me,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
forgive	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
their	1
sin	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
31:35	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
giveth	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
by	1
night,	1
which	1
divideth	1
the	1
sea	1
when	1
the	1
waves	1
thereof	1
roar;	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name:	1
31:36	1
If	1
those	1
ordinances	1
depart	1
from	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel	1
also	1
shall	1
cease	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
nation	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
31:37	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
If	1
heaven	1
above	1
can	1
be	1
measured,	1
and	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
searched	1
out	1
beneath,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:38	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Hananeel	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
corner.	1
	1
31:39	1
And	1
the	1
measuring	1
line	1
shall	1
yet	1
go	1
forth	1
over	1
against	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
hill	1
Gareb,	1
and	1
shall	1
compass	1
about	1
to	1
Goath.	1
	1
31:40	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ashes,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fields	1
unto	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
Kidron,	1
unto	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
gate	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
plucked	1
up,	1
nor	1
thrown	1
down	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
32:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
year	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar.	1
	1
32:2	1
For	1
then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
army	1
besieged	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah's	1
house.	1
	1
32:3	1
For	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
shut	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Wherefore	1
dost	1
thou	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
city	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
it;	1
32:4	1
And	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
not	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
but	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
shall	1
speak	1
with	1
him	1
mouth	1
to	1
mouth,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
his	1
eyes;	1
32:5	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
lead	1
Zedekiah	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
until	1
I	1
visit	1
him,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
though	1
ye	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
Jeremiah	1
said,	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
32:7	1
Behold,	1
Hanameel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shallum	1
thine	1
uncle	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
saying,	1
Buy	1
thee	1
my	1
field	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Anathoth:	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
redemption	1
is	1
thine	1
to	1
buy	1
it.	1
	1
32:8	1
So	1
Hanameel	1
mine	1
uncle's	1
son	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Buy	1
my	1
field,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Anathoth,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
inheritance	1
is	1
thine,	1
and	1
the	1
redemption	1
is	1
thine;	1
buy	1
it	1
for	1
thyself.	1
	1
Then	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:9	1
And	1
I	1
bought	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Hanameel	1
my	1
uncle's	1
son,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Anathoth,	1
and	1
weighed	1
him	1
the	1
money,	1
even	1
seventeen	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
32:10	1
And	1
I	1
subscribed	1
the	1
evidence,	1
and	1
sealed	1
it,	1
and	1
took	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
weighed	1
him	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
balances.	1
	1
32:11	1
So	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
purchase,	1
both	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sealed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
custom,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
open:	1
32:12	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
purchase	1
unto	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Hanameel	1
mine	1
uncle's	1
son,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
witnesses	1
that	1
subscribed	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
purchase,	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
32:13	1
And	1
I	1
charged	1
Baruch	1
before	1
them,	1
saying,	1
32:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Take	1
these	1
evidences,	1
this	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
purchase,	1
both	1
which	1
is	1
sealed,	1
and	1
this	1
evidence	1
which	1
is	1
open;	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
an	1
earthen	1
vessel,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
continue	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
32:15	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Houses	1
and	1
fields	1
and	1
vineyards	1
shall	1
be	1
possessed	1
again	1
in	1
this	1
land.	1
	1
32:16	1
Now	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
delivered	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
purchase	1
unto	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah,	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
32:17	1
Ah	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
thy	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
thee:	1
32:18	1
Thou	1
shewest	1
lovingkindness	1
unto	1
thousands,	1
and	1
recompensest	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
into	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
their	1
children	1
after	1
them:	1
the	1
Great,	1
the	1
Mighty	1
God,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
32:19	1
Great	1
in	1
counsel,	1
and	1
mighty	1
in	1
work:	1
for	1
thine	1
eyes	1
are	1
open	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
