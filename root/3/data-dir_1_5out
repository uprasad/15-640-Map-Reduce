	1
7:25	1
Then	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he,	1
whom	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
kill?	1
	1
7:26	1
But,	1
lo,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
boldly,	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
nothing	1
unto	1
him.	1
Do	1
the	1
rulers	1
know	1
indeed	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
Christ?	1
7:27	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
know	1
this	1
man	1
whence	1
he	1
is:	1
but	1
when	1
Christ	1
cometh,	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
whence	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
7:28	1
Then	1
cried	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
as	1
he	1
taught,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
both	1
know	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
whence	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
of	1
myself,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
true,	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
7:29	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
him:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:30	1
Then	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
him:	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
because	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
believed	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
When	1
Christ	1
cometh,	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
more	1
miracles	1
than	1
these	1
which	1
this	1
man	1
hath	1
done?	1
7:32	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
murmured	1
such	1
things	1
concerning	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
sent	1
officers	1
to	1
take	1
him.	1
	1
7:33	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:34	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
thither	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
7:35	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Whither	1
will	1
he	1
go,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
him?	1
will	1
he	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
dispersed	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
teach	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
	1
7:36	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
saying	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
thither	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come?	1
	1
7:37	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
day,	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast,	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
thirst,	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
7:38	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
scripture	1
hath	1
said,	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
belly	1
shall	1
flow	1
rivers	1
of	1
living	1
water.	1
	1
7:39	1
(But	1
this	1
spake	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
which	1
they	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
should	1
receive:	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
given;	1
because	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
glorified.)	1
	1
7:40	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
saying,	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Prophet.	1
	1
7:41	1
Others	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
Christ.	1
But	1
some	1
said,	1
Shall	1
Christ	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Galilee?	1
	1
7:42	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
scripture	1
said,	1
That	1
Christ	1
cometh	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Bethlehem,	1
where	1
David	1
was?	1
	1
7:43	1
So	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:44	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
him;	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
7:45	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees;	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
brought	1
him?	1
	1
7:46	1
The	1
officers	1
answered,	1
Never	1
man	1
spake	1
like	1
this	1
man.	1
	1
7:47	1
Then	1
answered	1
them	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
Are	1
ye	1
also	1
deceived?	1
	1
7:48	1
Have	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
believed	1
on	1
him?	1
	1
7:49	1
But	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
knoweth	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
cursed.	1
	1
7:50	1
Nicodemus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
(he	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
them,)	1
7:51	1
Doth	1
our	1
law	1
judge	1
any	1
man,	1
before	1
it	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
doeth?	1
	1
7:52	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
also	1
of	1
Galilee?	1
	1
Search,	1
and	1
look:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
Galilee	1
ariseth	1
no	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:53	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
went	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
8:1	1
Jesus	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
taught	1
them.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
woman	1
taken	1
in	1
adultery;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
8:4	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
taken	1
in	1
adultery,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act.	1
	1
8:5	1
Now	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
commanded	1
us,	1
that	1
such	1
should	1
be	1
stoned:	1
but	1
what	1
sayest	1
thou?	1
	1
8:6	1
This	1
they	1
said,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
accuse	1
him.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
8:7	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
continued	1
asking	1
him,	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
himself,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
without	1
sin	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
first	1
cast	1
a	1
stone	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
heard	1
it,	1
being	1
convicted	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
conscience,	1
went	1
out	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
eldest,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
last:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
8:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
himself,	1
and	1
saw	1
none	1
but	1
the	1
woman,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
where	1
are	1
those	1
thine	1
accusers?	1
hath	1
no	1
man	1
condemned	1
thee?	1
	1
8:11	1
She	1
said,	1
No	1
man,	1
Lord.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Neither	1
do	1
I	1
condemn	1
thee:	1
go,	1
and	1
sin	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
8:12	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
he	1
that	1
followeth	1
me	1
shall	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness,	1
but	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
8:13	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
bearest	1
record	1
of	1
thyself;	1
thy	1
record	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
	1
8:14	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Though	1
I	1
bear	1
record	1
of	1
myself,	1
yet	1
my	1
record	1
is	1
true:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
whence	1
I	1
came,	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go;	1
but	1
ye	1
cannot	1
tell	1
whence	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
8:15	1
Ye	1
judge	1
after	1
the	1
flesh;	1
I	1
judge	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
yet	1
if	1
I	1
judge,	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
true:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
alone,	1
but	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
8:17	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
law,	1
that	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
two	1
men	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
8:18	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
that	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
myself,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
beareth	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
thy	1
Father?	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Ye	1
neither	1
know	1
me,	1
nor	1
my	1
Father:	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
my	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
8:20	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
treasury,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him;	1
for	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
8:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
go	1
my	1
way,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins:	1
whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
8:22	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Will	1
he	1
kill	1
himself?	1
because	1
he	1
saith,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
from	1
beneath;	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
above:	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
this	1
world;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
8:24	1
I	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins:	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
8:25	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Even	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
8:26	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
you:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
true;	1
and	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:27	1
They	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
8:28	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
have	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
myself;	1
but	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
taught	1
me,	1
I	1
speak	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
with	1
me:	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
me	1
alone;	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
always	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
please	1
him.	1
	1
8:30	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
words,	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
those	1
Jews	1
which	1
believed	1
on	1
him,	1
If	1
ye	1
continue	1
in	1
my	1
word,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
my	1
disciples	1
indeed;	1
8:32	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
free.	1
	1
8:33	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
be	1
Abraham's	1
seed,	1
and	1
were	1
never	1
in	1
bondage	1
to	1
any	1
man:	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
free?	1
	1
8:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
committeth	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
8:35	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
abideth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
abideth	1
ever.	1
	1
8:36	1
If	1
the	1
Son	1
therefore	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
free,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
free	1
indeed.	1
	1
8:37	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
Abraham's	1
seed;	1
but	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
because	1
my	1
word	1
hath	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:38	1
I	1
speak	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
8:39	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Abraham	1
is	1
our	1
father.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
Abraham's	1
children,	1
ye	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
8:40	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
God:	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
Abraham.	1
	1
8:41	1
Ye	1
do	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
your	1
father.	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
to	1
him,	1
We	1
be	1
not	1
born	1
of	1
fornication;	1
we	1
have	1
one	1
Father,	1
even	1
God.	1
	1
8:42	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
God	1
were	1
your	1
Father,	1
ye	1
would	1
love	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
proceeded	1
forth	1
and	1
came	1
from	1
God;	1
neither	1
came	1
I	1
of	1
myself,	1
but	1
he	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
8:43	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
understand	1
my	1
speech?	1
even	1
because	1
ye	1
cannot	1
hear	1
my	1
word.	1
	1
8:44	1
Ye	1
are	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
ye	1
will	1
do.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
murderer	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
abode	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
truth,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
truth	1
in	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
speaketh	1
a	1
lie,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
of	1
his	1
own:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
8:45	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
ye	1
believe	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
8:46	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
convinceth	1
me	1
of	1
sin?	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
truth,	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
believe	1
me?	1
	1
8:47	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
heareth	1
God's	1
words:	1
ye	1
therefore	1
hear	1
them	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:48	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
we	1
not	1
well	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
Samaritan,	1
and	1
hast	1
a	1
devil?	1
	1
8:49	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
devil;	1
but	1
I	1
honour	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
dishonour	1
me.	1
	1
8:50	1
And	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
glory:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
seeketh	1
and	1
judgeth.	1
	1
8:51	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
keep	1
my	1
saying,	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
death.	1
	1
8:52	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
him,	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
Abraham	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
and	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
keep	1
my	1
saying,	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
taste	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
8:53	1
Art	1
thou	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
is	1
dead?	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
are	1
dead:	1
whom	1
makest	1
thou	1
thyself?	1
	1
8:54	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
If	1
I	1
honour	1
myself,	1
my	1
honour	1
is	1
nothing:	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
Father	1
that	1
honoureth	1
me;	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
say,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
God:	1
8:55	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
not,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
liar	1
like	1
unto	1
you:	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
saying.	1
	1
8:56	1
Your	1
father	1
Abraham	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
day:	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
glad.	1
	1
8:57	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
yet	1
fifty	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
Abraham?	1
	1
8:58	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Before	1
Abraham	1
was,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
8:59	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
up	1
stones	1
to	1
cast	1
at	1
him:	1
but	1
Jesus	1
hid	1
himself,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
passed	1
by.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
as	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
blind	1
from	1
his	1
birth.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
who	1
did	1
sin,	1
this	1
man,	1
or	1
his	1
parents,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
blind?	1
	1
9:3	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Neither	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
sinned,	1
nor	1
his	1
parents:	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
9:4	1
I	1
must	1
work	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
day:	1
the	1
night	1
cometh,	1
when	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
work.	1
	1
9:5	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
9:6	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
spat	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
made	1
clay	1
of	1
the	1
spittle,	1
and	1
he	1
anointed	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
clay,	1
9:7	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
wash	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Siloam,	1
(which	1
is	1
by	1
interpretation,	1
Sent.)	1
He	1
went	1
his	1
way	1
therefore,	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
came	1
seeing.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
neighbours	1
therefore,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
before	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
blind,	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
and	1
begged?	1
	1
9:9	1
Some	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
he:	1
others	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
like	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
9:10	1
Therefore	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
were	1
thine	1
eyes	1
opened?	1
	1
9:11	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Jesus	1
made	1
clay,	1
and	1
anointed	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Siloam,	1
and	1
wash:	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
I	1
received	1
sight.	1
	1
9:12	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
He	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
9:13	1
They	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
him	1
that	1
aforetime	1
was	1
blind.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
when	1
Jesus	1
made	1
the	1
clay,	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:15	1
Then	1
again	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sight.	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
put	1
clay	1
upon	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
I	1
washed,	1
and	1
do	1
see.	1
	1
9:16	1
Therefore	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
he	1
keepeth	1
not	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
Others	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
sinner	1
do	1
such	1
miracles?	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
again,	1
What	1
sayest	1
thou	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
opened	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
He	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
9:18	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
concerning	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
blind,	1
and	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
until	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
parents	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
son,	1
who	1
ye	1
say	1
was	1
born	1
blind?	1
how	1
then	1
doth	1
he	1
now	1
see?	1
	1
9:20	1
His	1
parents	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
our	1
son,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
blind:	1
9:21	1
But	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
now	1
seeth,	1
we	1
know	1
not;	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
we	1
know	1
not:	1
he	1
is	1
of	1
age;	1
ask	1
him:	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
9:22	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
his	1
parents,	1
because	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
Jews:	1
for	1
the	1
Jews	1
had	1
agreed	1
already,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
did	1
confess	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Christ,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue.	1
	1
9:23	1
Therefore	1
said	1
his	1
parents,	1
He	1
is	1
of	1
age;	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
9:24	1
Then	1
again	1
called	1
they	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
blind,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
God	1
the	1
praise:	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
9:25	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Whether	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
sinner	1
or	1
no,	1
I	1
know	1
not:	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
know,	1
that,	1
whereas	1
I	1
was	1
blind,	1
now	1
I	1
see.	1
	1
9:26	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
to	1
him	1
again,	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
to	1
thee?	1
how	1
opened	1
he	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
	1
9:27	1
He	1
answered	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
already,	1
and	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
hear:	1
wherefore	1
would	1
ye	1
hear	1
it	1
again?	1
will	1
ye	1
also	1
be	1
his	1
disciples?	1
	1
9:28	1
Then	1
they	1
reviled	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
his	1
disciple;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
Moses'	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:29	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses:	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
fellow,	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
9:30	1
The	1
man	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
herein	1
is	1
a	1
marvellous	1
thing,	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
hath	1
opened	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:31	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
heareth	1
not	1
sinners:	1
but	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
a	1
worshipper	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
doeth	1
his	1
will,	1
him	1
he	1
heareth.	1
	1
9:32	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
heard	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
blind.	1
	1
9:33	1
If	1
this	1
man	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing.	1
	1
9:34	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
wast	1
altogether	1
born	1
in	1
sins,	1
and	1
dost	1
thou	1
teach	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
9:35	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dost	1
thou	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
9:36	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
he,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
believe	1
on	1
him?	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
both	1
seen	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
talketh	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
believe.	1
And	1
he	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
9:39	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
For	1
judgment	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
see	1
not	1
might	1
see;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
see	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
blind.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Are	1
we	1
blind	1
also?	1
	1
9:41	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
blind,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
ye	1
say,	1
We	1
see;	1
therefore	1
your	1
sin	1
remaineth.	1
	1
10:1	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
entereth	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
sheepfold,	1
but	1
climbeth	1
up	1
some	1
other	1
way,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
thief	1
and	1
a	1
robber.	1
	1
10:2	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
entereth	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
the	1
shepherd	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:3	1
To	1
him	1
the	1
porter	1
openeth;	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
hear	1
his	1
voice:	1
and	1
he	1
calleth	1
his	1
own	1
sheep	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
leadeth	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
putteth	1
forth	1
his	1
own	1
sheep,	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
follow	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
a	1
stranger	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
follow,	1
but	1
will	1
flee	1
from	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
strangers.	1
	1
10:6	1
This	1
parable	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
what	1
things	1
they	1
were	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
10:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them	1
again,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:8	1
All	1
that	1
ever	1
came	1
before	1
me	1
are	1
thieves	1
and	1
robbers:	1
but	1
the	1
sheep	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
10:9	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
door:	1
by	1
me	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
enter	1
in,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
out,	1
and	1
find	1
pasture.	1
	1
10:10	1
The	1
thief	1
cometh	1
not,	1
but	1
for	1
to	1
steal,	1
and	1
to	1
kill,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy:	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
it	1
more	1
abundantly.	1
	1
10:11	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd:	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
giveth	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:12	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
whose	1
own	1
the	1
sheep	1
are	1
not,	1
seeth	1
the	1
wolf	1
coming,	1
and	1
leaveth	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
fleeth:	1
and	1
the	1
wolf	1
catcheth	1
them,	1
and	1
scattereth	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:13	1
The	1
hireling	1
fleeth,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
careth	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:14	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
know	1
my	1
sheep,	1
and	1
am	1
known	1
of	1
mine.	1
	1
10:15	1
As	1
the	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
me,	1
even	1
so	1
know	1
I	1
the	1
Father:	1
and	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
other	1
sheep	1
I	1
have,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
fold:	1
them	1
also	1
I	1
must	1
bring,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
voice;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
fold,	1
and	1
one	1
shepherd.	1
	1
10:17	1
Therefore	1
doth	1
my	1
Father	1
love	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
10:18	1
No	1
man	1
taketh	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
lay	1
it	1
down	1
of	1
myself.	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
lay	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
again.	1
This	1
commandment	1
have	1
I	1
received	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
10:19	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
therefore	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
for	1
these	1
sayings.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil,	1
and	1
is	1
mad;	1
why	1
hear	1
ye	1
him?	1
	1
10:21	1
Others	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
Can	1
a	1
devil	1
open	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind?	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
dedication,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
winter.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
in	1
Solomon's	1
porch.	1
	1
10:24	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
Jews	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
long	1
dost	1
thou	1
make	1
us	1
to	1
doubt?	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Christ,	1
tell	1
us	1
plainly.	1
	1
10:25	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
believed	1
not:	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
name,	1
they	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:26	1
But	1
ye	1
believe	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
my	1
sheep,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:27	1
My	1
sheep	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
follow	1
me:	1
10:28	1
And	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
eternal	1
life;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
never	1
perish,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
	1
10:29	1
My	1
Father,	1
which	1
gave	1
them	1
me,	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
all;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
Father's	1
hand.	1
	1
10:30	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
are	1
one.	1
	1
10:31	1
Then	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
up	1
stones	1
again	1
to	1
stone	1
him.	1
	1
10:32	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Many	1
good	1
works	1
have	1
I	1
shewed	1
you	1
from	1
my	1
Father;	1
for	1
which	1
of	1
those	1
works	1
do	1
ye	1
stone	1
me?	1
	1
10:33	1
The	1
Jews	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
For	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
we	1
stone	1
thee	1
not;	1
but	1
for	1
blasphemy;	1
and	1
because	1
that	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
man,	1
makest	1
thyself	1
God.	1
	1
10:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
law,	1
I	1
said,	1
Ye	1
are	1
gods?	1
	1
10:35	1
If	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
gods,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
scripture	1
cannot	1
be	1
broken;	1
10:36	1
Say	1
ye	1
of	1
him,	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
Thou	1
blasphemest;	1
because	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
10:37	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
believe	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
10:38	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
do,	1
though	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
me,	1
believe	1
the	1
works:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know,	1
and	1
believe,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sought	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
escaped	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand,	1
10:40	1
And	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
beyond	1
Jordan	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
John	1
at	1
first	1
baptized;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
abode.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
many	1
resorted	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
John	1
did	1
no	1
miracle:	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
John	1
spake	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
were	1
true.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
was	1
sick,	1
named	1
Lazarus,	1
of	1
Bethany,	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
Martha.	1
	1
11:2	1
(It	1
was	1
that	1
Mary	1
which	1
anointed	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
ointment,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
her	1
hair,	1
whose	1
brother	1
Lazarus	1
was	1
sick.)	1
	1
11:3	1
Therefore	1
his	1
sisters	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
lovest	1
is	1
sick.	1
	1
11:4	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
sickness	1
is	1
not	1
unto	1
death,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
glorified	1
thereby.	1
	1
11:5	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
Martha,	1
and	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
Lazarus.	1
	1
11:6	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
therefore	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sick,	1
he	1
abode	1
two	1
days	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
11:7	1
Then	1
after	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
Judaea	1
again.	1
	1
11:8	1
His	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
late	1
sought	1
to	1
stone	1
thee;	1
and	1
goest	1
thou	1
thither	1
again?	1
	1
11:9	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Are	1
there	1
not	1
twelve	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
day?	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
he	1
stumbleth	1
not,	1
because	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
11:10	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
he	1
stumbleth,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
11:11	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
he:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Our	1
friend	1
Lazarus	1
sleepeth;	1
but	1
I	1
go,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
awake	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:12	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
he	1
sleep,	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
well.	1
	1
11:13	1
Howbeit	1
Jesus	1
spake	1
of	1
his	1
death:	1
but	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
taking	1
of	1
rest	1
in	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them	1
plainly,	1
Lazarus	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
ye	1
may	1
believe;	1
nevertheless	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:16	1
Then	1
said	1
Thomas,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
unto	1
his	1
fellowdisciples,	1
Let	1
us	1
also	1
go,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
die	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:17	1
Then	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
in	1
the	1
grave	1
four	1
days	1
already.	1
	1
11:18	1
Now	1
Bethany	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
about	1
fifteen	1
furlongs	1
off:	1
11:19	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
came	1
to	1
Martha	1
and	1
Mary,	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
concerning	1
their	1
brother.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
Martha,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
coming,	1
went	1
and	1
met	1
him:	1
but	1
Mary	1
sat	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
11:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Martha	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
been	1
here,	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
	1
11:22	1
But	1
I	1
know,	1
that	1
even	1
now,	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt	1
ask	1
of	1
God,	1
God	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee.	1
	1
11:23	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
11:24	1
Martha	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
11:25	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
the	1
life:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
in	1
me,	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
dead,	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
live:	1
11:26	1
And	1
whosoever	1
liveth	1
and	1
believeth	1
in	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
die.	1
Believest	1
thou	1
this?	1
	1
11:27	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord:	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
she	1
went	1
her	1
way,	1
and	1
called	1
Mary	1
her	1
sister	1
secretly,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Master	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
calleth	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
11:29	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
that,	1
she	1
arose	1
quickly,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:30	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
where	1
Martha	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
Jews	1
then	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
comforted	1
her,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Mary,	1
that	1
she	1
rose	1
up	1
hastily	1
and	1
went	1
out,	1
followed	1
her,	1
saying,	1
She	1
goeth	1
unto	1
the	1
grave	1
to	1
weep	1
there.	1
	1
11:32	1
Then	1
when	1
Mary	1
was	1
come	1
where	1
Jesus	1
was,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
she	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
been	1
here,	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
	1
11:33	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
saw	1
her	1
weeping,	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
weeping	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
her,	1
he	1
groaned	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
was	1
troubled.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
said,	1
Where	1
have	1
ye	1
laid	1
him?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
11:35	1
Jesus	1
wept.	1
	1
11:36	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Behold	1
how	1
he	1
loved	1
him!	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
Could	1
not	1
this	1
man,	1
which	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind,	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
even	1
this	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
died?	1
	1
11:38	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
again	1
groaning	1
in	1
himself	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
a	1
stone	1
lay	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
11:39	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Take	1
ye	1
away	1
the	1
stone.	1
Martha,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
dead,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
stinketh:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
dead	1
four	1
days.	1
	1
11:40	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Said	1
I	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that,	1
if	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
believe,	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
see	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
11:41	1
Then	1
they	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
dead	1
was	1
laid.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said,	1
Father,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
me.	1
	1
11:42	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
hearest	1
me	1
always:	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
stand	1
by	1
I	1
said	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
11:43	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
thus	1
had	1
spoken,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Lazarus,	1
come	1
forth.	1
	1
11:44	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
dead	1
came	1
forth,	1
bound	1
hand	1
and	1
foot	1
with	1
graveclothes:	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
bound	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
napkin.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Loose	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
11:45	1
Then	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
Mary,	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
11:46	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
their	1
ways	1
to	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
what	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
11:47	1
Then	1
gathered	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
a	1
council,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
do	1
we?	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
doeth	1
many	1
miracles.	1
	1
11:48	1
If	1
we	1
let	1
him	1
thus	1
alone,	1
all	1
men	1
will	1
believe	1
on	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
Romans	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
both	1
our	1
place	1
and	1
nation.	1
	1
11:49	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
named	1
Caiaphas,	1
being	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
same	1
year,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
11:50	1
Nor	1
consider	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
perish	1
not.	1
	1
11:51	1
And	1
this	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
of	1
himself:	1
but	1
being	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
year,	1
he	1
prophesied	1
that	1
Jesus	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
that	1
nation;	1
11:52	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
nation	1
only,	1
but	1
that	1
also	1
he	1
should	1
gather	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad.	1
	1
11:53	1
Then	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forth	1
they	1
took	1
counsel	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
11:54	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
walked	1
no	1
more	1
openly	1
among	1
the	1
Jews;	1
but	1
went	1
thence	1
unto	1
a	1
country	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
there	1
continued	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
11:55	1
And	1
the	1
Jews'	1
passover	1
was	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand:	1
and	1
many	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
before	1
the	1
passover,	1
to	1
purify	1
themselves.	1
	1
11:56	1
Then	1
sought	1
they	1
for	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
spake	1
among	1
themselves,	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
What	1
think	1
ye,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast?	1
	1
11:57	1
Now	1
both	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
commandment,	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
were,	1
he	1
should	1
shew	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
six	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
passover	1
came	1
to	1
Bethany,	1
where	1
Lazarus	1
was,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
dead,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
12:2	1
There	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
supper;	1
and	1
Martha	1
served:	1
but	1
Lazarus	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:3	1
Then	1
took	1
Mary	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
ointment	1
of	1
spikenard,	1
very	1
costly,	1
and	1
anointed	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
her	1
hair:	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
odour	1
of	1
the	1
ointment.	1
	1
12:4	1
Then	1
saith	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
Simon's	1
son,	1
which	1
should	1
betray	1
him,	1
12:5	1
Why	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
ointment	1
sold	1
for	1
three	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor?	1
	1
12:6	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
the	1
poor;	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
thief,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
bag,	1
and	1
bare	1
what	1
was	1
put	1
therein.	1
	1
12:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus,	1
Let	1
her	1
alone:	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
burying	1
hath	1
she	1
kept	1
this.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
the	1
poor	1
always	1
ye	1
have	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
12:9	1
Much	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
not	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake	1
only,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
see	1
Lazarus	1
also,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
12:10	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
consulted	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
put	1
Lazarus	1
also	1
to	1
death;	1
12:11	1
Because	1
that	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
him	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
believed	1
on	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:12	1
On	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
much	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
12:13	1
Took	1
branches	1
of	1
palm	1
trees,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
Hosanna:	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
young	1
ass,	1
sat	1
thereon;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
12:15	1
Fear	1
not,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Sion:	1
behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh,	1
sitting	1
on	1
an	1
ass's	1
colt.	1
	1
12:16	1
These	1
things	1
understood	1
not	1
his	1
disciples	1
at	1
the	1
first:	1
but	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
glorified,	1
then	1
remembered	1
they	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
written	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
12:17	1
The	1
people	1
therefore	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
Lazarus	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
grave,	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
bare	1
record.	1
	1
12:18	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
met	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
miracle.	1
	1
12:19	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
therefore	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Perceive	1
ye	1
how	1
ye	1
prevail	1
nothing?	1
behold,	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
gone	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
Greeks	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
worship	1
at	1
the	1
feast:	1
12:21	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
therefore	1
to	1
Philip,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Bethsaida	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
desired	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Sir,	1
we	1
would	1
see	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:22	1
Philip	1
cometh	1
and	1
telleth	1
Andrew:	1
and	1
again	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Philip	1
tell	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
hour	1
is	1
come,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
12:24	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
a	1
corn	1
of	1
wheat	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
die,	1
it	1
abideth	1
alone:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
die,	1
it	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit.	1
	1
12:25	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
unto	1
life	1
eternal.	1
	1
12:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
serve	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
follow	1
me;	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
there	1
shall	1
also	1
my	1
servant	1
be:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
serve	1
me,	1
him	1
will	1
my	1
Father	1
honour.	1
	1
12:27	1
Now	1
is	1
my	1
soul	1
troubled;	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say?	1
Father,	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
hour:	1
but	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
this	1
hour.	1
	1
12:28	1
Father,	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name.	1
Then	1
came	1
there	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
both	1
glorified	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
glorify	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
12:29	1
The	1
people	1
therefore,	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
heard	1
it,	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
thundered:	1
others	1
said,	1
An	1
angel	1
spake	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
12:30	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
voice	1
came	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
me,	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
sakes.	1
	1
12:31	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
this	1
world:	1
now	1
shall	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
be	1
cast	1
out.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
I,	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
will	1
draw	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
12:33	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
signifying	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
die.	1
	1
12:34	1
The	1
people	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
Christ	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
lifted	1
up?	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
Son	1
of	1
man?	1
	1
12:35	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
Walk	1
while	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
light,	1
lest	1
darkness	1
come	1
upon	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness	1
knoweth	1
not	1
whither	1
he	1
goeth.	1
	1
12:36	1
While	1
ye	1
have	1
light,	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light.	1
These	1
things	1
spake	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
did	1
hide	1
himself	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
12:37	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
many	1
miracles	1
before	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
on	1
him:	1
12:38	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
hath	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
been	1
revealed?	1
	1
12:39	1
Therefore	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
believe,	1
because	1
that	1
Esaias	1
said	1
again,	1
12:40	1
He	1
hath	1
blinded	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hardened	1
their	1
heart;	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
nor	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
12:41	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
Esaias,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
12:42	1
Nevertheless	1
among	1
the	1
chief	1
rulers	1
also	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him;	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
confess	1
him,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
12:43	1
For	1
they	1
loved	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
men	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:44	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
believeth	1
not	1
on	1
me,	1
but	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
12:45	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
seeth	1
me	1
seeth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
12:46	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
a	1
light	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
should	1
not	1
abide	1
in	1
darkness.	1
	1
12:47	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
believe	1
not,	1
I	1
judge	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
12:48	1
He	1
that	1
rejecteth	1
me,	1
and	1
receiveth	1
not	1
my	1
words,	1
hath	1
one	1
that	1
judgeth	1
him:	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
judge	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
12:49	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
myself;	1
but	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
sent	1
me,	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
commandment,	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
speak.	1
	1
12:50	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
commandment	1
is	1
life	1
everlasting:	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
speak	1
therefore,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
so	1
I	1
speak.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
before	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
come	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
having	1
loved	1
his	1
own	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
loved	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
supper	1
being	1
ended,	1
the	1
devil	1
having	1
now	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
Simon's	1
son,	1
to	1
betray	1
him;	1
13:3	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
had	1
given	1
all	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
God,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
God;	1
13:4	1
He	1
riseth	1
from	1
supper,	1
and	1
laid	1
aside	1
his	1
garments;	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
towel,	1
and	1
girded	1
himself.	1
	1
13:5	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
poureth	1
water	1
into	1
a	1
bason,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
wash	1
the	1
disciples'	1
feet,	1
and	1
to	1
wipe	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
towel	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
girded.	1
	1
13:6	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter:	1
and	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
dost	1
thou	1
wash	1
my	1
feet?	1
	1
13:7	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
I	1
do	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
now;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
hereafter.	1
	1
13:8	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
never	1
wash	1
my	1
feet.	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
wash	1
thee	1
not,	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
part	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
13:9	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
not	1
my	1
feet	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
13:10	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
to	1
him,	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
washed	1
needeth	1
not	1
save	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet,	1
but	1
is	1
clean	1
every	1
whit:	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
clean,	1
but	1
not	1
all.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
who	1
should	1
betray	1
him;	1
therefore	1
said	1
he,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
clean.	1
	1
13:12	1
So	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
washed	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
again,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
you?	1
	1
13:13	1
Ye	1
call	1
me	1
Master	1
and	1
Lord:	1
and	1
ye	1
say	1
well;	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
13:14	1
If	1
I	1
then,	1
your	1
Lord	1
and	1
Master,	1
have	1
washed	1
your	1
feet;	1
ye	1
also	1
ought	1
to	1
wash	1
one	1
another's	1
feet.	1
	1
13:15	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
an	1
example,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
13:16	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
servant	1
is	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
lord;	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
sent	1
greater	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
13:17	1
If	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
13:18	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
of	1
you	1
all:	1
I	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen:	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
He	1
that	1
eateth	1
bread	1
with	1
me	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
heel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
13:19	1
Now	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
before	1
it	1
come,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
13:20	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
send	1
receiveth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
13:21	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
thus	1
said,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
testified,	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
13:22	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
looked	1
one	1
on	1
another,	1
doubting	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
13:23	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
leaning	1
on	1
Jesus'	1
bosom	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved.	1
	1
13:24	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
beckoned	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
ask	1
who	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
13:25	1
He	1
then	1
lying	1
on	1
Jesus'	1
breast	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
is	1
it?	1
13:26	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
He	1
it	1
is,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
a	1
sop,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
dipped	1
it.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
dipped	1
the	1
sop,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Simon.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
sop	1
Satan	1
entered	1
into	1
him.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
That	1
thou	1
doest,	1
do	1
quickly.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
no	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
knew	1
for	1
what	1
intent	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:29	1
For	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
thought,	1
because	1
Judas	1
had	1
the	1
bag,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Buy	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
against	1
the	1
feast;	1
or,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
13:30	1
He	1
then	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
sop	1
went	1
immediately	1
out:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
night.	1
	1
13:31	1
Therefore,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out,	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
glorified,	1
and	1
God	1
is	1
glorified	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
13:32	1
If	1
God	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
him,	1
God	1
shall	1
also	1
glorify	1
him	1
in	1
himself,	1
and	1
shall	1
straightway	1
glorify	1
him.	1
	1
13:33	1
Little	1
children,	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you.	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me:	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come;	1
so	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
13:34	1
A	1
new	1
commandment	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another;	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
13:35	1
By	1
this	1
shall	1
all	1
men	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
disciples,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
love	1
one	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
13:36	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
follow	1
me	1
now;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
follow	1
me	1
afterwards.	1
	1
13:37	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
why	1
cannot	1
I	1
follow	1
thee	1
now?	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
thy	1
sake.	1
	1
13:38	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
lay	1
down	1
thy	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake?	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
The	1
cock	1
shall	1
not	1
crow,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
denied	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
14:1	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
troubled:	1
ye	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
believe	1
also	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
14:2	1
In	1
my	1
Father's	1
house	1
are	1
many	1
mansions:	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
so,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
you.	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
again,	1
and	1
receive	1
you	1
unto	1
myself;	1
that	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
there	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
whither	1
I	1
go	1
ye	1
know,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
ye	1
know.	1
	1
14:5	1
Thomas	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest;	1
and	1
how	1
can	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
14:6	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
way,	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
life:	1
no	1
man	1
cometh	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
but	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
14:7	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
my	1
Father	1
also:	1
and	1
from	1
henceforth	1
ye	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
14:8	1
Philip	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
shew	1
us	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
us.	1
	1
14:9	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Have	1
I	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
yet	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
known	1
me,	1
Philip?	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
seen	1
me	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou	1
then,	1
Shew	1
us	1
the	1
Father?	1
	1
14:10	1
Believest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
me?	1
	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
of	1
myself:	1
but	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me,	1
he	1
doeth	1
the	1
works.	1
	1
14:11	1
Believe	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
me:	1
or	1
else	1
believe	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
works'	1
sake.	1
	1
14:12	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
also;	1
and	1
greater	1
works	1
than	1
these	1
shall	1
he	1
do;	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
14:14	1
If	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
14:15	1
If	1
ye	1
love	1
me,	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
another	1
Comforter,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
abide	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
ever;	1
14:17	1
Even	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth;	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
cannot	1
receive,	1
because	1
it	1
seeth	1
him	1
not,	1
neither	1
knoweth	1
him:	1
but	1
ye	1
know	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
14:18	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
you	1
comfortless:	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
14:19	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
seeth	1
me	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
ye	1
see	1
me:	1
because	1
I	1
live,	1
ye	1
shall	1
live	1
also.	1
	1
14:20	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
14:21	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
them,	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
loveth	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
loved	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
manifest	1
myself	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
14:22	1
Judas	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
not	1
Iscariot,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
manifest	1
thyself	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
14:23	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
love	1
me,	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
my	1
words:	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
will	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
make	1
our	1
abode	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
14:24	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
me	1
not	1
keepeth	1
not	1
my	1
sayings:	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
ye	1
hear	1
is	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
the	1
Father's	1
which	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
14:25	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
being	1
yet	1
present	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
14:26	1
But	1
the	1
Comforter,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
will	1
send	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
shall	1
teach	1
you	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
bring	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
your	1
remembrance,	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
14:27	1
Peace	1
I	1
leave	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
peace	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you:	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
giveth,	1
give	1
I	1
unto	1
you.	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
troubled,	1
neither	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
afraid.	1
	1
14:28	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
how	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
go	1
away,	1
and	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
you.	1
If	1
ye	1
loved	1
me,	1
ye	1
would	1
rejoice,	1
because	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Father:	1
for	1
my	1
Father	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
I.	1
	1
14:29	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
ye	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
14:30	1
Hereafter	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
talk	1
much	1
with	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
cometh,	1
and	1
hath	1
nothing	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
gave	1
me	1
commandment,	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
do.	1
Arise,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
hence.	1
	1
15:1	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
true	1
vine,	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
is	1
the	1
husbandman.	1
	1
15:2	1
Every	1
branch	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
beareth	1
not	1
fruit	1
he	1
taketh	1
away:	1
and	1
every	1
branch	1
that	1
beareth	1
fruit,	1
he	1
purgeth	1
it,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
more	1
fruit.	1
	1
15:3	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
clean	1
through	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:4	1
Abide	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
you.	1
As	1
the	1
branch	1
cannot	1
bear	1
fruit	1
of	1
itself,	1
except	1
it	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
vine;	1
no	1
more	1
can	1
ye,	1
except	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
15:5	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
vine,	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
branches:	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit:	1
for	1
without	1
me	1
ye	1
can	1
do	1
nothing.	1
	1
15:6	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
abide	1
not	1
in	1
me,	1
he	1
is	1
cast	1
forth	1
as	1
a	1
branch,	1
and	1
is	1
withered;	1
and	1
men	1
gather	1
them,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
burned.	1
	1
15:7	1
If	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
words	1
abide	1
in	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
what	1
ye	1
will,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:8	1
Herein	1
is	1
my	1
Father	1
glorified,	1
that	1
ye	1
bear	1
much	1
fruit;	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
15:9	1
As	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
loved	1
me,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
loved	1
you:	1
continue	1
ye	1
in	1
my	1
love.	1
	1
15:10	1
If	1
ye	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
ye	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
my	1
love;	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
Father's	1
commandments,	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
his	1
love.	1
	1
15:11	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
might	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
15:12	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
commandment,	1
That	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you.	1
	1
15:13	1
Greater	1
love	1
hath	1
no	1
man	1
than	1
this,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
lay	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
his	1
friends.	1
	1
15:14	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
friends,	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
15:15	1
Henceforth	1
I	1
call	1
you	1
not	1
servants;	1
for	1
the	1
servant	1
knoweth	1
not	1
what	1
his	1
lord	1
doeth:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
you	1
friends;	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:16	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
chosen	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
you,	1
and	1
ordained	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
fruit	1
should	1
remain:	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
15:17	1
These	1
things	1
I	1
command	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
15:18	1
If	1
the	1
world	1
hate	1
you,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
hated	1
me	1
before	1
it	1
hated	1
you.	1
	1
15:19	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
love	1
his	1
own:	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
therefore	1
the	1
world	1
hateth	1
you.	1
	1
15:20	1
Remember	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
servant	1
is	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
lord.	1
If	1
they	1
have	1
persecuted	1
me,	1
they	1
will	1
also	1
persecute	1
you;	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
saying,	1
they	1
will	1
keep	1
yours	1
also.	1
	1
15:21	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
15:22	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
and	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
cloak	1
for	1
their	1
sin.	1
	1
15:23	1
He	1
that	1
hateth	1
me	1
hateth	1
my	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
15:24	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
none	1
other	1
man	1
did,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
they	1
both	1
seen	1
and	1
hated	1
both	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
this	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
law,	1
They	1
hated	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause.	1
	1
15:26	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Comforter	1
is	1
come,	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
even	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
which	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
he	1
shall	1
testify	1
of	1
me:	1
15:27	1
And	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
bear	1
witness,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
16:1	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
offended.	1
	1
16:2	1
They	1
shall	1
put	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogues:	1
yea,	1
the	1
time	1
cometh,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
killeth	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
doeth	1
God	1
service.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
unto	1
you,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
Father,	1
nor	1
me.	1
	1
16:4	1
But	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come,	1
ye	1
may	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
16:5	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
asketh	1
me,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
	1
16:6	1
But	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
you,	1
sorrow	1
hath	1
filled	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
16:7	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth;	1
It	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
go	1
away:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
not	1
away,	1
the	1
Comforter	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
you;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
depart,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
reprove	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
sin,	1
and	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
of	1
judgment:	1
16:9	1
Of	1
sin,	1
because	1
they	1
believe	1
not	1
on	1
me;	1
16:10	1
Of	1
righteousness,	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
see	1
me	1
no	1
more;	1
16:11	1
Of	1
judgment,	1
because	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
judged.	1
	1
16:12	1
I	1
have	1
yet	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
ye	1
cannot	1
bear	1
them	1
now.	1
	1
16:13	1
Howbeit	1
when	1
he,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
guide	1
you	1
into	1
all	1
truth:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
himself;	1
but	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
hear,	1
that	1
shall	1
he	1
speak:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
things	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
16:14	1
He	1
shall	1
glorify	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:15	1
All	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
are	1
mine:	1
therefore	1
said	1
I,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:16	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:17	1
Then	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
among	1
themselves,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
us,	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me:	1
and,	1
Because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father?	1
	1
16:18	1
They	1
said	1
therefore,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
A	1
little	1
while?	1
we	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
16:19	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
ask	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
enquire	1
among	1
yourselves	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me?	1
	1
16:20	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
weep	1
and	1
lament,	1
but	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
rejoice:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
sorrowful,	1
but	1
your	1
sorrow	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
joy.	1
	1
16:21	1
A	1
woman	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
travail	1
hath	1
sorrow,	1
because	1
her	1
hour	1
is	1
come:	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
delivered	1
of	1
the	1
child,	1
she	1
remembereth	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
anguish,	1
for	1
joy	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
born	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
ye	1
now	1
therefore	1
have	1
sorrow:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
and	1
your	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
your	1
joy	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
me	1
nothing.	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
16:24	1
Hitherto	1
have	1
ye	1
asked	1
nothing	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
ask,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive,	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
16:25	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
proverbs:	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
cometh,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
proverbs,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
you	1
plainly	1
of	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:26	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
the	1
Father	1
for	1
you:	1
16:27	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
himself	1
loveth	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
16:28	1
I	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world:	1
again,	1
I	1
leave	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:29	1
His	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lo,	1
now	1
speakest	1
thou	1
plainly,	1
and	1
speakest	1
no	1
proverb.	1
	1
16:30	1
Now	1
are	1
we	1
sure	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
needest	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
ask	1
thee:	1
by	1
this	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
16:31	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
now	1
believe?	1
	1
16:32	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
yea,	1
is	1
now	1
come,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
me	1
alone:	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
alone,	1
because	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
16:33	1
These	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
peace.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
world	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
tribulation:	1
but	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
I	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:1	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
said,	1
Father,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
come;	1
glorify	1
thy	1
Son,	1
that	1
thy	1
Son	1
also	1
may	1
glorify	1
thee:	1
17:2	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him	1
power	1
over	1
all	1
flesh,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
eternal	1
life	1
to	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
life	1
eternal,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
thee	1
the	1
only	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent.	1
	1
17:4	1
I	1
have	1
glorified	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
earth:	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Father,	1
glorify	1
thou	1
me	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
self	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
with	1
thee	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
was.	1
	1
17:6	1
I	1
have	1
manifested	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
thine	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
thou	1
gavest	1
them	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
kept	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
17:7	1
Now	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
are	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
17:8	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
known	1
surely	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
send	1
me.	1
	1
17:9	1
I	1
pray	1
for	1
them:	1
I	1
pray	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
thine.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
all	1
mine	1
are	1
thine,	1
and	1
thine	1
are	1
mine;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
glorified	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee.	1
Holy	1
Father,	1
keep	1
through	1
thine	1
own	1
name	1
those	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
one,	1
as	1
we	1
are.	1
	1
17:12	1
While	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
name:	1
those	1
that	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
kept,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
lost,	1
but	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition;	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
now	1
come	1
I	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
my	1
joy	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
themselves.	1
	1
17:14	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
thy	1
word;	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
hated	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:15	1
I	1
pray	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
17:16	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:17	1
Sanctify	1
them	1
through	1
thy	1
truth:	1
thy	1
word	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
17:18	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
also	1
sent	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
I	1
sanctify	1
myself,	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
might	1
be	1
sanctified	1
through	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
17:20	1
Neither	1
pray	1
I	1
for	1
these	1
alone,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
me	1
through	1
their	1
word;	1
17:21	1
That	1
they	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
one;	1
as	1
thou,	1
Father,	1
art	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
thee,	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
one	1
in	1
us:	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
one,	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
one:	1
17:23	1
I	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
thou	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
one;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
hast	1
loved	1
them,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
me.	1
	1
17:24	1
Father,	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
they	1
also,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
am;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
behold	1
my	1
glory,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
lovedst	1
me	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:25	1
O	1
righteous	1
Father,	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
not	1
known	1
thee:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
thee,	1
and	1
these	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
will	1
declare	1
it:	1
that	1
the	1
love	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
me	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
18:1	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words,	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Cedron,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
garden,	1
into	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
entered,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Judas	1
also,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
knew	1
the	1
place:	1
for	1
Jesus	1
ofttimes	1
resorted	1
thither	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:3	1
Judas	1
then,	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
officers	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
cometh	1
thither	1
with	1
lanterns	1
and	1
torches	1
and	1
weapons.	1
	1
18:4	1
Jesus	1
therefore,	1
knowing	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
seek	1
ye?	1
	1
18:5	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
And	1
Judas	1
also,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
stood	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
18:6	1
As	1
soon	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
they	1
went	1
backward,	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
18:7	1
Then	1
asked	1
he	1
them	1
again,	1
Whom	1
seek	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
18:8	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he:	1
if	1
therefore	1
ye	1
seek	1
me,	1
let	1
these	1
go	1
their	1
way:	1
18:9	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
Of	1
them	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
have	1
I	1
lost	1
none.	1
	1
18:10	1
Then	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
having	1
a	1
sword	1
drew	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
servant,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
ear.	1
The	1
servant's	1
name	1
was	1
Malchus.	1
	1
18:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Put	1
up	1
thy	1
sword	1
into	1
the	1
sheath:	1
the	1
cup	1
which	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me,	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
drink	1
it?	1
	1
18:12	1
Then	1
the	1
band	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
bound	1
him,	1
18:13	1
And	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Annas	1
first;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
Caiaphas,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
same	1
year.	1
	1
18:14	1
Now	1
Caiaphas	1
was	1
he,	1
which	1
gave	1
counsel	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
followed	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
another	1
disciple:	1
that	1
disciple	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
Peter	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
without.	1
Then	1
went	1
out	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
which	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
her	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
Peter.	1
	1
18:17	1
Then	1
saith	1
the	1
damsel	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
this	1
man's	1
disciples?	1
He	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
officers	1
stood	1
there,	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
fire	1
of	1
coals;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
cold:	1
and	1
they	1
warmed	1
themselves:	1
and	1
Peter	1
stood	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself.	1
	1
18:19	1
The	1
high	1
priest	1
then	1
asked	1
Jesus	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
18:20	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
I	1
spake	1
openly	1
to	1
the	1
world;	1
I	1
ever	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
whither	1
the	1
Jews	1
always	1
resort;	1
and	1
in	1
secret	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
nothing.	1
	1
18:21	1
Why	1
askest	1
thou	1
me?	1
ask	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
me,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
behold,	1
they	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
said.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
which	1
stood	1
by	1
struck	1
Jesus	1
with	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
so?	1
	1
18:23	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
evil,	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
evil:	1
but	1
if	1
well,	1
why	1
smitest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
18:24	1
Now	1
Annas	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
bound	1
unto	1
Caiaphas	1
the	1
high	1
priest.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
stood	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself.	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples?	1
He	1
denied	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
18:26	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
being	1
his	1
kinsman	1
whose	1
ear	1
Peter	1
cut	1
off,	1
saith,	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
him?	1
18:27	1
Peter	1
then	1
denied	1
again:	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
18:28	1
Then	1
led	1
they	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Caiaphas	1
unto	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
judgment:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
early;	1
and	1
they	1
themselves	1
went	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
defiled;	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
eat	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
18:29	1
Pilate	1
then	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
accusation	1
bring	1
ye	1
against	1
this	1
man?	1
	1
18:30	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
malefactor,	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
18:31	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
ye	1
him,	1
and	1
judge	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
law.	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
put	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
death:	1
18:32	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
signifying	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
die.	1
	1
18:33	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall	1
again,	1
and	1
called	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
18:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Sayest	1
thou	1
this	1
thing	1
of	1
thyself,	1
or	1
did	1
others	1
tell	1
it	1
thee	1
of	1
me?	1
	1
18:35	1
Pilate	1
answered,	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
Jew?	1
Thine	1
own	1
nation	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
have	1
delivered	1
thee	1
unto	1
me:	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
18:36	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
My	1
kingdom	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
world:	1
if	1
my	1
kingdom	1
were	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
then	1
would	1
my	1
servants	1
fight,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
Jews:	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
my	1
kingdom	1
not	1
from	1
hence.	1
	1
18:37	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
a	1
king	1
then?	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
king.	1
To	1
this	1
end	1
was	1
I	1
born,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
came	1
I	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bear	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
truth.	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
heareth	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
18:38	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
truth?	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
no	1
fault	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:39	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
a	1
custom,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
passover:	1
will	1
ye	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
18:40	1
Then	1
cried	1
they	1
all	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
this	1
man,	1
but	1
Barabbas.	1
Now	1
Barabbas	1
was	1
a	1
robber.	1
	1
19:1	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
scourged	1
him.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
purple	1
robe,	1
19:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
19:4	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
went	1
forth	1
again,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
19:5	1
Then	1
came	1
Jesus	1
forth,	1
wearing	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
the	1
purple	1
robe.	1
And	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man!	1
	1
19:6	1
When	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
therefore	1
and	1
officers	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Crucify	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
ye	1
him,	1
and	1
crucify	1
him:	1
for	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
19:7	1
The	1
Jews	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
law	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
die,	1
because	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:8	1
When	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
afraid;	1
19:9	1
And	1
went	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Whence	1
art	1
thou?	1
But	1
Jesus	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
19:10	1
Then	1
saith	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
him,	1
Speakest	1
thou	1
not	1
unto	1
me?	1
knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
crucify	1
thee,	1
and	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
release	1
thee?	1
	1
19:11	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
couldest	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
at	1
all	1
against	1
me,	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
given	1
thee	1
from	1
above:	1
therefore	1
he	1
that	1
delivered	1
me	1
unto	1
thee	1
hath	1
the	1
greater	1
sin.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
from	1
thenceforth	1
Pilate	1
sought	1
to	1
release	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
Jews	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
let	1
this	1
man	1
go,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
Caesar's	1
friend:	1
whosoever	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
king	1
speaketh	1
against	1
Caesar.	1
	1
19:13	1
When	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
brought	1
Jesus	1
forth,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Pavement,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew,	1
Gabbatha.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Behold	1
your	1
King!	1
	1
19:15	1
But	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
Away	1
with	1
him,	1
away	1
with	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Shall	1
I	1
crucify	1
your	1
King?	1
The	1
chief	1
priests	1
answered,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
king	1
but	1
Caesar.	1
	1
19:16	1
Then	1
delivered	1
he	1
him	1
therefore	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
bearing	1
his	1
cross	1
went	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
Golgotha:	1
19:18	1
Where	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
with	1
him,	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
one,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
Pilate	1
wrote	1
a	1
title,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
cross.	1
And	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
JESUS	1
OF	1
NAZARETH	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
19:20	1
This	1
title	1
then	1
read	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Jesus	1
was	1
crucified	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
Hebrew,	1
and	1
Greek,	1
and	1
Latin.	1
	1
19:21	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
to	1
Pilate,	1
Write	1
not,	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
19:22	1
Pilate	1
answered,	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
I	1
have	1
written.	1
	1
19:23	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
crucified	1
Jesus,	1
took	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
made	1
four	1
parts,	1
to	1
every	1
soldier	1
a	1
part;	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
coat:	1
now	1
the	1
coat	1
was	1
without	1
seam,	1
woven	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
throughout.	1
	1
19:24	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
rend	1
it,	1
but	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
it,	1
whose	1
it	1
shall	1
be:	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
saith,	1
They	1
parted	1
my	1
raiment	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
vesture	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
lots.	1
These	1
things	1
therefore	1
the	1
soldiers	1
did.	1
	1
19:25	1
Now	1
there	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Jesus	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
mother's	1
sister,	1
Mary	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Cleophas,	1
and	1
Mary	1
Magdalene.	1
	1
19:26	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
saw	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
disciple	1
standing	1
by,	1
whom	1
he	1
loved,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
mother,	1
Woman,	1
behold	1
thy	1
son!	1
19:27	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
disciple,	1
Behold	1
thy	1
mother!	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
hour	1
that	1
disciple	1
took	1
her	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
19:28	1
After	1
this,	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
now	1
accomplished,	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
saith,	1
I	1
thirst.	1
	1
19:29	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
set	1
a	1
vessel	1
full	1
of	1
vinegar:	1
and	1
they	1
filled	1
a	1
spunge	1
with	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
19:30	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
vinegar,	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
finished:	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
19:31	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
that	1
the	1
bodies	1
should	1
not	1
remain	1
upon	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
(for	1
that	1
sabbath	1
day	1
was	1
an	1
high	1
day,)	1
besought	1
Pilate	1
that	1
their	1
legs	1
might	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
19:32	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
was	1
crucified	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
19:33	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
already,	1
they	1
brake	1
not	1
his	1
legs:	1
19:34	1
But	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
with	1
a	1
spear	1
pierced	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
came	1
there	1
out	1
blood	1
and	1
water.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
bare	1
record,	1
and	1
his	1
record	1
is	1
true:	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
true,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
19:36	1
For	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
A	1
bone	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
again	1
another	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
They	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
whom	1
they	1
pierced.	1
	1
19:38	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
Joseph	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
being	1
a	1
disciple	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
but	1
secretly	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
besought	1
Pilate	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
Pilate	1
gave	1
him	1
leave.	1
He	1
came	1
therefore,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
also	1
Nicodemus,	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
myrrh	1
and	1
aloes,	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
pound	1
weight.	1
	1
19:40	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
wound	1
it	1
in	1
linen	1
clothes	1
with	1
the	1
spices,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
is	1
to	1
bury.	1
	1
19:41	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
crucified	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
garden;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
a	1
new	1
sepulchre,	1
wherein	1
was	1
never	1
man	1
yet	1
laid.	1
	1
19:42	1
There	1
laid	1
they	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Jews'	1
preparation	1
day;	1
for	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
was	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
20:1	1
The	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
cometh	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
early,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
dark,	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
stone	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
she	1
runneth,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
disciple,	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
20:3	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:4	1
So	1
they	1
ran	1
both	1
together:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
disciple	1
did	1
outrun	1
Peter,	1
and	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
he	1
stooping	1
down,	1
and	1
looking	1
in,	1
saw	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
lying;	1
yet	1
went	1
he	1
not	1
in.	1
	1
20:6	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
following	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
lie,	1
20:7	1
And	1
the	1
napkin,	1
that	1
was	1
about	1
his	1
head,	1
not	1
lying	1
with	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes,	1
but	1
wrapped	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
by	1
itself.	1
	1
20:8	1
Then	1
went	1
in	1
also	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
which	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
he	1
saw,	1
and	1
believed.	1
	1
20:9	1
For	1
as	1
yet	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
scripture,	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
rise	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
20:10	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
20:11	1
But	1
Mary	1
stood	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
weeping:	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
wept,	1
she	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
20:12	1
And	1
seeth	1
two	1
angels	1
in	1
white	1
sitting,	1
the	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
feet,	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus	1
had	1
lain.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
thus	1
said,	1
she	1
turned	1
herself	1
back,	1
and	1
saw	1
Jesus	1
standing,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus.	1
	1
20:15	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
whom	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
	1
She,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
gardener,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
if	1
thou	1
have	1
borne	1
him	1
hence,	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
20:16	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Mary.	1
She	1
turned	1
herself,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabboni;	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
Master.	1
	1
20:17	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Touch	1
me	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
yet	1
ascended	1
to	1
my	1
Father:	1
but	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
ascend	1
unto	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
your	1
Father;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:18	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
disciples	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
20:19	1
Then	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
at	1
evening,	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
when	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
shut	1
where	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
assembled	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
came	1
Jesus	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
he	1
shewed	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
disciples	1
glad,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
them	1
again,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you:	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
even	1
so	1
send	1
I	1
you.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
breathed	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Receive	1
ye	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
20:23	1
Whose	1
soever	1
sins	1
ye	1
remit,	1
they	1
are	1
remitted	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
whose	1
soever	1
sins	1
ye	1
retain,	1
they	1
are	1
retained.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
Thomas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came.	1
	1
20:25	1
The	1
other	1
disciples	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Except	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
nails,	1
and	1
put	1
my	1
finger	1
into	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
nails,	1
and	1
thrust	1
my	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
side,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
believe.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
after	1
eight	1
days	1
again	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
within,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
with	1
them:	1
then	1
came	1
Jesus,	1
the	1
doors	1
being	1
shut,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
said,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
20:27	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
Thomas,	1
Reach	1
hither	1
thy	1
finger,	1
and	1
behold	1
my	1
hands;	1
and	1
reach	1
hither	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
thrust	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
side:	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
faithless,	1
but	1
believing.	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
Thomas	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
LORD	1
and	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
20:29	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thomas,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
me,	1
thou	1
hast	1
believed:	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
seen,	1
and	1
yet	1
have	1
believed.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
signs	1
truly	1
did	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book:	1
20:31	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
written,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
that	1
believing	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
life	1
through	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
21:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
shewed	1
himself	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
disciples	1
at	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Tiberias;	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
shewed	1
he	1
himself.	1
	1
21:2	1
There	1
were	1
together	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
and	1
Nathanael	1
of	1
Cana	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
of	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
21:3	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
go	1
a	1
fishing.	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
also	1
go	1
with	1
thee.	1
They	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
immediately;	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
they	1
caught	1
nothing.	1
	1
21:4	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
now	1
come,	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
shore:	1
but	1
the	1
disciples	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus.	1
	1
21:5	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Children,	1
have	1
ye	1
any	1
meat?	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
No.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Cast	1
the	1
net	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find.	1
They	1
cast	1
therefore,	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
draw	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
fishes.	1
	1
21:7	1
Therefore	1
that	1
disciple	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Now	1
when	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord,	1
he	1
girt	1
his	1
fisher's	1
coat	1
unto	1
him,	1
(for	1
he	1
was	1
naked,)	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
disciples	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
ship;	1
(for	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
land,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
cubits,)	1
dragging	1
the	1
net	1
with	1
fishes.	1
	1
21:9	1
As	1
soon	1
then	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
land,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
fire	1
of	1
coals	1
there,	1
and	1
fish	1
laid	1
thereon,	1
and	1
bread.	1
	1
21:10	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Bring	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
now	1
caught.	1
	1
21:11	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
net	1
to	1
land	1
full	1
of	1
great	1
fishes,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
and	1
three:	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many,	1
yet	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
net	1
broken.	1
	1
21:12	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
and	1
dine.	1
And	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
durst	1
ask	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
21:13	1
Jesus	1
then	1
cometh,	1
and	1
taketh	1
bread,	1
and	1
giveth	1
them,	1
and	1
fish	1
likewise.	1
	1
21:14	1
This	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
Jesus	1
shewed	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
21:15	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
dined,	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
these?	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
lambs.	1
	1
21:16	1
He	1
saith	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
sheep.	1
	1
21:17	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
Peter	1
was	1
grieved	1
because	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
things;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
sheep.	1
	1
21:18	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
When	1
thou	1
wast	1
young,	1
thou	1
girdest	1
thyself,	1
and	1
walkedst	1
whither	1
thou	1
wouldest:	1
but	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
old,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stretch	1
forth	1
thy	1
hands,	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
gird	1
thee,	1
and	1
carry	1
thee	1
whither	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not.	1
	1
21:19	1
This	1
spake	1
he,	1
signifying	1
by	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
glorify	1
God.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
21:20	1
Then	1
Peter,	1
turning	1
about,	1
seeth	1
the	1
disciple	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
following;	1
which	1
also	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
at	1
supper,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
which	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
thee?	1
	1
21:21	1
Peter	1
seeing	1
him	1
saith	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
this	1
man	1
do?	1
	1
21:22	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
tarry	1
till	1
I	1
come,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
thee?	1
follow	1
thou	1
me.	1
	1
21:23	1
Then	1
went	1
this	1
saying	1
abroad	1
among	1
the	1
brethren,	1
that	1
that	1
disciple	1
should	1
not	1
die:	1
yet	1
Jesus	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
him,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
die;	1
but,	1
If	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
tarry	1
till	1
I	1
come,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
thee?	1
21:24	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
disciple	1
which	1
testifieth	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
wrote	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
testimony	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
the	1
which,	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
written	1
every	1
one,	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
world	1
itself	1
could	1
not	1
contain	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
written.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Acts	1
of	1
the	1
Apostles	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
former	1
treatise	1
have	1
I	1
made,	1
O	1
Theophilus,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
Jesus	1
began	1
both	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
teach,	1
1:2	1
Until	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
through	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
had	1
given	1
commandments	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen:	1
1:3	1
To	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
shewed	1
himself	1
alive	1
after	1
his	1
passion	1
by	1
many	1
infallible	1
proofs,	1
being	1
seen	1
of	1
them	1
forty	1
days,	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
1:4	1
And,	1
being	1
assembled	1
together	1
with	1
them,	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
but	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
which,	1
saith	1
he,	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
John	1
truly	1
baptized	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
hence.	1
	1
1:6	1
When	1
they	1
therefore	1
were	1
come	1
together,	1
they	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
restore	1
again	1
the	1
kingdom	1
to	1
Israel?	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
times	1
or	1
the	1
seasons,	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
power.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
power,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
you:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
me	1
both	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
things,	1
while	1
they	1
beheld,	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up;	1
and	1
a	1
cloud	1
received	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
looked	1
stedfastly	1
toward	1
heaven	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
white	1
apparel;	1
1:11	1
Which	1
also	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
why	1
stand	1
ye	1
gazing	1
up	1
into	1
heaven?	1
this	1
same	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
is	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
you	1
into	1
heaven,	1
shall	1
so	1
come	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
go	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
returned	1
they	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
called	1
Olivet,	1
which	1
is	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
sabbath	1
day's	1
journey.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
in,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
upper	1
room,	1
where	1
abode	1
both	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
Bartholomew,	1
and	1
Matthew,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
Zelotes,	1
and	1
Judas	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James.	1
	1
1:14	1
These	1
all	1
continued	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication,	1
with	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
Peter	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
(the	1
number	1
of	1
names	1
together	1
were	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty,)	1
1:16	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
this	1
scripture	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
been	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
David	1
spake	1
before	1
concerning	1
Judas,	1
which	1
was	1
guide	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
took	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
had	1
obtained	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
ministry.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
this	1
man	1
purchased	1
a	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
falling	1
headlong,	1
he	1
burst	1
asunder	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
bowels	1
gushed	1
out.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
dwellers	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
insomuch	1
as	1
that	1
field	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
tongue,	1
Aceldama,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
The	1
field	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Psalms,	1
Let	1
his	1
habitation	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
and	1
his	1
bishoprick	1
let	1
another	1
take.	1
	1
1:21	1
Wherefore	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
companied	1
with	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
among	1
us,	1
1:22	1
Beginning	1
from	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
unto	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
us,	1
must	1
one	1
be	1
ordained	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
with	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
they	1
appointed	1
two,	1
Joseph	1
called	1
Barsabas,	1
who	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Justus,	1
and	1
Matthias.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
prayed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou,	1
Lord,	1
which	1
knowest	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
shew	1
whether	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
1:25	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
ministry	1
and	1
apostleship,	1
from	1
which	1
Judas	1
by	1
transgression	1
fell,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
place.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
forth	1
their	1
lots;	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
upon	1
Matthias;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
eleven	1
apostles.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Pentecost	1
was	1
fully	1
come,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
one	1
place.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sound	1
from	1
heaven	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
rushing	1
mighty	1
wind,	1
and	1
it	1
filled	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
sitting.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
cloven	1
tongues	1
like	1
as	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
sat	1
upon	1
each	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
other	1
tongues,	1
as	1
the	1
Spirit	1
gave	1
them	1
utterance.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
dwelling	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
Jews,	1
devout	1
men,	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
nation	1
under	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:6	1
Now	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
noised	1
abroad,	1
the	1
multitude	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
were	1
confounded,	1
because	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
language.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed	1
and	1
marvelled,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Behold,	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
which	1
speak	1
Galilaeans?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
how	1
hear	1
we	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
tongue,	1
wherein	1
we	1
were	1
born?	1
	1
2:9	1
Parthians,	1
and	1
Medes,	1
and	1
Elamites,	1
and	1
the	1
dwellers	1
in	1
Mesopotamia,	1
and	1
in	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Cappadocia,	1
in	1
Pontus,	1
and	1
Asia,	1
2:10	1
Phrygia,	1
and	1
Pamphylia,	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Libya	1
about	1
Cyrene,	1
and	1
strangers	1
of	1
Rome,	1
Jews	1
and	1
proselytes,	1
2:11	1
Cretes	1
and	1
Arabians,	1
we	1
do	1
hear	1
them	1
speak	1
in	1
our	1
tongues	1
the	1
wonderful	1
works	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
doubt,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
this?	1
	1
2:13	1
Others	1
mocking	1
said,	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
new	1
wine.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
Peter,	1
standing	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
eleven,	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
be	1
this	1
known	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
my	1
words:	1
2:15	1
For	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
drunken,	1
as	1
ye	1
suppose,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
2:16	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Joel;	1
2:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days,	1
saith	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
all	1
flesh:	1
and	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
see	1
visions,	1
and	1
your	1
old	1
men	1
shall	1
dream	1
dreams:	1
2:18	1
And	1
on	1
my	1
servants	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
handmaidens	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy:	1
2:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
wonders	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
and	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath;	1
blood,	1
and	1
fire,	1
and	1
vapour	1
of	1
smoke:	1
2:20	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
into	1
blood,	1
before	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
notable	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
come:	1
2:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
2:22	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hear	1
these	1
words;	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
a	1
man	1
approved	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
you	1
by	1
miracles	1
and	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs,	1
which	1
God	1
did	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
also	1
know:	1
2:23	1
Him,	1
being	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
determinate	1
counsel	1
and	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
have	1
taken,	1
and	1
by	1
wicked	1
hands	1
have	1
crucified	1
and	1
slain:	1
2:24	1
Whom	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
up,	1
having	1
loosed	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
death:	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
holden	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
David	1
speaketh	1
concerning	1
him,	1
I	1
foresaw	1
the	1
Lord	1
always	1
before	1
my	1
face,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
moved:	1
2:26	1
Therefore	1
did	1
my	1
heart	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
my	1
tongue	1
was	1
glad;	1
moreover	1
also	1
my	1
flesh	1
shall	1
rest	1
in	1
hope:	1
2:27	1
Because	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
leave	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
hell,	1
neither	1
wilt	1
thou	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
2:28	1
Thou	1
hast	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
life;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
me	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
with	1
thy	1
countenance.	1
	1
2:29	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
let	1
me	1
freely	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
patriarch	1
David,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
both	1
dead	1
and	1
buried,	1
and	1
his	1
sepulchre	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
2:30	1
Therefore	1
being	1
a	1
prophet,	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
sworn	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
loins,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
he	1
would	1
raise	1
up	1
Christ	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
his	1
throne;	1
2:31	1
He	1
seeing	1
this	1
before	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ,	1
that	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
not	1
left	1
in	1
hell,	1
neither	1
his	1
flesh	1
did	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
2:32	1
This	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
God	1
raised	1
up,	1
whereof	1
we	1
all	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
2:33	1
Therefore	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
exalted,	1
and	1
having	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
he	1
hath	1
shed	1
forth	1
this,	1
which	1
ye	1
now	1
see	1
and	1
hear.	1
	1
2:34	1
For	1
David	1
is	1
not	1
ascended	1
into	1
the	1
heavens:	1
but	1
he	1
saith	1
himself,	1
The	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
2:35	1
Until	1
I	1
make	1
thy	1
foes	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
2:36	1
Therefore	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
know	1
assuredly,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
crucified,	1
both	1
Lord	1
and	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:37	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
pricked	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
apostles,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
	1
2:38	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Repent,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
2:39	1
For	1
the	1
promise	1
is	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
children,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
call.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
with	1
many	1
other	1
words	1
did	1
he	1
testify	1
and	1
exhort,	1
saying,	1
Save	1
yourselves	1
from	1
this	1
untoward	1
generation.	1
	1
2:41	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
gladly	1
received	1
his	1
word	1
were	1
baptized:	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
there	1
were	1
added	1
unto	1
them	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
souls.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
they	1
continued	1
stedfastly	1
in	1
the	1
apostles'	1
doctrine	1
and	1
fellowship,	1
and	1
in	1
breaking	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
in	1
prayers.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
every	1
soul:	1
and	1
many	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
2:44	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
believed	1
were	1
together,	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common;	1
2:45	1
And	1
sold	1
their	1
possessions	1
and	1
goods,	1
and	1
parted	1
them	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
as	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
need.	1
	1
2:46	1
And	1
they,	1
continuing	1
daily	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
breaking	1
bread	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
did	1
eat	1
their	1
meat	1
with	1
gladness	1
and	1
singleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
2:47	1
Praising	1
God,	1
and	1
having	1
favour	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
daily	1
such	1
as	1
should	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
went	1
up	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
prayer,	1
being	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
lame	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb	1
was	1
carried,	1
whom	1
they	1
laid	1
daily	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Beautiful,	1
to	1
ask	1
alms	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple;	1
3:3	1
Who	1
seeing	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
asked	1
an	1
alms.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
Peter,	1
fastening	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
John,	1
said,	1
Look	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
them,	1
expecting	1
to	1
receive	1
something	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:6	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Silver	1
and	1
gold	1
have	1
I	1
none;	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
give	1
I	1
thee:	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
up:	1
and	1
immediately	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
ankle	1
bones	1
received	1
strength.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
he	1
leaping	1
up	1
stood,	1
and	1
walked,	1
and	1
entered	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
walking,	1
and	1
leaping,	1
and	1
praising	1
God.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
and	1
praising	1
God:	1
3:10	1
And	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
which	1
sat	1
for	1
alms	1
at	1
the	1
Beautiful	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
lame	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
healed	1
held	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
ran	1
together	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Solomon's,	1
greatly	1
wondering.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
answered	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
why	1
marvel	1
ye	1
at	1
this?	1
or	1
why	1
look	1
ye	1
so	1
earnestly	1
on	1
us,	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
power	1
or	1
holiness	1
we	1
had	1
made	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
walk?	1
3:13	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
hath	1
glorified	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus;	1
whom	1
ye	1
delivered	1
up,	1
and	1
denied	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Pilate,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
ye	1
denied	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
and	1
the	1
Just,	1
and	1
desired	1
a	1
murderer	1
to	1
be	1
granted	1
unto	1
you;	1
3:15	1
And	1
killed	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
life,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
whereof	1
we	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
through	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
hath	1
made	1
this	1
man	1
strong,	1
whom	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
know:	1
yea,	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
him	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
this	1
perfect	1
soundness	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
now,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
wot	1
that	1
through	1
ignorance	1
ye	1
did	1
it,	1
as	1
did	1
also	1
your	1
rulers.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
those	1
things,	1
which	1
God	1
before	1
had	1
shewed	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
prophets,	1
that	1
Christ	1
should	1
suffer,	1
he	1
hath	1
so	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
3:19	1
Repent	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
be	1
converted,	1
that	1
your	1
sins	1
may	1
be	1
blotted	1
out,	1
when	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
refreshing	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
before	1
was	1
preached	1
unto	1
you:	1
3:21	1
Whom	1
the	1
heaven	1
must	1
receive	1
until	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
restitution	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
holy	1
prophets	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began.	1
	1
3:22	1
For	1
Moses	1
truly	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers,	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
soul,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
that	1
prophet,	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:24	1
Yea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
from	1
Samuel	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
follow	1
after,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
spoken,	1
have	1
likewise	1
foretold	1
of	1
these	1
days.	1
	1
3:25	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
God	1
made	1
with	1
our	1
fathers,	1
saying	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
And	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
3:26	1
Unto	1
you	1
first	1
God,	1
having	1
raised	1
up	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus,	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
bless	1
you,	1
in	1
turning	1
away	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
his	1
iniquities.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
4:2	1
Being	1
grieved	1
that	1
they	1
taught	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
preached	1
through	1
Jesus	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
hold	1
unto	1
the	1
next	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
eventide.	1
	1
4:4	1
Howbeit	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
believed;	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
thousand.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
their	1
rulers,	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
scribes,	1
4:6	1
And	1
Annas	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
Caiaphas,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
kindred	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
they	1
asked,	1
By	1
what	1
power,	1
or	1
by	1
what	1
name,	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
this?	1
	1
4:8	1
Then	1
Peter,	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
4:9	1
If	1
we	1
this	1
day	1
be	1
examined	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
deed	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
impotent	1
man,	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
is	1
made	1
whole;	1
4:10	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
whom	1
ye	1
crucified,	1
whom	1
God	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
even	1
by	1
him	1
doth	1
this	1
man	1
stand	1
here	1
before	1
you	1
whole.	1
	1
4:11	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
was	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
of	1
you	1
builders,	1
which	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner.	1
	1
4:12	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
salvation	1
in	1
any	1
other:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
name	1
under	1
heaven	1
given	1
among	1
men,	1
whereby	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
4:13	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
unlearned	1
and	1
ignorant	1
men,	1
they	1
marvelled;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
beholding	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
healed	1
standing	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
4:15	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
they	1
conferred	1
among	1
themselves,	1
4:16	1
Saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
to	1
these	1
men?	1
for	1
that	1
indeed	1
a	1
notable	1
miracle	1
hath	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
them	1
is	1
manifest	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
deny	1
it.	1
	1
4:17	1
But	1
that	1
it	1
spread	1
no	1
further	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
let	1
us	1
straitly	1
threaten	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
henceforth	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
this	1
name.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
them,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
all	1
nor	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whether	1
it	1
be	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
unto	1
God,	1
judge	1
ye.	1
	1
4:20	1
For	1
we	1
cannot	1
but	1
speak	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard.	1
	1
4:21	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
further	1
threatened	1
them,	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
finding	1
nothing	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
punish	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
glorified	1
God	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
above	1
forty	1
years	1
old,	1
on	1
whom	1
this	1
miracle	1
of	1
healing	1
was	1
shewed.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
being	1
let	1
go,	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
company,	1
and	1
reported	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
to	1
God	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
art	1
God,	1
which	1
hast	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
them	1
is:	1
4:25	1
Who	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
hast	1
said,	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
heathen	1
rage,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
imagine	1
vain	1
things?	1
	1
4:26	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
against	1
thy	1
holy	1
child	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
anointed,	1
both	1
Herod,	1
and	1
Pontius	1
Pilate,	1
with	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
4:28	1
For	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
hand	1
and	1
thy	1
counsel	1
determined	1
before	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
4:29	1
And	1
now,	1
Lord,	1
behold	1
their	1
threatenings:	1
and	1
grant	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
boldness	1
they	1
may	1
speak	1
thy	1
word,	1
4:30	1
By	1
stretching	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
heal;	1
and	1
that	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
thy	1
holy	1
child	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:31	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prayed,	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
shaken	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
assembled	1
together;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
boldness.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
heart	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
soul:	1
neither	1
said	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
possessed	1
was	1
his	1
own;	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
gave	1
the	1
apostles	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
great	1
grace	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
4:34	1
Neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
lacked:	1
for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
possessors	1
of	1
lands	1
or	1
houses	1
sold	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
prices	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
sold,	1
4:35	1
And	1
laid	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet:	1
and	1
distribution	1
was	1
made	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
need.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
Joses,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
apostles	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Barnabas,	1
(which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
consolation,)	1
a	1
Levite,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
4:37	1
Having	1
land,	1
sold	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet.	1
	1
5:1	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Ananias,	1
with	1
Sapphira	1
his	1
wife,	1
sold	1
a	1
possession,	1
5:2	1
And	1
kept	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
price,	1
his	1
wife	1
also	1
being	1
privy	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
certain	1
part,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet.	1
	1
5:3	1
But	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Ananias,	1
why	1
hath	1
Satan	1
filled	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
lie	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
land?	1
5:4	1
Whiles	1
it	1
remained,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
thine	1
own?	1
and	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
sold,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
power?	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
conceived	1
this	1
thing	1
in	1
thine	1
heart?	1
	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
lied	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Ananias	1
hearing	1
these	1
words	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost:	1
and	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
arose,	1
wound	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
out,	1
and	1
buried	1
him.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
hours	1
after,	1
when	1
his	1
wife,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
unto	1
her,	1
Tell	1
me	1
whether	1
ye	1
sold	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
so	1
much?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Yea,	1
for	1
so	1
much.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
agreed	1
together	1
to	1
tempt	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
behold,	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
buried	1
thy	1
husband	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
shall	1
carry	1
thee	1
out.	1
	1
5:10	1
Then	1
fell	1
she	1
down	1
straightway	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost:	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
her	1
dead,	1
and,	1
carrying	1
her	1
forth,	1
buried	1
her	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
upon	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
were	1
many	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
people;	1
(and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
Solomon's	1
porch.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
durst	1
no	1
man	1
join	1
himself	1
to	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
magnified	1
them.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
believers	1
were	1
the	1
more	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
multitudes	1
both	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women.)	1
	1
5:15	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
sick	1
into	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
beds	1
and	1
couches,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Peter	1
passing	1
by	1
might	1
overshadow	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:16	1
There	1
came	1
also	1
a	1
multitude	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
round	1
about	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
bringing	1
sick	1
folks,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
vexed	1
with	1
unclean	1
spirits:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
healed	1
every	1
one.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
(which	1
is	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees,)	1
and	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
indignation,	1
5:18	1
And	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
prison.	1
	1
5:19	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
night	1
opened	1
the	1
prison	1
doors,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
forth,	1
and	1
said,	1
5:20	1
Go,	1
stand	1
and	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
life.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
taught.	1
But	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
council	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
senate	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
brought.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
officers	1
came,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
they	1
returned	1
and	1
told,	1
5:23	1
Saying,	1
The	1
prison	1
truly	1
found	1
we	1
shut	1
with	1
all	1
safety,	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
standing	1
without	1
before	1
the	1
doors:	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
opened,	1
we	1
found	1
no	1
man	1
within.	1
	1
5:24	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
doubted	1
of	1
them	1
whereunto	1
this	1
would	1
grow.	1
	1
5:25	1
Then	1
came	1
one	1
and	1
told	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
ye	1
put	1
in	1
prison	1
are	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
teaching	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
5:26	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
captain	1
with	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
without	1
violence:	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
stoned.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
them,	1
they	1
set	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
council:	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
asked	1
them,	1
5:28	1
Saying,	1
Did	1
not	1
we	1
straitly	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
teach	1
in	1
this	1
name?	1
and,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
have	1
filled	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
your	1
doctrine,	1
and	1
intend	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
man's	1
blood	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
5:29	1
Then	1
Peter	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
apostles	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
obey	1
God	1
rather	1
than	1
men.	1
	1
5:30	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
and	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree.	1
	1
5:31	1
Him	1
hath	1
God	1
exalted	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Prince	1
and	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
for	1
to	1
give	1
repentance	1
to	1
Israel,	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
5:32	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
witnesses	1
of	1
these	1
things;	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
5:33	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
slay	1
them.	1
	1
5:34	1
Then	1
stood	1
there	1
up	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
named	1
Gamaliel,	1
a	1
doctor	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
had	1
in	1
reputation	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
apostles	1
forth	1
a	1
little	1
space;	1
5:35	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves	1
what	1
ye	1
intend	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
touching	1
these	1
men.	1
	1
5:36	1
For	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
rose	1
up	1
Theudas,	1
boasting	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
somebody;	1
to	1
whom	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men,	1
about	1
four	1
hundred,	1
joined	1
themselves:	1
who	1
was	1
slain;	1
and	1
all,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
were	1
scattered,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
nought.	1
	1
5:37	1
After	1
this	1
man	1
rose	1
up	1
Judas	1
of	1
Galilee	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
taxing,	1
and	1
drew	1
away	1
much	1
people	1
after	1
him:	1
he	1
also	1
perished;	1
and	1
all,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
were	1
dispersed.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Refrain	1
from	1
these	1
men,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
alone:	1
for	1
if	1
this	1
counsel	1
or	1
this	1
work	1
be	1
of	1
men,	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
nought:	1
5:39	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
overthrow	1
it;	1
lest	1
haply	1
ye	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
agreed:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
beaten	1
them,	1
they	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
rejoicing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
worthy	1
to	1
suffer	1
shame	1
for	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
5:42	1
And	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
house,	1
they	1
ceased	1
not	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
preach	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
was	1
multiplied,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
murmuring	1
of	1
the	1
Grecians	1
against	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
because	1
their	1
widows	1
were	1
neglected	1
in	1
the	1
daily	1
ministration.	1
	1
6:2	1
Then	1
the	1
twelve	1
called	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
reason	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
leave	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
tables.	1
	1
6:3	1
Wherefore,	1
brethren,	1
look	1
ye	1
out	1
among	1
you	1
seven	1
men	1
of	1
honest	1
report,	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
whom	1
we	1
may	1
appoint	1
over	1
this	1
business.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
ourselves	1
continually	1
to	1
prayer,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
the	1
saying	1
pleased	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude:	1
and	1
they	1
chose	1
Stephen,	1
a	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Prochorus,	1
and	1
Nicanor,	1
and	1
Timon,	1
and	1
Parmenas,	1
and	1
Nicolas	1
a	1
proselyte	1
of	1
Antioch:	1
6:6	1
Whom	1
they	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
apostles:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prayed,	1
they	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
increased;	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
multiplied	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
greatly;	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
were	1
obedient	1
to	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
Stephen,	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
power,	1
did	1
great	1
wonders	1
and	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
6:9	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Libertines,	1
and	1
Cyrenians,	1
and	1
Alexandrians,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Cilicia	1
and	1
of	1
Asia,	1
disputing	1
with	1
Stephen.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
they	1
suborned	1
men,	1
which	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
speak	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
against	1
Moses,	1
and	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
they	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
council,	1
6:13	1
And	1
set	1
up	1
false	1
witnesses,	1
which	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
ceaseth	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
against	1
this	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
law:	1
6:14	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
that	1
this	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
shall	1
destroy	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
change	1
the	1
customs	1
which	1
Moses	1
delivered	1
us.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
looking	1
stedfastly	1
on	1
him,	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
angel.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
Are	1
these	1
things	1
so?	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Men,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
fathers,	1
hearken;	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
glory	1
appeared	1
unto	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Mesopotamia,	1
before	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Charran,	1
7:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
thee.	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldaeans,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Charran:	1
and	1
from	1
thence,	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
removed	1
him	1
into	1
this	1
land,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
now	1
dwell.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
none	1
inheritance	1
in	1
it,	1
no,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
foot	1
on:	1
yet	1
he	1
promised	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
possession,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him,	1
when	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
child.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
That	1
his	1
seed	1
should	1
sojourn	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
bondage,	1
and	1
entreat	1
them	1
evil	1
four	1
hundred	1
years.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
the	1
nation	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
bondage	1
will	1
I	1
judge,	1
said	1
God:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
shall	1
they	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
serve	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
circumcision:	1
and	1
so	1
Abraham	1
begat	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
circumcised	1
him	1
the	1
eighth	1
day;	1
and	1
Isaac	1
begat	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
begat	1
the	1
twelve	1
patriarchs.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
patriarchs,	1
moved	1
with	1
envy,	1
sold	1
Joseph	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
but	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
7:10	1
And	1
delivered	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
afflictions,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
favour	1
and	1
wisdom	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
governor	1
over	1
Egypt	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
7:11	1
Now	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
dearth	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
Chanaan,	1
and	1
great	1
affliction:	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
found	1
no	1
sustenance.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
when	1
Jacob	1
heard	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
our	1
fathers	1
first.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
Joseph	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
his	1
brethren;	1
and	1
Joseph's	1
kindred	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
7:14	1
Then	1
sent	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
father	1
Jacob	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
kindred,	1
threescore	1
and	1
fifteen	1
souls.	1
	1
7:15	1
So	1
Jacob	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
died,	1
he,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
7:16	1
And	1
were	1
carried	1
over	1
into	1
Sychem,	1
and	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
that	1
Abraham	1
bought	1
for	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Emmor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Sychem.	1
	1
7:17	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
people	1
grew	1
and	1
multiplied	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
7:18	1
Till	1
another	1
king	1
arose,	1
which	1
knew	1
not	1
Joseph.	1
	1
7:19	1
The	1
same	1
dealt	1
subtilly	1
with	1
our	1
kindred,	1
and	1
evil	1
entreated	1
our	1
fathers,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
their	1
young	1
children,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
live.	1
	1
7:20	1
In	1
which	1
time	1
Moses	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
was	1
exceeding	1
fair,	1
and	1
nourished	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
three	1
months:	1
7:21	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
nourished	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
son.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
learned	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
was	1
mighty	1
in	1
words	1
and	1
in	1
deeds.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
forty	1
years	1
old,	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
seeing	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
suffer	1
wrong,	1
he	1
defended	1
him,	1
and	1
avenged	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
oppressed,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Egyptian:	1
7:25	1
For	1
he	1
supposed	1
his	1
brethren	1
would	1
have	1
understood	1
how	1
that	1
God	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
would	1
deliver	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1
not.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
shewed	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
strove,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
them	1
at	1
one	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
are	1
brethren;	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
wrong	1
one	1
to	1
another?	1
	1
7:27	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
did	1
his	1
neighbour	1
wrong	1
thrust	1
him	1
away,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
judge	1
over	1
us?	1
7:28	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
kill	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
diddest	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
yesterday?	1
	1
7:29	1
Then	1
fled	1
Moses	1
at	1
this	1
saying,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Madian,	1
where	1
he	1
begat	1
two	1
sons.	1
	1
7:30	1
And	1
when	1
forty	1
years	1
were	1
expired,	1
there	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
mount	1
Sina	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
a	1
bush.	1
	1
7:31	1
When	1
Moses	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
sight:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
behold	1
it,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
7:32	1
Saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
Then	1
Moses	1
trembled,	1
and	1
durst	1
not	1
behold.	1
	1
7:33	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
him,	1
Put	1
off	1
thy	1
shoes	1
from	1
thy	1
feet:	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
standest	1
is	1
holy	1
ground.	1
	1
7:34	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
their	1
groaning,	1
and	1
am	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
deliver	1
them.	1
And	1
now	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:35	1
This	1
Moses	1
whom	1
they	1
refused,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
judge?	1
the	1
same	1
did	1
God	1
send	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
deliverer	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
bush.	1
	1
7:36	1
He	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shewed	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
7:37	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
Moses,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear.	1
	1
7:38	1
This	1
is	1
he,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
spake	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
Sina,	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
fathers:	1
who	1
received	1
the	1
lively	1
oracles	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
us:	1
7:39	1
To	1
whom	1
our	1
fathers	1
would	1
not	1
obey,	1
but	1
thrust	1
him	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
7:40	1
Saying	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Make	1
us	1
gods	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
us:	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
Moses,	1
which	1
brought	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
we	1
wot	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:41	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
calf	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
offered	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
idol,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
7:42	1
Then	1
God	1
turned,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
have	1
ye	1
offered	1
to	1
me	1
slain	1
beasts	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
7:43	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Moloch,	1
and	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
your	1
god	1
Remphan,	1
figures	1
which	1
ye	1
made	1
to	1
worship	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
carry	1
you	1
away	1
beyond	1
Babylon.	1
	1
7:44	1
Our	1
fathers	1
had	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
appointed,	1
speaking	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fashion	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
7:45	1
Which	1
also	1
our	1
fathers	1
that	1
came	1
after	1
brought	1
in	1
with	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
whom	1
God	1
drave	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
unto	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
David;	1
7:46	1
Who	1
found	1
favour	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
7:47	1
But	1
Solomon	1
built	1
him	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
7:48	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
temples	1
made	1
with	1
hands;	1
as	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet,	1
7:49	1
Heaven	1
is	1
my	1
throne,	1
and	1
earth	1
is	1
my	1
footstool:	1
what	1
house	1
will	1
ye	1
build	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord:	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
rest?	1
	1
7:50	1
Hath	1
not	1
my	1
hand	1
made	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
7:51	1
Ye	1
stiffnecked	1
and	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
heart	1
and	1
ears,	1
ye	1
do	1
always	1
resist	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
as	1
your	1
fathers	1
did,	1
so	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
7:52	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
not	1
your	1
fathers	1
persecuted?	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
which	1
shewed	1
before	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Just	1
One;	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
now	1
the	1
betrayers	1
and	1
murderers:	1
7:53	1
Who	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
angels,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
it.	1
	1
7:54	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
they	1
gnashed	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
teeth.	1
	1
7:55	1
But	1
he,	1
being	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
looked	1
up	1
stedfastly	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
7:56	1
And	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
heavens	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:57	1
Then	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
stopped	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
ran	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
7:58	1
And	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
witnesses	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
clothes	1
at	1
a	1
young	1
man's	1
feet,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Saul.	1
	1
7:59	1
And	1
they	1
stoned	1
Stephen,	1
calling	1
upon	1
God,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
receive	1
my	1
spirit.	1
	1
7:60	1
And	1
he	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Lord,	1
lay	1
not	1
this	1
sin	1
to	1
their	1
charge.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
consenting	1
unto	1
his	1
death.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
persecution	1
against	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
except	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
devout	1
men	1
carried	1
Stephen	1
to	1
his	1
burial,	1
and	1
made	1
great	1
lamentation	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
8:3	1
As	1
for	1
Saul,	1
he	1
made	1
havock	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
entering	1
into	1
every	1
house,	1
and	1
haling	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
committed	1
them	1
to	1
prison.	1
	1
8:4	1
Therefore	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
went	1
every	1
where	1
preaching	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
8:5	1
Then	1
Philip	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
preached	1
Christ	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Philip	1
spake,	1
hearing	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
crying	1
with	1
loud	1
voice,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
many	1
taken	1
with	1
palsies,	1
and	1
that	1
were	1
lame,	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
called	1
Simon,	1
which	1
beforetime	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
city	1
used	1
sorcery,	1
and	1
bewitched	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
giving	1
out	1
that	1
himself	1
was	1
some	1
great	1
one:	1
8:10	1
To	1
whom	1
they	1
all	1
gave	1
heed,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
greatest,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
had	1
regard,	1
because	1
that	1
of	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
bewitched	1
them	1
with	1
sorceries.	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
believed	1
Philip	1
preaching	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
they	1
were	1
baptized,	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
8:13	1
Then	1
Simon	1
himself	1
believed	1
also:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
baptized,	1
he	1
continued	1
with	1
Philip,	1
and	1
wondered,	1
beholding	1
the	1
miracles	1
and	1
signs	1
which	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
8:14	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
apostles	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
heard	1
that	1
Samaria	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
Peter	1
and	1
John:	1
8:15	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down,	1
prayed	1
for	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
8:16	1
(For	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
none	1
of	1
them:	1
only	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.)	1
	1
8:17	1
Then	1
laid	1
they	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
when	1
Simon	1
saw	1
that	1
through	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
apostles'	1
hands	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
given,	1
he	1
offered	1
them	1
money,	1
8:19	1
Saying,	1
Give	1
me	1
also	1
this	1
power,	1
that	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
lay	1
hands,	1
he	1
may	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
8:20	1
But	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
money	1
perish	1
with	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
purchased	1
with	1
money.	1
	1
8:21	1
Thou	1
hast	1
neither	1
part	1
nor	1
lot	1
in	1
this	1
matter:	1
for	1
thy	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:22	1
Repent	1
therefore	1
of	1
this	1
thy	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
pray	1
God,	1
if	1
perhaps	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
thine	1
heart	1
may	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
8:23	1
For	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
8:24	1
Then	1
answered	1
Simon,	1
and	1
said,	1
Pray	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
come	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
testified	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
in	1
many	1
villages	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
unto	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Gaza,	1
which	1
is	1
desert.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
went:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Ethiopia,	1
an	1
eunuch	1
of	1
great	1
authority	1
under	1
Candace	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopians,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
treasure,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
to	1
worship,	1
8:28	1
Was	1
returning,	1
and	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
chariot	1
read	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
8:29	1
Then	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
Go	1
near,	1
and	1
join	1
thyself	1
to	1
this	1
chariot.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Philip	1
ran	1
thither	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
read	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias,	1
and	1
said,	1
Understandest	1
thou	1
what	1
thou	1
readest?	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
I,	1
except	1
some	1
man	1
should	1
guide	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
Philip	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
and	1
sit	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
8:32	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
scripture	1
which	1
he	1
read	1
was	1
this,	1
He	1
was	1
led	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
lamb	1
dumb	1
before	1
his	1
shearer,	1
so	1
opened	1
he	1
not	1
his	1
mouth:	1
8:33	1
In	1
his	1
humiliation	1
his	1
judgment	1
was	1
taken	1
away:	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
generation?	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
the	1
eunuch	1
answered	1
Philip,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
whom	1
speaketh	1
the	1
prophet	1
this?	1
of	1
himself,	1
or	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
man?	1
	1
8:35	1
Then	1
Philip	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
scripture,	1
and	1
preached	1
unto	1
him	1
Jesus.	1
	1
8:36	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
way,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
eunuch	1
said,	1
See,	1
here	1
is	1
water;	1
what	1
doth	1
hinder	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
baptized?	1
	1
8:37	1
And	1
Philip	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
believest	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
thou	1
mayest.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:38	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
chariot	1
to	1
stand	1
still:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
both	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
both	1
Philip	1
and	1
the	1
eunuch;	1
and	1
he	1
baptized	1
him.	1
	1
8:39	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
caught	1
away	1
Philip,	1
that	1
the	1
eunuch	1
saw	1
him	1
no	1
more:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
8:40	1
But	1
Philip	1
was	1
found	1
at	1
Azotus:	1
and	1
passing	1
through	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Caesarea.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
Saul,	1
yet	1
breathing	1
out	1
threatenings	1
and	1
slaughter	1
against	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
9:2	1
And	1
desired	1
of	1
him	1
letters	1
to	1
Damascus	1
to	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
any	1
of	1
this	1
way,	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
or	1
women,	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
bound	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed,	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
Damascus:	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
shined	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
heaven:	1
9:4	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest:	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
he	1
trembling	1
and	1
astonished	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
have	1
me	1
to	1
do?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
must	1
do.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
journeyed	1
with	1
him	1
stood	1
speechless,	1
hearing	1
a	1
voice,	1
but	1
seeing	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened,	1
he	1
saw	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
Damascus.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
three	1
days	1
without	1
sight,	1
and	1
neither	1
did	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
named	1
Ananias;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
Ananias.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
here,	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Straight,	1
and	1
enquire	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judas	1
for	1
one	1
called	1
Saul,	1
of	1
Tarsus:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
he	1
prayeth,	1
9:12	1
And	1
hath	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Ananias	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
9:13	1
Then	1
Ananias	1
answered,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
this	1
man,	1
how	1
much	1
evil	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
thy	1
saints	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
9:14	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
hath	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
to	1
bind	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
on	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
chosen	1
vessel	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
bear	1
my	1
name	1
before	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
9:16	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
him	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
must	1
suffer	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
Ananias	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
said,	1
Brother	1
Saul,	1
the	1
Lord,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
thou	1
camest,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
receive	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
immediately	1
there	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
scales:	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
sight	1
forthwith,	1
and	1
arose,	1
and	1
was	1
baptized.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
meat,	1
he	1
was	1
strengthened.	1
Then	1
was	1
Saul	1
certain	1
days	1
with	1
the	1
disciples	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Damascus.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
preached	1
Christ	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:21	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
were	1
amazed,	1
and	1
said;	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he	1
that	1
destroyed	1
them	1
which	1
called	1
on	1
this	1
name	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
came	1
hither	1
for	1
that	1
intent,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
bound	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests?	1
	1
9:22	1
But	1
Saul	1
increased	1
the	1
more	1
in	1
strength,	1
and	1
confounded	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
proving	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
Christ.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
many	1
days	1
were	1
fulfilled,	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
kill	1
him:	1
9:24	1
But	1
their	1
laying	1
await	1
was	1
known	1
of	1
Saul.	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
the	1
gates	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
9:25	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
wall	1
in	1
a	1
basket.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
assayed	1
to	1
join	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
disciples:	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
believed	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
disciple.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
Barnabas	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
preached	1
boldly	1
at	1
Damascus	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
coming	1
in	1
and	1
going	1
out	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
disputed	1
against	1
the	1
Grecians:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
9:30	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
knew,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
Tarsus.	1
	1
9:31	1
Then	1
had	1
the	1
churches	1
rest	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Galilee	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
were	1
edified;	1
and	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
were	1
multiplied.	1
	1
9:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Peter	1
passed	1
throughout	1
all	1
quarters,	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Lydda.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
there	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Aeneas,	1
which	1
had	1
kept	1
his	1
bed	1
eight	1
years,	1
and	1
was	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Aeneas,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
maketh	1
thee	1
whole:	1
arise,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
bed.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
immediately.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Lydda	1
and	1
Saron	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:36	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
Joppa	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
named	1
Tabitha,	1
which	1
by	1
interpretation	1
is	1
called	1
Dorcas:	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
good	1
works	1
and	1
almsdeeds	1
which	1
she	1
did.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
died:	1
whom	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
washed,	1
they	1
laid	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
upper	1
chamber.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
Lydda	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Peter	1
was	1
there,	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
men,	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
9:39	1
Then	1
Peter	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
widows	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
weeping,	1
and	1
shewing	1
the	1
coats	1
and	1
garments	1
which	1
Dorcas	1
made,	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:40	1
But	1
Peter	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
forth,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed;	1
and	1
turning	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
body	1
said,	1
Tabitha,	1
arise.	1
And	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Peter,	1
she	1
sat	1
up.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
up,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
saints	1
and	1
widows,	1
presented	1
her	1
alive.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
throughout	1
all	1
Joppa;	1
and	1
many	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
tarried	1
many	1
days	1
in	1
Joppa	1
with	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner.	1
	1
10:1	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
in	1
Caesarea	1
called	1
Cornelius,	1
a	1
centurion	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
called	1
the	1
Italian	1
band,	1
10:2	1
A	1
devout	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feared	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
which	1
gave	1
much	1
alms	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
alway.	1
	1
10:3	1
He	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
evidently	1
about	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
coming	1
in	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Cornelius.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
it,	1
Lord?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
prayers	1
and	1
thine	1
alms	1
are	1
come	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
now	1
send	1
men	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
one	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter:	1
10:6	1
He	1
lodgeth	1
with	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner,	1
whose	1
house	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
he	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
spake	1
unto	1
Cornelius	1
was	1
departed,	1
he	1
called	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
household	1
servants,	1
and	1
a	1
devout	1
soldier	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
waited	1
on	1
him	1
continually;	1
10:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
declared	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Joppa.	1
	1
10:9	1
On	1
the	1
morrow,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
city,	1
Peter	1
went	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop	1
to	1
pray	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour:	1
10:10	1
And	1
he	1
became	1
very	1
hungry,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
eaten:	1
but	1
while	1
they	1
made	1
ready,	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
trance,	1
10:11	1
And	1
saw	1
heaven	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
vessel	1
descending	1
upon	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
sheet	1
knit	1
at	1
the	1
four	1
corners,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
10:12	1
Wherein	1
were	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fourfooted	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
him,	1
Rise,	1
Peter;	1
kill,	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Not	1
so,	1
Lord;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
eaten	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
common	1
or	1
unclean.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
What	1
God	1
hath	1
cleansed,	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
thou	1
common.	1
	1
10:16	1
This	1
was	1
done	1
thrice:	1
and	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
received	1
up	1
again	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:17	1
Now	1
while	1
Peter	1
doubted	1
in	1
himself	1
what	1
this	1
vision	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
should	1
mean,	1
behold,	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
Cornelius	1
had	1
made	1
enquiry	1
for	1
Simon's	1
house,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
gate,	1
10:18	1
And	1
called,	1
and	1
asked	1
whether	1
Simon,	1
which	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Peter,	1
were	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
10:19	1
While	1
Peter	1
thought	1
on	1
the	1
vision,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
three	1
men	1
seek	1
thee.	1
	1
10:20	1
Arise	1
therefore,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
down,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
doubting	1
nothing:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
them.	1
	1
10:21	1
Then	1
Peter	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
Cornelius;	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek:	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
are	1
come?	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Cornelius	1
the	1
centurion,	1
a	1
just	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feareth	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
report	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nation	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
was	1
warned	1
from	1
God	1
by	1
an	1
holy	1
angel	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
thee	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
words	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
10:23	1
Then	1
called	1
he	1
them	1
in,	1
and	1
lodged	1
them.	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
Peter	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
certain	1
brethren	1
from	1
Joppa	1
accompanied	1
him.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
Caesarea.	1
And	1
Cornelius	1
waited	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
together	1
his	1
kinsmen	1
and	1
near	1
friends.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
was	1
coming	1
in,	1
Cornelius	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
10:26	1
But	1
Peter	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Stand	1
up;	1
I	1
myself	1
also	1
am	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
together.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unlawful	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Jew	1
to	1
keep	1
company,	1
or	1
come	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
another	1
nation;	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
call	1
any	1
man	1
common	1
or	1
unclean.	1
	1
10:29	1
Therefore	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
you	1
without	1
gainsaying,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
sent	1
for:	1
I	1
ask	1
therefore	1
for	1
what	1
intent	1
ye	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
me?	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
Cornelius	1
said,	1
Four	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
was	1
fasting	1
until	1
this	1
hour;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
I	1
prayed	1
in	1
my	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
bright	1
clothing,	1
10:31	1
And	1
said,	1
Cornelius,	1
thy	1
prayer	1
is	1
heard,	1
and	1
thine	1
alms	1
are	1
had	1
in	1
remembrance	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
Send	1
therefore	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
hither	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter;	1
he	1
is	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:33	1
Immediately	1
therefore	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
well	1
done	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
here	1
present	1
before	1
God,	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
commanded	1
thee	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:34	1
Then	1
Peter	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
no	1
respecter	1
of	1
persons:	1
10:35	1
But	1
in	1
every	1
nation	1
he	1
that	1
feareth	1
him,	1
and	1
worketh	1
righteousness,	1
is	1
accepted	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:36	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
God	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
preaching	1
peace	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
(he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
all:)	1
10:37	1
That	1
word,	1
I	1
say,	1
ye	1
know,	1
which	1
was	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
began	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
after	1
the	1
baptism	1
which	1
John	1
preached;	1
10:38	1
How	1
God	1
anointed	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
with	1
power:	1
who	1
went	1
about	1
doing	1
good,	1
and	1
healing	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
oppressed	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
for	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
witnesses	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
whom	1
they	1
slew	1
and	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
10:40	1
Him	1
God	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
shewed	1
him	1
openly;	1
10:41	1
Not	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
but	1
unto	1
witnesses	1
chosen	1
before	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
us,	1
who	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
him	1
after	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
us	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
quick	1
and	1
dead.	1
	1
10:43	1
To	1
him	1
give	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
witness,	1
that	1
through	1
his	1
name	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
receive	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
10:44	1
While	1
Peter	1
yet	1
spake	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
10:45	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
which	1
believed	1
were	1
astonished,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
came	1
with	1
Peter,	1
because	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
also	1
was	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
10:46	1
For	1
they	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
magnify	1
God.	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter,	1
10:47	1
Can	1
any	1
man	1
forbid	1
water,	1
that	1
these	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
baptized,	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we?	1
	1
10:48	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Then	1
prayed	1
they	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
certain	1
days.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
brethren	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Judaea	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
had	1
also	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
contended	1
with	1
him,	1
11:3	1
Saying,	1
Thou	1
wentest	1
in	1
to	1
men	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
didst	1
eat	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
But	1
Peter	1
rehearsed	1
the	1
matter	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
expounded	1
it	1
by	1
order	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
11:5	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Joppa	1
praying:	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
trance	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
vision,	1
A	1
certain	1
vessel	1
descend,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
sheet,	1
let	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
by	1
four	1
corners;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
even	1
to	1
me:	1
11:6	1
Upon	1
the	1
which	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
fastened	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
I	1
considered,	1
and	1
saw	1
fourfooted	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
Peter;	1
slay	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
11:8	1
But	1
I	1
said,	1
Not	1
so,	1
Lord:	1
for	1
nothing	1
common	1
or	1
unclean	1
hath	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
entered	1
into	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
the	1
voice	1
answered	1
me	1
again	1
from	1
heaven,	1
What	1
God	1
hath	1
cleansed,	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
thou	1
common.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
three	1
times:	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
drawn	1
up	1
again	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
immediately	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
men	1
already	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
I	1
was,	1
sent	1
from	1
Caesarea	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
bade	1
me	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
nothing	1
doubting.	1
Moreover	1
these	1
six	1
brethren	1
accompanied	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
man's	1
house:	1
11:13	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
us	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
which	1
stood	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Send	1
men	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter;	1
11:14	1
Who	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
words,	1
whereby	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
speak,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
on	1
them,	1
as	1
on	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
11:16	1
Then	1
remembered	1
I	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
John	1
indeed	1
baptized	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
11:17	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
like	1
gift	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
us,	1
who	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
what	1
was	1
I,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
withstand	1
God?	1
	1
11:18	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Then	1
hath	1
God	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
granted	1
repentance	1
unto	1
life.	1
	1
11:19	1
Now	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
persecution	1
that	1
arose	1
about	1
Stephen	1
travelled	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Phenice,	1
and	1
Cyprus,	1
and	1
Antioch,	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
to	1
none	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
only.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
Cyprus	1
and	1
Cyrene,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
Grecians,	1
preaching	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
believed,	1
and	1
turned	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:22	1
Then	1
tidings	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
sent	1
forth	1
Barnabas,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:23	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
exhorted	1
them	1
all,	1
that	1
with	1
purpose	1
of	1
heart	1
they	1
would	1
cleave	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:24	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
of	1
faith:	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
was	1
added	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:25	1
Then	1
departed	1
Barnabas	1
to	1
Tarsus,	1
for	1
to	1
seek	1
Saul:	1
11:26	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Antioch.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
a	1
whole	1
year	1
they	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
taught	1
much	1
people.	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
called	1
Christians	1
first	1
in	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
came	1
prophets	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
there	1
stood	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
named	1
Agabus,	1
and	1
signified	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
great	1
dearth	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
world:	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Claudius	1
Caesar.	1
	1
11:29	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples,	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ability,	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
relief	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Judaea:	1
11:30	1
Which	1
also	1
they	1
did,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
elders	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
about	1
that	1
time	1
Herod	1
the	1
king	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
vex	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
he	1
killed	1
James	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
John	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Jews,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
further	1
to	1
take	1
Peter	1
also.	1
(Then	1
were	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread.)	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
apprehended	1
him,	1
he	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
four	1
quaternions	1
of	1
soldiers	1
to	1
keep	1
him;	1
intending	1
after	1
Easter	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
12:5	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
was	1
kept	1
in	1
prison:	1
but	1
prayer	1
was	1
made	1
without	1
ceasing	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
would	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
forth,	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
Peter	1
was	1
sleeping	1
between	1
two	1
soldiers,	1
bound	1
with	1
two	1
chains:	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
kept	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
12:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
light	1
shined	1
in	1
the	1
prison:	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
Peter	1
on	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Arise	1
up	1
quickly.	1
And	1
his	1
chains	1
fell	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Gird	1
thyself,	1
and	1
bind	1
on	1
thy	1
sandals.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
did.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Cast	1
thy	1
garment	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
followed	1
him;	1
and	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
which	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
angel;	1
but	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
vision.	1
	1
12:10	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
past	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
ward,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
iron	1
gate	1
that	1
leadeth	1
unto	1
the	1
city;	1
which	1
opened	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
through	1
one	1
street;	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
angel	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
delivered	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Herod,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
considered	1
the	1
thing,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark;	1
where	1
many	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
praying.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
a	1
damsel	1
came	1
to	1
hearken,	1
named	1
Rhoda.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
knew	1
Peter's	1
voice,	1
she	1
opened	1
not	1
the	1
gate	1
for	1
gladness,	1
but	1
ran	1
in,	1
and	1
told	1
how	1
Peter	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
art	1
mad.	1
But	1
she	1
constantly	1
affirmed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
so.	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
It	1
is	1
his	1
angel.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
Peter	1
continued	1
knocking:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
were	1
astonished.	1
	1
12:17	1
But	1
he,	1
beckoning	1
unto	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
peace,	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
how	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
shew	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
James,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
brethren.	1
And	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
another	1
place.	1
	1
12:18	1
Now	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
small	1
stir	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
what	1
was	1
become	1
of	1
Peter.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
had	1
sought	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
not,	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
keepers,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
there	1
abode.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
Herod	1
was	1
highly	1
displeased	1
with	1
them	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon:	1
but	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
to	1
him,	1
and,	1
having	1
made	1
Blastus	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlain	1
their	1
friend,	1
desired	1
peace;	1
because	1
their	1
country	1
was	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
country.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
upon	1
a	1
set	1
day	1
Herod,	1
arrayed	1
in	1
royal	1
apparel,	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
oration	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
gave	1
a	1
shout,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
god,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
smote	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
gave	1
not	1
God	1
the	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
eaten	1
of	1
worms,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
12:24	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
grew	1
and	1
multiplied.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul	1
returned	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
their	1
ministry,	1
and	1
took	1
with	1
them	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Antioch	1
certain	1
prophets	1
and	1
teachers;	1
as	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
Simeon	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Niger,	1
and	1
Lucius	1
of	1
Cyrene,	1
and	1
Manaen,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch,	1
and	1
Saul.	1
	1
13:2	1
As	1
they	1
ministered	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
fasted,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
said,	1
Separate	1
me	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
whereunto	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fasted	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
they	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
13:4	1
So	1
they,	1
being	1
sent	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
departed	1
unto	1
Seleucia;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
they	1
sailed	1
to	1
Cyprus.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
Salamis,	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
John	1
to	1
their	1
minister.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
isle	1
unto	1
Paphos,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
sorcerer,	1
a	1
false	1
prophet,	1
a	1
Jew,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Barjesus:	1
13:7	1
Which	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
deputy	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
Sergius	1
Paulus,	1
a	1
prudent	1
man;	1
who	1
called	1
for	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:8	1
But	1
Elymas	1
the	1
sorcerer	1
(for	1
so	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
by	1
interpretation)	1
withstood	1
them,	1
seeking	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
deputy	1
from	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
13:9	1
Then	1
Saul,	1
(who	1
also	1
is	1
called	1
Paul,)	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
set	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
subtilty	1
and	1
all	1
mischief,	1
thou	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
thou	1
enemy	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pervert	1
the	1
right	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blind,	1
not	1
seeing	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
And	1
immediately	1
there	1
fell	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
mist	1
and	1
a	1
darkness;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
about	1
seeking	1
some	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
13:12	1
Then	1
the	1
deputy,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
believed,	1
being	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
13:13	1
Now	1
when	1
Paul	1
and	1
his	1
company	1
loosed	1
from	1
Paphos,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Perga	1
in	1
Pamphylia:	1
and	1
John	1
departing	1
from	1
them	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Perga,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Antioch	1
in	1
Pisidia,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
sent	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
any	1
word	1
of	1
exhortation	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
say	1
on.	1
	1
13:16	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
beckoning	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
said,	1
Men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
God,	1
give	1
audience.	1
	1
13:17	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
chose	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
exalted	1
the	1
people	1
when	1
they	1
dwelt	1
as	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
high	1
arm	1
brought	1
he	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
suffered	1
he	1
their	1
manners	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
destroyed	1
seven	1
nations	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Chanaan,	1
he	1
divided	1
their	1
land	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
lot.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
judges	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years,	1
until	1
Samuel	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
afterward	1
they	1
desired	1
a	1
king:	1
and	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
Saul	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Cis,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
removed	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
unto	1
them	1
David	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king;	1
to	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
gave	1
their	1
testimony,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
David	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
a	1
man	1
after	1
mine	1
own	1
heart,	1
which	1
shall	1
fulfil	1
all	1
my	1
will.	1
	1
13:23	1
Of	1
this	1
man's	1
seed	1
hath	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
promise	1
raised	1
unto	1
Israel	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
Jesus:	1
13:24	1
When	1
John	1
had	1
first	1
preached	1
before	1
his	1
coming	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
as	1
John	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
course,	1
he	1
said,	1
Whom	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
he.	1
But,	1
behold,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
after	1
me,	1
whose	1
shoes	1
of	1
his	1
feet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
loose.	1
	1
13:26	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
among	1
you	1
feareth	1
God,	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
this	1
salvation	1
sent.	1
	1
13:27	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
their	1
rulers,	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
not,	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
are	1
read	1
every	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
they	1
have	1
fulfilled	1
them	1
in	1
condemning	1
him.	1
	1
13:28	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
found	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
him,	1
yet	1
desired	1
they	1
Pilate	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
written	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
13:30	1
But	1
God	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
13:31	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
many	1
days	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
who	1
are	1
his	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
we	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
glad	1
tidings,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers,	1
13:33	1
God	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
same	1
unto	1
us	1
their	1
children,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
again;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
psalm,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
13:34	1
And	1
as	1
concerning	1
that	1
he	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
now	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
corruption,	1
he	1
said	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
sure	1
mercies	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
13:35	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
psalm,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
13:36	1
For	1
David,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
his	1
own	1
generation	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
fell	1
on	1
sleep,	1
and	1
was	1
laid	1
unto	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
saw	1
corruption:	1
13:37	1
But	1
he,	1
whom	1
God	1
raised	1
again,	1
saw	1
no	1
corruption.	1
	1
13:38	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
therefore,	1
men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
that	1
through	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
preached	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins:	1
13:39	1
And	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
believe	1
are	1
justified	1
from	1
all	1
things,	1
from	1
which	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
13:40	1
Beware	1
therefore,	1
lest	1
that	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
prophets;	1
13:41	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
despisers,	1
and	1
wonder,	1
and	1
perish:	1
for	1
I	1
work	1
a	1
work	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
a	1
work	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
believe,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
13:42	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
besought	1
that	1
these	1
words	1
might	1
be	1
preached	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
next	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:43	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
broken	1
up,	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
religious	1
proselytes	1
followed	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas:	1
who,	1
speaking	1
to	1
them,	1
persuaded	1
them	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:44	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
sabbath	1
day	1
came	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
together	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:45	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
envy,	1
and	1
spake	1
against	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Paul,	1
contradicting	1
and	1
blaspheming.	1
	1
13:46	1
Then	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
waxed	1
bold,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
first	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
to	1
you:	1
but	1
seeing	1
ye	1
put	1
it	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
judge	1
yourselves	1
unworthy	1
of	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
lo,	1
we	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
13:47	1
For	1
so	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
us,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
for	1
salvation	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
13:48	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
glorified	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
ordained	1
to	1
eternal	1
life	1
believed.	1
	1
13:49	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region.	1
	1
13:50	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
devout	1
and	1
honourable	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
raised	1
persecution	1
against	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
expelled	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
13:51	1
But	1
they	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Iconium.	1
	1
13:52	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
Iconium,	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
so	1
spake,	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Greeks	1
believed.	1
	1
14:2	1
But	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
Jews	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
minds	1
evil	1
affected	1
against	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
14:3	1
Long	1
time	1
therefore	1
abode	1
they	1
speaking	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
which	1
gave	1
testimony	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
and	1
granted	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
14:4	1
But	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
divided:	1
and	1
part	1
held	1
with	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
part	1
with	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
assault	1
made	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
with	1
their	1
rulers,	1
to	1
use	1
them	1
despitefully,	1
and	1
to	1
stone	1
them,	1
14:6	1
They	1
were	1
ware	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
fled	1
unto	1
Lystra	1
and	1
Derbe,	1
cities	1
of	1
Lycaonia,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
region	1
that	1
lieth	1
round	1
about:	1
14:7	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
sat	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
at	1
Lystra,	1
impotent	1
in	1
his	1
feet,	1
being	1
a	1
cripple	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
who	1
never	1
had	1
walked:	1
14:9	1
The	1
same	1
heard	1
Paul	1
speak:	1
who	1
stedfastly	1
beholding	1
him,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
faith	1
to	1
be	1
healed,	1
14:10	1
Said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Stand	1
upright	1
on	1
thy	1
feet.	1
And	1
he	1
leaped	1
and	1
walked.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
what	1
Paul	1
had	1
done,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
Lycaonia,	1
The	1
gods	1
are	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
Barnabas,	1
Jupiter;	1
and	1
Paul,	1
Mercurius,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
speaker.	1
	1
14:13	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Jupiter,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
their	1
city,	1
brought	1
oxen	1
and	1
garlands	1
unto	1
the	1
gates,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:14	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
apostles,	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
heard	1
of,	1
they	1
rent	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
crying	1
out,	1
14:15	1
And	1
saying,	1
Sirs,	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
these	1
things?	1
We	1
also	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
like	1
passions	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
preach	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
turn	1
from	1
these	1
vanities	1
unto	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
which	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
therein:	1
14:16	1
Who	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
suffered	1
all	1
nations	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
ways.	1
	1
14:17	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
left	1
not	1
himself	1
without	1
witness,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
good,	1
and	1
gave	1
us	1
rain	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
fruitful	1
seasons,	1
filling	1
our	1
hearts	1
with	1
food	1
and	1
gladness.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
sayings	1
scarce	1
restrained	1
they	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
thither	1
certain	1
Jews	1
from	1
Antioch	1
and	1
Iconium,	1
who	1
persuaded	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
having	1
stoned	1
Paul,	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
supposing	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dead.	1
	1
14:20	1
Howbeit,	1
as	1
the	1
disciples	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
he	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
departed	1
with	1
Barnabas	1
to	1
Derbe.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
that	1
city,	1
and	1
had	1
taught	1
many,	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
Lystra,	1
and	1
to	1
Iconium,	1
and	1
Antioch,	1
14:22	1
Confirming	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
exhorting	1
them	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
through	1
much	1
tribulation	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
ordained	1
them	1
elders	1
in	1
every	1
church,	1
and	1
had	1
prayed	1
with	1
fasting,	1
they	1
commended	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
believed.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
throughout	1
Pisidia,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Pamphylia.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
Perga,	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Attalia:	1
14:26	1
And	1
thence	1
sailed	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
they	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
and	1
had	1
gathered	1
the	1
church	1
together,	1
they	1
rehearsed	1
all	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
faith	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
abode	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
certain	1
men	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
taught	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
said,	1
Except	1
ye	1
be	1
circumcised	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Moses,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
15:2	1
When	1
therefore	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
had	1
no	1
small	1
dissension	1
and	1
disputation	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
determined	1
that	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
certain	1
other	1
of	1
them,	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
about	1
this	1
question.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
being	1
brought	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
by	1
the	1
church,	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
Phenice	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
declaring	1
the	1
conversion	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
they	1
caused	1
great	1
joy	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
they	1
were	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
they	1
declared	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
there	1
rose	1
up	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
which	1
believed,	1
saying,	1
That	1
it	1
was	1
needful	1
to	1
circumcise	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
came	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
disputing,	1
Peter	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
ago	1
God	1
made	1
choice	1
among	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
my	1
mouth	1
should	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
and	1
believe.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
God,	1
which	1
knoweth	1
the	1
hearts,	1
bare	1
them	1
witness,	1
giving	1
them	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
us;	1
15:9	1
And	1
put	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
them,	1
purifying	1
their	1
hearts	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
15:10	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
God,	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
yoke	1
upon	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
which	1
neither	1
our	1
fathers	1
nor	1
we	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
bear?	1
15:11	1
But	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
even	1
as	1
they.	1
	1
15:12	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
kept	1
silence,	1
and	1
gave	1
audience	1
to	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
declaring	1
what	1
miracles	1
and	1
wonders	1
God	1
had	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
James	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
15:14	1
Simeon	1
hath	1
declared	1
how	1
God	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
did	1
visit	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
to	1
take	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
people	1
for	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
to	1
this	1
agree	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
15:16	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
return,	1
and	1
will	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
fallen	1
down;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
ruins	1
thereof,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
it	1
up:	1
15:17	1
That	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
men	1
might	1
seek	1
after	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
upon	1
whom	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
called,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
doeth	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
15:18	1
Known	1
unto	1
God	1
are	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
15:19	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
sentence	1
is,	1
that	1
we	1
trouble	1
not	1
them,	1
which	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
are	1
turned	1
to	1
God:	1
15:20	1
But	1
that	1
we	1
write	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
abstain	1
from	1
pollutions	1
of	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication,	1
and	1
from	1
things	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
blood.	1
	1
15:21	1
For	1
Moses	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
hath	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
them	1
that	1
preach	1
him,	1
being	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
every	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
15:22	1
Then	1
pleased	1
it	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
church,	1
to	1
send	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
company	1
to	1
Antioch	1
with	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas;	1
namely,	1
Judas	1
surnamed	1
Barsabas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
chief	1
men	1
among	1
the	1
brethren:	1
15:23	1
And	1
they	1
wrote	1
letters	1
by	1
them	1
after	1
this	1
manner;	1
The	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
and	1
brethren	1
send	1
greeting	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
Antioch	1
and	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia.	1
	1
15:24	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
that	1
certain	1
which	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
us	1
have	1
troubled	1
you	1
with	1
words,	1
subverting	1
your	1
souls,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
must	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
law:	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
gave	1
no	1
such	1
commandment:	1
15:25	1
It	1
seemed	1
good	1
unto	1
us,	1
being	1
assembled	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
to	1
send	1
chosen	1
men	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
our	1
beloved	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
15:26	1
Men	1
that	1
have	1
hazarded	1
their	1
lives	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:27	1
We	1
have	1
sent	1
therefore	1
Judas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
who	1
shall	1
also	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
by	1
mouth.	1
	1
15:28	1
For	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
to	1
us,	1
to	1
lay	1
upon	1
you	1
no	1
greater	1
burden	1
than	1
these	1
necessary	1
things;	1
15:29	1
That	1
ye	1
abstain	1
from	1
meats	1
offered	1
to	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
things	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication:	1
from	1
which	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
yourselves,	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
well.	1
Fare	1
ye	1
well.	1
	1
15:30	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
dismissed,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Antioch:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
the	1
multitude	1
together,	1
they	1
delivered	1
the	1
epistle:	1
15:31	1
Which	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
read,	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
the	1
consolation.	1
	1
15:32	1
And	1
Judas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
being	1
prophets	1
also	1
themselves,	1
exhorted	1
the	1
brethren	1
with	1
many	1
words,	1
and	1
confirmed	1
them.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
tarried	1
there	1
a	1
space,	1
they	1
were	1
let	1
go	1
in	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
15:34	1
Notwithstanding	1
it	1
pleased	1
Silas	1
to	1
abide	1
there	1
still.	1
	1
15:35	1
Paul	1
also	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
continued	1
in	1
Antioch,	1
teaching	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
with	1
many	1
others	1
also.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
some	1
days	1
after	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
Barnabas,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
again	1
and	1
visit	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
where	1
we	1
have	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
do.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
Barnabas	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
them	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark.	1
	1
15:38	1
But	1
Paul	1
thought	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
them,	1
who	1
departed	1
from	1
them	1
from	1
Pamphylia,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
the	1
contention	1
was	1
so	1
sharp	1
between	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
departed	1
asunder	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other:	1
and	1
so	1
Barnabas	1
took	1
Mark,	1
and	1
sailed	1
unto	1
Cyprus;	1
15:40	1
And	1
Paul	1
chose	1
Silas,	1
and	1
departed,	1
being	1
recommended	1
by	1
the	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:41	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia,	1
confirming	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
16:1	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
to	1
Derbe	1
and	1
Lystra:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
was	1
there,	1
named	1
Timotheus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
Jewess,	1
and	1
believed;	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
Greek:	1
16:2	1
Which	1
was	1
well	1
reported	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
brethren	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
Lystra	1
and	1
Iconium.	1
	1
16:3	1
Him	1
would	1
Paul	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
took	1
and	1
circumcised	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
those	1
quarters:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
Greek.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
cities,	1
they	1
delivered	1
them	1
the	1
decrees	1
for	1
to	1
keep,	1
that	1
were	1
ordained	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
so	1
were	1
the	1
churches	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
increased	1
in	1
number	1
daily.	1
	1
16:6	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
throughout	1
Phrygia	1
and	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Galatia,	1
and	1
were	1
forbidden	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
Asia,	1
16:7	1
After	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Mysia,	1
they	1
assayed	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Bithynia:	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
suffered	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
they	1
passing	1
by	1
Mysia	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
Troas.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
a	1
vision	1
appeared	1
to	1
Paul	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
There	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
prayed	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
over	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
help	1
us.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
vision,	1
immediately	1
we	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
assuredly	1
gathering	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
called	1
us	1
for	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
16:11	1
Therefore	1
loosing	1
from	1
Troas,	1
we	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
to	1
Samothracia,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
Neapolis;	1
16:12	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
Philippi,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
city	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
a	1
colony:	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
city	1
abiding	1
certain	1
days.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
we	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
a	1
river	1
side,	1
where	1
prayer	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
made;	1
and	1
we	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
women	1
which	1
resorted	1
thither.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
named	1
Lydia,	1
a	1
seller	1
of	1
purple,	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Thyatira,	1
which	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
heard	1
us:	1
whose	1
heart	1
the	1
Lord	1
opened,	1
that	1
she	1
attended	1
unto	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
of	1
Paul.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
baptized,	1
and	1
her	1
household,	1
she	1
besought	1
us,	1
saying,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
judged	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
abide	1
there.	1
And	1
she	1
constrained	1
us.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
prayer,	1
a	1
certain	1
damsel	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
divination	1
met	1
us,	1
which	1
brought	1
her	1
masters	1
much	1
gain	1
by	1
soothsaying:	1
16:17	1
The	1
same	1
followed	1
Paul	1
and	1
us,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
which	1
shew	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
this	1
did	1
she	1
many	1
days.	1
But	1
Paul,	1
being	1
grieved,	1
turned	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
spirit,	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
same	1
hour.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
when	1
her	1
masters	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
their	1
gains	1
was	1
gone,	1
they	1
caught	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas,	1
and	1
drew	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
marketplace	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers,	1
16:20	1
And	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
magistrates,	1
saying,	1
These	1
men,	1
being	1
Jews,	1
do	1
exceedingly	1
trouble	1
our	1
city,	1
16:21	1
And	1
teach	1
customs,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
receive,	1
neither	1
to	1
observe,	1
being	1
Romans.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
rose	1
up	1
together	1
against	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
magistrates	1
rent	1
off	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
beat	1
them.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
laid	1
many	1
stripes	1
upon	1
them,	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
prison,	1
charging	1
the	1
jailor	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
safely:	1
16:24	1
Who,	1
having	1
received	1
such	1
a	1
charge,	1
thrust	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
prison,	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
feet	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
stocks.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
at	1
midnight	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas	1
prayed,	1
and	1
sang	1
praises	1
unto	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
were	1
shaken:	1
and	1
immediately	1
all	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
every	1
one's	1
bands	1
were	1
loosed.	1
	1
16:27	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
awaking	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
prison	1
doors	1
open,	1
he	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
himself,	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
prisoners	1
had	1
been	1
fled.	1
	1
16:28	1
But	1
Paul	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Do	1
thyself	1
no	1
harm:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
here.	1
	1
16:29	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
light,	1
and	1
sprang	1
in,	1
and	1
came	1
trembling,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas,	1
16:30	1
And	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
what	1
must	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Believe	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
thy	1
house.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:33	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
washed	1
their	1
stripes;	1
and	1
was	1
baptized,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his,	1
straightway.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
he	1
set	1
meat	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
rejoiced,	1
believing	1
in	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
the	1
magistrates	1
sent	1
the	1
serjeants,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
those	1
men	1
go.	1
	1
16:36	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
told	1
this	1
saying	1
to	1
Paul,	1
The	1
magistrates	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
go:	1
now	1
therefore	1
depart,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
16:37	1
But	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
have	1
beaten	1
us	1
openly	1
uncondemned,	1
being	1
Romans,	1
and	1
have	1
cast	1
us	1
into	1
prison;	1
and	1
now	1
do	1
they	1
thrust	1
us	1
out	1
privily?	1
nay	1
verily;	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
themselves	1
and	1
fetch	1
us	1
out.	1
	1
16:38	1
And	1
the	1
serjeants	1
told	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
magistrates:	1
and	1
they	1
feared,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
Romans.	1
	1
16:39	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
besought	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
desired	1
them	1
to	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
16:40	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Lydia:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
brethren,	1
they	1
comforted	1
them,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
17:1	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Amphipolis	1
and	1
Apollonia,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Thessalonica,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
17:2	1
And	1
Paul,	1
as	1
his	1
manner	1
was,	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
three	1
sabbath	1
days	1
reasoned	1
with	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
17:3	1
Opening	1
and	1
alleging,	1
that	1
Christ	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
suffered,	1
and	1
risen	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
I	1
preach	1
unto	1
you,	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
believed,	1
and	1
consorted	1
with	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
devout	1
Greeks	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
women	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
17:5	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
believed	1
not,	1
moved	1
with	1
envy,	1
took	1
unto	1
them	1
certain	1
lewd	1
fellows	1
of	1
the	1
baser	1
sort,	1
and	1
gathered	1
a	1
company,	1
and	1
set	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
an	1
uproar,	1
and	1
assaulted	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jason,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
them	1
not,	1
they	1
drew	1
Jason	1
and	1
certain	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
crying,	1
These	1
that	1
have	1
turned	1
the	1
world	1
upside	1
down	1
are	1
come	1
hither	1
also;	1
17:7	1
Whom	1
Jason	1
hath	1
received:	1
and	1
these	1
all	1
do	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
king,	1
one	1
Jesus.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
they	1
troubled	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
security	1
of	1
Jason,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
brethren	1
immediately	1
sent	1
away	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas	1
by	1
night	1
unto	1
Berea:	1
who	1
coming	1
thither	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
17:11	1
These	1
were	1
more	1
noble	1
than	1
those	1
in	1
Thessalonica,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
all	1
readiness	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
searched	1
the	1
scriptures	1
daily,	1
whether	1
those	1
things	1
were	1
so.	1
	1
17:12	1
Therefore	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
believed;	1
also	1
of	1
honourable	1
women	1
which	1
were	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
of	1
men,	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
17:13	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
Thessalonica	1
had	1
knowledge	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
preached	1
of	1
Paul	1
at	1
Berea,	1
they	1
came	1
thither	1
also,	1
and	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
then	1
immediately	1
the	1
brethren	1
sent	1
away	1
Paul	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
sea:	1
but	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
abode	1
there	1
still.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
conducted	1
Paul	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Athens:	1
and	1
receiving	1
a	1
commandment	1
unto	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
for	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
speed,	1
they	1
departed.	1
	1
17:16	1
Now	1
while	1
Paul	1
waited	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
Athens,	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
stirred	1
in	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
city	1
wholly	1
given	1
to	1
idolatry.	1
	1
17:17	1
Therefore	1
disputed	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
with	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
devout	1
persons,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
market	1
daily	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
met	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:18	1
Then	1
certain	1
philosophers	1
of	1
the	1
Epicureans,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Stoicks,	1
encountered	1
him.	1
And	1
some	1
said,	1
What	1
will	1
this	1
babbler	1
say?	1
other	1
some,	1
He	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
setter	1
forth	1
of	1
strange	1
gods:	1
because	1
he	1
preached	1
unto	1
them	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Areopagus,	1
saying,	1
May	1
we	1
know	1
what	1
this	1
new	1
doctrine,	1
whereof	1
thou	1
speakest,	1
is?	1
	1
17:20	1
For	1
thou	1
bringest	1
certain	1
strange	1
things	1
to	1
our	1
ears:	1
we	1
would	1
know	1
therefore	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
mean.	1
	1
17:21	1
(For	1
all	1
the	1
Athenians	1
and	1
strangers	1
which	1
were	1
there	1
spent	1
their	1
time	1
in	1
nothing	1
else,	1
but	1
either	1
to	1
tell,	1
or	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
new	1
thing.)	1
	1
17:22	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Mars'	1
hill,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Athens,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
ye	1
are	1
too	1
superstitious.	1
	1
17:23	1
For	1
as	1
I	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
beheld	1
your	1
devotions,	1
I	1
found	1
an	1
altar	1
with	1
this	1
inscription,	1
TO	1
THE	1
UNKNOWN	1
GOD.	1
Whom	1
therefore	1
ye	1
ignorantly	1
worship,	1
him	1
declare	1
I	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
17:24	1
God	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
therein,	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
temples	1
made	1
with	1
hands;	1
17:25	1
Neither	1
is	1
worshipped	1
with	1
men's	1
hands,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
needed	1
any	1
thing,	1
seeing	1
he	1
giveth	1
to	1
all	1
life,	1
and	1
breath,	1
and	1
all	1
things;	1
17:26	1
And	1
hath	1
made	1
of	1
one	1
blood	1
all	1
nations	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hath	1
determined	1
the	1
times	1
before	1
appointed,	1
and	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
their	1
habitation;	1
17:27	1
That	1
they	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
Lord,	1
if	1
haply	1
they	1
might	1
feel	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
find	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us:	1
17:28	1
For	1
in	1
him	1
we	1
live,	1
and	1
move,	1
and	1
have	1
our	1
being;	1
as	1
certain	1
also	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
poets	1
have	1
said,	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
also	1
his	1
offspring.	1
	1
17:29	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
God,	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
Godhead	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
gold,	1
or	1
silver,	1
or	1
stone,	1
graven	1
by	1
art	1
and	1
man's	1
device.	1
	1
17:30	1
And	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
this	1
ignorance	1
God	1
winked	1
at;	1
but	1
now	1
commandeth	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
where	1
to	1
repent:	1
17:31	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
appointed	1
a	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
judge	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
righteousness	1
by	1
that	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
ordained;	1
whereof	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
assurance	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:32	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
some	1
mocked:	1
and	1
others	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
hear	1
thee	1
again	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
17:33	1
So	1
Paul	1
departed	1
from	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
17:34	1
Howbeit	1
certain	1
men	1
clave	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
believed:	1
among	1
the	1
which	1
was	1
Dionysius	1
the	1
Areopagite,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
named	1
Damaris,	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
18:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Paul	1
departed	1
from	1
Athens,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Corinth;	1
18:2	1
And	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew	1
named	1
Aquila,	1
born	1
in	1
Pontus,	1
lately	1
come	1
from	1
Italy,	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Priscilla;	1
(because	1
that	1
Claudius	1
had	1
commanded	1
all	1
Jews	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
Rome:)	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
craft,	1
he	1
abode	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
wrought:	1
for	1
by	1
their	1
occupation	1
they	1
were	1
tentmakers.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
reasoned	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
every	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
persuaded	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
Greeks.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
when	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
were	1
come	1
from	1
Macedonia,	1
Paul	1
was	1
pressed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
testified	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
opposed	1
themselves,	1
and	1
blasphemed,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Your	1
blood	1
be	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
heads;	1
I	1
am	1
clean;	1
from	1
henceforth	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
he	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
man's	1
house,	1
named	1
Justus,	1
one	1
that	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
whose	1
house	1
joined	1
hard	1
to	1
the	1
synagogue.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
Crispus,	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
hearing	1
believed,	1
and	1
were	1
baptized.	1
	1
18:9	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
Paul	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
by	1
a	1
vision,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
but	1
speak,	1
and	1
hold	1
not	1
thy	1
peace:	1
18:10	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
set	1
on	1
thee	1
to	1
hurt	1
thee:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
much	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
he	1
continued	1
there	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
six	1
months,	1
teaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
when	1
Gallio	1
was	1
the	1
deputy	1
of	1
Achaia,	1
the	1
Jews	1
made	1
insurrection	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
against	1
Paul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
18:13	1
Saying,	1
This	1
fellow	1
persuadeth	1
men	1
to	1
worship	1
God	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
mouth,	1
Gallio	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
wrong	1
or	1
wicked	1
lewdness,	1
O	1
ye	1
Jews,	1
reason	1
would	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bear	1
with	1
you:	1
18:15	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
words	1
and	1
names,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
law,	1
look	1
ye	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
judge	1
of	1
such	1
matters.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
he	1
drave	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat.	1
	1
18:17	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
Greeks	1
took	1
Sosthenes,	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
beat	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat.	1
And	1
Gallio	1
cared	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
Paul	1
after	1
this	1
tarried	1
there	1
yet	1
a	1
good	1
while,	1
and	1
then	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sailed	1
thence	1
into	1
Syria,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
Priscilla	1
and	1
Aquila;	1
having	1
shorn	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
Cenchrea:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
vow.	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
there:	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
reasoned	1
with	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
18:20	1
When	1
they	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
longer	1
time	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
consented	1
not;	1
18:21	1
But	1
bade	1
them	1
farewell,	1
saying,	1
I	1
must	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
keep	1
this	1
feast	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
again	1
unto	1
you,	1
if	1
God	1
will.	1
And	1
he	1
sailed	1
from	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
landed	1
at	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
gone	1
up,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
church,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Antioch.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
there,	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Galatia	1
and	1
Phrygia	1
in	1
order,	1
strengthening	1
all	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew	1
named	1
Apollos,	1
born	1
at	1
Alexandria,	1
an	1
eloquent	1
man,	1
and	1
mighty	1
in	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
18:25	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
instructed	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
being	1
fervent	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
he	1
spake	1
and	1
taught	1
diligently	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
knowing	1
only	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
whom	1
when	1
Aquila	1
and	1
Priscilla	1
had	1
heard,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
expounded	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
more	1
perfectly.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
pass	1
into	1
Achaia,	1
the	1
brethren	1
wrote,	1
exhorting	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
receive	1
him:	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
helped	1
them	1
much	1
which	1
had	1
believed	1
through	1
grace:	1
18:28	1
For	1
he	1
mightily	1
convinced	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
that	1
publickly,	1
shewing	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
while	1
Apollos	1
was	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
Paul	1
having	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
upper	1
coasts	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus:	1
and	1
finding	1
certain	1
disciples,	1
19:2	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
since	1
ye	1
believed?	1
	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
heard	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Unto	1
what	1
then	1
were	1
ye	1
baptized?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Unto	1
John's	1
baptism.	1
	1
19:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
John	1
verily	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance,	1
saying	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
after	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
on	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:5	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
them,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
came	1
on	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
prophesied.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
about	1
twelve.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
spake	1
boldly	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
months,	1
disputing	1
and	1
persuading	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:9	1
But	1
when	1
divers	1
were	1
hardened,	1
and	1
believed	1
not,	1
but	1
spake	1
evil	1
of	1
that	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
multitude,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
separated	1
the	1
disciples,	1
disputing	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
school	1
of	1
one	1
Tyrannus.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
this	1
continued	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Asia	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
God	1
wrought	1
special	1
miracles	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Paul:	1
19:12	1
So	1
that	1
from	1
his	1
body	1
were	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
handkerchiefs	1
or	1
aprons,	1
and	1
the	1
diseases	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
spirits	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
19:13	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
vagabond	1
Jews,	1
exorcists,	1
took	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
call	1
over	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
evil	1
spirits	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
We	1
adjure	1
you	1
by	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
Paul	1
preacheth.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
Sceva,	1
a	1
Jew,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
which	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Jesus	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
Paul	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
who	1
are	1
ye?	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
was	1
leaped	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
overcame	1
them,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
naked	1
and	1
wounded.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks	1
also	1
dwelling	1
at	1
Ephesus;	1
and	1
fear	1
fell	1
on	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
was	1
magnified.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
many	1
that	1
believed	1
came,	1
and	1
confessed,	1
and	1
shewed	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
19:19	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
used	1
curious	1
arts	1
brought	1
their	1
books	1
together,	1
and	1
burned	1
them	1
before	1
all	1
men:	1
and	1
they	1
counted	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
19:20	1
So	1
mightily	1
grew	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
prevailed.	1
	1
19:21	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
ended,	1
Paul	1
purposed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
After	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
there,	1
I	1
must	1
also	1
see	1
Rome.	1
	1
19:22	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
into	1
Macedonia	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
Timotheus	1
and	1
Erastus;	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
stayed	1
in	1
Asia	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
there	1
arose	1
no	1
small	1
stir	1
about	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
19:24	1
For	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Demetrius,	1
a	1
silversmith,	1
which	1
made	1
silver	1
shrines	1
for	1
Diana,	1
brought	1
no	1
small	1
gain	1
unto	1
the	1
craftsmen;	1
19:25	1
Whom	1
he	1
called	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
workmen	1
of	1
like	1
occupation,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
craft	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
wealth.	1
	1
19:26	1
Moreover	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
hear,	1
that	1
not	1
alone	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
but	1
almost	1
throughout	1
all	1
Asia,	1
this	1
Paul	1
hath	1
persuaded	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
much	1
people,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
no	1
gods,	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
with	1
hands:	1
19:27	1
So	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
this	1
our	1
craft	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
at	1
nought;	1
but	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goddess	1
Diana	1
should	1
be	1
despised,	1
and	1
her	1
magnificence	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
whom	1
all	1
Asia	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
worshippeth.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
sayings,	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
wrath,	1
and	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Great	1
is	1
Diana	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
confusion:	1
and	1
having	1
caught	1
Gaius	1
and	1
Aristarchus,	1
men	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
Paul's	1
companions	1
in	1
travel,	1
they	1
rushed	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
into	1
the	1
theatre.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
would	1
have	1
entered	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
disciples	1
suffered	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
Asia,	1
which	1
were	1
his	1
friends,	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
adventure	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
theatre.	1
	1
19:32	1
Some	1
therefore	1
cried	1
one	1
thing,	1
and	1
some	1
another:	1
for	1
the	1
assembly	1
was	1
confused:	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
knew	1
not	1
wherefore	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
together.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
Alexander	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
the	1
Jews	1
putting	1
him	1
forward.	1
And	1
Alexander	1
beckoned	1
with	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
his	1
defence	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
19:34	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Jew,	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
hours	1
cried	1
out,	1
Great	1
is	1
Diana	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
townclerk	1
had	1
appeased	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Ephesus,	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
knoweth	1
not	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians	1
is	1
a	1
worshipper	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goddess	1
Diana,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
fell	1
down	1
from	1
Jupiter?	1
	1
19:36	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
cannot	1
be	1
spoken	1
against,	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
rashly.	1
	1
19:37	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
hither	1
these	1
men,	1
which	1
are	1
neither	1
robbers	1
of	1
churches,	1
nor	1
yet	1
blasphemers	1
of	1
your	1
goddess.	1
	1
19:38	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
Demetrius,	1
and	1
the	1
craftsmen	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
him,	1
have	1
a	1
matter	1
against	1
any	1
man,	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
open,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
deputies:	1
let	1
them	1
implead	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
19:39	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
enquire	1
any	1
thing	1
concerning	1
other	1
matters,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
determined	1
in	1
a	1
lawful	1
assembly.	1
	1
19:40	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
for	1
this	1
day's	1
uproar,	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
cause	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
this	1
concourse.	1
	1
19:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
dismissed	1
the	1
assembly.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
uproar	1
was	1
ceased,	1
Paul	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them,	1
and	1
departed	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
over	1
those	1
parts,	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
much	1
exhortation,	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
Greece,	1
20:3	1
And	1
there	1
abode	1
three	1
months.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
into	1
Syria,	1
he	1
purposed	1
to	1
return	1
through	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
there	1
accompanied	1
him	1
into	1
Asia	1
Sopater	1
of	1
Berea;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians,	1
Aristarchus	1
and	1
Secundus;	1
and	1
Gaius	1
of	1
Derbe,	1
and	1
Timotheus;	1
and	1
of	1
Asia,	1
Tychicus	1
and	1
Trophimus.	1
	1
20:5	1
These	1
going	1
before	1
tarried	1
for	1
us	1
at	1
Troas.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
we	1
sailed	1
away	1
from	1
Philippi	1
after	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
Troas	1
in	1
five	1
days;	1
where	1
we	1
abode	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
break	1
bread,	1
Paul	1
preached	1
unto	1
them,	1
ready	1
to	1
depart	1
on	1
the	1
morrow;	1
and	1
continued	1
his	1
speech	1
until	1
midnight.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
there	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
window	1
a	1
certain	1
young	1
man	1
named	1
Eutychus,	1
being	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep:	1
and	1
as	1
Paul	1
was	1
long	1
preaching,	1
he	1
sunk	1
down	1
with	1
sleep,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
third	1
loft,	1
and	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
dead.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Paul	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
embracing	1
him	1
said,	1
Trouble	1
not	1
yourselves;	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
20:11	1
When	1
he	1
therefore	1
was	1
come	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
bread,	1
and	1
eaten,	1
and	1
talked	1
a	1
long	1
while,	1
even	1
till	1
break	1
of	1
day,	1
so	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
alive,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
comforted.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
we	1
went	1
before	1
to	1
ship,	1
and	1
sailed	1
unto	1
Assos,	1
there	1
intending	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
Paul:	1
for	1
so	1
had	1
he	1
appointed,	1
minding	1
himself	1
to	1
go	1
afoot.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
us	1
at	1
Assos,	1
we	1
took	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Mitylene.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
we	1
sailed	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
over	1
against	1
Chios;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
arrived	1
at	1
Samos,	1
and	1
tarried	1
at	1
Trogyllium;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Miletus.	1
	1
20:16	1
For	1
Paul	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
sail	1
by	1
Ephesus,	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
spend	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
Asia:	1
for	1
he	1
hasted,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
for	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Pentecost.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
from	1
Miletus	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Asia,	1
after	1
what	1
manner	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
all	1
seasons,	1
20:19	1
Serving	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
humility	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
tears,	1
and	1
temptations,	1
which	1
befell	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
20:20	1
And	1
how	1
I	1
kept	1
back	1
nothing	1
that	1
was	1
profitable	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
have	1
shewed	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
publickly,	1
and	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
20:21	1
Testifying	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
repentance	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
faith	1
toward	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
go	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
not	1
knowing	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
befall	1
me	1
there:	1
20:23	1
Save	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
witnesseth	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
saying	1
that	1
bonds	1
and	1
afflictions	1
abide	1
me.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
move	1
me,	1
neither	1
count	1
I	1
my	1
life	1
dear	1
unto	1
myself,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
finish	1
my	1
course	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
the	1
ministry,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
testify	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
all,	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
gone	1
preaching	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
20:26	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
record	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
pure	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
20:27	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
shunned	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
20:28	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
flock,	1
over	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
overseers,	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
purchased	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
blood.	1
	1
20:29	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
this,	1
that	1
after	1
my	1
departing	1
shall	1
grievous	1
wolves	1
enter	1
in	1
among	1
you,	1
not	1
sparing	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
20:30	1
Also	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
selves	1
shall	1
men	1
arise,	1
speaking	1
perverse	1
things,	1
to	1
draw	1
away	1
disciples	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
20:31	1
Therefore	1
watch,	1
and	1
remember,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
ceased	1
not	1
to	1
warn	1
every	1
one	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
now,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
commend	1
you	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
build	1
you	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sanctified.	1
	1
20:33	1
I	1
have	1
coveted	1
no	1
man's	1
silver,	1
or	1
gold,	1
or	1
apparel.	1
	1
20:34	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
know,	1
that	1
these	1
hands	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
my	1
necessities,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
20:35	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
you	1
all	1
things,	1
how	1
that	1
so	1
labouring	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
how	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
more	1
blessed	1
to	1
give	1
than	1
to	1
receive.	1
	1
20:36	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed	1
with	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
wept	1
sore,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
Paul's	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
20:38	1
Sorrowing	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
And	1
they	1
accompanied	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
were	1
gotten	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
launched,	1
we	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
unto	1
Coos,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
unto	1
Rhodes,	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
unto	1
Patara:	1
21:2	1
And	1
finding	1
a	1
ship	1
sailing	1
over	1
unto	1
Phenicia,	1
we	1
went	1
aboard,	1
and	1
set	1
forth.	1
	1
21:3	1
Now	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
discovered	1
Cyprus,	1
we	1
left	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
sailed	1
into	1
Syria,	1
and	1
landed	1
at	1
Tyre:	1
for	1
there	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
to	1
unlade	1
her	1
burden.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
finding	1
disciples,	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
seven	1
days:	1
who	1
said	1
to	1
Paul	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
accomplished	1
those	1
days,	1
we	1
departed	1
and	1
went	1
our	1
way;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
brought	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
way,	1
with	1
wives	1
and	1
children,	1
till	1
we	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
we	1
kneeled	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
shore,	1
and	1
prayed.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
taken	1
our	1
leave	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
we	1
took	1
ship;	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
home	1
again.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
finished	1
our	1
course	1
from	1
Tyre,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Ptolemais,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
Paul's	1
company	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Caesarea:	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Philip	1
the	1
evangelist,	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven;	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
had	1
four	1
daughters,	1
virgins,	1
which	1
did	1
prophesy.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
many	1
days,	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
a	1
certain	1
prophet,	1
named	1
Agabus.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
us,	1
he	1
took	1
Paul's	1
girdle,	1
and	1
bound	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
and	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
Jews	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
bind	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
owneth	1
this	1
girdle,	1
and	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
besought	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:13	1
Then	1
Paul	1
answered,	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
to	1
weep	1
and	1
to	1
break	1
mine	1
heart?	1
	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
die	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
persuaded,	1
we	1
ceased,	1
saying,	1
The	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
after	1
those	1
days	1
we	1
took	1
up	1
our	1
carriages,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:16	1
There	1
went	1
with	1
us	1
also	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
Mnason	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
an	1
old	1
disciple,	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
should	1
lodge.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
brethren	1
received	1
us	1
gladly.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
Paul	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
us	1
unto	1
James;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
were	1
present.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
saluted	1
them,	1
he	1
declared	1
particularly	1
what	1
things	1
God	1
had	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
his	1
ministry.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
glorified	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest,	1
brother,	1
how	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
Jews	1
there	1
are	1
which	1
believe;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
zealous	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
21:21	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
informed	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
teachest	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
forsake	1
Moses,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
circumcise	1
their	1
children,	1
neither	1
to	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
customs.	1
	1
21:22	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
therefore?	1
the	1
multitude	1
must	1
needs	1
come	1
together:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come.	1
	1
21:23	1
Do	1
therefore	1
this	1
that	1
we	1
say	1
to	1
thee:	1
We	1
have	1
four	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
vow	1
on	1
them;	1
21:24	1
Them	1
take,	1
and	1
purify	1
thyself	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
at	1
charges	1
with	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
shave	1
their	1
heads:	1
and	1
all	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
those	1
things,	1
whereof	1
they	1
were	1
informed	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
are	1
nothing;	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
also	1
walkest	1
orderly,	1
and	1
keepest	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
21:25	1
As	1
touching	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
believe,	1
we	1
have	1
written	1
and	1
concluded	1
that	1
they	1
observe	1
no	1
such	1
thing,	1
save	1
only	1
that	1
they	1
keep	1
themselves	1
from	1
things	1
offered	1
to	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication.	1
	1
21:26	1
Then	1
Paul	1
took	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
purifying	1
himself	1
with	1
them	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
to	1
signify	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
purification,	1
until	1
that	1
an	1
offering	1
should	1
be	1
offered	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
days	1
were	1
almost	1
ended,	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
Asia,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
stirred	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
21:28	1
Crying	1
out,	1
Men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
help:	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
teacheth	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
where	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
this	1
place:	1
and	1
further	1
brought	1
Greeks	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
hath	1
polluted	1
this	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
21:29	1
(For	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
before	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
Trophimus	1
an	1
Ephesian,	1
whom	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
Paul	1
had	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
temple.)	1
21:30	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
ran	1
together:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
Paul,	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
shut.	1
	1
21:31	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
tidings	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
band,	1
that	1
all	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
uproar.	1
	1
21:32	1
Who	1
immediately	1
took	1
soldiers	1
and	1
centurions,	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
they	1
left	1
beating	1
of	1
Paul.	1
	1
21:33	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
with	1
two	1
chains;	1
and	1
demanded	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
some	1
cried	1
one	1
thing,	1
some	1
another,	1
among	1
the	1
multitude:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
certainty	1
for	1
the	1
tumult,	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
21:35	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
borne	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:36	1
For	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
followed	1
after,	1
crying,	1
Away	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:37	1
And	1
as	1
Paul	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
May	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee?	1
Who	1
said,	1
Canst	1
thou	1
speak	1
Greek?	1
	1
21:38	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
that	1
Egyptian,	1
which	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
madest	1
an	1
uproar,	1
and	1
leddest	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
four	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
murderers?	1
	1
21:39	1
But	1
Paul	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
Jew	1
of	1
Tarsus,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
Cilicia,	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
no	1
mean	1
city:	1
and,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
suffer	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
licence,	1
Paul	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
beckoned	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
silence,	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue,	1
saying,	1
22:1	1
Men,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
fathers,	1
hear	1
ye	1
my	1
defence	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
now	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
22:2	1
(And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
more	1
silence:	1
and	1
he	1
saith,)	1
22:3	1
I	1
am	1
verily	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
Jew,	1
born	1
in	1
Tarsus,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
Cilicia,	1
yet	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Gamaliel,	1
and	1
taught	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
perfect	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
zealous	1
toward	1
God,	1
as	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
I	1
persecuted	1
this	1
way	1
unto	1
the	1
death,	1
binding	1
and	1
delivering	1
into	1
prisons	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
22:5	1
As	1
also	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
doth	1
bear	1
me	1
witness,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
the	1
elders:	1
from	1
whom	1
also	1
I	1
received	1
letters	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
there	1
bound	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
punished.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
made	1
my	1
journey,	1
and	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Damascus	1
about	1
noon,	1
suddenly	1
there	1
shone	1
from	1
heaven	1
a	1
great	1
light	1
round	1
about	1
me.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
saw	1
indeed	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
were	1
afraid;	1
but	1
they	1
heard	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
LORD?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
Damascus;	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
thee	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
appointed	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
that	1
light,	1
being	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Damascus.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
one	1
Ananias,	1
a	1
devout	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
there,	1
22:13	1
Came	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
stood,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Brother	1
Saul,	1
receive	1
thy	1
sight.	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
I	1
looked	1
up	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
hath	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
know	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
Just	1
One,	1
and	1
shouldest	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
22:15	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
his	1
witness	1
unto	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
and	1
heard.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
now	1
why	1
tarriest	1
thou?	1
arise,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized,	1
and	1
wash	1
away	1
thy	1
sins,	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
even	1
while	1
I	1
prayed	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
trance;	1
22:18	1
And	1
saw	1
him	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Make	1
haste,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
thy	1
testimony	1
concerning	1
me.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
imprisoned	1
and	1
beat	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
on	1
thee:	1
22:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
martyr	1
Stephen	1
was	1
shed,	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
standing	1
by,	1
and	1
consenting	1
unto	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
kept	1
the	1
raiment	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Depart:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
far	1
hence	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
audience	1
unto	1
this	1
word,	1
and	1
then	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
said,	1
Away	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
fellow	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
live.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
threw	1
dust	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
22:24	1
The	1
chief	1
captain	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
bade	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
examined	1
by	1
scourging;	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
wherefore	1
they	1
cried	1
so	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
thongs,	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
centurion	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
scourge	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
uncondemned?	1
	1
22:26	1
When	1
the	1
centurion	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed	1
what	1
thou	1
doest:	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
Roman.	1
	1
22:27	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
art	1
thou	1
a	1
Roman?	1
He	1
said,	1
Yea.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
answered,	1
With	1
a	1
great	1
sum	1
obtained	1
I	1
this	1
freedom.	1
And	1
Paul	1
said,	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
free	1
born.	1
	1
22:29	1
Then	1
straightway	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
examined	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
also	1
was	1
afraid,	1
after	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
bound	1
him.	1
	1
22:30	1
On	1
the	1
morrow,	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
certainty	1
wherefore	1
he	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
he	1
loosed	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
bands,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
council	1
to	1
appear,	1
and	1
brought	1
Paul	1
down,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
Paul,	1
earnestly	1
beholding	1
the	1
council,	1
said,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
conscience	1
before	1
God	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
Ananias	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
smite	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:3	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul	1
unto	1
him,	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee,	1
thou	1
whited	1
wall:	1
for	1
sittest	1
thou	1
to	1
judge	1
me	1
after	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
commandest	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
said,	1
Revilest	1
thou	1
God's	1
high	1
priest?	1
	1
23:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
I	1
wist	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
23:6	1
But	1
when	1
Paul	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
part	1
were	1
Sadducees,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Pharisees,	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
Pharisee:	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
and	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
question.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
dissension	1
between	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
the	1
Sadducees:	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
was	1
divided.	1
	1
23:8	1
For	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection,	1
neither	1
angel,	1
nor	1
spirit:	1
but	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
confess	1
both.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
cry:	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees'	1
part	1
arose,	1
and	1
strove,	1
saying,	1
We	1
find	1
no	1
evil	1
in	1
this	1
man:	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
spirit	1
or	1
an	1
angel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
to	1
him,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
fight	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
dissension,	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
Paul	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
pulled	1
in	1
pieces	1
of	1
them,	1
commanded	1
the	1
soldiers	1
to	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
force	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
the	1
night	1
following	1
the	1
Lord	1
stood	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
Paul:	1
for	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
testified	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
so	1
must	1
thou	1
bear	1
witness	1
also	1
at	1
Rome.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
banded	1
together,	1
and	1
bound	1
themselves	1
under	1
a	1
curse,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
killed	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
this	1
conspiracy.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
bound	1
ourselves	1
under	1
a	1
great	1
curse,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
eat	1
nothing	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
slain	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:15	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
with	1
the	1
council	1
signify	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
that	1
he	1
bring	1
him	1
down	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
morrow,	1
as	1
though	1
ye	1
would	1
enquire	1
something	1
more	1
perfectly	1
concerning	1
him:	1
and	1
we,	1
or	1
ever	1
he	1
come	1
near,	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
when	1
Paul's	1
sister's	1
son	1
heard	1
of	1
their	1
lying	1
in	1
wait,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
told	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:17	1
Then	1
Paul	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
centurions	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Bring	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
certain	1
thing	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
	1
23:18	1
So	1
he	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
and	1
said,	1
Paul	1
the	1
prisoner	1
called	1
me	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
prayed	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
unto	1
thee,	1
who	1
hath	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
23:19	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
aside	1
privately,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
tell	1
me?	1
23:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
Jews	1
have	1
agreed	1
to	1
desire	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
bring	1
down	1
Paul	1
to	1
morrow	1
into	1
the	1
council,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
enquire	1
somewhat	1
of	1
him	1
more	1
perfectly.	1
	1
23:21	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
thou	1
yield	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
there	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
of	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
men,	1
which	1
have	1
bound	1
themselves	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
him:	1
and	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
ready,	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
promise	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
23:22	1
So	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
then	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
depart,	1
and	1
charged	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
centurions,	1
saying,	1
Make	1
ready	1
two	1
hundred	1
soldiers	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
horsemen	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten,	1
and	1
spearmen	1
two	1
hundred,	1
at	1
the	1
third	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night;	1
23:24	1
And	1
provide	1
them	1
beasts,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
set	1
Paul	1
on,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
safe	1
unto	1
Felix	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
after	1
this	1
manner:	1
23:26	1
Claudius	1
Lysias	1
unto	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
governor	1
Felix	1
sendeth	1
greeting.	1
	1
23:27	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
killed	1
of	1
them:	1
then	1
came	1
I	1
with	1
an	1
army,	1
and	1
rescued	1
him,	1
having	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Roman.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
cause	1
wherefore	1
they	1
accused	1
him,	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
their	1
council:	1
23:29	1
Whom	1
I	1
perceived	1
to	1
be	1
accused	1
of	1
questions	1
of	1
their	1
law,	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
laid	1
to	1
his	1
charge	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
bonds.	1
	1
23:30	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
man,	1
I	1
sent	1
straightway	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
gave	1
commandment	1
to	1
his	1
accusers	1
also	1
to	1
say	1
before	1
thee	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
against	1
him.	1
Farewell.	1
	1
23:31	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
commanded	1
them,	1
took	1
Paul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
Antipatris.	1
	1
23:32	1
On	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
horsemen	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
castle:	1
23:33	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Caesarea	1
and	1
delivered	1
the	1
epistle	1
to	1
the	1
governor,	1
presented	1
Paul	1
also	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
23:34	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
letter,	1
he	1
asked	1
of	1
what	1
province	1
he	1
was.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
Cilicia;	1
23:35	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
thee,	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
thine	1
accusers	1
are	1
also	1
come.	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
Herod's	1
judgment	1
hall.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
after	1
five	1
days	1
Ananias	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
descended	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
orator	1
named	1
Tertullus,	1
who	1
informed	1
the	1
governor	1
against	1
Paul.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
forth,	1
Tertullus	1
began	1
to	1
accuse	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Seeing	1
that	1
by	1
thee	1
we	1
enjoy	1
great	1
quietness,	1
and	1
that	1
very	1
worthy	1
deeds	1
are	1
done	1
unto	1
this	1
nation	1
by	1
thy	1
providence,	1
24:3	1
We	1
accept	1
it	1
always,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
places,	1
most	1
noble	1
Felix,	1
with	1
all	1
thankfulness.	1
	1
24:4	1
Notwithstanding,	1
that	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
further	1
tedious	1
unto	1
thee,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
hear	1
us	1
of	1
thy	1
clemency	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
24:5	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
this	1
man	1
a	1
pestilent	1
fellow,	1
and	1
a	1
mover	1
of	1
sedition	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
throughout	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
a	1
ringleader	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Nazarenes:	1
24:6	1
Who	1
also	1
hath	1
gone	1
about	1
to	1
profane	1
the	1
temple:	1
whom	1
we	1
took,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
law.	1
	1
24:7	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
Lysias	1
came	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
violence	1
took	1
him	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
24:8	1
Commanding	1
his	1
accusers	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
by	1
examining	1
of	1
whom	1
thyself	1
mayest	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
whereof	1
we	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
assented,	1
saying	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
so.	1
	1
24:10	1
Then	1
Paul,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
speak,	1
answered,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
a	1
judge	1
unto	1
this	1
nation,	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
more	1
cheerfully	1
answer	1
for	1
myself:	1
24:11	1
Because	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
understand,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
yet	1
but	1
twelve	1
days	1
since	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
to	1
worship.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
they	1
neither	1
found	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
disputing	1
with	1
any	1
man,	1
neither	1
raising	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
city:	1
24:13	1
Neither	1
can	1
they	1
prove	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
they	1
now	1
accuse	1
me.	1
	1
24:14	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
confess	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
they	1
call	1
heresy,	1
so	1
worship	1
I	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
fathers,	1
believing	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
prophets:	1
24:15	1
And	1
have	1
hope	1
toward	1
God,	1
which	1
they	1
themselves	1
also	1
allow,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
unjust.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
herein	1
do	1
I	1
exercise	1
myself,	1
to	1
have	1
always	1
a	1
conscience	1
void	1
to	1
offence	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
toward	1
men.	1
	1
24:17	1
Now	1
after	1
many	1
years	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
bring	1
alms	1
to	1
my	1
nation,	1
and	1
offerings.	1
	1
24:18	1
Whereupon	1
certain	1
Jews	1
from	1
Asia	1
found	1
me	1
purified	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
neither	1
with	1
multitude,	1
nor	1
with	1
tumult.	1
	1
24:19	1
Who	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
object,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
ought	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
24:20	1
Or	1
else	1
let	1
these	1
same	1
here	1
say,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
found	1
any	1
evil	1
doing	1
in	1
me,	1
while	1
I	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
council,	1
24:21	1
Except	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
voice,	1
that	1
I	1
cried	1
standing	1
among	1
them,	1
Touching	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
by	1
you	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
when	1
Felix	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
having	1
more	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
that	1
way,	1
he	1
deferred	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
When	1
Lysias	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
I	1
will	1
know	1
the	1
uttermost	1
of	1
your	1
matter.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
a	1
centurion	1
to	1
keep	1
Paul,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
liberty,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
forbid	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
minister	1
or	1
come	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
days,	1
when	1
Felix	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Drusilla,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
Jewess,	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
Paul,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
24:25	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
reasoned	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
temperance,	1
and	1
judgment	1
to	1
come,	1
Felix	1
trembled,	1
and	1
answered,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way	1
for	1
this	1
time;	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
convenient	1
season,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
24:26	1
He	1
hoped	1
also	1
that	1
money	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
him	1
of	1
Paul,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
loose	1
him:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
oftener,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
24:27	1
But	1
after	1
two	1
years	1
Porcius	1
Festus	1
came	1
into	1
Felix'	1
room:	1
and	1
Felix,	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
left	1
Paul	1
bound.	1
	1
25:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Festus	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
province,	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
ascended	1
from	1
Caesarea	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
25:2	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
informed	1
him	1
against	1
Paul,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
25:3	1
And	1
desired	1
favour	1
against	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
laying	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
25:4	1
But	1
Festus	1
answered,	1
that	1
Paul	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
at	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
depart	1
shortly	1
thither.	1
	1
25:5	1
Let	1
them	1
therefore,	1
said	1
he,	1
which	1
among	1
you	1
are	1
able,	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
accuse	1
this	1
man,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
wickedness	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tarried	1
among	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
days,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
Caesarea;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
commanded	1
Paul	1
to	1
be	1
brought.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
stood	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
laid	1
many	1
and	1
grievous	1
complaints	1
against	1
Paul,	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
prove.	1
	1
25:8	1
While	1
he	1
answered	1
for	1
himself,	1
Neither	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
neither	1
against	1
the	1
temple,	1
nor	1
yet	1
against	1
Caesar,	1
have	1
I	1
offended	1
any	1
thing	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
25:9	1
But	1
Festus,	1
willing	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
answered	1
Paul,	1
and	1
said,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
before	1
me?	1
	1
25:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
I	1
stand	1
at	1
Caesar's	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
where	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
judged:	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
no	1
wrong,	1
as	1
thou	1
very	1
well	1
knowest.	1
	1
25:11	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
an	1
offender,	1
or	1
have	1
committed	1
any	1
thing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
I	1
refuse	1
not	1
to	1
die:	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
whereof	1
these	1
accuse	1
me,	1
no	1
man	1
may	1
deliver	1
me	1
unto	1
them.	1
I	1
appeal	1
unto	1
Caesar.	1
	1
25:12	1
Then	1
Festus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
conferred	1
with	1
the	1
council,	1
answered,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Caesar?	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
days	1
king	1
Agrippa	1
and	1
Bernice	1
came	1
unto	1
Caesarea	1
to	1
salute	1
Festus.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
many	1
days,	1
Festus	1
declared	1
Paul's	1
cause	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
left	1
in	1
bonds	1
by	1
Felix:	1
25:15	1
About	1
whom,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
informed	1
me,	1
desiring	1
to	1
have	1
judgment	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
25:16	1
To	1
whom	1
I	1
answered,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Romans	1
to	1
deliver	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
die,	1
before	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
accused	1
have	1
the	1
accusers	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
have	1
licence	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
himself	1
concerning	1
the	1
crime	1
laid	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
25:17	1
Therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
hither,	1
without	1
any	1
delay	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
I	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
forth.	1
	1
25:18	1
Against	1
whom	1
when	1
the	1
accusers	1
stood	1
up,	1
they	1
brought	1
none	1
accusation	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
I	1
supposed:	1
25:19	1
But	1
had	1
certain	1
questions	1
against	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
superstition,	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
was	1
dead,	1
whom	1
Paul	1
affirmed	1
to	1
be	1
alive.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
doubted	1
of	1
such	1
manner	1
of	1
questions,	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
these	1
matters.	1
	1
25:21	1
But	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
appealed	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
unto	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
Augustus,	1
I	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
till	1
I	1
might	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
Caesar.	1
	1
25:22	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Festus,	1
I	1
would	1
also	1
hear	1
the	1
man	1
myself.	1
To	1
morrow,	1
said	1
he,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
Agrippa	1
was	1
come,	1
and	1
Bernice,	1
with	1
great	1
pomp,	1
and	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
hearing,	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
captains,	1
and	1
principal	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
at	1
Festus'	1
commandment	1
Paul	1
was	1
brought	1
forth.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
Festus	1
said,	1
King	1
Agrippa,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
which	1
are	1
here	1
present	1
with	1
us,	1
ye	1
see	1
this	1
man,	1
about	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
dealt	1
with	1
me,	1
both	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
also	1
here,	1
crying	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
live	1
any	1
longer.	1
	1
25:25	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
committed	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
hath	1
appealed	1
to	1
Augustus,	1
I	1
have	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
him.	1
	1
25:26	1
Of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
certain	1
thing	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
my	1
lord.	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
specially	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
that,	1
after	1
examination	1
had,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
write.	1
	1
25:27	1
For	1
it	1
seemeth	1
to	1
me	1
unreasonable	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
not	1
withal	1
to	1
signify	1
the	1
crimes	1
laid	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
26:1	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Paul,	1
Thou	1
art	1
permitted	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
thyself.	1
	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stretched	1
forth	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
answered	1
for	1
himself:	1
26:2	1
I	1
think	1
myself	1
happy,	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
because	1
I	1
shall	1
answer	1
for	1
myself	1
this	1
day	1
before	1
thee	1
touching	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
I	1
am	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
26:3	1
Especially	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
expert	1
in	1
all	1
customs	1
and	1
questions	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Jews:	1
wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
patiently.	1
	1
26:4	1
My	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
my	1
youth,	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
among	1
mine	1
own	1
nation	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
Jews;	1
26:5	1
Which	1
knew	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
testify,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
most	1
straitest	1
sect	1
of	1
our	1
religion	1
I	1
lived	1
a	1
Pharisee.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
stand	1
and	1
am	1
judged	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
made	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers:	1
26:7	1
Unto	1
which	1
promise	1
our	1
twelve	1
tribes,	1
instantly	1
serving	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
hope	1
to	1
come.	1
For	1
which	1
hope's	1
sake,	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
I	1
am	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
26:8	1
Why	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
thought	1
a	1
thing	1
incredible	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
should	1
raise	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
26:9	1
I	1
verily	1
thought	1
with	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
many	1
things	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
26:10	1
Which	1
thing	1
I	1
also	1
did	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
did	1
I	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
prison,	1
having	1
received	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
voice	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
26:11	1
And	1
I	1
punished	1
them	1
oft	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
compelled	1
them	1
to	1
blaspheme;	1
and	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
mad	1
against	1
them,	1
I	1
persecuted	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
strange	1
cities.	1
	1
26:12	1
Whereupon	1
as	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus	1
with	1
authority	1
and	1
commission	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
26:13	1
At	1
midday,	1
O	1
king,	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
heaven,	1
above	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
shining	1
round	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
journeyed	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
26:14	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
speaking	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.	1
	1
26:15	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest.	1
	1
26:16	1
But	1
rise,	1
and	1
stand	1
upon	1
thy	1
feet:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
this	1
purpose,	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
minister	1
and	1
a	1
witness	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
appear	1
unto	1
thee;	1
26:17	1
Delivering	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
unto	1
whom	1
now	1
I	1
send	1
thee,	1
26:18	1
To	1
open	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
from	1
darkness	1
to	1
light,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Satan	1
unto	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
inheritance	1
among	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sanctified	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
26:19	1
Whereupon,	1
O	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
disobedient	1
unto	1
the	1
heavenly	1
vision:	1
26:20	1
But	1
shewed	1
first	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
do	1
works	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance.	1
	1
26:21	1
For	1
these	1
causes	1
the	1
Jews	1
caught	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
me.	1
	1
26:22	1
Having	1
therefore	1
obtained	1
help	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
continue	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
witnessing	1
both	1
to	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
saying	1
none	1
other	1
things	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
Moses	1
did	1
say	1
should	1
come:	1
26:23	1
That	1
Christ	1
should	1
suffer,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
should	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
should	1
shew	1
light	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
26:24	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
thus	1
spake	1
for	1
himself,	1
Festus	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Paul,	1
thou	1
art	1
beside	1
thyself;	1
much	1
learning	1
doth	1
make	1
thee	1
mad.	1
	1
26:25	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mad,	1
most	1
noble	1
Festus;	1
but	1
speak	1
forth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
soberness.	1
	1
26:26	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
knoweth	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
before	1
whom	1
also	1
I	1
speak	1
freely:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
hidden	1
from	1
him;	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
was	1
not	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
corner.	1
	1
26:27	1
King	1
Agrippa,	1
believest	1
thou	1
the	1
prophets?	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
believest.	1
	1
26:28	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Paul,	1
Almost	1
thou	1
persuadest	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Christian.	1
	1
26:29	1
And	1
Paul	1
said,	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God,	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
thou,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
me	1
this	1
day,	1
were	1
both	1
almost,	1
and	1
altogether	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
except	1
these	1
bonds.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
the	1
king	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
governor,	1
and	1
Bernice,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
sat	1
with	1
them:	1
26:31	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
aside,	1
they	1
talked	1
between	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
doeth	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
bonds.	1
	1
26:32	1
Then	1
said	1
Agrippa	1
unto	1
Festus,	1
This	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
at	1
liberty,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Caesar.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
sail	1
into	1
Italy,	1
they	1
delivered	1
Paul	1
and	1
certain	1
other	1
prisoners	1
unto	1
one	1
named	1
Julius,	1
a	1
centurion	1
of	1
Augustus'	1
band.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Adramyttium,	1
we	1
launched,	1
meaning	1
to	1
sail	1
by	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Asia;	1
one	1
Aristarchus,	1
a	1
Macedonian	1
of	1
Thessalonica,	1
being	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
27:3	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
touched	1
at	1
Sidon.	1
And	1
Julius	1
courteously	1
entreated	1
Paul,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
liberty	1
to	1
go	1
unto	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
refresh	1
himself.	1
	1
27:4	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
launched	1
from	1
thence,	1
we	1
sailed	1
under	1
Cyprus,	1
because	1
the	1
winds	1
were	1
contrary.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Cilicia	1
and	1
Pamphylia,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Myra,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Lycia.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
there	1
the	1
centurion	1
found	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Alexandria	1
sailing	1
into	1
Italy;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
us	1
therein.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
slowly	1
many	1
days,	1
and	1
scarce	1
were	1
come	1
over	1
against	1
Cnidus,	1
the	1
wind	1
not	1
suffering	1
us,	1
we	1
sailed	1
under	1
Crete,	1
over	1
against	1
Salmone;	1
27:8	1
And,	1
hardly	1
passing	1
it,	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
The	1
fair	1
havens;	1
nigh	1
whereunto	1
was	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Lasea.	1
	1
27:9	1
Now	1
when	1
much	1
time	1
was	1
spent,	1
and	1
when	1
sailing	1
was	1
now	1
dangerous,	1
because	1
the	1
fast	1
was	1
now	1
already	1
past,	1
Paul	1
admonished	1
them,	1
27:10	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sirs,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
this	1
voyage	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
hurt	1
and	1
much	1
damage,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
lading	1
and	1
ship,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
our	1
lives.	1
	1
27:11	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
centurion	1
believed	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
more	1
than	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Paul.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
because	1
the	1
haven	1
was	1
not	1
commodious	1
to	1
winter	1
in,	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
advised	1
to	1
depart	1
thence	1
also,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
they	1
might	1
attain	1
to	1
Phenice,	1
and	1
there	1
to	1
winter;	1
which	1
is	1
an	1
haven	1
of	1
Crete,	1
and	1
lieth	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
west	1
and	1
north	1
west.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blew	1
softly,	1
supposing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
obtained	1
their	1
purpose,	1
loosing	1
thence,	1
they	1
sailed	1
close	1
by	1
Crete.	1
	1
27:14	1
But	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
there	1
arose	1
against	1
it	1
a	1
tempestuous	1
wind,	1
called	1
Euroclydon.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
caught,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
wind,	1
we	1
let	1
her	1
drive.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
running	1
under	1
a	1
certain	1
island	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Clauda,	1
we	1
had	1
much	1
work	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
boat:	1
27:17	1
Which	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
up,	1
they	1
used	1
helps,	1
undergirding	1
the	1
ship;	1
and,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
quicksands,	1
strake	1
sail,	1
and	1
so	1
were	1
driven.	1
	1
27:18	1
And	1
we	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
tossed	1
with	1
a	1
tempest,	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
they	1
lightened	1
the	1
ship;	1
27:19	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
we	1
cast	1
out	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands	1
the	1
tackling	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
when	1
neither	1
sun	1
nor	1
stars	1
in	1
many	1
days	1
appeared,	1
and	1
no	1
small	1
tempest	1
lay	1
on	1
us,	1
all	1
hope	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
was	1
then	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
27:21	1
But	1
after	1
long	1
abstinence	1
Paul	1
stood	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
loosed	1
from	1
Crete,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
gained	1
this	1
harm	1
and	1
loss.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
exhort	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
loss	1
of	1
any	1
man's	1
life	1
among	1
you,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:23	1
For	1
there	1
stood	1
by	1
me	1
this	1
night	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
whose	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
whom	1
I	1
serve,	1
27:24	1
Saying,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Paul;	1
thou	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
Caesar:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
sail	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
27:25	1
Wherefore,	1
sirs,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
for	1
I	1
believe	1
God,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me.	1
	1
27:26	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
cast	1
upon	1
a	1
certain	1
island.	1
	1
27:27	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
night	1
was	1
come,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
driven	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
Adria,	1
about	1
midnight	1
the	1
shipmen	1
deemed	1
that	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
some	1
country;	1
27:28	1
And	1
sounded,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
twenty	1
fathoms:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
further,	1
they	1
sounded	1
again,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
fifteen	1
fathoms.	1
	1
27:29	1
Then	1
fearing	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
fallen	1
upon	1
rocks,	1
they	1
cast	1
four	1
anchors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stern,	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
shipmen	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
boat	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
under	1
colour	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
cast	1
anchors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
foreship,	1
27:31	1
Paul	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
centurion	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
Except	1
these	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
ship,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
27:32	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
ropes	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
fall	1
off.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
coming	1
on,	1
Paul	1
besought	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
take	1
meat,	1
saying,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
tarried	1
and	1
continued	1
fasting,	1
having	1
taken	1
nothing.	1
	1
27:34	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
meat:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
health:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hair	1
fall	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
presence	1
of	1
them	1
all:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
it,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
27:36	1
Then	1
were	1
they	1
all	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
some	1
meat.	1
	1
27:37	1
And	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
two	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
sixteen	1
souls.	1
	1
27:38	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
enough,	1
they	1
lightened	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
land:	1
but	1
they	1
discovered	1
a	1
certain	1
creek	1
with	1
a	1
shore,	1
into	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
minded,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
to	1
thrust	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:40	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
anchors,	1
they	1
committed	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
loosed	1
the	1
rudder	1
bands,	1
and	1
hoised	1
up	1
the	1
mainsail	1
to	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
made	1
toward	1
shore.	1
	1
27:41	1
And	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
two	1
seas	1
met,	1
they	1
ran	1
the	1
ship	1
aground;	1
and	1
the	1
forepart	1
stuck	1
fast,	1
and	1
remained	1
unmoveable,	1
but	1
the	1
hinder	1
part	1
was	1
broken	1
with	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
waves.	1
	1
27:42	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
counsel	1
was	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
lest	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
swim	1
out,	1
and	1
escape.	1
	1
27:43	1
But	1
the	1
centurion,	1
willing	1
to	1
save	1
Paul,	1
kept	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
purpose;	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
could	1
swim	1
should	1
cast	1
themselves	1
first	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
get	1
to	1
land:	1
27:44	1
And	1
the	1
rest,	1
some	1
on	1
boards,	1
and	1
some	1
on	1
broken	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
they	1
escaped	1
all	1
safe	1
to	1
land.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
escaped,	1
then	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
island	1
was	1
called	1
Melita.	1
	1
28:2	1
And	1
the	1
barbarous	1
people	1
shewed	1
us	1
no	1
little	1
kindness:	1
for	1
they	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
received	1
us	1
every	1
one,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
rain,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
cold.	1
	1
28:3	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
gathered	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
sticks,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
fire,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
viper	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heat,	1
and	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
28:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
barbarians	1
saw	1
the	1
venomous	1
beast	1
hang	1
on	1
his	1
hand,	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
No	1
doubt	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
murderer,	1
whom,	1
though	1
he	1
hath	1
escaped	1
the	1
sea,	1
yet	1
vengeance	1
suffereth	1
not	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
he	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
beast	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
felt	1
no	1
harm.	1
	1
28:6	1
Howbeit	1
they	1
looked	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
swollen,	1
or	1
fallen	1
down	1
dead	1
suddenly:	1
but	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
a	1
great	1
while,	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
harm	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
they	1
changed	1
their	1
minds,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
god.	1
	1
28:7	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
quarters	1
were	1
possessions	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
island,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Publius;	1
who	1
received	1
us,	1
and	1
lodged	1
us	1
three	1
days	1
courteously.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Publius	1
lay	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
bloody	1
flux:	1
to	1
whom	1
Paul	1
entered	1
in,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
him.	1
	1
28:9	1
So	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
others	1
also,	1
which	1
had	1
diseases	1
in	1
the	1
island,	1
came,	1
and	1
were	1
healed:	1
28:10	1
Who	1
also	1
honoured	1
us	1
with	1
many	1
honours;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
departed,	1
they	1
laded	1
us	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
were	1
necessary.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
months	1
we	1
departed	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Alexandria,	1
which	1
had	1
wintered	1
in	1
the	1
isle,	1
whose	1
sign	1
was	1
Castor	1
and	1
Pollux.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
landing	1
at	1
Syracuse,	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
28:13	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
we	1
fetched	1
a	1
compass,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Rhegium:	1
and	1
after	1
one	1
day	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blew,	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
Puteoli:	1
28:14	1
Where	1
we	1
found	1
brethren,	1
and	1
were	1
desired	1
to	1
tarry	1
with	1
them	1
seven	1
days:	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
went	1
toward	1
Rome.	1
	1
28:15	1
And	1
from	1
thence,	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
heard	1
of	1
us,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Appii	1
forum,	1
and	1
The	1
three	1
taverns:	1
whom	1
when	1
Paul	1
saw,	1
he	1
thanked	1
God,	1
and	1
took	1
courage.	1
	1
28:16	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Rome,	1
the	1
centurion	1
delivered	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard:	1
but	1
Paul	1
was	1
suffered	1
to	1
dwell	1
by	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
soldier	1
that	1
kept	1
him.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
Paul	1
called	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
together:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
together,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
or	1
customs	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
yet	1
was	1
I	1
delivered	1
prisoner	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Romans.	1
	1
28:18	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
examined	1
me,	1
would	1
have	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
28:19	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
spake	1
against	1
it,	1
I	1
was	1
constrained	1
to	1
appeal	1
unto	1
Caesar;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ought	1
to	1
accuse	1
my	1
nation	1
of.	1
	1
28:20	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
called	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
you:	1
because	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Israel	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
with	1
this	1
chain.	1
	1
28:21	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
neither	1
received	1
letters	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
neither	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
that	1
came	1
shewed	1
or	1
spake	1
any	1
harm	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
28:22	1
But	1
we	1
desire	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
thinkest:	1
for	1
as	1
concerning	1
this	1
sect,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
spoken	1
against.	1
	1
28:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
appointed	1
him	1
a	1
day,	1
there	1
came	1
many	1
to	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
lodging;	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
expounded	1
and	1
testified	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
persuading	1
them	1
concerning	1
Jesus,	1
both	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
evening.	1
	1
28:24	1
And	1
some	1
believed	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken,	1
and	1
some	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
28:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
agreed	1
not	1
among	1
themselves,	1
they	1
departed,	1
after	1
that	1
Paul	1
had	1
spoken	1
one	1
word,	1
Well	1
spake	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers,	1
28:26	1
Saying,	1
Go	1
unto	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
say,	1
Hearing	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
understand;	1
and	1
seeing	1
ye	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
not	1
perceive:	1
28:27	1
For	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
is	1
waxed	1
gross,	1
and	1
their	1
ears	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
have	1
they	1
closed;	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
28:28	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
therefore	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
28:29	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Jews	1
departed,	1
and	1
had	1
great	1
reasoning	1
among	1
themselves.	1
	1
28:30	1
And	1
Paul	1
dwelt	1
two	1
whole	1
years	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
hired	1
house,	1
and	1
received	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
28:31	1
Preaching	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
teaching	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
concern	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
with	1
all	1
confidence,	1
no	1
man	1
forbidding	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Romans	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
apostle,	1
separated	1
unto	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God,	1
1:2	1
(Which	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
afore	1
by	1
his	1
prophets	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures,)	1
1:3	1
Concerning	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord,	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh;	1
1:4	1
And	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
power,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
holiness,	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
1:5	1
By	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
grace	1
and	1
apostleship,	1
for	1
obedience	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
for	1
his	1
name:	1
1:6	1
Among	1
whom	1
are	1
ye	1
also	1
the	1
called	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:7	1
To	1
all	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
Rome,	1
beloved	1
of	1
God,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
saints:	1
Grace	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:8	1
First,	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,	1
whom	1
I	1
serve	1
with	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
that	1
without	1
ceasing	1
I	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers;	1
1:10	1
Making	1
request,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
now	1
at	1
length	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
prosperous	1
journey	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
impart	1
unto	1
you	1
some	1
spiritual	1
gift,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
established;	1
1:12	1
That	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
comforted	1
together	1
with	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
mutual	1
faith	1
both	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
me.	1
	1
1:13	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
oftentimes	1
I	1
purposed	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
(but	1
was	1
let	1
hitherto,)	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
some	1
fruit	1
among	1
you	1
also,	1
even	1
as	1
among	1
other	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
am	1
debtor	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Barbarians;	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
unwise.	1
	1
1:15	1
So,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
me	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
Rome	1
also.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
salvation	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
believeth;	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Greek.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
therein	1
is	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
revealed	1
from	1
faith	1
to	1
faith:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
revealed	1
from	1
heaven	1
against	1
all	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
unrighteousness	1
of	1
men,	1
who	1
hold	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
unrighteousness;	1
1:19	1
Because	1
that	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
known	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
manifest	1
in	1
them;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
it	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
the	1
invisible	1
things	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
clearly	1
seen,	1
being	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
made,	1
even	1
his	1
eternal	1
power	1
and	1
Godhead;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
excuse:	1
1:21	1
Because	1
that,	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
God,	1
they	1
glorified	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
God,	1
neither	1
were	1
thankful;	1
but	1
became	1
vain	1
in	1
their	1
imaginations,	1
and	1
their	1
foolish	1
heart	1
was	1
darkened.	1
	1
1:22	1
Professing	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
wise,	1
they	1
became	1
fools,	1
1:23	1
And	1
changed	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
uncorruptible	1
God	1
into	1
an	1
image	1
made	1
like	1
to	1
corruptible	1
man,	1
and	1
to	1
birds,	1
and	1
fourfooted	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things.	1
	1
1:24	1
Wherefore	1
God	1
also	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
through	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hearts,	1
to	1
dishonour	1
their	1
own	1
bodies	1
between	1
themselves:	1
1:25	1
Who	1
changed	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God	1
into	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
creature	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
Creator,	1
who	1
is	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:26	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
vile	1
affections:	1
for	1
even	1
their	1
women	1
did	1
change	1
the	1
natural	1
use	1
into	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
against	1
nature:	1
1:27	1
And	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
men,	1
leaving	1
the	1
natural	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
burned	1
in	1
their	1
lust	1
one	1
toward	1
another;	1
men	1
with	1
men	1
working	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
unseemly,	1
and	1
receiving	1
in	1
themselves	1
that	1
recompence	1
of	1
their	1
error	1
which	1
was	1
meet.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
retain	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
knowledge,	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
over	1
to	1
a	1
reprobate	1
mind,	1
to	1
do	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
convenient;	1
1:29	1
Being	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
unrighteousness,	1
fornication,	1
wickedness,	1
covetousness,	1
maliciousness;	1
full	1
of	1
envy,	1
murder,	1
debate,	1
deceit,	1
malignity;	1
whisperers,	1
1:30	1
Backbiters,	1
haters	1
of	1
God,	1
despiteful,	1
proud,	1
boasters,	1
inventors	1
of	1
evil	1
things,	1
disobedient	1
to	1
parents,	1
1:31	1
Without	1
understanding,	1
covenantbreakers,	1
without	1
natural	1
affection,	1
implacable,	1
unmerciful:	1
1:32	1
Who	1
knowing	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
commit	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
have	1
pleasure	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
2:1	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
art	1
inexcusable,	1
O	1
man,	1
whosoever	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
judgest:	1
for	1
wherein	1
thou	1
judgest	1
another,	1
thou	1
condemnest	1
thyself;	1
for	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
doest	1
the	1
same	1
things.	1
	1
2:2	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
truth	1
against	1
them	1
which	1
commit	1
such	1
things.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
this,	1
O	1
man,	1
that	1
judgest	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
such	1
things,	1
and	1
doest	1
the	1
same,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
escape	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
2:4	1
Or	1
despisest	1
thou	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
goodness	1
and	1
forbearance	1
and	1
longsuffering;	1
not	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
leadeth	1
thee	1
to	1
repentance?	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
after	1
thy	1
hardness	1
and	1
impenitent	1
heart	1
treasurest	1
up	1
unto	1
thyself	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
wrath	1
and	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
of	1
God;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
will	1
render	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
deeds:	1
2:7	1
To	1
them	1
who	1
by	1
patient	1
continuance	1
in	1
well	1
doing	1
seek	1
for	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
immortality,	1
eternal	1
life:	1
2:8	1
But	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
contentious,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
obey	1
unrighteousness,	1
indignation	1
and	1
wrath,	1
2:9	1
Tribulation	1
and	1
anguish,	1
upon	1
every	1
soul	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil,	1
of	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentile;	1
2:10	1
But	1
glory,	1
honour,	1
and	1
peace,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
worketh	1
good,	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentile:	1
2:11	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
sinned	1
without	1
law	1
shall	1
also	1
perish	1
without	1
law:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
sinned	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
2:13	1
(For	1
not	1
the	1
hearers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
just	1
before	1
God,	1
but	1
the	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
law,	1
do	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
things	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
these,	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
law,	1
are	1
a	1
law	1
unto	1
themselves:	1
2:15	1
Which	1
shew	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
their	1
conscience	1
also	1
bearing	1
witness,	1
and	1
their	1
thoughts	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
accusing	1
or	1
else	1
excusing	1
one	1
another;)	1
2:16	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
God	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
men	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel.	1
	1
2:17	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
called	1
a	1
Jew,	1
and	1
restest	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
makest	1
thy	1
boast	1
of	1
God,	1
2:18	1
And	1
knowest	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
approvest	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
more	1
excellent,	1
being	1
instructed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
2:19	1
And	1
art	1
confident	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
art	1
a	1
guide	1
of	1
the	1
blind,	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
darkness,	1
2:20	1
An	1
instructor	1
of	1
the	1
foolish,	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
babes,	1
which	1
hast	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:21	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
which	1
teachest	1
another,	1
teachest	1
thou	1
not	1
thyself?	1
thou	1
that	1
preachest	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
steal,	1
dost	1
thou	1
steal?	1
	1
2:22	1
Thou	1
that	1
sayest	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
dost	1
thou	1
commit	1
adultery?	1
thou	1
that	1
abhorrest	1
idols,	1
dost	1
thou	1
commit	1
sacrilege?	1
	1
2:23	1
Thou	1
that	1
makest	1
thy	1
boast	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
through	1
breaking	1
the	1
law	1
dishonourest	1
thou	1
God?	1
	1
2:24	1
For	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
blasphemed	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
through	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
circumcision	1
verily	1
profiteth,	1
if	1
thou	1
keep	1
the	1
law:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
breaker	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
thy	1
circumcision	1
is	1
made	1
uncircumcision.	1
	1
2:26	1
Therefore	1
if	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
keep	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
shall	1
not	1
his	1
uncircumcision	1
be	1
counted	1
for	1
circumcision?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
shall	1
not	1
uncircumcision	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
nature,	1
if	1
it	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law,	1
judge	1
thee,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
circumcision	1
dost	1
transgress	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
2:28	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
Jew,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
outwardly;	1
neither	1
is	1
that	1
circumcision,	1
which	1
is	1
outward	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
2:29	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Jew,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
inwardly;	1
and	1
circumcision	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
letter;	1
whose	1
praise	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:1	1
What	1
advantage	1
then	1
hath	1
the	1
Jew?	1
or	1
what	1
profit	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
circumcision?	1
	1
3:2	1
Much	1
every	1
way:	1
chiefly,	1
because	1
that	1
unto	1
them	1
were	1
committed	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
what	1
if	1
some	1
did	1
not	1
believe?	1
shall	1
their	1
unbelief	1
make	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
effect?	1
	1
3:4	1
God	1
forbid:	1
yea,	1
let	1
God	1
be	1
true,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
liar;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
That	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
thy	1
sayings,	1
and	1
mightest	1
overcome	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
judged.	1
	1
3:5	1
But	1
if	1
our	1
unrighteousness	1
commend	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say?	1
Is	1
God	1
unrighteous	1
who	1
taketh	1
vengeance?	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
a	1
man)	1
3:6	1
God	1
forbid:	1
for	1
then	1
how	1
shall	1
God	1
judge	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
more	1
abounded	1
through	1
my	1
lie	1
unto	1
his	1
glory;	1
why	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
also	1
judged	1
as	1
a	1
sinner?	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
not	1
rather,	1
(as	1
we	1
be	1
slanderously	1
reported,	1
and	1
as	1
some	1
affirm	1
that	1
we	1
say,)	1
Let	1
us	1
do	1
evil,	1
that	1
good	1
may	1
come?	1
whose	1
damnation	1
is	1
just.	1
	1
3:9	1
What	1
then?	1
are	1
we	1
better	1
than	1
they?	1
No,	1
in	1
no	1
wise:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
before	1
proved	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
under	1
sin;	1
3:10	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
righteous,	1
no,	1
not	1
one:	1
3:11	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
understandeth,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
seeketh	1
after	1
God.	1
	1
3:12	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
they	1
are	1
together	1
become	1
unprofitable;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good,	1
no,	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
3:13	1
Their	1
throat	1
is	1
an	1
open	1
sepulchre;	1
with	1
their	1
tongues	1
they	1
have	1
used	1
deceit;	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
asps	1
is	1
under	1
their	1
lips:	1
3:14	1
Whose	1
mouth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
cursing	1
and	1
bitterness:	1
3:15	1
Their	1
feet	1
are	1
swift	1
to	1
shed	1
blood:	1
3:16	1
Destruction	1
and	1
misery	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
ways:	1
3:17	1
And	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
peace	1
have	1
they	1
not	1
known:	1
3:18	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
3:19	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
what	1
things	1
soever	1
the	1
law	1
saith,	1
it	1
saith	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law:	1
that	1
every	1
mouth	1
may	1
be	1
stopped,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
become	1
guilty	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
3:20	1
Therefore	1
by	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
3:21	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
manifested,	1
being	1
witnessed	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
3:22	1
Even	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
unto	1
all	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difference:	1
3:23	1
For	1
all	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God;	1
3:24	1
Being	1
justified	1
freely	1
by	1
his	1
grace	1
through	1
the	1
redemption	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
3:25	1
Whom	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
propitiation	1
through	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
blood,	1
to	1
declare	1
his	1
righteousness	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
that	1
are	1
past,	1
through	1
the	1
forbearance	1
of	1
God;	1
3:26	1
To	1
declare,	1
I	1
say,	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
his	1
righteousness:	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
just,	1
and	1
the	1
justifier	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
believeth	1
in	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:27	1
Where	1
is	1
boasting	1
then?	1
It	1
is	1
excluded.	1
By	1
what	1
law?	1
of	1
works?	1
Nay:	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
3:28	1
Therefore	1
we	1
conclude	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
faith	1
without	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:29	1
Is	1
he	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
only?	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
Yes,	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
also:	1
3:30	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
God,	1
which	1
shall	1
justify	1
the	1
circumcision	1
by	1
faith,	1
and	1
uncircumcision	1
through	1
faith.	1
	1
3:31	1
Do	1
we	1
then	1
make	1
void	1
the	1
law	1
through	1
faith?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
yea,	1
we	1
establish	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
4:1	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then	1
that	1
Abraham	1
our	1
father,	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
hath	1
found?	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
if	1
Abraham	1
were	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
he	1
hath	1
whereof	1
to	1
glory;	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture?	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
counted	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:4	1
Now	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
worketh	1
is	1
the	1
reward	1
not	1
reckoned	1
of	1
grace,	1
but	1
of	1
debt.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
worketh	1
not,	1
but	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
justifieth	1
the	1
ungodly,	1
his	1
faith	1
is	1
counted	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:6	1
Even	1
as	1
David	1
also	1
describeth	1
the	1
blessedness	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
unto	1
whom	1
God	1
imputeth	1
righteousness	1
without	1
works,	1
4:7	1
Saying,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
whose	1
iniquities	1
are	1
forgiven,	1
and	1
whose	1
sins	1
are	1
covered.	1
	1
4:8	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
impute	1
sin.	1
	1
4:9	1
Cometh	1
this	1
blessedness	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
circumcision	1
only,	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
also?	1
for	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
faith	1
was	1
reckoned	1
to	1
Abraham	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:10	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
then	1
reckoned?	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
circumcision,	1
or	1
in	1
uncircumcision?	1
Not	1
in	1
circumcision,	1
but	1
in	1
uncircumcision.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
circumcision,	1
a	1
seal	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
being	1
uncircumcised:	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
circumcised;	1
that	1
righteousness	1
might	1
be	1
imputed	1
unto	1
them	1
also:	1
4:12	1
And	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
circumcision	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
only,	1
but	1
who	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
that	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
being	1
yet	1
uncircumcised.	1
	1
4:13	1
For	1
the	1
promise,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
seed,	1
through	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
be	1
heirs,	1
faith	1
is	1
made	1
void,	1
and	1
the	1
promise	1
made	1
of	1
none	1
effect:	1
4:15	1
Because	1
the	1
law	1
worketh	1
wrath:	1
for	1
where	1
no	1
law	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
transgression.	1
	1
4:16	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
faith,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
by	1
grace;	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
promise	1
might	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
seed;	1
not	1
to	1
that	1
only	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
to	1
that	1
also	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Abraham;	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
us	1
all,	1
4:17	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations,)	1
before	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
believed,	1
even	1
God,	1
who	1
quickeneth	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
calleth	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
not	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were.	1
	1
4:18	1
Who	1
against	1
hope	1
believed	1
in	1
hope,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
become	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken,	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
being	1
not	1
weak	1
in	1
faith,	1
he	1
considered	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
now	1
dead,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old,	1
neither	1
yet	1
the	1
deadness	1
of	1
Sarah's	1
womb:	1
4:20	1
He	1
staggered	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
unbelief;	1
but	1
was	1
strong	1
in	1
faith,	1
giving	1
glory	1
to	1
God;	1
4:21	1
And	1
being	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
that,	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
promised,	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
perform.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:23	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
written	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
alone,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
to	1
him;	1
4:24	1
But	1
for	1
us	1
also,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
imputed,	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
4:25	1
Who	1
was	1
delivered	1
for	1
our	1
offences,	1
and	1
was	1
raised	1
again	1
for	1
our	1
justification.	1
	1
5:1	1
Therefore	1
being	1
justified	1
by	1
faith,	1
we	1
have	1
peace	1
with	1
God	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
5:2	1
By	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
have	1
access	1
by	1
faith	1
into	1
this	1
grace	1
wherein	1
we	1
stand,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
so,	1
but	1
we	1
glory	1
in	1
tribulations	1
also:	1
knowing	1
that	1
tribulation	1
worketh	1
patience;	1
5:4	1
And	1
patience,	1
experience;	1
and	1
experience,	1
hope:	1
5:5	1
And	1
hope	1
maketh	1
not	1
ashamed;	1
because	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
shed	1
abroad	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
without	1
strength,	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
the	1
ungodly.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
scarcely	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
will	1
one	1
die:	1
yet	1
peradventure	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
some	1
would	1
even	1
dare	1
to	1
die.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
God	1
commendeth	1
his	1
love	1
toward	1
us,	1
in	1
that,	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
sinners,	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
5:9	1
Much	1
more	1
then,	1
being	1
now	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
blood,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
wrath	1
through	1
him.	1
	1
5:10	1
For	1
if,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
enemies,	1
we	1
were	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
much	1
more,	1
being	1
reconciled,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
by	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
so,	1
but	1
we	1
also	1
joy	1
in	1
God	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
received	1
the	1
atonement.	1
	1
5:12	1
Wherefore,	1
as	1
by	1
one	1
man	1
sin	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
death	1
by	1
sin;	1
and	1
so	1
death	1
passed	1
upon	1
all	1
men,	1
for	1
that	1
all	1
have	1
sinned:	1
5:13	1
(For	1
until	1
the	1
law	1
sin	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
world:	1
but	1
sin	1
is	1
not	1
imputed	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law.	1
	1
5:14	1
Nevertheless	1
death	1
reigned	1
from	1
Adam	1
to	1
Moses,	1
even	1
over	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
sinned	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
Adam's	1
transgression,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
offence,	1
so	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
free	1
gift.	1
For	1
if	1
through	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
one	1
many	1
be	1
dead,	1
much	1
more	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
gift	1
by	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
one	1
man,	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
hath	1
abounded	1
unto	1
many.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
that	1
sinned,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
gift:	1
for	1
the	1
judgment	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
condemnation,	1
but	1
the	1
free	1
gift	1
is	1
of	1
many	1
offences	1
unto	1
justification.	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
if	1
by	1
one	1
man's	1
offence	1
death	1
reigned	1
by	1
one;	1
much	1
more	1
they	1
which	1
receive	1
abundance	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
reign	1
in	1
life	1
by	1
one,	1
Jesus	1
Christ.)	1
	1
5:18	1
Therefore	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
one	1
judgment	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
condemnation;	1
even	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
one	1
the	1
free	1
gift	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
justification	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
5:19	1
For	1
as	1
by	1
one	1
man's	1
disobedience	1
many	1
were	1
made	1
sinners,	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
one	1
shall	1
many	1
be	1
made	1
righteous.	1
	1
5:20	1
Moreover	1
the	1
law	1
entered,	1
that	1
the	1
offence	1
might	1
abound.	1
But	1
where	1
sin	1
abounded,	1
grace	1
did	1
much	1
more	1
abound:	1
5:21	1
That	1
as	1
sin	1
hath	1
reigned	1
unto	1
death,	1
even	1
so	1
might	1
grace	1
reign	1
through	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
eternal	1
life	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:1	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Shall	1
we	1
continue	1
in	1
sin,	1
that	1
grace	1
may	1
abound?	1
	1
6:2	1
God	1
forbid.	1
How	1
shall	1
we,	1
that	1
are	1
dead	1
to	1
sin,	1
live	1
any	1
longer	1
therein?	1
	1
6:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
were	1
baptized	1
into	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
were	1
baptized	1
into	1
his	1
death?	1
	1
6:4	1
Therefore	1
we	1
are	1
buried	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
baptism	1
into	1
death:	1
that	1
like	1
as	1
Christ	1
was	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
by	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
even	1
so	1
we	1
also	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
newness	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
planted	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection:	1
6:6	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
our	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
sin	1
might	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
that	1
henceforth	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
serve	1
sin.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
dead	1
is	1
freed	1
from	1
sin.	1
	1
6:8	1
Now	1
if	1
we	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
Christ,	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
live	1
with	1
him:	1
6:9	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Christ	1
being	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
dieth	1
no	1
more;	1
death	1
hath	1
no	1
more	1
dominion	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
he	1
died	1
unto	1
sin	1
once:	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
liveth,	1
he	1
liveth	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
6:11	1
Likewise	1
reckon	1
ye	1
also	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
dead	1
indeed	1
unto	1
sin,	1
but	1
alive	1
unto	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:12	1
Let	1
not	1
sin	1
therefore	1
reign	1
in	1
your	1
mortal	1
body,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
obey	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
lusts	1
thereof.	1
	1
6:13	1
Neither	1
yield	1
ye	1
your	1
members	1
as	1
instruments	1
of	1
unrighteousness	1
unto	1
sin:	1
but	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
God,	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
alive	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
your	1
members	1
as	1
instruments	1
of	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
6:14	1
For	1
sin	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
under	1
grace.	1
	1
6:15	1
What	1
then?	1
shall	1
we	1
sin,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
under	1
grace?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
6:16	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
that	1
to	1
whom	1
ye	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
servants	1
to	1
obey,	1
his	1
servants	1
ye	1
are	1
to	1
whom	1
ye	1
obey;	1
whether	1
of	1
sin	1
unto	1
death,	1
or	1
of	1
obedience	1
unto	1
righteousness?	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
God	1
be	1
thanked,	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
sin,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
obeyed	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
that	1
form	1
of	1
doctrine	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
you.	1
	1
6:18	1
Being	1
then	1
made	1
free	1
from	1
sin,	1
ye	1
became	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:19	1
I	1
speak	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
infirmity	1
of	1
your	1
flesh:	1
for	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
yielded	1
your	1
members	1
servants	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
to	1
iniquity	1
unto	1
iniquity;	1
even	1
so	1
now	1
yield	1
your	1
members	1
servants	1
to	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
holiness.	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
when	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
sin,	1
ye	1
were	1
free	1
from	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:21	1
What	1
fruit	1
had	1
ye	1
then	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
are	1
now	1
ashamed?	1
	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
is	1
death.	1
	1
6:22	1
But	1
now	1
being	1
made	1
free	1
from	1
sin,	1
and	1
become	1
servants	1
to	1
God,	1
ye	1
have	1
your	1
fruit	1
unto	1
holiness,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
6:23	1
For	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
sin	1
is	1
death;	1
but	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
eternal	1
life	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
7:1	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
(for	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
the	1
law,)	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
hath	1
dominion	1
over	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth?	1
	1
7:2	1
For	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth;	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
loosed	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
7:3	1
So	1
then	1
if,	1
while	1
her	1
husband	1
liveth,	1
she	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another	1
man,	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
adulteress:	1
but	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
that	1
law;	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
no	1
adulteress,	1
though	1
she	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
7:4	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
become	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ;	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
the	1
motions	1
of	1
sins,	1
which	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
law,	1
did	1
work	1
in	1
our	1
members	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
7:6	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
being	1
dead	1
wherein	1
we	1
were	1
held;	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
in	1
newness	1
of	1
spirit,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
oldness	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
7:7	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Is	1
the	1
law	1
sin?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
Nay,	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
sin,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
lust,	1
except	1
the	1
law	1
had	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet.	1
	1
7:8	1
But	1
sin,	1
taking	1
occasion	1
by	1
the	1
commandment,	1
wrought	1
in	1
me	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
concupiscence.	1
For	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
sin	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
7:9	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
alive	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
once:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
commandment	1
came,	1
sin	1
revived,	1
and	1
I	1
died.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
commandment,	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
to	1
life,	1
I	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
sin,	1
taking	1
occasion	1
by	1
the	1
commandment,	1
deceived	1
me,	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
slew	1
me.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
holy,	1
and	1
the	1
commandment	1
holy,	1
and	1
just,	1
and	1
good.	1
	1
7:13	1
Was	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
made	1
death	1
unto	1
me?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
But	1
sin,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
appear	1
sin,	1
working	1
death	1
in	1
me	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good;	1
that	1
sin	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
might	1
become	1
exceeding	1
sinful.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
spiritual:	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
carnal,	1
sold	1
under	1
sin.	1
	1
7:15	1
For	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
I	1
allow	1
not:	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
would,	1
that	1
do	1
I	1
not;	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
hate,	1
that	1
do	1
I.	1
	1
7:16	1
If	1
then	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
I	1
consent	1
unto	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
7:17	1
Now	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
that	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
sin	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:18	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
(that	1
is,	1
in	1
my	1
flesh,)	1
dwelleth	1
no	1
good	1
thing:	1
for	1
to	1
will	1
is	1
present	1
with	1
me;	1
but	1
how	1
to	1
perform	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
I	1
find	1
not.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
that	1
I	1
do.	1
	1
7:20	1
Now	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
that	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
sin	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:21	1
I	1
find	1
then	1
a	1
law,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
good,	1
evil	1
is	1
present	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
I	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God	1
after	1
the	1
inward	1
man:	1
7:23	1
But	1
I	1
see	1
another	1
law	1
in	1
my	1
members,	1
warring	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
bringing	1
me	1
into	1
captivity	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
members.	1
	1
7:24	1
O	1
wretched	1
man	1
that	1
I	1
am!	1
who	1
shall	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
this	1
death?	1
	1
7:25	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
So	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
mind	1
I	1
myself	1
serve	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
flesh	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
8:1	1
There	1
is	1
therefore	1
now	1
no	1
condemnation	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
walk	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:2	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
death.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
what	1
the	1
law	1
could	1
not	1
do,	1
in	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
weak	1
through	1
the	1
flesh,	1
God	1
sending	1
his	1
own	1
Son	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
sinful	1
flesh,	1
and	1
for	1
sin,	1
condemned	1
sin	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
8:4	1
That	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
us,	1
who	1
walk	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
do	1
mind	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
flesh;	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:6	1
For	1
to	1
be	1
carnally	1
minded	1
is	1
death;	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
spiritually	1
minded	1
is	1
life	1
and	1
peace.	1
	1
8:7	1
Because	1
the	1
carnal	1
mind	1
is	1
enmity	1
against	1
God:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God,	1
neither	1
indeed	1
can	1
be.	1
	1
8:8	1
So	1
then	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
cannot	1
please	1
God.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
dwell	1
in	1
you.	1
Now	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
his.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
dead	1
because	1
of	1
sin;	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
life	1
because	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:11	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
dwell	1
in	1
you,	1
he	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
also	1
quicken	1
your	1
mortal	1
bodies	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:12	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
are	1
debtors,	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
to	1
live	1
after	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
8:13	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
live	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
ye	1
shall	1
die:	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
do	1
mortify	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
ye	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:15	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
bondage	1
again	1
to	1
fear;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
adoption,	1
whereby	1
we	1
cry,	1
Abba,	1
Father.	1
	1
8:16	1
The	1
Spirit	1
itself	1
beareth	1
witness	1
with	1
our	1
spirit,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God:	1
8:17	1
And	1
if	1
children,	1
then	1
heirs;	1
heirs	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
joint-heirs	1
with	1
Christ;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
suffer	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
also	1
glorified	1
together.	1
	1
8:18	1
For	1
I	1
reckon	1
that	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
are	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
8:19	1
For	1
the	1
earnest	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:20	1
For	1
the	1
creature	1
was	1
made	1
subject	1
to	1
vanity,	1
not	1
willingly,	1
but	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
subjected	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
hope,	1
8:21	1
Because	1
the	1
creature	1
itself	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
bondage	1
of	1
corruption	1
into	1
the	1
glorious	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:22	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
creation	1
groaneth	1
and	1
travaileth	1
in	1
pain	1
together	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
they,	1
but	1
ourselves	1
also,	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
we	1
ourselves	1
groan	1
within	1
ourselves,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
adoption,	1
to	1
wit,	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
our	1
body.	1
	1
8:24	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
saved	1
by	1
hope:	1
but	1
hope	1
that	1
is	1
seen	1
is	1
not	1
hope:	1
for	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
seeth,	1
why	1
doth	1
he	1
yet	1
hope	1
for?	1
	1
8:25	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
hope	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
not,	1
then	1
do	1
we	1
with	1
patience	1
wait	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
8:26	1
Likewise	1
the	1
Spirit	1
also	1
helpeth	1
our	1
infirmities:	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
pray	1
for	1
as	1
we	1
ought:	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
itself	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
us	1
with	1
groanings	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
uttered.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
searcheth	1
the	1
hearts	1
knoweth	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
because	1
he	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
the	1
saints	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
work	1
together	1
for	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
God,	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
called	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
purpose.	1
	1
8:29	1
For	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
foreknow,	1
he	1
also	1
did	1
predestinate	1
to	1
be	1
conformed	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
firstborn	1
among	1
many	1
brethren.	1
	1
8:30	1
Moreover	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
predestinate,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
called:	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
called,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
justified:	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
justified,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
glorified.	1
	1
8:31	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
then	1
say	1
to	1
these	1
things?	1
If	1
God	1
be	1
for	1
us,	1
who	1
can	1
be	1
against	1
us?	1
	1
8:32	1
He	1
that	1
spared	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
Son,	1
but	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
us	1
all,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
with	1
him	1
also	1
freely	1
give	1
us	1
all	1
things?	1
	1
8:33	1
Who	1
shall	1
lay	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
God's	1
elect?	1
It	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
justifieth.	1
	1
8:34	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth?	1
It	1
is	1
Christ	1
that	1
died,	1
yea	1
rather,	1
that	1
is	1
risen	1
again,	1
who	1
is	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
also	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
8:35	1
Who	1
shall	1
separate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ?	1
shall	1
tribulation,	1
or	1
distress,	1
or	1
persecution,	1
or	1
famine,	1
or	1
nakedness,	1
or	1
peril,	1
or	1
sword?	1
	1
8:36	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
For	1
thy	1
sake	1
we	1
are	1
killed	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long;	1
we	1
are	1
accounted	1
as	1
sheep	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter.	1
	1
8:37	1
Nay,	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
we	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
conquerors	1
through	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
us.	1
	1
8:38	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded,	1
that	1
neither	1
death,	1
nor	1
life,	1
nor	1
angels,	1
nor	1
principalities,	1
nor	1
powers,	1
nor	1
things	1
present,	1
nor	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
8:39	1
Nor	1
height,	1
nor	1
depth,	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
creature,	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
separate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:1	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
Christ,	1
I	1
lie	1
not,	1
my	1
conscience	1
also	1
bearing	1
me	1
witness	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
9:2	1
That	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
heaviness	1
and	1
continual	1
sorrow	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
9:3	1
For	1
I	1
could	1
wish	1
that	1
myself	1
were	1
accursed	1
from	1
Christ	1
for	1
my	1
brethren,	1
my	1
kinsmen	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh:	1
9:4	1
Who	1
are	1
Israelites;	1
to	1
whom	1
pertaineth	1
the	1
adoption,	1
and	1
the	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
covenants,	1
and	1
the	1
giving	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
promises;	1
9:5	1
Whose	1
are	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
as	1
concerning	1
the	1
flesh	1
Christ	1
came,	1
who	1
is	1
over	1
all,	1
God	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
9:6	1
Not	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
none	1
effect.	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
Israel,	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
Israel:	1
9:7	1
Neither,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
children:	1
but,	1
In	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called.	1
	1
9:8	1
That	1
is,	1
They	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
are	1
counted	1
for	1
the	1
seed.	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
promise,	1
At	1
this	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
this;	1
but	1
when	1
Rebecca	1
also	1
had	1
conceived	1
by	1
one,	1
even	1
by	1
our	1
father	1
Isaac;	1
9:11	1
(For	1
the	1
children	1
being	1
not	1
yet	1
born,	1
neither	1
having	1
done	1
any	1
good	1
or	1
evil,	1
that	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
election	1
might	1
stand,	1
not	1
of	1
works,	1
but	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
calleth;)	1
9:12	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
elder	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
younger.	1
	1
9:13	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Jacob	1
have	1
I	1
loved,	1
but	1
Esau	1
have	1
I	1
hated.	1
	1
9:14	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Is	1
there	1
unrighteousness	1
with	1
God?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
9:15	1
For	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
Moses,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
compassion.	1
	1
9:16	1
So	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
willeth,	1
nor	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
runneth,	1
but	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
sheweth	1
mercy.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Even	1
for	1
this	1
same	1
purpose	1
have	1
I	1
raised	1
thee	1
up,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
shew	1
my	1
power	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
might	1
be	1
declared	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:18	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
he	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
will	1
he	1
hardeneth.	1
	1
9:19	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
then	1
unto	1
me,	1
Why	1
doth	1
he	1
yet	1
find	1
fault?	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
resisted	1
his	1
will?	1
	1
9:20	1
Nay	1
but,	1
O	1
man,	1
who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
repliest	1
against	1
God?	1
Shall	1
the	1
thing	1
formed	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
formed	1
it,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
made	1
me	1
thus?	1
	1
9:21	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
potter	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
clay,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
lump	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
vessel	1
unto	1
honour,	1
and	1
another	1
unto	1
dishonour?	1
	1
9:22	1
What	1
if	1
God,	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
power	1
known,	1
endured	1
with	1
much	1
longsuffering	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
wrath	1
fitted	1
to	1
destruction:	1
9:23	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
on	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
mercy,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
afore	1
prepared	1
unto	1
glory,	1
9:24	1
Even	1
us,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
called,	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
	1
9:25	1
As	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
Osee,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
them	1
my	1
people,	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
her	1
beloved,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
beloved.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people;	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
9:27	1
Esaias	1
also	1
crieth	1
concerning	1
Israel,	1
Though	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
a	1
remnant	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
9:28	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
finish	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
short	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
because	1
a	1
short	1
work	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
make	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
as	1
Esaias	1
said	1
before,	1
Except	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Sabaoth	1
had	1
left	1
us	1
a	1
seed,	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
Sodoma,	1
and	1
been	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
Gomorrha.	1
	1
9:30	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
That	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
followed	1
not	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
have	1
attained	1
to	1
righteousness,	1
even	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
9:31	1
But	1
Israel,	1
which	1
followed	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
hath	1
not	1
attained	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
9:32	1
Wherefore?	1
Because	1
they	1
sought	1
it	1
not	1
by	1
faith,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
For	1
they	1
stumbled	1
at	1
that	1
stumblingstone;	1
9:33	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Sion	1
a	1
stumblingstone	1
and	1
rock	1
of	1
offence:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
10:1	1
Brethren,	1
my	1
heart's	1
desire	1
and	1
prayer	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
Israel	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
I	1
bear	1
them	1
record	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
zeal	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
knowledge.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
they	1
being	1
ignorant	1
of	1
God's	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
going	1
about	1
to	1
establish	1
their	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
have	1
not	1
submitted	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:4	1
For	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
righteousness	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
believeth.	1
	1
10:5	1
For	1
Moses	1
describeth	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
doeth	1
those	1
things	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
10:6	1
But	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
faith	1
speaketh	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
Say	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
Who	1
shall	1
ascend	1
into	1
heaven?	1
(that	1
is,	1
to	1
bring	1
Christ	1
down	1
from	1
above:)	1
10:7	1
Or,	1
Who	1
shall	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
deep?	1
(that	1
is,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
Christ	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.)	1
	1
10:8	1
But	1
what	1
saith	1
it?	1
The	1
word	1
is	1
nigh	1
thee,	1
even	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
heart:	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
faith,	1
which	1
we	1
preach;	1
10:9	1
That	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
confess	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
shalt	1
believe	1
in	1
thine	1
heart	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:10	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
heart	1
man	1
believeth	1
unto	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
mouth	1
confession	1
is	1
made	1
unto	1
salvation.	1
	1
10:11	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
Whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
10:12	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
Jew	1
and	1
the	1
Greek:	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
Lord	1
over	1
all	1
is	1
rich	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
10:13	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:14	1
How	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
call	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
believed?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
heard?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
hear	1
without	1
a	1
preacher?	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
preach,	1
except	1
they	1
be	1
sent?	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
How	1
beautiful	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
bring	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
good	1
things!	1
	1
10:16	1
But	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
all	1
obeyed	1
the	1
gospel.	1
For	1
Esaias	1
saith,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
	1
10:17	1
So	1
then	1
faith	1
cometh	1
by	1
hearing,	1
and	1
hearing	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:18	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
Have	1
they	1
not	1
heard?	1
Yes	1
verily,	1
their	1
sound	1
went	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
10:19	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
Did	1
not	1
Israel	1
know?	1
First	1
Moses	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
provoke	1
you	1
to	1
jealousy	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
no	1
people,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
foolish	1
nation	1
I	1
will	1
anger	1
you.	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
Esaias	1
is	1
very	1
bold,	1
and	1
saith,	1
I	1
was	1
found	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sought	1
me	1
not;	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
asked	1
not	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
10:21	1
But	1
to	1
Israel	1
he	1
saith,	1
All	1
day	1
long	1
I	1
have	1
stretched	1
forth	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
a	1
disobedient	1
and	1
gainsaying	1
people.	1
	1
11:1	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Hath	1
God	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
people?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
For	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
an	1
Israelite,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
11:2	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
people	1
which	1
he	1
foreknew.	1
Wot	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
of	1
Elias?	1
how	1
he	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
to	1
God	1
against	1
Israel	1
saying,	1
11:3	1
Lord,	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
thy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
digged	1
down	1
thine	1
altars;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
they	1
seek	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
11:4	1
But	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
him?	1
I	1
have	1
reserved	1
to	1
myself	1
seven	1
thousand	1
men,	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
bowed	1
the	1
knee	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
Baal.	1
	1
11:5	1
Even	1
so	1
then	1
at	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
also	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
remnant	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
grace.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
if	1
by	1
grace,	1
then	1
is	1
it	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
works:	1
otherwise	1
grace	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
grace.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
works,	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
grace:	1
otherwise	1
work	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
work.	1
	1
11:7	1
What	1
then?	1
Israel	1
hath	1
not	1
obtained	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seeketh	1
for;	1
but	1
the	1
election	1
hath	1
obtained	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
blinded.	1
	1
11:8	1
(According	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
them	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
slumber,	1
eyes	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
ears	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hear;)	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
David	1
saith,	1
Let	1
their	1
table	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
snare,	1
and	1
a	1
trap,	1
and	1
a	1
stumblingblock,	1
and	1
a	1
recompence	1
unto	1
them:	1
11:10	1
Let	1
their	1
eyes	1
be	1
darkened,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
bow	1
down	1
their	1
back	1
alway.	1
	1
11:11	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Have	1
they	1
stumbled	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
fall?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
but	1
rather	1
through	1
their	1
fall	1
salvation	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
for	1
to	1
provoke	1
them	1
to	1
jealousy.	1
	1
11:12	1
Now	1
if	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
diminishing	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
their	1
fulness?	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
Gentiles,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
apostle	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
I	1
magnify	1
mine	1
office:	1
11:14	1
If	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
may	1
provoke	1
to	1
emulation	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
might	1
save	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
11:15	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
casting	1
away	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
reconciling	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
what	1
shall	1
the	1
receiving	1
of	1
them	1
be,	1
but	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
11:16	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
firstfruit	1
be	1
holy,	1
the	1
lump	1
is	1
also	1
holy:	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
root	1
be	1
holy,	1
so	1
are	1
the	1
branches.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
if	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
be	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
wild	1
olive	1
tree,	1
wert	1
graffed	1
in	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
partakest	1
of	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
fatness	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
tree;	1
11:18	1
Boast	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
branches.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
boast,	1
thou	1
bearest	1
not	1
the	1
root,	1
but	1
the	1
root	1
thee.	1
	1
11:19	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
then,	1
The	1
branches	1
were	1
broken	1
off,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
graffed	1
in.	1
	1
11:20	1
Well;	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
they	1
were	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
thou	1
standest	1
by	1
faith.	1
Be	1
not	1
highminded,	1
but	1
fear:	1
11:21	1
For	1
if	1
God	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
natural	1
branches,	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
he	1
also	1
spare	1
not	1
thee.	1
	1
11:22	1
Behold	1
therefore	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
severity	1
of	1
God:	1
on	1
them	1
which	1
fell,	1
severity;	1
but	1
toward	1
thee,	1
goodness,	1
if	1
thou	1
continue	1
in	1
his	1
goodness:	1
otherwise	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
they	1
also,	1
if	1
they	1
abide	1
not	1
still	1
in	1
unbelief,	1
shall	1
be	1
graffed	1
in:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
graff	1
them	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
11:24	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
wild	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
wert	1
graffed	1
contrary	1
to	1
nature	1
into	1
a	1
good	1
olive	1
tree:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
these,	1
which	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
branches,	1
be	1
graffed	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
olive	1
tree?	1
	1
11:25	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
this	1
mystery,	1
lest	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
conceits;	1
that	1
blindness	1
in	1
part	1
is	1
happened	1
to	1
Israel,	1
until	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
be	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
11:26	1
And	1
so	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
There	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Sion	1
the	1
Deliverer,	1
and	1
shall	1
turn	1
away	1
ungodliness	1
from	1
Jacob:	1
11:27	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
covenant	1
unto	1
them,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
11:28	1
As	1
concerning	1
the	1
gospel,	1
they	1
are	1
enemies	1
for	1
your	1
sakes:	1
but	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
election,	1
they	1
are	1
beloved	1
for	1
the	1
father's	1
sakes.	1
	1
11:29	1
For	1
the	1
gifts	1
and	1
calling	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
without	1
repentance.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
as	1
ye	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
have	1
not	1
believed	1
God,	1
yet	1
have	1
now	1
obtained	1
mercy	1
through	1
their	1
unbelief:	1
11:31	1
Even	1
so	1
have	1
these	1
also	1
now	1
not	1
believed,	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
mercy	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
obtain	1
mercy.	1
	1
11:32	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
concluded	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
unbelief,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
all.	1
	1
11:33	1
O	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
riches	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
how	1
unsearchable	1
are	1
his	1
judgments,	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
past	1
finding	1
out!	1
	1
11:34	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
known	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
been	1
his	1
counsellor?	1
	1
11:35	1
Or	1
who	1
hath	1
first	1
given	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
recompensed	1
unto	1
him	1
again?	1
	1
11:36	1
For	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
through	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
him,	1
are	1
all	1
things:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
12:1	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
present	1
your	1
bodies	1
a	1
living	1
sacrifice,	1
holy,	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
reasonable	1
service.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
conformed	1
to	1
this	1
world:	1
but	1
be	1
ye	1
transformed	1
by	1
the	1
renewing	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prove	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
good,	1
and	1
acceptable,	1
and	1
perfect,	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:3	1
For	1
I	1
say,	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
himself	1
more	1
highly	1
than	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
think;	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
soberly,	1
according	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
dealt	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
12:4	1
For	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
members	1
in	1
one	1
body,	1
and	1
all	1
members	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
office:	1
12:5	1
So	1
we,	1
being	1
many,	1
are	1
one	1
body	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
members	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
12:6	1
Having	1
then	1
gifts	1
differing	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
us,	1
whether	1
prophecy,	1
let	1
us	1
prophesy	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
faith;	1
12:7	1
Or	1
ministry,	1
let	1
us	1
wait	1
on	1
our	1
ministering:	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
teacheth,	1
on	1
teaching;	1
12:8	1
Or	1
he	1
that	1
exhorteth,	1
on	1
exhortation:	1
he	1
that	1
giveth,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
simplicity;	1
he	1
that	1
ruleth,	1
with	1
diligence;	1
he	1
that	1
sheweth	1
mercy,	1
with	1
cheerfulness.	1
	1
12:9	1
Let	1
love	1
be	1
without	1
dissimulation.	1
Abhor	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil;	1
cleave	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
12:10	1
Be	1
kindly	1
affectioned	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
brotherly	1
love;	1
in	1
honour	1
preferring	1
one	1
another;	1
12:11	1
Not	1
slothful	1
in	1
business;	1
fervent	1
in	1
spirit;	1
serving	1
the	1
Lord;	1
12:12	1
Rejoicing	1
in	1
hope;	1
patient	1
in	1
tribulation;	1
continuing	1
instant	1
in	1
prayer;	1
12:13	1
Distributing	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
saints;	1
given	1
to	1
hospitality.	1
	1
12:14	1
Bless	1
them	1
which	1
persecute	1
you:	1
bless,	1
and	1
curse	1
not.	1
	1
12:15	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
weep	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
weep.	1
	1
12:16	1
Be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
one	1
toward	1
another.	1
Mind	1
not	1
high	1
things,	1
but	1
condescend	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
low	1
estate.	1
Be	1
not	1
wise	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
conceits.	1
	1
12:17	1
Recompense	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
evil	1
for	1
evil.	1
Provide	1
things	1
honest	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
12:18	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
possible,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
lieth	1
in	1
you,	1
live	1
peaceably	1
with	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
12:19	1
Dearly	1
beloved,	1
avenge	1
not	1
yourselves,	1
but	1
rather	1
give	1
place	1
unto	1
wrath:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Vengeance	1
is	1
mine;	1
I	1
will	1
repay,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:20	1
Therefore	1
if	1
thine	1
enemy	1
hunger,	1
feed	1
him;	1
if	1
he	1
thirst,	1
give	1
him	1
drink:	1
for	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
thou	1
shalt	1
heap	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
12:21	1
Be	1
not	1
overcome	1
of	1
evil,	1
but	1
overcome	1
evil	1
with	1
good.	1
	1
13:1	1
Let	1
every	1
soul	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
the	1
higher	1
powers.	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
but	1
of	1
God:	1
the	1
powers	1
that	1
be	1
are	1
ordained	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:2	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
resisteth	1
the	1
power,	1
resisteth	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
resist	1
shall	1
receive	1
to	1
themselves	1
damnation.	1
	1
13:3	1
For	1
rulers	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
terror	1
to	1
good	1
works,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
evil.	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
then	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
power?	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
same:	1
13:4	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
thee	1
for	1
good.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil,	1
be	1
afraid;	1
for	1
he	1
beareth	1
not	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
God,	1
a	1
revenger	1
to	1
execute	1
wrath	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil.	1
	1
13:5	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
subject,	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
wrath,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake.	1
	1
13:6	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
pay	1
ye	1
tribute	1
also:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
God's	1
ministers,	1
attending	1
continually	1
upon	1
this	1
very	1
thing.	1
	1
13:7	1
Render	1
therefore	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
dues:	1
tribute	1
to	1
whom	1
tribute	1
is	1
due;	1
custom	1
to	1
whom	1
custom;	1
fear	1
to	1
whom	1
fear;	1
honour	1
to	1
whom	1
honour.	1
	1
13:8	1
Owe	1
no	1
man	1
any	1
thing,	1
but	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
another	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
this,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet;	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
commandment,	1
it	1
is	1
briefly	1
comprehended	1
in	1
this	1
saying,	1
namely,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
13:10	1
Love	1
worketh	1
no	1
ill	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
therefore	1
love	1
is	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
that,	1
knowing	1
the	1
time,	1
that	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
awake	1
out	1
of	1
sleep:	1
for	1
now	1
is	1
our	1
salvation	1
nearer	1
than	1
when	1
we	1
believed.	1
	1
13:12	1
The	1
night	1
is	1
far	1
spent,	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
let	1
us	1
therefore	1
cast	1
off	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
13:13	1
Let	1
us	1
walk	1
honestly,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day;	1
not	1
in	1
rioting	1
and	1
drunkenness,	1
not	1
in	1
chambering	1
and	1
wantonness,	1
not	1
in	1
strife	1
and	1
envying.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
put	1
ye	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
make	1
not	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
flesh,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
lusts	1
thereof.	1
	1
14:1	1
Him	1
that	1
is	1
weak	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
receive	1
ye,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
doubtful	1
disputations.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
one	1
believeth	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat	1
all	1
things:	1
another,	1
who	1
is	1
weak,	1
eateth	1
herbs.	1
	1
14:3	1
Let	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
eateth	1
despise	1
him	1
that	1
eateth	1
not;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
him	1
which	1
eateth	1
not	1
judge	1
him	1
that	1
eateth:	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
received	1
him.	1
	1
14:4	1
Who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
another	1
man's	1
servant?	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
master	1
he	1
standeth	1
or	1
falleth.	1
Yea,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holden	1
up:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
stand.	1
	1
14:5	1
One	1
man	1
esteemeth	1
one	1
day	1
above	1
another:	1
another	1
esteemeth	1
every	1
day	1
alike.	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
14:6	1
He	1
that	1
regardeth	1
the	1
day,	1
regardeth	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
regardeth	1
not	1
the	1
day,	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
regard	1
it.	1
He	1
that	1
eateth,	1
eateth	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
he	1
giveth	1
God	1
thanks;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
not,	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
eateth	1
not,	1
and	1
giveth	1
God	1
thanks.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
liveth	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
dieth	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
14:8	1
For	1
whether	1
we	1
live,	1
we	1
live	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
whether	1
we	1
die,	1
we	1
die	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord:	1
whether	1
we	1
live	1
therefore,	1
or	1
die,	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
Lord's.	1
	1
14:9	1
For	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
Christ	1
both	1
died,	1
and	1
rose,	1
and	1
revived,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
Lord	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
living.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
judge	1
thy	1
brother?	1
or	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
thy	1
brother?	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
14:11	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
every	1
knee	1
shall	1
bow	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
every	1
tongue	1
shall	1
confess	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:12	1
So	1
then	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:13	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
therefore	1
judge	1
one	1
another	1
any	1
more:	1
but	1
judge	1
this	1
rather,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
put	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
or	1
an	1
occasion	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
his	1
brother's	1
way.	1
	1
14:14	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
am	1
persuaded	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
unclean	1
of	1
itself:	1
but	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
esteemeth	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
unclean,	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
14:15	1
But	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
grieved	1
with	1
thy	1
meat,	1
now	1
walkest	1
thou	1
not	1
charitably.	1
Destroy	1
not	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
meat,	1
for	1
whom	1
Christ	1
died.	1
	1
14:16	1
Let	1
not	1
then	1
your	1
good	1
be	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of:	1
14:17	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
meat	1
and	1
drink;	1
but	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
14:18	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
serveth	1
Christ	1
is	1
acceptable	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
approved	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
14:19	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
follow	1
after	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
make	1
for	1
peace,	1
and	1
things	1
wherewith	1
one	1
may	1
edify	1
another.	1
	1
14:20	1
For	1
meat	1
destroy	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God.	1
All	1
things	1
indeed	1
are	1
pure;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
evil	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
who	1
eateth	1
with	1
offence.	1
	1
14:21	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
neither	1
to	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
nor	1
to	1
drink	1
wine,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
whereby	1
thy	1
brother	1
stumbleth,	1
or	1
is	1
offended,	1
or	1
is	1
made	1
weak.	1
	1
14:22	1
Hast	1
thou	1
faith?	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
thyself	1
before	1
God.	1
Happy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth	1
not	1
himself	1
in	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
alloweth.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
doubteth	1
is	1
damned	1
if	1
he	1
eat,	1
because	1
he	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
faith:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
faith	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
15:1	1
We	1
then	1
that	1
are	1
strong	1
ought	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
infirmities	1
of	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
please	1
ourselves.	1
	1
15:2	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
please	1
his	1
neighbour	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
to	1
edification.	1
	1
15:3	1
For	1
even	1
Christ	1
pleased	1
not	1
himself;	1
but,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
reproaches	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
reproached	1
thee	1
fell	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
15:4	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
were	1
written	1
aforetime	1
were	1
written	1
for	1
our	1
learning,	1
that	1
we	1
through	1
patience	1
and	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
scriptures	1
might	1
have	1
hope.	1
	1
15:5	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
patience	1
and	1
consolation	1
grant	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
likeminded	1
one	1
toward	1
another	1
according	1
to	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
15:6	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
and	1
one	1
mouth	1
glorify	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:7	1
Wherefore	1
receive	1
ye	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
received	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:8	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
was	1
a	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
promises	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers:	1
15:9	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
glorify	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
mercy;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
to	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
sing	1
unto	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
saith,	1
Rejoice,	1
ye	1
Gentiles,	1
with	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
again,	1
Praise	1
the	1
Lord,	1
all	1
ye	1
Gentiles;	1
and	1
laud	1
him,	1
all	1
ye	1
people.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
again,	1
Esaias	1
saith,	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
root	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
rise	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
trust.	1
	1
15:13	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hope	1
fill	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
joy	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
believing,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
abound	1
in	1
hope,	1
through	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
I	1
myself	1
also	1
am	1
persuaded	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
goodness,	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
knowledge,	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
admonish	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
15:15	1
Nevertheless,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
the	1
more	1
boldly	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
some	1
sort,	1
as	1
putting	1
you	1
in	1
mind,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
God,	1
15:16	1
That	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
ministering	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
offering	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
be	1
acceptable,	1
being	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
15:17	1
I	1
have	1
therefore	1
whereof	1
I	1
may	1
glory	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
pertain	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
15:18	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Christ	1
hath	1
not	1
wrought	1
by	1
me,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
obedient,	1
by	1
word	1
and	1
deed,	1
15:19	1
Through	1
mighty	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God;	1
so	1
that	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
unto	1
Illyricum,	1
I	1
have	1
fully	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:20	1
Yea,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
strived	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
not	1
where	1
Christ	1
was	1
named,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
build	1
upon	1
another	1
man's	1
foundation:	1
15:21	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
To	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
spoken	1
of,	1
they	1
shall	1
see:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
shall	1
understand.	1
	1
15:22	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
hindered	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
now	1
having	1
no	1
more	1
place	1
in	1
these	1
parts,	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
great	1
desire	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you;	1
15:24	1
Whensoever	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
journey	1
into	1
Spain,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
journey,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
thitherward	1
by	1
you,	1
if	1
first	1
I	1
be	1
somewhat	1
filled	1
with	1
your	1
company.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
15:26	1
For	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
them	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
certain	1
contribution	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:27	1
It	1
hath	1
pleased	1
them	1
verily;	1
and	1
their	1
debtors	1
they	1
are.	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
their	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
their	1
duty	1
is	1
also	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
carnal	1
things.	1
	1
15:28	1
When	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
performed	1
this,	1
and	1
have	1
sealed	1
to	1
them	1
this	1
fruit,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
by	1
you	1
into	1
Spain.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:30	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
ye	1
strive	1
together	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
prayers	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
me;	1
15:31	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
Judaea;	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
service	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
Jerusalem	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
of	1
the	1
saints;	1
15:32	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
joy	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
may	1
with	1
you	1
be	1
refreshed.	1
	1
15:33	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:1	1
I	1
commend	1
unto	1
you	1
Phebe	1
our	1
sister,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Cenchrea:	1
16:2	1
That	1
ye	1
receive	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
becometh	1
saints,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
assist	1
her	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
business	1
she	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
you:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
a	1
succourer	1
of	1
many,	1
and	1
of	1
myself	1
also.	1
	1
16:3	1
Greet	1
Priscilla	1
and	1
Aquila	1
my	1
helpers	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
16:4	1
Who	1
have	1
for	1
my	1
life	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
own	1
necks:	1
unto	1
whom	1
not	1
only	1
I	1
give	1
thanks,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
16:5	1
Likewise	1
greet	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
Salute	1
my	1
well-beloved	1

who	1
is	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
Achaia	1
unto	1
Christ.	1
	1
16:6	1
Greet	1
Mary,	1
who	1
bestowed	1
much	1
labour	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
16:7	1
Salute	1
Andronicus	1
and	1
Junia,	1
my	1
kinsmen,	1
and	1
my	1
fellow-prisoners,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
note	1
among	1
the	1
apostles,	1
who	1
also	1
were	1
in	1
Christ	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
16:8	1
Greet	1
Amplias	1
my	1
beloved	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:9	1
Salute	1
Urbane,	1
our	1
helper	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
Stachys	1
my	1
beloved.	1
	1
16:10	1
Salute	1
Apelles	1
approved	1
in	1

Salute	1

which	1
are	1
of	1
Aristobulus'	1
household.	1
	1
16:11	1
Salute	1
Herodion	1

Greet	1

	1
16:12	1
Salute	1

Lord.	1
Salute	1

	1

	1
16:16	1
Salute	1

an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
The	1
churches	1
of	1
Christ	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
16:17	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
mark	1
them	1
which	1
cause	1
divisions	1
and	1
offences	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
learned;	1
and	1
avoid	1
them.	1
	1
16:18	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
such	1
serve	1
not	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
but	1
their	1
own	1
belly;	1
and	1
by	1
good	1
words	1
and	1
fair	1
speeches	1
deceive	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
simple.	1
	1
16:19	1
For	1
your	1
obedience	1
is	1
come	1
abroad	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
therefore	1
on	1
your	1
behalf:	1
but	1
yet	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
wise	1
unto	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
simple	1
concerning	1
evil.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
bruise	1
Satan	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
shortly.	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:21	1
Timotheus	1
my	1
workfellow,	1
and	1
Lucius,	1
and	1
Jason,	1
and	1
Sosipater,	1
my	1
kinsmen,	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
16:22	1
I	1
Tertius,	1
who	1
wrote	1
this	1
epistle,	1
salute	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:23	1
Gaius	1
mine	1
host,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
church,	1
saluteth	1
you.	1
Erastus	1
the	1
chamberlain	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
and	1
Quartus	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
16:24	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:25	1
Now	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
power	1
to	1
stablish	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel,	1
and	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
mystery,	1
which	1
was	1
kept	1
secret	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began,	1
16:26	1
But	1
now	1
is	1
made	1
manifest,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God,	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
nations	1
for	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
faith:	1
16:27	1
To	1
God	1
only	1
wise,	1
be	1
glory	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
through	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Sosthenes	1
our	1
brother,	1
1:2	1
Unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
saints,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord,	1
both	1
their's	1
and	1
our's:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
always	1
on	1
your	1
behalf,	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
you	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:5	1
That	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
ye	1
are	1
enriched	1
by	1
him,	1
in	1
all	1
utterance,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
knowledge;	1
1:6	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Christ	1
was	1
confirmed	1
in	1
you:	1
1:7	1
So	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
behind	1
in	1
no	1
gift;	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:8	1
Who	1
shall	1
also	1
confirm	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blameless	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
God	1
is	1
faithful,	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
were	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:10	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
speak	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
divisions	1
among	1
you;	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
perfectly	1
joined	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
judgment.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
declared	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
by	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Chloe,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
contentions	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
1:12	1
Now	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Paul;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Apollos;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Cephas;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
Is	1
Christ	1
divided?	1
was	1
Paul	1
crucified	1
for	1
you?	1
or	1
were	1
ye	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Paul?	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
baptized	1
none	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
Crispus	1
and	1
Gaius;	1
1:15	1
Lest	1
any	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
baptized	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
name.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
I	1
baptized	1
also	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
Stephanas:	1
besides,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
I	1
baptized	1
any	1
other.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
Christ	1
sent	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
baptize,	1
but	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel:	1
not	1
with	1
wisdom	1
of	1
words,	1
lest	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
perish	1
foolishness;	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
which	1
are	1
saved	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
nothing	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
prudent.	1
	1
1:20	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
wise?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
scribe?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
disputer	1
of	1
this	1
world?	1
hath	1
not	1
God	1
made	1
foolish	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world?	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
after	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
wisdom	1
knew	1
not	1
God,	1
it	1
pleased	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
preaching	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
1:22	1
For	1
the	1
Jews	1
require	1
a	1
sign,	1
and	1
the	1
Greeks	1
seek	1
after	1
wisdom:	1
1:23	1
But	1
we	1
preach	1
Christ	1
crucified,	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
stumblingblock,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Greeks	1
foolishness;	1
1:24	1
But	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
called,	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks,	1
Christ	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:25	1
Because	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
wiser	1
than	1
men;	1
and	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
men.	1
	1
1:26	1
For	1
ye	1
see	1
your	1
calling,	1
brethren,	1
how	1
that	1
not	1
many	1
wise	1
men	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
not	1
many	1
mighty,	1
not	1
many	1
noble,	1
are	1
called:	1
1:27	1
But	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
the	1
foolish	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
wise;	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
the	1
weak	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
mighty;	1
1:28	1
And	1
base	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
despised,	1
hath	1
God	1
chosen,	1
yea,	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not,	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
nought	1
things	1
that	1
are:	1
1:29	1
That	1
no	1
flesh	1
should	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
1:30	1
But	1
of	1
him	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
made	1
unto	1
us	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
sanctification,	1
and	1
redemption:	1
1:31	1
That,	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
that	1
glorieth,	1
let	1
him	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
you,	1
came	1
not	1
with	1
excellency	1
of	1
speech	1
or	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
declaring	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
I	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
any	1
thing	1
among	1
you,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
him	1
crucified.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
weakness,	1
and	1
in	1
fear,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
my	1
speech	1
and	1
my	1
preaching	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
enticing	1
words	1
of	1
man's	1
wisdom,	1
but	1
in	1
demonstration	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
of	1
power:	1
2:5	1
That	1
your	1
faith	1
should	1
not	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:6	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
speak	1
wisdom	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
perfect:	1
yet	1
not	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
nought:	1
2:7	1
But	1
we	1
speak	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
mystery,	1
even	1
the	1
hidden	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
God	1
ordained	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
unto	1
our	1
glory:	1
2:8	1
Which	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
knew:	1
for	1
had	1
they	1
known	1
it,	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
crucified	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
glory.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Eye	1
hath	1
not	1
seen,	1
nor	1
ear	1
heard,	1
neither	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man,	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him.	1
	1
2:10	1
But	1
God	1
hath	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit:	1
for	1
the	1
Spirit	1
searcheth	1
all	1
things,	1
yea,	1
the	1
deep	1
things	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
what	1
man	1
knoweth	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
save	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
him?	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
Now	1
we	1
have	1
received,	1
not	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
freely	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:13	1
Which	1
things	1
also	1
we	1
speak,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
man's	1
wisdom	1
teacheth,	1
but	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
teacheth;	1
comparing	1
spiritual	1
things	1
with	1
spiritual.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
the	1
natural	1
man	1
receiveth	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
foolishness	1
unto	1
him:	1
neither	1
can	1
he	1
know	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
spiritually	1
discerned.	1
	1
2:15	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
spiritual	1
judgeth	1
all	1
things,	1
yet	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
judged	1
of	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
known	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
instruct	1
him?	1
	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
unto	1
spiritual,	1
but	1
as	1
unto	1
carnal,	1
even	1
as	1
unto	1
babes	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:2	1
I	1
have	1
fed	1
you	1
with	1
milk,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
meat:	1
for	1
hitherto	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it,	1
neither	1
yet	1
now	1
are	1
ye	1
able.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
yet	1
carnal:	1
for	1
whereas	1
there	1
is	1
among	1
you	1
envying,	1
and	1
strife,	1
and	1
divisions,	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
carnal,	1
and	1
walk	1
as	1
men?	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
while	1
one	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Paul;	1
and	1
another,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Apollos;	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
carnal?	1
	1
3:5	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
Paul,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
Apollos,	1
but	1
ministers	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
believed,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
gave	1
to	1
every	1
man?	1
	1
3:6	1
I	1
have	1
planted,	1
Apollos	1
watered;	1
but	1
God	1
gave	1
the	1
increase.	1
	1
3:7	1
So	1
then	1
neither	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
planteth	1
any	1
thing,	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
watereth;	1
but	1
God	1
that	1
giveth	1
the	1
increase.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
planteth	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
watereth	1
are	1
one:	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
receive	1
his	1
own	1
reward	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
labour.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
labourers	1
together	1
with	1
God:	1
ye	1
are	1
God's	1
husbandry,	1
ye	1
are	1
God's	1
building.	1
	1
3:10	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
a	1
wise	1
masterbuilder,	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation,	1
and	1
another	1
buildeth	1
thereon.	1
But	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
take	1
heed	1
how	1
he	1
buildeth	1
thereupon.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
other	1
foundation	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
lay	1
than	1
that	1
is	1
laid,	1
which	1
is	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
build	1
upon	1
this	1
foundation	1
gold,	1
silver,	1
precious	1
stones,	1
wood,	1
hay,	1
stubble;	1
3:13	1
Every	1
man's	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
manifest:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
shall	1
declare	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
by	1
fire;	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
try	1
every	1
man's	1
work	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
3:14	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
work	1
abide	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
built	1
thereupon,	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
reward.	1
	1
3:15	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
burned,	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
loss:	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
saved;	1
yet	1
so	1
as	1
by	1
fire.	1
	1
3:16	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
you?	1
	1
3:17	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
defile	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
him	1
shall	1
God	1
destroy;	1
for	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
holy,	1
which	1
temple	1
ye	1
are.	1
	1
3:18	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
himself.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
let	1
him	1
become	1
a	1
fool,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
wise.	1
	1
3:19	1
For	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
foolishness	1
with	1
God.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
taketh	1
the	1
wise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
craftiness.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
again,	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
vain.	1
	1
3:21	1
Therefore	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
men.	1
For	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
your's;	1
3:22	1
Whether	1
Paul,	1
or	1
Apollos,	1
or	1
Cephas,	1
or	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
life,	1
or	1
death,	1
or	1
things	1
present,	1
or	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
all	1
are	1
your's;	1
3:23	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
Christ's;	1
and	1
Christ	1
is	1
God's.	1
	1
4:1	1
Let	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
account	1
of	1
us,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
stewards	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:2	1
Moreover	1
it	1
is	1
required	1
in	1
stewards,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
found	1
faithful.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
with	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
you,	1
or	1
of	1
man's	1
judgment:	1
yea,	1
I	1
judge	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
self.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
by	1
myself;	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
hereby	1
justified:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
judgeth	1
me	1
is	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:5	1
Therefore	1
judge	1
nothing	1
before	1
the	1
time,	1
until	1
the	1
Lord	1
come,	1
who	1
both	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
hidden	1
things	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
manifest	1
the	1
counsels	1
of	1
the	1
hearts:	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
every	1
man	1
have	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
these	1
things,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
a	1
figure	1
transferred	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
to	1
Apollos	1
for	1
your	1
sakes;	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
learn	1
in	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
men	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
written,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
puffed	1
up	1
for	1
one	1
against	1
another.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
who	1
maketh	1
thee	1
to	1
differ	1
from	1
another?	1
and	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
receive?	1
now	1
if	1
thou	1
didst	1
receive	1
it,	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
glory,	1
as	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
not	1
received	1
it?	1
	1
4:8	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
full,	1
now	1
ye	1
are	1
rich,	1
ye	1
have	1
reigned	1
as	1
kings	1
without	1
us:	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
ye	1
did	1
reign,	1
that	1
we	1
also	1
might	1
reign	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:9	1
For	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
forth	1
us	1
the	1
apostles	1
last,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
appointed	1
to	1
death:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
a	1
spectacle	1
unto	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
to	1
angels,	1
and	1
to	1
men.	1
	1
4:10	1
We	1
are	1
fools	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
wise	1
in	1
Christ;	1
we	1
are	1
weak,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
strong;	1
ye	1
are	1
honourable,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
despised.	1
	1
4:11	1
Even	1
unto	1
this	1
present	1
hour	1
we	1
both	1
hunger,	1
and	1
thirst,	1
and	1
are	1
naked,	1
and	1
are	1
buffeted,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
certain	1
dwellingplace;	1
4:12	1
And	1
labour,	1
working	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands:	1
being	1
reviled,	1
we	1
bless;	1
being	1
persecuted,	1
we	1
suffer	1
it:	1
4:13	1
Being	1
defamed,	1
we	1
intreat:	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
as	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
are	1
the	1
offscouring	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:14	1
I	1
write	1
not	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
shame	1
you,	1
but	1
as	1
my	1
beloved	1
sons	1
I	1
warn	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
though	1
ye	1
have	1
ten	1
thousand	1
instructers	1
in	1
Christ,	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
many	1
fathers:	1
for	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
I	1
have	1
begotten	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
4:16	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
be	1
ye	1
followers	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
Timotheus,	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
son,	1
and	1
faithful	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
shall	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
remembrance	1
of	1
my	1
ways	1
which	1
be	1
in	1
Christ,	1
as	1
I	1
teach	1
every	1
where	1
in	1
every	1
church.	1
	1
4:18	1
Now	1
some	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
shortly,	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
will,	1
and	1
will	1
know,	1
not	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
but	1
the	1
power.	1
	1
4:20	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
word,	1
but	1
in	1
power.	1
	1
4:21	1
What	1
will	1
ye?	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
rod,	1
or	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
meekness?	1
	1
5:1	1
It	1
is	1
reported	1
commonly	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
fornication	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
such	1
fornication	1
as	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
named	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
one	1
should	1
have	1
his	1
father's	1
wife.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
rather	1
mourned,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
deed	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
I	1
verily,	1
as	1
absent	1
in	1
body,	1
but	1
present	1
in	1
spirit,	1
have	1
judged	1
already,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
present,	1
concerning	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
so	1
done	1
this	1
deed,	1
5:4	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
my	1
spirit,	1
with	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
5:5	1
To	1
deliver	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
unto	1
Satan	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
may	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
5:6	1
Your	1
glorying	1
is	1
not	1
good.	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
leaven	1
leaveneth	1
the	1
whole	1
lump?	1
	1
5:7	1
Purge	1
out	1
therefore	1
the	1
old	1
leaven,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
lump,	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
unleavened.	1
For	1
even	1
Christ	1
our	1
passover	1
is	1
sacrificed	1
for	1
us:	1
5:8	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
keep	1
the	1
feast,	1
not	1
with	1
old	1
leaven,	1
neither	1
with	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
malice	1
and	1
wickedness;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
of	1
sincerity	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
5:9	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
an	1
epistle	1
not	1
to	1
company	1
with	1
fornicators:	1
5:10	1
Yet	1
not	1
altogether	1
with	1
the	1
fornicators	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
covetous,	1
or	1
extortioners,	1
or	1
with	1
idolaters;	1
for	1
then	1
must	1
ye	1
needs	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
company,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
brother	1
be	1
a	1
fornicator,	1
or	1
covetous,	1
or	1
an	1
idolater,	1
or	1
a	1
railer,	1
or	1
a	1
drunkard,	1
or	1
an	1
extortioner;	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
no	1
not	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
judge	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
without?	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
judge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
within?	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
God	1
judgeth.	1
Therefore	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
yourselves	1
that	1
wicked	1
person.	1
	1
6:1	1
Dare	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
a	1
matter	1
against	1
another,	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
before	1
the	1
unjust,	1
and	1
not	1
before	1
the	1
saints?	1
	1
6:2	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
saints	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
world?	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
you,	1
are	1
ye	1
unworthy	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
smallest	1
matters?	1
	1
6:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
judge	1
angels?	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
things	1
that	1
pertain	1
to	1
this	1
life?	1
6:4	1
If	1
then	1
ye	1
have	1
judgments	1
of	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
this	1
life,	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
judge	1
who	1
are	1
least	1
esteemed	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
6:5	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
your	1
shame.	1
Is	1
it	1
so,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
among	1
you?	1
no,	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
judge	1
between	1
his	1
brethren?	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
brother	1
goeth	1
to	1
law	1
with	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
unbelievers.	1
	1
6:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
there	1
is	1
utterly	1
a	1
fault	1
among	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
one	1
with	1
another.	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
rather	1
take	1
wrong?	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
rather	1
suffer	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
defrauded?	1
	1
6:8	1
Nay,	1
ye	1
do	1
wrong,	1
and	1
defraud,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
brethren.	1
	1
6:9	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
shall	1
not	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
neither	1
fornicators,	1
nor	1
idolaters,	1
nor	1
adulterers,	1
nor	1
effeminate,	1
nor	1
abusers	1
of	1
themselves	1
with	1
mankind,	1
6:10	1
Nor	1
thieves,	1
nor	1
covetous,	1
nor	1
drunkards,	1
nor	1
revilers,	1
nor	1
extortioners,	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
such	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
you:	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
washed,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
sanctified,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
justified	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
expedient:	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
under	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
any.	1
	1
6:13	1
Meats	1
for	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
the	1
belly	1
for	1
meats:	1
but	1
God	1
shall	1
destroy	1
both	1
it	1
and	1
them.	1
Now	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
fornication,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
God	1
hath	1
both	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
will	1
also	1
raise	1
up	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
power.	1
	1
6:15	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
your	1
bodies	1
are	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Christ?	1
shall	1
I	1
then	1
take	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
an	1
harlot?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
6:16	1
What?	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
an	1
harlot	1
is	1
one	1
body?	1
	1
for	1
two,	1
saith	1
he,	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
joined	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
one	1
spirit.	1
	1
6:18	1
Flee	1
fornication.	1
Every	1
sin	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
doeth	1
is	1
without	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
committeth	1
fornication	1
sinneth	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
6:19	1
What?	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
your	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
own?	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
bought	1
with	1
a	1
price:	1
therefore	1
glorify	1
God	1
in	1
your	1
body,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
spirit,	1
which	1
are	1
God's.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
wrote	1
unto	1
me:	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
a	1
woman.	1
	1
7:2	1
Nevertheless,	1
to	1
avoid	1
fornication,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
wife,	1
and	1
let	1
every	1
woman	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
husband.	1
	1
7:3	1
Let	1
the	1
husband	1
render	1
unto	1
the	1
wife	1
due	1
benevolence:	1
and	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
wife	1
unto	1
the	1
husband.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
wife	1
hath	1
not	1
power	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
husband:	1
and	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
husband	1
hath	1
not	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
wife.	1
	1
7:5	1
Defraud	1
ye	1
not	1
one	1
the	1
other,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
consent	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
give	1
yourselves	1
to	1
fasting	1
and	1
prayer;	1
and	1
come	1
together	1
again,	1
that	1
Satan	1
tempt	1
you	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
incontinency.	1
	1
7:6	1
But	1
I	1
speak	1
this	1
by	1
permission,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
commandment.	1
	1
7:7	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
were	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
myself.	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
his	1
proper	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
one	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
and	1
another	1
after	1
that.	1
	1
7:8	1
I	1
say	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
unmarried	1
and	1
widows,	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
abide	1
even	1
as	1
I.	1
	1
7:9	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
cannot	1
contain,	1
let	1
them	1
marry:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
marry	1
than	1
to	1
burn.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
married	1
I	1
command,	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
wife	1
depart	1
from	1
her	1
husband:	1
7:11	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
depart,	1
let	1
her	1
remain	1
unmarried	1
or	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
her	1
husband:	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
husband	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
speak	1
I,	1
not	1
the	1
Lord:	1
If	1
any	1
brother	1
hath	1
a	1
wife	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
him,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
put	1
her	1
away.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
her,	1
let	1
her	1
not	1
leave	1
him.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
husband	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
wife	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
husband:	1
else	1
were	1
your	1
children	1
unclean;	1
but	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
holy.	1
	1
7:15	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
depart,	1
let	1
him	1
depart.	1
A	1
brother	1
or	1
a	1
sister	1
is	1
not	1
under	1
bondage	1
in	1
such	1
cases:	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
peace.	1
	1
7:16	1
For	1
what	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
O	1
wife,	1
whether	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
thy	1
husband?	1
	1
or	1
how	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
O	1
man,	1
whether	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
thy	1
wife?	1
	1
7:17	1
But	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
distributed	1
to	1
every	1
man,	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
called	1
every	1
one,	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
walk.	1
And	1
so	1
ordain	1
I	1
in	1
all	1
churches.	1
	1
7:18	1
Is	1
any	1
man	1
called	1
being	1
circumcised?	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
become	1
uncircumcised.	1
Is	1
any	1
called	1
in	1
uncircumcision?	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
circumcised.	1
	1
7:19	1
Circumcision	1
is	1
nothing,	1
and	1
uncircumcision	1
is	1
nothing,	1
but	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:20	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
calling	1
wherein	1
he	1
was	1
called.	1
	1
7:21	1
Art	1
thou	1
called	1
being	1
a	1
servant?	1
care	1
not	1
for	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
made	1
free,	1
use	1
it	1
rather.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
being	1
a	1
servant,	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's	1
freeman:	1
likewise	1
also	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called,	1
being	1
free,	1
is	1
Christ's	1
servant.	1
	1
7:23	1
Ye	1
are	1
bought	1
with	1
a	1
price;	1
be	1
not	1
ye	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
7:24	1
Brethren,	1
let	1
every	1
man,	1
wherein	1
he	1
is	1
called,	1
therein	1
abide	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
7:25	1
Now	1
concerning	1
virgins	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
judgment,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
obtained	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
be	1
faithful.	1
	1
7:26	1
I	1
suppose	1
therefore	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
distress,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
7:27	1
Art	1
thou	1
bound	1
unto	1
a	1
wife?	1
seek	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
loosed.	1
Art	1
thou	1
loosed	1
from	1
a	1
wife?	1
seek	1
not	1
a	1
wife.	1
	1
7:28	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
marry,	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
sinned;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
virgin	1
marry,	1
she	1
hath	1
not	1
sinned.	1
Nevertheless	1
such	1
shall	1
have	1
trouble	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
but	1
I	1
spare	1
you.	1
	1
7:29	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
brethren,	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
short:	1
it	1
remaineth,	1
that	1
both	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
wives	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
none;	1
7:30	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
weep,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
wept	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
rejoice,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
buy,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
possessed	1
not;	1
7:31	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
use	1
this	1
world,	1
as	1
not	1
abusing	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
passeth	1
away.	1
	1
7:32	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
without	1
carefulness.	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unmarried	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
the	1
Lord:	1
7:33	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
7:34	1
There	1
is	1
difference	1
also	1
between	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
a	1
virgin.	1
The	1
unmarried	1
woman	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
holy	1
both	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
in	1
spirit:	1
but	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
how	1
she	1
may	1
please	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
7:35	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
speak	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
profit;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cast	1
a	1
snare	1
upon	1
you,	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
comely,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
attend	1
upon	1
the	1
Lord	1
without	1
distraction.	1
	1
7:36	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
behaveth	1
himself	1
uncomely	1
toward	1
his	1
virgin,	1
if	1
she	1
pass	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
her	1
age,	1
and	1
need	1
so	1
require,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
will,	1
he	1
sinneth	1
not:	1
let	1
them	1
marry.	1
	1
7:37	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
that	1
standeth	1
stedfast	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
having	1
no	1
necessity,	1
but	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
will,	1
and	1
hath	1
so	1
decreed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
his	1
virgin,	1
doeth	1
well.	1
	1
7:38	1
So	1
then	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
her	1
in	1
marriage	1
doeth	1
well;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
her	1
not	1
in	1
marriage	1
doeth	1
better.	1
	1
7:39	1
The	1
wife	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
liveth;	1
but	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
will;	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
7:40	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
happier	1
if	1
she	1
so	1
abide,	1
after	1
my	1
judgment:	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
also	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:1	1
Now	1
as	1
touching	1
things	1
offered	1
unto	1
idols,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
knowledge.	1
Knowledge	1
puffeth	1
up,	1
but	1
charity	1
edifieth.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
knoweth	1
any	1
thing,	1
he	1
knoweth	1
nothing	1
yet	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
know.	1
	1
8:3	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
God,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
known	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:4	1
As	1
concerning	1
therefore	1
the	1
eating	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
idols,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
an	1
idol	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
God	1
but	1
one.	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
though	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
are	1
called	1
gods,	1
whether	1
in	1
heaven	1
or	1
in	1
earth,	1
(as	1
there	1
be	1
gods	1
many,	1
and	1
lords	1
many,)	1
8:6	1
But	1
to	1
us	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
God,	1
the	1
Father,	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
we	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
one	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
we	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
8:7	1
Howbeit	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
knowledge:	1
for	1
some	1
with	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
idol	1
unto	1
this	1
hour	1
eat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
offered	1
unto	1
an	1
idol;	1
and	1
their	1
conscience	1
being	1
weak	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
8:8	1
But	1
meat	1
commendeth	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
God:	1
for	1
neither,	1
if	1
we	1
eat,	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
better;	1
neither,	1
if	1
we	1
eat	1
not,	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
worse.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
this	1
liberty	1
of	1
your's	1
become	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
weak.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
see	1
thee	1
which	1
hast	1
knowledge	1
sit	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
idol's	1
temple,	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
weak	1
be	1
emboldened	1
to	1
eat	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
offered	1
to	1
idols;	1
8:11	1
And	1
through	1
thy	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
the	1
weak	1
brother	1
perish,	1
for	1
whom	1
Christ	1
died?	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
sin	1
so	1
against	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
wound	1
their	1
weak	1
conscience,	1
ye	1
sin	1
against	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:13	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
meat	1
make	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
offend,	1
I	1
will	1
eat	1
no	1
flesh	1
while	1
the	1
world	1
standeth,	1
lest	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
offend.	1
	1
9:1	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
an	1
apostle?	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
free?	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
seen	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord?	1
are	1
not	1
ye	1
my	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
9:2	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
an	1
apostle	1
unto	1
others,	1
yet	1
doubtless	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
mine	1
apostleship	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:3	1
Mine	1
answer	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
examine	1
me	1
is	1
this,	1
9:4	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink?	1
	1
9:5	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
lead	1
about	1
a	1
sister,	1
a	1
wife,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
other	1
apostles,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
Cephas?	1
	1
9:6	1
Or	1
I	1
only	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
have	1
not	1
we	1
power	1
to	1
forbear	1
working?	1
	1
9:7	1
Who	1
goeth	1
a	1
warfare	1
any	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
charges?	1
who	1
planteth	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof?	1
or	1
who	1
feedeth	1
a	1
flock,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
flock?	1
	1
9:8	1
Say	1
I	1
these	1
things	1
as	1
a	1
man?	1
or	1
saith	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
the	1
same	1
also?	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ox	1
that	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
Doth	1
God	1
take	1
care	1
for	1
oxen?	1
	1
9:10	1
Or	1
saith	1
he	1
it	1
altogether	1
for	1
our	1
sakes?	1
For	1
our	1
sakes,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
this	1
is	1
written:	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
ploweth	1
should	1
plow	1
in	1
hope;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
thresheth	1
in	1
hope	1
should	1
be	1
partaker	1
of	1
his	1
hope.	1
	1
9:11	1
If	1
we	1
have	1
sown	1
unto	1
you	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
thing	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
reap	1
your	1
carnal	1
things?	1
	1
9:12	1
If	1
others	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
this	1
power	1
over	1
you,	1
are	1
not	1
we	1
rather?	1
	1
Nevertheless	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
used	1
this	1
power;	1
but	1
suffer	1
all	1
things,	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
hinder	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
9:13	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
minister	1
about	1
holy	1
things	1
live	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
temple?	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
wait	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
are	1
partakers	1
with	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
9:14	1
Even	1
so	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
ordained	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
should	1
live	1
of	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
used	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
done	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die,	1
than	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
make	1
my	1
glorying	1
void.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
glory	1
of:	1
for	1
necessity	1
is	1
laid	1
upon	1
me;	1
yea,	1
woe	1
is	1
unto	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
preach	1
not	1
the	1
gospel!	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
willingly,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
reward:	1
but	1
if	1
against	1
my	1
will,	1
a	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
committed	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:18	1
What	1
is	1
my	1
reward	1
then?	1
Verily	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ	1
without	1
charge,	1
that	1
I	1
abuse	1
not	1
my	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
men,	1
yet	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
myself	1
servant	1
unto	1
all,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
I	1
became	1
as	1
a	1
Jew,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
Jews;	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law;	1
9:21	1
To	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
law,	1
as	1
without	1
law,	1
(being	1
not	1
without	1
law	1
to	1
God,	1
but	1
under	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
Christ,)	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
law.	1
	1
9:22	1
To	1
the	1
weak	1
became	1
I	1
as	1
weak,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
weak:	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
save	1
some.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
gospel's	1
sake,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
partaker	1
thereof	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
9:24	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
run	1
in	1
a	1
race	1
run	1
all,	1
but	1
one	1
receiveth	1
the	1
prize?	1
So	1
run,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
obtain.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
striveth	1
for	1
the	1
mastery	1
is	1
temperate	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
Now	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
corruptible	1
crown;	1
but	1
we	1
an	1
incorruptible.	1
	1
9:26	1
I	1
therefore	1
so	1
run,	1
not	1
as	1
uncertainly;	1
so	1
fight	1
I,	1
not	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
beateth	1
the	1
air:	1
9:27	1
But	1
I	1
keep	1
under	1
my	1
body,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
into	1
subjection:	1
lest	1
that	1
by	1
any	1
means,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
to	1
others,	1
I	1
myself	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
castaway.	1
	1
10:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
how	1
that	1
all	1
our	1
fathers	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
all	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
sea;	1
10:2	1
And	1
were	1
all	1
baptized	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
10:3	1
And	1
did	1
all	1
eat	1
the	1
same	1
spiritual	1
meat;	1
10:4	1
And	1
did	1
all	1
drink	1
the	1
same	1
spiritual	1
drink:	1
for	1
they	1
drank	1
of	1
that	1
spiritual	1
Rock	1
that	1
followed	1
them:	1
and	1
that	1
Rock	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
10:5	1
But	1
with	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
God	1
was	1
not	1
well	1
pleased:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
overthrown	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
10:6	1
Now	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
our	1
examples,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
lust	1
after	1
evil	1
things,	1
as	1
they	1
also	1
lusted.	1
	1
10:7	1
Neither	1
be	1
ye	1
idolaters,	1
as	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
them;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
people	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
play.	1
	1
10:8	1
Neither	1
let	1
us	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
committed,	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
three	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand.	1
	1
10:9	1
Neither	1
let	1
us	1
tempt	1
Christ,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
tempted,	1
and	1
were	1
destroyed	1
of	1
serpents.	1
	1
10:10	1
Neither	1
murmur	1
ye,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
murmured,	1
and	1
were	1
destroyed	1
of	1
the	1
destroyer.	1
	1
10:11	1
Now	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
ensamples:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
for	1
our	1
admonition,	1
upon	1
whom	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
come.	1
	1
10:12	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
thinketh	1
he	1
standeth	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
he	1
fall.	1
	1
10:13	1
There	1
hath	1
no	1
temptation	1
taken	1
you	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
common	1
to	1
man:	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
faithful,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
tempted	1
above	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
able;	1
but	1
will	1
with	1
the	1
temptation	1
also	1
make	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
escape,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it.	1
	1
10:14	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
flee	1
from	1
idolatry.	1
	1
10:15	1
I	1
speak	1
as	1
to	1
wise	1
men;	1
judge	1
ye	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
	1
10:16	1
The	1
cup	1
of	1
blessing	1
which	1
we	1
bless,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ?	1
The	1
bread	1
which	1
we	1
break,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ?	1
	1
10:17	1
For	1
we	1
being	1
many	1
are	1
one	1
bread,	1
and	1
one	1
body:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
partakers	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
bread.	1
	1
10:18	1
Behold	1
Israel	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
are	1
not	1
they	1
which	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
10:19	1
What	1
say	1
I	1
then?	1
that	1
the	1
idol	1
is	1
any	1
thing,	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
idols	1
is	1
any	1
thing?	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
sacrifice,	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
devils,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
God:	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
devils.	1
	1
10:21	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
drink	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
devils:	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
Lord's	1
table,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
devils.	1
	1
10:22	1
Do	1
we	1
provoke	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
jealousy?	1
are	1
we	1
stronger	1
than	1
he?	1
10:23	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
expedient:	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
edify	1
not.	1
	1
10:24	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
seek	1
his	1
own,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
another's	1
wealth.	1
	1
10:25	1
Whatsoever	1
is	1
sold	1
in	1
the	1
shambles,	1
that	1
eat,	1
asking	1
no	1
question	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake:	1
10:26	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof.	1
	1
10:27	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not	1
bid	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
ye	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
go;	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
you,	1
eat,	1
asking	1
no	1
question	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake.	1
	1
10:28	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
is	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
idols,	1
eat	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
that	1
shewed	1
it,	1
and	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake:	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof:	1
10:29	1
Conscience,	1
I	1
say,	1
not	1
thine	1
own,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
other:	1
for	1
why	1
is	1
my	1
liberty	1
judged	1
of	1
another	1
man's	1
conscience?	1
	1
10:30	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
grace	1
be	1
a	1
partaker,	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
thanks?	1
	1
10:31	1
Whether	1
therefore	1
ye	1
eat,	1
or	1
drink,	1
or	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do,	1
do	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
Give	1
none	1
offence,	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God:	1
10:33	1
Even	1
as	1
I	1
please	1
all	1
men	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
not	1
seeking	1
mine	1
own	1
profit,	1
but	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
many,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
11:1	1
Be	1
ye	1
followers	1
of	1
me,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:2	1
Now	1
I	1
praise	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
remember	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
ordinances,	1
as	1
I	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
11:3	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
Christ;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
11:4	1
Every	1
man	1
praying	1
or	1
prophesying,	1
having	1
his	1
head	1
covered,	1
dishonoureth	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
11:5	1
But	1
every	1
woman	1
that	1
prayeth	1
or	1
prophesieth	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
uncovered	1
dishonoureth	1
her	1
head:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
even	1
all	1
one	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
shaven.	1
	1
11:6	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
be	1
not	1
covered,	1
let	1
her	1
also	1
be	1
shorn:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
be	1
shorn	1
or	1
shaven,	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
covered.	1
	1
11:7	1
For	1
a	1
man	1
indeed	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
head,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:8	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
woman:	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:9	1
Neither	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
created	1
for	1
the	1
woman;	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
for	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
ought	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
angels.	1
	1
11:11	1
Nevertheless	1
neither	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
without	1
the	1
woman,	1
neither	1
the	1
woman	1
without	1
the	1
man,	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:12	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
even	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
woman;	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:13	1
Judge	1
in	1
yourselves:	1
is	1
it	1
comely	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
pray	1
unto	1
God	1
uncovered?	1
	1
11:14	1
Doth	1
not	1
even	1
nature	1
itself	1
teach	1
you,	1
that,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
long	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
11:15	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
have	1
long	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
glory	1
to	1
her:	1
for	1
her	1
hair	1
is	1
given	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
covering.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
contentious,	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
such	1
custom,	1
neither	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:17	1
Now	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
not,	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
better,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
	1
11:18	1
For	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
divisions	1
among	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
partly	1
believe	1
it.	1
	1
11:19	1
For	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
also	1
heresies	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
approved	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
11:20	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
therefore	1
into	1
one	1
place,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
Lord's	1
supper.	1
	1
11:21	1
For	1
in	1
eating	1
every	1
one	1
taketh	1
before	1
other	1
his	1
own	1
supper:	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
another	1
is	1
drunken.	1
	1
11:22	1
What?	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
houses	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink	1
in?	1
or	1
despise	1
ye	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
shame	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
not?	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you?	1
shall	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
in	1
this?	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
not.	1
	1
11:23	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
which	1
also	1
I	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
betrayed	1
took	1
bread:	1
11:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body,	1
which	1
is	1
broken	1
for	1
you:	1
this	1
do	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
11:25	1
After	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
also	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
supped,	1
saying,	1
This	1
cup	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
in	1
my	1
blood:	1
this	1
do	1
ye,	1
as	1
oft	1
as	1
ye	1
drink	1
it,	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
11:26	1
For	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
ye	1
eat	1
this	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
this	1
cup,	1
ye	1
do	1
shew	1
the	1
Lord's	1
death	1
till	1
he	1
come.	1
	1
11:27	1
Wherefore	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
eat	1
this	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
this	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
unworthily,	1
shall	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:28	1
But	1
let	1
a	1
man	1
examine	1
himself,	1
and	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
of	1
that	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
that	1
cup.	1
	1
11:29	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
unworthily,	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
damnation	1
to	1
himself,	1
not	1
discerning	1
the	1
Lord's	1
body.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
many	1
are	1
weak	1
and	1
sickly	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
many	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:31	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
would	1
judge	1
ourselves,	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
judged.	1
	1
11:32	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
judged,	1
we	1
are	1
chastened	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
condemned	1
with	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
11:33	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
to	1
eat,	1
tarry	1
one	1
for	1
another.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hunger,	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
at	1
home;	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
not	1
together	1
unto	1
condemnation.	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
will	1
I	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant.	1
	1
12:2	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
Gentiles,	1
carried	1
away	1
unto	1
these	1
dumb	1
idols,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
were	1
led.	1
	1
12:3	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
speaking	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
calleth	1
Jesus	1
accursed:	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
12:4	1
Now	1
there	1
are	1
diversities	1
of	1
gifts,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
differences	1
of	1
administrations,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
diversities	1
of	1
operations,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
God	1
which	1
worketh	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
profit	1
withal.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
to	1
one	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
wisdom;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
knowledge	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
12:9	1
To	1
another	1
faith	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
12:10	1
To	1
another	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
miracles;	1
to	1
another	1
prophecy;	1
to	1
another	1
discerning	1
of	1
spirits;	1
to	1
another	1
divers	1
kinds	1
of	1
tongues;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
tongues:	1
12:11	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
worketh	1
that	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
selfsame	1
Spirit,	1
dividing	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
severally	1
as	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
12:12	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
hath	1
many	1
members,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
body,	1
being	1
many,	1
are	1
one	1
body:	1
so	1
also	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
12:13	1
For	1
by	1
one	1
Spirit	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
baptized	1
into	1
one	1
body,	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
Jews	1
or	1
Gentiles,	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
bond	1
or	1
free;	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
made	1
to	1
drink	1
into	1
one	1
Spirit.	1
	1
12:14	1
For	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
member,	1
but	1
many.	1
	1
12:15	1
If	1
the	1
foot	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
hand,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
is	1
it	1
therefore	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
ear	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
eye,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
is	1
it	1
therefore	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:17	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
were	1
an	1
eye,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
hearing?	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
were	1
hearing,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
smelling?	1
	1
12:18	1
But	1
now	1
hath	1
God	1
set	1
the	1
members	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
him.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
one	1
member,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:20	1
But	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
many	1
members,	1
yet	1
but	1
one	1
body.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
the	1
eye	1
cannot	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
hand,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
thee:	1
nor	1
again	1
the	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
feet,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
12:22	1
Nay,	1
much	1
more	1
those	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
feeble,	1
are	1
necessary:	1
12:23	1
And	1
those	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
we	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
honourable,	1
upon	1
these	1
we	1
bestow	1
more	1
abundant	1
honour;	1
and	1
our	1
uncomely	1
parts	1
have	1
more	1
abundant	1
comeliness.	1
	1
12:24	1
For	1
our	1
comely	1
parts	1
have	1
no	1
need:	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
tempered	1
the	1
body	1
together,	1
having	1
given	1
more	1
abundant	1
honour	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
which	1
lacked.	1
	1
12:25	1
That	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
schism	1
in	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
care	1
one	1
for	1
another.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
whether	1
one	1
member	1
suffer,	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
suffer	1
with	1
it;	1
or	1
one	1
member	1
be	1
honoured,	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
rejoice	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
12:27	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
members	1
in	1
particular.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
first	1
apostles,	1
secondarily	1
prophets,	1
thirdly	1
teachers,	1
after	1
that	1
miracles,	1
then	1
gifts	1
of	1
healings,	1
helps,	1
governments,	1
diversities	1
of	1
tongues.	1
	1
12:29	1
Are	1
all	1
apostles?	1
are	1
all	1
prophets?	1
are	1
all	1
teachers?	1
are	1
all	1
workers	1
of	1
miracles?	1
	1
12:30	1
Have	1
all	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing?	1
do	1
all	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues?	1
do	1
all	1
interpret?	1
	1
12:31	1
But	1
covet	1
earnestly	1
the	1
best	1
gifts:	1
and	1
yet	1
shew	1
I	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
way.	1
	1
13:1	1
Though	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
tongues	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
of	1
angels,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
as	1
sounding	1
brass,	1
or	1
a	1
tinkling	1
cymbal.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
understand	1
all	1
mysteries,	1
and	1
all	1
knowledge;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
all	1
faith,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
remove	1
mountains,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
I	1
am	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
bestow	1
all	1
my	1
goods	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
it	1
profiteth	1
me	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:4	1
Charity	1
suffereth	1
long,	1
and	1
is	1
kind;	1
charity	1
envieth	1
not;	1
charity	1
vaunteth	1
not	1
itself,	1
is	1
not	1
puffed	1
up,	1
13:5	1
Doth	1
not	1
behave	1
itself	1
unseemly,	1
seeketh	1
not	1
her	1
own,	1
is	1
not	1
easily	1
provoked,	1
thinketh	1
no	1
evil;	1
13:6	1
Rejoiceth	1
not	1
in	1
iniquity,	1
but	1
rejoiceth	1
in	1
the	1
truth;	1
13:7	1
Beareth	1
all	1
things,	1
believeth	1
all	1
things,	1
hopeth	1
all	1
things,	1
endureth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
13:8	1
Charity	1
never	1
faileth:	1
but	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
prophecies,	1
they	1
shall	1
fail;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
tongues,	1
they	1
shall	1
cease;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
knowledge,	1
it	1
shall	1
vanish	1
away.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
in	1
part,	1
and	1
we	1
prophesy	1
in	1
part.	1
	1
13:10	1
But	1
when	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
perfect	1
is	1
come,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
away.	1
	1
13:11	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
spake	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
understood	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
thought	1
as	1
a	1
child:	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
became	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
put	1
away	1
childish	1
things.	1
	1
13:12	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
through	1
a	1
glass,	1
darkly;	1
but	1
then	1
face	1
to	1
face:	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
in	1
part;	1
but	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
even	1
as	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
known.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
now	1
abideth	1
faith,	1
hope,	1
charity,	1
these	1
three;	1
but	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
charity.	1
	1
14:1	1
Follow	1
after	1
charity,	1
and	1
desire	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prophesy.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
speaketh	1
not	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
unto	1
God:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
understandeth	1
him;	1
howbeit	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
he	1
speaketh	1
mysteries.	1
	1
14:3	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
edification,	1
and	1
exhortation,	1
and	1
comfort.	1
	1
14:4	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
edifieth	1
himself;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
edifieth	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:5	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
spake	1
with	1
tongues	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
ye	1
prophesied:	1
for	1
greater	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
with	1
tongues,	1
except	1
he	1
interpret,	1
that	1
the	1
church	1
may	1
receive	1
edifying.	1
	1
14:6	1
Now,	1
brethren,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
speaking	1
with	1
tongues,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
profit	1
you,	1
except	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
either	1
by	1
revelation,	1
or	1
by	1
knowledge,	1
or	1
by	1
prophesying,	1
or	1
by	1
doctrine?	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
even	1
things	1
without	1
life	1
giving	1
sound,	1
whether	1
pipe	1
or	1
harp,	1
except	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
distinction	1
in	1
the	1
sounds,	1
how	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
piped	1
or	1
harped?	1
	1
14:8	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
trumpet	1
give	1
an	1
uncertain	1
sound,	1
who	1
shall	1
prepare	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
battle?	1
	1
14:9	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
except	1
ye	1
utter	1
by	1
the	1
tongue	1
words	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
how	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
spoken?	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
14:10	1
There	1
are,	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
so	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
without	1
signification.	1
	1
14:11	1
Therefore	1
if	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
voice,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
a	1
barbarian,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
barbarian	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
14:12	1
Even	1
so	1
ye,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
zealous	1
of	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
seek	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
excel	1
to	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:13	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
pray	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
interpret.	1
	1
14:14	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
pray	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue,	1
my	1
spirit	1
prayeth,	1
but	1
my	1
understanding	1
is	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
14:15	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
then?	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
with	1
the	1
understanding	1
also:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
understanding	1
also.	1
	1
14:16	1
Else	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bless	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
occupieth	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
unlearned	1
say	1
Amen	1
at	1
thy	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks,	1
seeing	1
he	1
understandeth	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest?	1
	1
14:17	1
For	1
thou	1
verily	1
givest	1
thanks	1
well,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
not	1
edified.	1
	1
14:18	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues	1
more	1
than	1
ye	1
all:	1
14:19	1
Yet	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
speak	1
five	1
words	1
with	1
my	1
understanding,	1
that	1
by	1
my	1
voice	1
I	1
might	1
teach	1
others	1
also,	1
than	1
ten	1
thousand	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue.	1
	1
14:20	1
Brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
children	1
in	1
understanding:	1
howbeit	1
in	1
malice	1
be	1
ye	1
children,	1
but	1
in	1
understanding	1
be	1
men.	1
	1
14:21	1
In	1
the	1
law	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
With	1
men	1
of	1
other	1
tongues	1
and	1
other	1
lips	1
will	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
this	1
people;	1
and	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
hear	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:22	1
Wherefore	1
tongues	1
are	1
for	1
a	1
sign,	1
not	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not:	1
but	1
prophesying	1
serveth	1
not	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
believe.	1
	1
14:23	1
If	1
therefore	1
the	1
whole	1
church	1
be	1
come	1
together	1
into	1
one	1
place,	1
and	1
all	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
unlearned,	1
or	1
unbelievers,	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
mad?	1
	1
14:24	1
But	1
if	1
all	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
one	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
or	1
one	1
unlearned,	1
he	1
is	1
convinced	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
is	1
judged	1
of	1
all:	1
14:25	1
And	1
thus	1
are	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
made	1
manifest;	1
and	1
so	1
falling	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
will	1
worship	1
God,	1
and	1
report	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth.	1
	1
14:26	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
then,	1
brethren?	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
hath	1
a	1
psalm,	1
hath	1
a	1
doctrine,	1
hath	1
a	1
tongue,	1
hath	1
a	1
revelation,	1
hath	1
an	1
interpretation.	1
Let	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
edifying.	1
	1
14:27	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
speak	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
two,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
by	1
three,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
course;	1
and	1
let	1
one	1
interpret.	1
	1
14:28	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
interpreter,	1
let	1
him	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:29	1
Let	1
the	1
prophets	1
speak	1
two	1
or	1
three,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
judge.	1
	1
14:30	1
If	1
any	1
thing	1
be	1
revealed	1
to	1
another	1
that	1
sitteth	1
by,	1
let	1
the	1
first	1
hold	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
14:31	1
For	1
ye	1
may	1
all	1
prophesy	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
that	1
all	1
may	1
learn,	1
and	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
comforted.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
are	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
14:33	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
confusion,	1
but	1
of	1
peace,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
churches	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
14:34	1
Let	1
your	1
women	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
churches:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
permitted	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
speak;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
obedience	1
as	1
also	1
saith	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
learn	1
any	1
thing,	1
let	1
them	1
ask	1
their	1
husbands	1
at	1
home:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
women	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:36	1
What?	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
out	1
from	1
you?	1
or	1
came	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
only?	1
	1
14:37	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prophet,	1
or	1
spiritual,	1
let	1
him	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
14:38	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
ignorant.	1
	1
14:39	1
Wherefore,	1
brethren,	1
covet	1
to	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
forbid	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues.	1
	1
14:40	1
Let	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
decently	1
and	1
in	1
order.	1
	1
15:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
and	1
wherein	1
ye	1
stand;	1
15:2	1
By	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
saved,	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
in	1
memory	1
what	1
I	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
unless	1
ye	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
15:3	1
For	1
I	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
received,	1
how	1
that	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
our	1
sins	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures;	1
15:4	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
buried,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures:	1
15:5	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
Cephas,	1
then	1
of	1
the	1
twelve:	1
15:6	1
After	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
above	1
five	1
hundred	1
brethren	1
at	1
once;	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
remain	1
unto	1
this	1
present,	1
but	1
some	1
are	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
	1
15:7	1
After	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
James;	1
then	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
me	1
also,	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
born	1
out	1
of	1
due	1
time.	1
	1
15:9	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
apostles,	1
that	1
am	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
apostle,	1
because	1
I	1
persecuted	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:10	1
But	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
am	1
what	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
his	1
grace	1
which	1
was	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
me	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
vain;	1
but	1
I	1
laboured	1
more	1
abundantly	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
15:11	1
Therefore	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
I	1
or	1
they,	1
so	1
we	1
preach,	1
and	1
so	1
ye	1
believed.	1
	1
15:12	1
Now	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
preached	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
how	1
say	1
some	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
15:13	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
then	1
is	1
Christ	1
not	1
risen:	1
15:14	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
not	1
risen,	1
then	1
is	1
our	1
preaching	1
vain,	1
and	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
also	1
vain.	1
	1
15:15	1
Yea,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
found	1
false	1
witnesses	1
of	1
God;	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
testified	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
Christ:	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
not	1
up,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not.	1
	1
15:16	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not,	1
then	1
is	1
not	1
Christ	1
raised:	1
15:17	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
not	1
raised,	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
vain;	1
ye	1
are	1
yet	1
in	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
15:18	1
Then	1
they	1
also	1
which	1
are	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
in	1
Christ	1
are	1
perished.	1
	1
15:19	1
If	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
only	1
we	1
have	1
hope	1
in	1
Christ,	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
most	1
miserable.	1
	1
15:20	1
But	1
now	1
is	1
Christ	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
become	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
slept.	1
	1
15:21	1
For	1
since	1
by	1
man	1
came	1
death,	1
by	1
man	1
came	1
also	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
15:22	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
Adam	1
all	1
die,	1
even	1
so	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
made	1
alive.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
order:	1
Christ	1
the	1
firstfruits;	1
afterward	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
Christ's	1
at	1
his	1
coming.	1
	1
15:24	1
Then	1
cometh	1
the	1
end,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
to	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father;	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
rule	1
and	1
all	1
authority	1
and	1
power.	1
	1
15:25	1
For	1
he	1
must	1
reign,	1
till	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
enemies	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
15:26	1
The	1
last	1
enemy	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
is	1
death.	1
	1
15:27	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saith	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
put	1
under	1
him,	1
it	1
is	1
manifest	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
excepted,	1
which	1
did	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
subdued	1
unto	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
also	1
himself	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
him,	1
that	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
15:29	1
Else	1
what	1
shall	1
they	1
do	1
which	1
are	1
baptized	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not	1
at	1
all?	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
then	1
baptized	1
for	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
why	1
stand	1
we	1
in	1
jeopardy	1
every	1
hour?	1
	1
15:31	1
I	1
protest	1
by	1
your	1
rejoicing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
LORD,	1
I	1
die	1
daily.	1
	1
15:32	1
If	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
with	1
beasts	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
what	1
advantageth	1
it	1
me,	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not?	1
let	1
us	1
eat	1
and	1
drink;	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
die.	1
	1
15:33	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
evil	1
communications	1
corrupt	1
good	1
manners.	1
	1
15:34	1
Awake	1
to	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
sin	1
not;	1
for	1
some	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God:	1
I	1
speak	1
this	1
to	1
your	1
shame.	1
	1
15:35	1
But	1
some	1
man	1
will	1
say,	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
dead	1
raised	1
up?	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
body	1
do	1
they	1
come?	1
	1
15:36	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sowest	1
is	1
not	1
quickened,	1
except	1
it	1
die:	1
15:37	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sowest,	1
thou	1
sowest	1
not	1
that	1
body	1
that	1
shall	1
be,	1
but	1
bare	1
grain,	1
it	1
may	1
chance	1
of	1
wheat,	1
or	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
grain:	1
15:38	1
But	1
God	1
giveth	1
it	1
a	1
body	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
seed	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
15:39	1
All	1
flesh	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
flesh:	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
kind	1
of	1
flesh	1
of	1
men,	1
another	1
flesh	1
of	1
beasts,	1
another	1
of	1
fishes,	1
and	1
another	1
of	1
birds.	1
	1
15:40	1
There	1
are	1
also	1
celestial	1
bodies,	1
and	1
bodies	1
terrestrial:	1
but	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
celestial	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
is	1
another.	1
	1
15:41	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
another	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
another	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
stars:	1
for	1
one	1
star	1
differeth	1
from	1
another	1
star	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
15:42	1
So	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
corruption;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
incorruption:	1
15:43	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
dishonour;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
glory:	1
it	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
weakness;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
power:	1
15:44	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
a	1
natural	1
body;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
a	1
spiritual	1
body.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
natural	1
body,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
spiritual	1
body.	1
	1
15:45	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
Adam	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
living	1
soul;	1
the	1
last	1
Adam	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
quickening	1
spirit.	1
	1
15:46	1
Howbeit	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
first	1
which	1
is	1
spiritual,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
natural;	1
and	1
afterward	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
spiritual.	1
	1
15:47	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
earthy;	1
the	1
second	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
15:48	1
As	1
is	1
the	1
earthy,	1
such	1
are	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
earthy:	1
and	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
heavenly,	1
such	1
are	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
heavenly.	1
	1
15:49	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
earthy,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
bear	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly.	1
	1
15:50	1
Now	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
cannot	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God;	1
neither	1
doth	1
corruption	1
inherit	1
incorruption.	1
	1
15:51	1
Behold,	1
I	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
mystery;	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
all	1
sleep,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
changed,	1
15:52	1
In	1
a	1
moment,	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye,	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
trump:	1
for	1
the	1
trumpet	1
shall	1
sound,	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
incorruptible,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
changed.	1
	1
15:53	1
For	1
this	1
corruptible	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption,	1
and	1
this	1
mortal	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
immortality.	1
	1
15:54	1
So	1
when	1
this	1
corruptible	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption,	1
and	1
this	1
mortal	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
immortality,	1
then	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
saying	1
that	1
is	1
written,	1
Death	1
is	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
victory.	1
	1
15:55	1
O	1
death,	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
sting?	1
O	1
grave,	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
victory?	1
15:56	1
The	1
sting	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
sin;	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
15:57	1
But	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
which	1
giveth	1
us	1
the	1
victory	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:58	1
Therefore,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
be	1
ye	1
stedfast,	1
unmoveable,	1
always	1
abounding	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
labour	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
vain	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
collection	1
for	1
the	1
saints,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Galatia,	1
even	1
so	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
16:2	1
Upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
lay	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
store,	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
prospered	1
him,	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
gatherings	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
come,	1
whomsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
approve	1
by	1
your	1
letters,	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
send	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
liberality	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
meet	1
that	1
I	1
go	1
also,	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
16:5	1
Now	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
Macedonia:	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
pass	1
through	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
abide,	1
yea,	1
and	1
winter	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
bring	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
journey	1
whithersoever	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
16:7	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
see	1
you	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
way;	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
tarry	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
you,	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
permit.	1
	1
16:8	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
tarry	1
at	1
Ephesus	1
until	1
Pentecost.	1
	1
16:9	1
For	1
a	1
great	1
door	1
and	1
effectual	1
is	1
opened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
adversaries.	1
	1
16:10	1
Now	1
if	1
Timotheus	1
come,	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
without	1
fear:	1
for	1
he	1
worketh	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
do.	1
	1
16:11	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
therefore	1
despise	1
him:	1
but	1
conduct	1
him	1
forth	1
in	1
peace,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
16:12	1
As	1
touching	1
our	1
brother	1
Apollos,	1
I	1
greatly	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
brethren:	1
but	1
his	1
will	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
this	1
time;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
convenient	1
time.	1
	1
16:13	1
Watch	1
ye,	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
quit	1
you	1
like	1
men,	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
16:14	1
Let	1
all	1
your	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
charity.	1
	1
16:15	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
(ye	1
know	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Stephanas,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
Achaia,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
addicted	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
saints,)	1
16:16	1
That	1
ye	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
such,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
helpeth	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
laboureth.	1
	1
16:17	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Stephanas	1
and	1
Fortunatus	1
and	1
Achaicus:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lacking	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
they	1
have	1
supplied.	1
	1
16:18	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
refreshed	1
my	1
spirit	1
and	1
your's:	1
therefore	1
acknowledge	1
ye	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
such.	1
	1
16:19	1
The	1
churches	1
of	1
Asia	1
salute	1
you.	1
Aquila	1
and	1
Priscilla	1
salute	1
you	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
with	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
	1
16:20	1
All	1
the	1
brethren	1
greet	1
you.	1
Greet	1
ye	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
16:21	1
The	1
salutation	1
of	1
me	1
Paul	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
16:22	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
not	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
Anathema	1
Maranatha.	1
	1
16:23	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
16:24	1
My	1
love	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Timothy	1
our	1
brother,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
Achaia:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
mercies,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
comfort;	1
1:4	1
Who	1
comforteth	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
tribulation,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
any	1
trouble,	1
by	1
the	1
comfort	1
wherewith	1
we	1
ourselves	1
are	1
comforted	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ	1
abound	1
in	1
us,	1
so	1
our	1
consolation	1
also	1
aboundeth	1
by	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
afflicted,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
consolation	1
and	1
salvation,	1
which	1
is	1
effectual	1
in	1
the	1
enduring	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sufferings	1
which	1
we	1
also	1
suffer:	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
comforted,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
consolation	1
and	1
salvation.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
our	1
hope	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
stedfast,	1
knowing,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
consolation.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
we	1
would	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant	1
of	1
our	1
trouble	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
Asia,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
pressed	1
out	1
of	1
measure,	1
above	1
strength,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
despaired	1
even	1
of	1
life:	1
1:9	1
But	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
trust	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
in	1
God	1
which	1
raiseth	1
the	1
dead:	1
1:10	1
Who	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
death,	1
and	1
doth	1
deliver:	1
in	1
whom	1
we	1
trust	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
yet	1
deliver	1
us;	1
1:11	1
Ye	1
also	1
helping	1
together	1
by	1
prayer	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
gift	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
many	1
persons	1
thanks	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
many	1
on	1
our	1
behalf.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
our	1
rejoicing	1
is	1
this,	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
our	1
conscience,	1
that	1
in	1
simplicity	1
and	1
godly	1
sincerity,	1
not	1
with	1
fleshly	1
wisdom,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
our	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
you-ward.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
we	1
write	1
none	1
other	1
things	1
unto	1
you,	1
than	1
what	1
ye	1
read	1
or	1
acknowledge;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
ye	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
end;	1
1:14	1
As	1
also	1
ye	1
have	1
acknowledged	1
us	1
in	1
part,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
your	1
rejoicing,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
our's	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
confidence	1
I	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
before,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
second	1
benefit;	1
1:16	1
And	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
you	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
toward	1
Judaea.	1
	1
1:17	1
When	1
I	1
therefore	1
was	1
thus	1
minded,	1
did	1
I	1
use	1
lightness?	1
or	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
purpose,	1
do	1
I	1
purpose	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
that	1
with	1
me	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
yea	1
yea,	1
and	1
nay	1
nay?	1
	1
1:18	1
But	1
as	1
God	1
is	1
true,	1
our	1
word	1
toward	1
you	1
was	1
not	1
yea	1
and	1
nay.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
was	1
preached	1
among	1
you	1
by	1
us,	1
even	1
by	1
me	1
and	1
Silvanus	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
was	1
not	1
yea	1
and	1
nay,	1
but	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
yea.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him	1
are	1
yea,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
Amen,	1
unto	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
us.	1
	1
1:21	1
Now	1
he	1
which	1
stablisheth	1
us	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
hath	1
anointed	1
us,	1
is	1
God;	1
1:22	1
Who	1
hath	1
also	1
sealed	1
us,	1
and	1
given	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
in	1
our	1
hearts.	1
	1
1:23	1
Moreover	1
I	1
call	1
God	1
for	1
a	1
record	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
that	1
to	1
spare	1
you	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
unto	1
Corinth.	1
	1
1:24	1
Not	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
your	1
faith,	1
but	1
are	1
helpers	1
of	1
your	1
joy:	1
for	1
by	1
faith	1
ye	1
stand.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
I	1
determined	1
this	1
with	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
heaviness.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
you	1
sorry,	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
that	1
maketh	1
me	1
glad,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
is	1
made	1
sorry	1
by	1
me?	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
wrote	1
this	1
same	1
unto	1
you,	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
came,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sorrow	1
from	1
them	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
rejoice;	1
having	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
is	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
much	1
affliction	1
and	1
anguish	1
of	1
heart	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
many	1
tears;	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
grieved,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
abundantly	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
have	1
caused	1
grief,	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
grieved	1
me,	1
but	1
in	1
part:	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
overcharge	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:6	1
Sufficient	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
this	1
punishment,	1
which	1
was	1
inflicted	1
of	1
many.	1
	1
2:7	1
So	1
that	1
contrariwise	1
ye	1
ought	1
rather	1
to	1
forgive	1
him,	1
and	1
comfort	1
him,	1
lest	1
perhaps	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
with	1
overmuch	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:8	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
confirm	1
your	1
love	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
2:9	1
For	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
also	1
did	1
I	1
write,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
you,	1
whether	1
ye	1
be	1
obedient	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:10	1
To	1
whom	1
ye	1
forgive	1
any	1
thing,	1
I	1
forgive	1
also:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
forgave	1
any	1
thing,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
forgave	1
it,	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
forgave	1
I	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
Christ;	1
2:11	1
Lest	1
Satan	1
should	1
get	1
an	1
advantage	1
of	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
his	1
devices.	1
	1
2:12	1
Furthermore,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Troas	1
to	1
preach	1
Christ's	1
gospel,	1
and	1
a	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
2:13	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
rest	1
in	1
my	1
spirit,	1
because	1
I	1
found	1
not	1
Titus	1
my	1
brother:	1
but	1
taking	1
my	1
leave	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
went	1
from	1
thence	1
into	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
2:14	1
Now	1
thanks	1
be	1
unto	1
God,	1
which	1
always	1
causeth	1
us	1
to	1
triumph	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
maketh	1
manifest	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
his	1
knowledge	1
by	1
us	1
in	1
every	1
place.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
unto	1
God	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
of	1
Christ,	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
saved,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
perish:	1
2:16	1
To	1
the	1
one	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
death	1
unto	1
death;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
life	1
unto	1
life.	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
many,	1
which	1
corrupt	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
sincerity,	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
speak	1
we	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:1	1
Do	1
we	1
begin	1
again	1
to	1
commend	1
ourselves?	1
or	1
need	1
we,	1
as	1
some	1
others,	1
epistles	1
of	1
commendation	1
to	1
you,	1
or	1
letters	1
of	1
commendation	1
from	1
you?	1
	1
3:2	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
epistle	1
written	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
known	1
and	1
read	1
of	1
all	1
men:	1
3:3	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
manifestly	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
epistle	1
of	1
Christ	1
ministered	1
by	1
us,	1
written	1
not	1
with	1
ink,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
not	1
in	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
but	1
in	1
fleshy	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
such	1
trust	1
have	1
we	1
through	1
Christ	1
to	1
God-ward:	1
3:5	1
Not	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
sufficient	1
of	1
ourselves	1
to	1
think	1
any	1
thing	1
as	1
of	1
ourselves;	1
but	1
our	1
sufficiency	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
3:6	1
Who	1
also	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
able	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament;	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
spirit:	1
for	1
the	1
letter	1
killeth,	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
giveth	1
life.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
death,	1
written	1
and	1
engraven	1
in	1
stones,	1
was	1
glorious,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stedfastly	1
behold	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Moses	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
countenance;	1
which	1
glory	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
away:	1
3:8	1
How	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
be	1
rather	1
glorious?	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
condemnation	1
be	1
glory,	1
much	1
more	1
doth	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
righteousness	1
exceed	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
glorious	1
had	1
no	1
glory	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
excelleth.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
if	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
was	1
glorious,	1
much	1
more	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
is	1
glorious.	1
	1
3:12	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
such	1
hope,	1
we	1
use	1
great	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech:	1
3:13	1
And	1
not	1
as	1
Moses,	1
which	1
put	1
a	1
vail	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stedfastly	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
abolished:	1
3:14	1
But	1
their	1
minds	1
were	1
blinded:	1
for	1
until	1
this	1
day	1
remaineth	1
the	1
same	1
vail	1
untaken	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
testament;	1
which	1
vail	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:15	1
But	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
when	1
Moses	1
is	1
read,	1
the	1
vail	1
is	1
upon	1
their	1
heart.	1
	1
3:16	1
Nevertheless	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
vail	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
3:17	1
Now	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
that	1
Spirit:	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
liberty.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
we	1
all,	1
with	1
open	1
face	1
beholding	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
are	1
changed	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
image	1
from	1
glory	1
to	1
glory,	1
even	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
Therefore	1
seeing	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
ministry,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
mercy,	1
we	1
faint	1
not;	1
4:2	1
But	1
have	1
renounced	1
the	1
hidden	1
things	1
of	1
dishonesty,	1
not	1
walking	1
in	1
craftiness,	1
nor	1
handling	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
deceitfully;	1
but	1
by	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
commending	1
ourselves	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
conscience	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
if	1
our	1
gospel	1
be	1
hid,	1
it	1
is	1
hid	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
lost:	1
4:4	1
In	1
whom	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
hath	1
blinded	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
believe	1
not,	1
lest	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
glorious	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God,	1
should	1
shine	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:5	1
For	1
we	1
preach	1
not	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
ourselves	1
your	1
servants	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
God,	1
who	1
commanded	1
the	1
light	1
to	1
shine	1
out	1
of	1
darkness,	1
hath	1
shined	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
treasure	1
in	1
earthen	1
vessels,	1
that	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
4:8	1
We	1
are	1
troubled	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
yet	1
not	1
distressed;	1
we	1
are	1
perplexed,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
despair;	1
4:9	1
Persecuted,	1
but	1
not	1
forsaken;	1
cast	1
down,	1
but	1
not	1
destroyed;	1
4:10	1
Always	1
bearing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
the	1
dying	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
also	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
our	1
body.	1
	1
4:11	1
For	1
we	1
which	1
live	1
are	1
alway	1
delivered	1
unto	1
death	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake,	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
also	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
our	1
mortal	1
flesh.	1
	1
4:12	1
So	1
then	1
death	1
worketh	1
in	1
us,	1
but	1
life	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
4:13	1
We	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
spirit	1
of	1
faith,	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
believed,	1
and	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
spoken;	1
we	1
also	1
believe,	1
and	1
therefore	1
speak;	1
4:14	1
Knowing	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
raise	1
up	1
us	1
also	1
by	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
shall	1
present	1
us	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
that	1
the	1
abundant	1
grace	1
might	1
through	1
the	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
many	1
redound	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
we	1
faint	1
not;	1
but	1
though	1
our	1
outward	1
man	1
perish,	1
yet	1
the	1
inward	1
man	1
is	1
renewed	1
day	1
by	1
day.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
our	1
light	1
affliction,	1
which	1
is	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
worketh	1
for	1
us	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
exceeding	1
and	1
eternal	1
weight	1
of	1
glory;	1
4:18	1
While	1
we	1
look	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen:	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen	1
are	1
temporal;	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen	1
are	1
eternal.	1
	1
5:1	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
our	1
earthly	1
house	1
of	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
were	1
dissolved,	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
building	1
of	1
God,	1
an	1
house	1
not	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
eternal	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
in	1
this	1
we	1
groan,	1
earnestly	1
desiring	1
to	1
be	1
clothed	1
upon	1
with	1
our	1
house	1
which	1
is	1
from	1
heaven:	1
5:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
being	1
clothed	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
naked.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
we	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
do	1
groan,	1
being	1
burdened:	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
be	1
unclothed,	1
but	1
clothed	1
upon,	1
that	1
mortality	1
might	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
wrought	1
us	1
for	1
the	1
selfsame	1
thing	1
is	1
God,	1
who	1
also	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:6	1
Therefore	1
we	1
are	1
always	1
confident,	1
knowing	1
that,	1
whilst	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
we	1
are	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
Lord:	1
5:7	1
(For	1
we	1
walk	1
by	1
faith,	1
not	1
by	1
sight:)	1
5:8	1
We	1
are	1
confident,	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
willing	1
rather	1
to	1
be	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:9	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
labour,	1
that,	1
whether	1
present	1
or	1
absent,	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:10	1
For	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
of	1
Christ;	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
may	1
receive	1
the	1
things	1
done	1
in	1
his	1
body,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
	1
5:11	1
Knowing	1
therefore	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
we	1
persuade	1
men;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
God;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
also	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
your	1
consciences.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
we	1
commend	1
not	1
ourselves	1
again	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
give	1
you	1
occasion	1
to	1
glory	1
on	1
our	1
behalf,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
answer	1
them	1
which	1
glory	1
in	1
appearance,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
5:13	1
For	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
beside	1
ourselves,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
God:	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
sober,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
cause.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ	1
constraineth	1
us;	1
because	1
we	1
thus	1
judge,	1
that	1
if	1
one	1
died	1
for	1
all,	1
then	1
were	1
all	1
dead:	1
5:15	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
for	1
all,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
live	1
should	1
not	1
henceforth	1
live	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
but	1
unto	1
him	1
which	1
died	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
rose	1
again.	1
	1
5:16	1
Wherefore	1
henceforth	1
know	1
we	1
no	1
man	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
yea,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
Christ	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
yet	1
now	1
henceforth	1
know	1
we	1
him	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
5:17	1
Therefore	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
in	1
Christ,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
creature:	1
old	1
things	1
are	1
passed	1
away;	1
behold,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
become	1
new.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
reconciled	1
us	1
to	1
himself	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
reconciliation;	1
5:19	1
To	1
wit,	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
in	1
Christ,	1
reconciling	1
the	1
world	1
unto	1
himself,	1
not	1
imputing	1
their	1
trespasses	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
hath	1
committed	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
reconciliation.	1
	1
5:20	1
Now	1
then	1
we	1
are	1
ambassadors	1
for	1
Christ,	1
as	1
though	1
God	1
did	1
beseech	1
you	1
by	1
us:	1
we	1
pray	1
you	1
in	1
Christ's	1
stead,	1
be	1
ye	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
5:21	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sin	1
for	1
us,	1
who	1
knew	1
no	1
sin;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:1	1
We	1
then,	1
as	1
workers	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
beseech	1
you	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
6:2	1
(For	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
accepted,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation	1
have	1
I	1
succoured	1
thee:	1
behold,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
accepted	1
time;	1
behold,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation.)	1
	1
6:3	1
Giving	1
no	1
offence	1
in	1
any	1
thing,	1
that	1
the	1
ministry	1
be	1
not	1
blamed:	1
6:4	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
approving	1
ourselves	1
as	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
much	1
patience,	1
in	1
afflictions,	1
in	1
necessities,	1
in	1
distresses,	1
6:5	1
In	1
stripes,	1
in	1
imprisonments,	1
in	1
tumults,	1
in	1
labours,	1
in	1
watchings,	1
in	1
fastings;	1
6:6	1
By	1
pureness,	1
by	1
knowledge,	1
by	1
longsuffering,	1
by	1
kindness,	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
by	1
love	1
unfeigned,	1
6:7	1
By	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God,	1
by	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
righteousness	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
6:8	1
By	1
honour	1
and	1
dishonour,	1
by	1
evil	1
report	1
and	1
good	1
report:	1
as	1
deceivers,	1
and	1
yet	1
true;	1
6:9	1
As	1
unknown,	1
and	1
yet	1
well	1
known;	1
as	1
dying,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
we	1
live;	1
as	1
chastened,	1
and	1
not	1
killed;	1
6:10	1
As	1
sorrowful,	1
yet	1
alway	1
rejoicing;	1
as	1
poor,	1
yet	1
making	1
many	1
rich;	1
as	1
having	1
nothing,	1
and	1
yet	1
possessing	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
6:11	1
O	1
ye	1
Corinthians,	1
our	1
mouth	1
is	1
open	1
unto	1
you,	1
our	1
heart	1
is	1
enlarged.	1
	1
6:12	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
straitened	1
in	1
us,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
straitened	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
bowels.	1
	1
6:13	1
Now	1
for	1
a	1
recompence	1
in	1
the	1
same,	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
unto	1
my	1
children,)	1
be	1
ye	1
also	1
enlarged.	1
	1
6:14	1
Be	1
ye	1
not	1
unequally	1
yoked	1
together	1
with	1
unbelievers:	1
for	1
what	1
fellowship	1
hath	1
righteousness	1
with	1
unrighteousness?	1
and	1
what	1
communion	1
hath	1
light	1
with	1
darkness?	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
what	1
concord	1
hath	1
Christ	1
with	1
Belial?	1
or	1
what	1
part	1
hath	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
with	1
an	1
infidel?	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
what	1
agreement	1
hath	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
idols?	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
6:17	1
Wherefore	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
separate,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
touch	1
not	1
the	1
unclean	1
thing;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
receive	1
you.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
Father	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Almighty.	1
	1
7:1	1
Having	1
therefore	1
these	1
promises,	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
cleanse	1
ourselves	1
from	1
all	1
filthiness	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
spirit,	1
perfecting	1
holiness	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:2	1
Receive	1
us;	1
we	1
have	1
wronged	1
no	1
man,	1
we	1
have	1
corrupted	1
no	1
man,	1
we	1
have	1
defrauded	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
7:3	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
this	1
to	1
condemn	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
before,	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
live	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
7:4	1
Great	1
is	1
my	1
boldness	1
of	1
speech	1
toward	1
you,	1
great	1
is	1
my	1
glorying	1
of	1
you:	1
I	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
comfort,	1
I	1
am	1
exceeding	1
joyful	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
tribulation.	1
	1
7:5	1
For,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
our	1
flesh	1
had	1
no	1
rest,	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
troubled	1
on	1
every	1
side;	1
without	1
were	1
fightings,	1
within	1
were	1
fears.	1
	1
7:6	1
Nevertheless	1
God,	1
that	1
comforteth	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
cast	1
down,	1
comforted	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Titus;	1
7:7	1
And	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
coming	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
consolation	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
comforted	1
in	1
you,	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
your	1
earnest	1
desire,	1
your	1
mourning,	1
your	1
fervent	1
mind	1
toward	1
me;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
made	1
you	1
sorry	1
with	1
a	1
letter,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
repent,	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
repent:	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
epistle	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
sorry,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
7:9	1
Now	1
I	1
rejoice,	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
sorry,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrowed	1
to	1
repentance:	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
sorry	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
manner,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
receive	1
damage	1
by	1
us	1
in	1
nothing.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
godly	1
sorrow	1
worketh	1
repentance	1
to	1
salvation	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
repented	1
of:	1
but	1
the	1
sorrow	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
worketh	1
death.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
behold	1
this	1
selfsame	1
thing,	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrowed	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
sort,	1
what	1
carefulness	1
it	1
wrought	1
in	1
you,	1
yea,	1
what	1
clearing	1
of	1
yourselves,	1
yea,	1
what	1
indignation,	1
yea,	1
what	1
fear,	1
yea,	1
what	1
vehement	1
desire,	1
yea,	1
what	1
zeal,	1
yea,	1
what	1
revenge!	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
approved	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
clear	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore,	1
though	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
cause	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
wrong,	1
nor	1
for	1
his	1
cause	1
that	1
suffered	1
wrong,	1
but	1
that	1
our	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
appear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
7:13	1
Therefore	1
we	1
were	1
comforted	1
in	1
your	1
comfort:	1
yea,	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
the	1
more	1
joyed	1
we	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Titus,	1
because	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
refreshed	1
by	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
boasted	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
spake	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
truth,	1
even	1
so	1
our	1
boasting,	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
before	1
Titus,	1
is	1
found	1
a	1
truth.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
his	1
inward	1
affection	1
is	1
more	1
abundant	1
toward	1
you,	1
whilst	1
he	1
remembereth	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
you	1
all,	1
how	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling	1
ye	1
received	1
him.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
rejoice	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
8:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
do	1
you	1
to	1
wit	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
bestowed	1
on	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Macedonia;	1
8:2	1
How	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
trial	1
of	1
affliction	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
their	1
joy	1
and	1
their	1
deep	1
poverty	1
abounded	1
unto	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
their	1
liberality.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
to	1
their	1
power,	1
I	1
bear	1
record,	1
yea,	1
and	1
beyond	1
their	1
power	1
they	1
were	1
willing	1
of	1
themselves;	1
8:4	1
Praying	1
us	1
with	1
much	1
intreaty	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
receive	1
the	1
gift,	1
and	1
take	1
upon	1
us	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
this	1
they	1
did,	1
not	1
as	1
we	1
hoped,	1
but	1
first	1
gave	1
their	1
own	1
selves	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:6	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
desired	1
Titus,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
begun,	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
also	1
finish	1
in	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
grace	1
also.	1
	1
8:7	1
Therefore,	1
as	1
ye	1
abound	1
in	1
every	1
thing,	1
in	1
faith,	1
and	1
utterance,	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
diligence,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
love	1
to	1
us,	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
abound	1
in	1
this	1
grace	1
also.	1
	1
8:8	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
by	1
commandment,	1
but	1
by	1
occasion	1
of	1
the	1
forwardness	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
your	1
love.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
rich,	1
yet	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
he	1
became	1
poor,	1
that	1
ye	1
through	1
his	1
poverty	1
might	1
be	1
rich.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
herein	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
advice:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
begun	1
before,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
forward	1
a	1
year	1
ago.	1
	1
8:11	1
Now	1
therefore	1
perform	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
it;	1
that	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
will,	1
so	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
performance	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
first	1
a	1
willing	1
mind,	1
it	1
is	1
accepted	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
hath,	1
and	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
not.	1
	1
8:13	1
For	1
I	1
mean	1
not	1
that	1
other	1
men	1
be	1
eased,	1
and	1
ye	1
burdened:	1
8:14	1
But	1
by	1
an	1
equality,	1
that	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
your	1
abundance	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
supply	1
for	1
their	1
want,	1
that	1
their	1
abundance	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
supply	1
for	1
your	1
want:	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
equality:	1
8:15	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
that	1
had	1
gathered	1
much	1
had	1
nothing	1
over;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
gathered	1
little	1
had	1
no	1
lack.	1
	1
8:16	1
But	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
which	1
put	1
the	1
same	1
earnest	1
care	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Titus	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
indeed	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
exhortation;	1
but	1
being	1
more	1
forward,	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
sent	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
brother,	1
whose	1
praise	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
churches;	1
8:19	1
And	1
not	1
that	1
only,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
chosen	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
to	1
travel	1
with	1
us	1
with	1
this	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
Lord,	1
and	1
declaration	1
of	1
your	1
ready	1
mind:	1
8:20	1
Avoiding	1
this,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
blame	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
abundance	1
which	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
us:	1
8:21	1
Providing	1
for	1
honest	1
things,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
sent	1
with	1
them	1
our	1
brother,	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
oftentimes	1
proved	1
diligent	1
in	1
many	1
things,	1
but	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
diligent,	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
confidence	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:23	1
Whether	1
any	1
do	1
enquire	1
of	1
Titus,	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
partner	1
and	1
fellowhelper	1
concerning	1
you:	1
or	1
our	1
brethren	1
be	1
enquired	1
of,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
the	1
churches,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:24	1
Wherefore	1
shew	1
ye	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
churches,	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
your	1
love,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
boasting	1
on	1
your	1
behalf.	1
	1
9:1	1
For	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
it	1
is	1
superfluous	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you:	1
9:2	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
forwardness	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
boast	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
that	1
Achaia	1
was	1
ready	1
a	1
year	1
ago;	1
and	1
your	1
zeal	1
hath	1
provoked	1
very	1
many.	1
	1
9:3	1
Yet	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
the	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
our	1
boasting	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
vain	1
in	1
this	1
behalf;	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
ready:	1
9:4	1
Lest	1
haply	1
if	1
they	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
find	1
you	1
unprepared,	1
we	1
(that	1
we	1
say	1
not,	1
ye)	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
confident	1
boasting.	1
	1
9:5	1
Therefore	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
exhort	1
the	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
before	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
up	1
beforehand	1
your	1
bounty,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
had	1
notice	1
before,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
might	1
be	1
ready,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
bounty,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
of	1
covetousness.	1
	1
9:6	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
He	1
which	1
soweth	1
sparingly	1
shall	1
reap	1
also	1
sparingly;	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
soweth	1
bountifully	1
shall	1
reap	1
also	1
bountifully.	1
	1
9:7	1
Every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
purposeth	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
give;	1
not	1
grudgingly,	1
or	1
of	1
necessity:	1
for	1
God	1
loveth	1
a	1
cheerful	1
giver.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
grace	1
abound	1
toward	1
you;	1
that	1
ye,	1
always	1
having	1
all	1
sufficiency	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
may	1
abound	1
to	1
every	1
good	1
work:	1
9:9	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
hath	1
dispersed	1
abroad;	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor:	1
his	1
righteousness	1
remaineth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
9:10	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
ministereth	1
seed	1
to	1
the	1
sower	1
both	1
minister	1
bread	1
for	1
your	1
food,	1
and	1
multiply	1
your	1
seed	1
sown,	1
and	1
increase	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
your	1
righteousness;)	1
9:11	1
Being	1
enriched	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
all	1
bountifulness,	1
which	1
causeth	1
through	1
us	1
thanksgiving	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
9:12	1
For	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
this	1
service	1
not	1
only	1
supplieth	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
but	1
is	1
abundant	1
also	1
by	1
many	1
thanksgivings	1
unto	1
God;	1
9:13	1
Whiles	1
by	1
the	1
experiment	1
of	1
this	1
ministration	1
they	1
glorify	1
God	1
for	1
your	1
professed	1
subjection	1
unto	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
liberal	1
distribution	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
men;	1
9:14	1
And	1
by	1
their	1
prayer	1
for	1
you,	1
which	1
long	1
after	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
exceeding	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
9:15	1
Thanks	1
be	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
unspeakable	1
gift.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
I	1
Paul	1
myself	1
beseech	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
meekness	1
and	1
gentleness	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
in	1
presence	1
am	1
base	1
among	1
you,	1
but	1
being	1
absent	1
am	1
bold	1
toward	1
you:	1
10:2	1
But	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
bold	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
present	1
with	1
that	1
confidence,	1
wherewith	1
I	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
bold	1
against	1
some,	1
which	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
walked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
though	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
war	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
10:4	1
(For	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
our	1
warfare	1
are	1
not	1
carnal,	1
but	1
mighty	1
through	1
God	1
to	1
the	1
pulling	1
down	1
of	1
strong	1
holds;)	1
10:5	1
Casting	1
down	1
imaginations,	1
and	1
every	1
high	1
thing	1
that	1
exalteth	1
itself	1
against	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
bringing	1
into	1
captivity	1
every	1
thought	1
to	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
Christ;	1
10:6	1
And	1
having	1
in	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
revenge	1
all	1
disobedience,	1
when	1
your	1
obedience	1
is	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
10:7	1
Do	1
ye	1
look	1
on	1
things	1
after	1
the	1
outward	1
appearance?	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
trust	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Christ's,	1
let	1
him	1
of	1
himself	1
think	1
this	1
again,	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
Christ's,	1
even	1
so	1
are	1
we	1
Christ's.	1
	1
10:8	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
boast	1
somewhat	1
more	1
of	1
our	1
authority,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
for	1
edification,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
destruction,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
10:9	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
terrify	1
you	1
by	1
letters.	1
	1
10:10	1
For	1
his	1
letters,	1
say	1
they,	1
are	1
weighty	1
and	1
powerful;	1
but	1
his	1
bodily	1
presence	1
is	1
weak,	1
and	1
his	1
speech	1
contemptible.	1
	1
10:11	1
Let	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
think	1
this,	1
that,	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
word	1
by	1
letters	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
absent,	1
such	1
will	1
we	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
deed	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
present.	1
	1
10:12	1
For	1
we	1
dare	1
not	1
make	1
ourselves	1
of	1
the	1
number,	1
or	1
compare	1
ourselves	1
with	1
some	1
that	1
commend	1
themselves:	1
but	1
they	1
measuring	1
themselves	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
comparing	1
themselves	1
among	1
themselves,	1
are	1
not	1
wise.	1
	1
10:13	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
boast	1
of	1
things	1
without	1
our	1
measure,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
rule	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
distributed	1
to	1
us,	1
a	1
measure	1
to	1
reach	1
even	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:14	1
For	1
we	1
stretch	1
not	1
ourselves	1
beyond	1
our	1
measure,	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
reached	1
not	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
come	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
you	1
also	1
in	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
10:15	1
Not	1
boasting	1
of	1
things	1
without	1
our	1
measure,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
labours;	1
but	1
having	1
hope,	1
when	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
increased,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
enlarged	1
by	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
rule	1
abundantly,	1
10:16	1
To	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
in	1
the	1
regions	1
beyond	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
boast	1
in	1
another	1
man's	1
line	1
of	1
things	1
made	1
ready	1
to	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
10:17	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
glorieth,	1
let	1
him	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
10:18	1
For	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
commendeth	1
himself	1
is	1
approved,	1
but	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
commendeth.	1
	1
11:1	1
Would	1
to	1
God	1
ye	1
could	1
bear	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
my	1
folly:	1
and	1
indeed	1
bear	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
11:2	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
jealous	1
over	1
you	1
with	1
godly	1
jealousy:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
espoused	1
you	1
to	1
one	1
husband,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
present	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
chaste	1
virgin	1
to	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:3	1
But	1
I	1
fear,	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means,	1
as	1
the	1
serpent	1
beguiled	1
Eve	1
through	1
his	1
subtilty,	1
so	1
your	1
minds	1
should	1
be	1
corrupted	1
from	1
the	1
simplicity	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:4	1
For	1
if	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
preacheth	1
another	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
preached,	1
or	1
if	1
ye	1
receive	1
another	1
spirit,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received,	1
or	1
another	1
gospel,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
accepted,	1
ye	1
might	1
well	1
bear	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:5	1
For	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
behind	1
the	1
very	1
chiefest	1
apostles.	1
	1
11:6	1
But	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
rude	1
in	1
speech,	1
yet	1
not	1
in	1
knowledge;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
throughly	1
made	1
manifest	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
11:7	1
Have	1
I	1
committed	1
an	1
offence	1
in	1
abasing	1
myself	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
exalted,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
freely?	1
11:8	1
I	1
robbed	1
other	1
churches,	1
taking	1
wages	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
service.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
present	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
wanted,	1
I	1
was	1
chargeable	1
to	1
no	1
man:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lacking	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Macedonia	1
supplied:	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
myself	1
from	1
being	1
burdensome	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
keep	1
myself.	1
	1
11:10	1
As	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
stop	1
me	1
of	1
this	1
boasting	1
in	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Achaia.	1
	1
11:11	1
Wherefore?	1
because	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
not?	1
God	1
knoweth.	1
	1
11:12	1
But	1
what	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cut	1
off	1
occasion	1
from	1
them	1
which	1
desire	1
occasion;	1
that	1
wherein	1
they	1
glory,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
as	1
we.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
such	1
are	1
false	1
apostles,	1
deceitful	1
workers,	1
transforming	1
themselves	1
into	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
no	1
marvel;	1
for	1
Satan	1
himself	1
is	1
transformed	1
into	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
11:15	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
thing	1
if	1
his	1
ministers	1
also	1
be	1
transformed	1
as	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
righteousness;	1
whose	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
11:16	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
fool;	1
if	1
otherwise,	1
yet	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
receive	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
boast	1
myself	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
11:17	1
That	1
which	1
I	1
speak,	1
I	1
speak	1
it	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
foolishly,	1
in	1
this	1
confidence	1
of	1
boasting.	1
	1
11:18	1
Seeing	1
that	1
many	1
glory	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
I	1
will	1
glory	1
also.	1
	1
11:19	1
For	1
ye	1
suffer	1
fools	1
gladly,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
wise.	1
	1
11:20	1
For	1
ye	1
suffer,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
bondage,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
devour	1
you,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
of	1
you,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
exalt	1
himself,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
smite	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
11:21	1
I	1
speak	1
as	1
concerning	1
reproach,	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
weak.	1
Howbeit	1
whereinsoever	1
any	1
is	1
bold,	1
(I	1
speak	1
foolishly,)	1
I	1
am	1
bold	1
also.	1
	1
11:22	1
Are	1
they	1
Hebrews?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
Are	1
they	1
Israelites?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
Are	1
they	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
11:23	1
Are	1
they	1
ministers	1
of	1
Christ?	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
a	1
fool)	1
I	1
am	1
more;	1
in	1
labours	1
more	1
abundant,	1
in	1
stripes	1
above	1
measure,	1
in	1
prisons	1
more	1
frequent,	1
in	1
deaths	1
oft.	1
	1
11:24	1
Of	1
the	1
Jews	1
five	1
times	1
received	1
I	1
forty	1
stripes	1
save	1
one.	1
	1
11:25	1
Thrice	1
was	1
I	1
beaten	1
with	1
rods,	1
once	1
was	1
I	1
stoned,	1
thrice	1
I	1
suffered	1
shipwreck,	1
a	1
night	1
and	1
a	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
deep;	1
11:26	1
In	1
journeyings	1
often,	1
in	1
perils	1
of	1
waters,	1
in	1
perils	1
of	1
robbers,	1
in	1
perils	1
by	1
mine	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
in	1
perils	1
by	1
the	1
heathen,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
in	1
perils	1
among	1
false	1
brethren;	1
11:27	1
In	1
weariness	1
and	1
painfulness,	1
in	1
watchings	1
often,	1
in	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst,	1
in	1
fastings	1
often,	1
in	1
cold	1
and	1
nakedness.	1
	1
11:28	1
Beside	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
upon	1
me	1
daily,	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
11:29	1
Who	1
is	1
weak,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
weak?	1
who	1
is	1
offended,	1
and	1
I	1
burn	1
not?	1
11:30	1
If	1
I	1
must	1
needs	1
glory,	1
I	1
will	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
concern	1
mine	1
infirmities.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
is	1
blessed	1
for	1
evermore,	1
knoweth	1
that	1
I	1
lie	1
not.	1
	1
11:32	1
In	1
Damascus	1
the	1
governor	1
under	1
Aretas	1
the	1
king	1
kept	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Damascenes	1
with	1
a	1
garrison,	1
desirous	1
to	1
apprehend	1
me:	1
11:33	1
And	1
through	1
a	1
window	1
in	1
a	1
basket	1
was	1
I	1
let	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
escaped	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
12:1	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
expedient	1
for	1
me	1
doubtless	1
to	1
glory.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
visions	1
and	1
revelations	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:2	1
I	1
knew	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Christ	1
above	1
fourteen	1
years	1
ago,	1
(whether	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell;	1
or	1
whether	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell:	1
God	1
knoweth;)	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
caught	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
(whether	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell:	1
God	1
knoweth;)	1
12:4	1
How	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
into	1
paradise,	1
and	1
heard	1
unspeakable	1
words,	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
utter.	1
	1
12:5	1
Of	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
will	1
I	1
glory:	1
yet	1
of	1
myself	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
glory,	1
but	1
in	1
mine	1
infirmities.	1
	1
12:6	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
desire	1
to	1
glory,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
fool;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
the	1
truth:	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
forbear,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seeth	1
me	1
to	1
be,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
heareth	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
measure	1
through	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
revelations,	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
thorn	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
Satan	1
to	1
buffet	1
me,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
measure.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
this	1
thing	1
I	1
besought	1
the	1
Lord	1
thrice,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
depart	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
grace	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
thee:	1
for	1
my	1
strength	1
is	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
weakness.	1
Most	1
gladly	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
rather	1
glory	1
in	1
my	1
infirmities,	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Christ	1
may	1
rest	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
12:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
take	1
pleasure	1
in	1
infirmities,	1
in	1
reproaches,	1
in	1
necessities,	1
in	1
persecutions,	1
in	1
distresses	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake:	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
weak,	1
then	1
am	1
I	1
strong.	1
	1
12:11	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
glorying;	1
ye	1
have	1
compelled	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
commended	1
of	1
you:	1
for	1
in	1
nothing	1
am	1
I	1
behind	1
the	1
very	1
chiefest	1
apostles,	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
nothing.	1
	1
12:12	1
Truly	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
an	1
apostle	1
were	1
wrought	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
patience,	1
in	1
signs,	1
and	1
wonders,	1
and	1
mighty	1
deeds.	1
	1
12:13	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
wherein	1
ye	1
were	1
inferior	1
to	1
other	1
churches,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
myself	1
was	1
not	1
burdensome	1
to	1
you?	1
forgive	1
me	1
this	1
wrong.	1
	1
12:14	1
Behold,	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
burdensome	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
your's	1
but	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
parents,	1
but	1
the	1
parents	1
for	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
very	1
gladly	1
spend	1
and	1
be	1
spent	1
for	1
you;	1
though	1
the	1
more	1
abundantly	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
the	1
less	1
I	1
be	1
loved.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
be	1
it	1
so,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
burden	1
you:	1
nevertheless,	1
being	1
crafty,	1
I	1
caught	1
you	1
with	1
guile.	1
	1
12:17	1
Did	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
gain	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
whom	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you?	1
12:18	1
I	1
desired	1
Titus,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
sent	1
a	1
brother.	1
Did	1
Titus	1
make	1
a	1
gain	1
of	1
you?	1
walked	1
we	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
spirit?	1
walked	1
we	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
steps?	1
	1
12:19	1
Again,	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
we	1
excuse	1
ourselves	1
unto	1
you?	1
we	1
speak	1
before	1
God	1
in	1
Christ:	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
all	1
things,	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
for	1
your	1
edifying.	1
	1
12:20	1
For	1
I	1
fear,	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
come,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
unto	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
ye	1
would	1
not:	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
debates,	1
envyings,	1
wraths,	1
strifes,	1
backbitings,	1
whisperings,	1
swellings,	1
tumults:	1
12:21	1
And	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
my	1
God	1
will	1
humble	1
me	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
bewail	1
many	1
which	1
have	1
sinned	1
already,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
fornication	1
and	1
lasciviousness	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed.	1
	1
13:1	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
coming	1
to	1
you.	1
In	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses	1
shall	1
every	1
word	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
13:2	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
before,	1
and	1
foretell	1
you,	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
present,	1
the	1
second	1
time;	1
and	1
being	1
absent	1
now	1
I	1
write	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
heretofore	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
other,	1
that,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
spare:	1
13:3	1
Since	1
ye	1
seek	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
Christ	1
speaking	1
in	1
me,	1
which	1
to	1
you-ward	1
is	1
not	1
weak,	1
but	1
is	1
mighty	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
13:4	1
For	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
crucified	1
through	1
weakness,	1
yet	1
he	1
liveth	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
For	1
we	1
also	1
are	1
weak	1
in	1
him,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
toward	1
you.	1
	1
13:5	1
Examine	1
yourselves,	1
whether	1
ye	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
faith;	1
prove	1
your	1
own	1
selves.	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
your	1
own	1
selves,	1
how	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
except	1
ye	1
be	1
reprobates?	1
	1
13:6	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
reprobates.	1
	1
13:7	1
Now	1
I	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
no	1
evil;	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
appear	1
approved,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
honest,	1
though	1
we	1
be	1
as	1
reprobates.	1
	1
13:8	1
For	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
glad,	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
weak,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
strong:	1
and	1
this	1
also	1
we	1
wish,	1
even	1
your	1
perfection.	1
	1
13:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
write	1
these	1
things	1
being	1
absent,	1
lest	1
being	1
present	1
I	1
should	1
use	1
sharpness,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
edification,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
destruction.	1
	1
13:11	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
farewell.	1
Be	1
perfect,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
be	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
live	1
in	1
peace;	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
13:12	1
Greet	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
13:13	1
All	1
the	1
saints	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
13:14	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Galatians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle,	1
(not	1
of	1
men,	1
neither	1
by	1
man,	1
but	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
raised	1

from	1
the	1

1:2	1
And	1
all	1

which	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
unto	1
the	1

of	1
Galatia:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
the	1

and	1
from	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
1:4	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
our	1
sins,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
this	1
present	1
evil	1
world,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1

1:5	1
To	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:6	1
I	1
marvel	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
so	1
soon	1
removed	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
called	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
another	1
gospel:	1
1:7	1
Which	1
is	1
not	1
another;	1
but	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
that	1
trouble	1
you,	1
and	1
would	1
pervert	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
though	1
we,	1
or	1
an	1
angel	1
from	1
heaven,	1
preach	1
any	1
other	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
1:9	1
As	1
we	1
said	1
before,	1
so	1
say	1
I	1
now	1
again,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
preach	1
any	1
other	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
do	1
I	1
now	1
persuade	1
men,	1
or	1
God?	1
or	1
do	1
I	1
seek	1
to	1
please	1
men?	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
yet	1
pleased	1
men,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:11	1
But	1
I	1
certify	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
was	1
preached	1
of	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
after	1
man.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
I	1
neither	1
received	1
it	1
of	1
man,	1
neither	1
was	1
I	1
taught	1
it,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
conversation	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
religion,	1
how	1
that	1
beyond	1
measure	1
I	1
persecuted	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
wasted	1
it:	1
1:14	1
And	1
profited	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
religion	1
above	1
many	1
my	1
equals	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
nation,	1
being	1
more	1
exceedingly	1
zealous	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
my	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:15	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
pleased	1
God,	1
who	1
separated	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
and	1
called	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
grace,	1
1:16	1
To	1
reveal	1
his	1
Son	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
preach	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
heathen;	1
immediately	1
I	1
conferred	1
not	1
with	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood:	1
1:17	1
Neither	1
went	1
I	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
apostles	1
before	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
returned	1
again	1
unto	1
Damascus.	1
	1
1:18	1
Then	1
after	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
see	1
Peter,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
fifteen	1
days.	1
	1
1:19	1
But	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
saw	1
I	1
none,	1
save	1
James	1
the	1
Lord's	1
brother.	1
	1
1:20	1
Now	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
behold,	1
before	1
God,	1
I	1
lie	1
not.	1
	1
1:21	1
Afterwards	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia;	1
1:22	1
And	1
was	1
unknown	1
by	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Judaea	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Christ:	1
1:23	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
only,	1
That	1
he	1
which	1
persecuted	1
us	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
now	1
preacheth	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
once	1
he	1
destroyed.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
glorified	1
God	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
2:1	1
Then	1
fourteen	1
years	1
after	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
took	1
Titus	1
with	1
me	1
also.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
revelation,	1
and	1
communicated	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
but	1
privately	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
reputation,	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
should	1
run,	1
or	1
had	1
run,	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
2:3	1
But	1
neither	1
Titus,	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
me,	1
being	1
a	1
Greek,	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised:	1
2:4	1
And	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
false	1
brethren	1
unawares	1
brought	1
in,	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
privily	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
our	1
liberty	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
into	1
bondage:	1
2:5	1
To	1
whom	1
we	1
gave	1
place	1
by	1
subjection,	1
no,	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
hour;	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
might	1
continue	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
of	1
these	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat,	1
(whatsoever	1
they	1
were,	1
it	1
maketh	1
no	1
matter	1
to	1
me:	1
God	1
accepteth	1
no	1
man's	1
person:)	1
for	1
they	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat	1
in	1
conference	1
added	1
nothing	1
to	1
me:	1
2:7	1
But	1
contrariwise,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
was	1
committed	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
was	1
unto	1
Peter;	1
2:8	1
(For	1
he	1
that	1
wrought	1
effectually	1
in	1
Peter	1
to	1
the	1
apostleship	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision,	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
mighty	1
in	1
me	1
toward	1
the	1
Gentiles:)	1
2:9	1
And	1
when	1
James,	1
Cephas,	1
and	1
John,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
pillars,	1
perceived	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
they	1
gave	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
the	1
right	1
hands	1
of	1
fellowship;	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
they	1
unto	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
2:10	1
Only	1
they	1
would	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
remember	1
the	1
poor;	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
forward	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
2:11	1
But	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
I	1
withstood	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
face,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
blamed.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
before	1
that	1
certain	1
came	1
from	1
James,	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
with	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
and	1
separated	1
himself,	1
fearing	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
Jews	1
dissembled	1
likewise	1
with	1
him;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
Barnabas	1
also	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
with	1
their	1
dissimulation.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
walked	1
not	1
uprightly	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter	1
before	1
them	1
all,	1
If	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
Jew,	1
livest	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
do	1
the	1
Jews,	1
why	1
compellest	1
thou	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
live	1
as	1
do	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
2:15	1
We	1
who	1
are	1
Jews	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
not	1
sinners	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
2:16	1
Knowing	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
even	1
we	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
2:17	1
But	1
if,	1
while	1
we	1
seek	1
to	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
Christ,	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
are	1
found	1
sinners,	1
is	1
therefore	1
Christ	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
sin?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
destroyed,	1
I	1
make	1
myself	1
a	1
transgressor.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
I	1
through	1
the	1
law	1
am	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
live	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
2:20	1
I	1
am	1
crucified	1
with	1
Christ:	1
neverthless	1
I	1
live;	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
Christ	1
liveth	1
in	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
live	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
2:21	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
frustrate	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
if	1
righteousness	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
law,	1
then	1
Christ	1
is	1
dead	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:1	1
O	1
foolish	1
Galatians,	1
who	1
hath	1
bewitched	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth,	1
before	1
whose	1
eyes	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
been	1
evidently	1
set	1
forth,	1
crucified	1
among	1
you?	1
	1
3:2	1
This	1
only	1
would	1
I	1
learn	1
of	1
you,	1
Received	1
ye	1
the	1
Spirit	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
faith?	1
	1
3:3	1
Are	1
ye	1
so	1
foolish?	1
having	1
begun	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
are	1
ye	1
now	1
made	1
perfect	1
by	1
the	1
flesh?	1
	1
3:4	1
Have	1
ye	1
suffered	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
in	1
vain?	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
yet	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
therefore	1
that	1
ministereth	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
worketh	1
miracles	1
among	1
you,	1
doeth	1
he	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
faith?	1
	1
3:6	1
Even	1
as	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
accounted	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:7	1
Know	1
ye	1
therefore	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
faith,	1
the	1
same	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
the	1
scripture,	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
justify	1
the	1
heathen	1
through	1
faith,	1
preached	1
before	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
saying,	1
In	1
thee	1
shall	1
all	1
nations	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
3:9	1
So	1
then	1
they	1
which	1
be	1
of	1
faith	1
are	1
blessed	1
with	1
faithful	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
curse:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Cursed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
continueth	1
not	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
3:11	1
But	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
it	1
is	1
evident:	1
for,	1
The	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
faith:	1
but,	1
The	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
them	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:13	1
Christ	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
being	1
made	1
a	1
curse	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Cursed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hangeth	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
3:14	1
That	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
Abraham	1
might	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
through	1
faith.	1
	1
3:15	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
speak	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men;	1
Though	1
it	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
man's	1
covenant,	1
yet	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
confirmed,	1
no	1
man	1
disannulleth,	1
or	1
addeth	1
thereto.	1
	1
3:16	1
Now	1
to	1
Abraham	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
were	1
the	1
promises	1
made.	1
He	1
saith	1
not,	1
And	1
to	1
seeds,	1
as	1
of	1
many;	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
one,	1
And	1
to	1
thy	1
seed,	1
which	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
covenant,	1
that	1
was	1
confirmed	1
before	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ,	1
the	1
law,	1
which	1
was	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years	1
after,	1
cannot	1
disannul,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
make	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
3:18	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
inheritance	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
promise:	1
but	1
God	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Abraham	1
by	1
promise.	1
	1
3:19	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
serveth	1
the	1
law?	1
It	1
was	1
added	1
because	1
of	1
transgressions,	1
till	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
promise	1
was	1
made;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
ordained	1
by	1
angels	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
mediator.	1
	1
3:20	1
Now	1
a	1
mediator	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mediator	1
of	1
one,	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
one.	1
	1
3:21	1
Is	1
the	1
law	1
then	1
against	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
God?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
law	1
given	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
life,	1
verily	1
righteousness	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:22	1
But	1
the	1
scripture	1
hath	1
concluded	1
all	1
under	1
sin,	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
by	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
might	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
3:23	1
But	1
before	1
faith	1
came,	1
we	1
were	1
kept	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
shut	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
should	1
afterwards	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
3:24	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
our	1
schoolmaster	1
to	1
bring	1
us	1
unto	1
Christ,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
3:25	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
faith	1
is	1
come,	1
we	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
under	1
a	1
schoolmaster.	1
	1
3:26	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:27	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
have	1
been	1
baptized	1
into	1
Christ	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:28	1
There	1
is	1
neither	1
Jew	1
nor	1
Greek,	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
bond	1
nor	1
free,	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
male	1
nor	1
female:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:29	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
Christ's,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
Abraham's	1
seed,	1
and	1
heirs	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
I	1
say,	1
That	1
the	1
heir,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
child,	1
differeth	1
nothing	1
from	1
a	1
servant,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
lord	1
of	1
all;	1
4:2	1
But	1
is	1
under	1
tutors	1
and	1
governors	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
of	1
the	1
father.	1
	1
4:3	1
Even	1
so	1
we,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
children,	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
under	1
the	1
elements	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
4:4	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come,	1
God	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
Son,	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
made	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
4:5	1
To	1
redeem	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
sons.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
sons,	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
forth	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
into	1
your	1
hearts,	1
crying,	1
Abba,	1
Father.	1
	1
4:7	1
Wherefore	1
thou	1
art	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
servant,	1
but	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
son,	1
then	1
an	1
heir	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:8	1
Howbeit	1
then,	1
when	1
ye	1
knew	1
not	1
God,	1
ye	1
did	1
service	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
by	1
nature	1
are	1
no	1
gods.	1
	1
4:9	1
But	1
now,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
God,	1
or	1
rather	1
are	1
known	1
of	1
God,	1
how	1
turn	1
ye	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
weak	1
and	1
beggarly	1
elements,	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
desire	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
bondage?	1
	1
4:10	1
Ye	1
observe	1
days,	1
and	1
months,	1
and	1
times,	1
and	1
years.	1
	1
4:11	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
you,	1
lest	1
I	1
have	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
you	1
labour	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
4:12	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
be	1
as	1
I	1
am;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
ye	1
are:	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
injured	1
me	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
4:13	1
Ye	1
know	1
how	1
through	1
infirmity	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
my	1
temptation	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
ye	1
despised	1
not,	1
nor	1
rejected;	1
but	1
received	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:15	1
Where	1
is	1
then	1
the	1
blessedness	1
ye	1
spake	1
of?	1
for	1
I	1
bear	1
you	1
record,	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
possible,	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
plucked	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
4:16	1
Am	1
I	1
therefore	1
become	1
your	1
enemy,	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth?	1
4:17	1
They	1
zealously	1
affect	1
you,	1
but	1
not	1
well;	1
yea,	1
they	1
would	1
exclude	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
affect	1
them.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
zealously	1
affected	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
present	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:19	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
travail	1
in	1
birth	1
again	1
until	1
Christ	1
be	1
formed	1
in	1
you,	1
4:20	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
you	1
now,	1
and	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
voice;	1
for	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
doubt	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
4:21	1
Tell	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
that	1
Abraham	1
had	1
two	1
sons,	1
the	1
one	1
by	1
a	1
bondmaid,	1
the	1
other	1
by	1
a	1
freewoman.	1
	1
4:23	1
But	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flesh;	1
but	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
freewoman	1
was	1
by	1
promise.	1
	1
4:24	1
Which	1
things	1
are	1
an	1
allegory:	1
for	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
covenants;	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
which	1
gendereth	1
to	1
bondage,	1
which	1
is	1
Agar.	1
	1
4:25	1
For	1
this	1
Agar	1
is	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
in	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
answereth	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
now	1
is,	1
and	1
is	1
in	1
bondage	1
with	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
4:26	1
But	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
is	1
above	1
is	1
free,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
us	1
all.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Rejoice,	1
thou	1
barren	1
that	1
bearest	1
not;	1
break	1
forth	1
and	1
cry,	1
thou	1
that	1
travailest	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
desolate	1
hath	1
many	1
more	1
children	1
than	1
she	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband.	1
	1
4:28	1
Now	1
we,	1
brethren,	1
as	1
Isaac	1
was,	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
promise.	1
	1
4:29	1
But	1
as	1
then	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
persecuted	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
now.	1
	1
4:30	1
Nevertheless	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture?	1
Cast	1
out	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
and	1
her	1
son:	1
for	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
heir	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
freewoman.	1
	1
4:31	1
So	1
then,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
free.	1
	1
5:1	1
Stand	1
fast	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
liberty	1
wherewith	1
Christ	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
free,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
entangled	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
5:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
Paul	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
Christ	1
shall	1
profit	1
you	1
nothing.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
I	1
testify	1
again	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
debtor	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
whole	1
law.	1
	1
5:4	1
Christ	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
no	1
effect	1
unto	1
you,	1
whosoever	1
of	1
you	1
are	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
ye	1
are	1
fallen	1
from	1
grace.	1
	1
5:5	1
For	1
we	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
righteousness	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
neither	1
circumcision	1
availeth	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
uncircumcision;	1
but	1
faith	1
which	1
worketh	1
by	1
love.	1
	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
did	1
run	1
well;	1
who	1
did	1
hinder	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth?	1
	1
5:8	1
This	1
persuasion	1
cometh	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
calleth	1
you.	1
	1
5:9	1
A	1
little	1
leaven	1
leaveneth	1
the	1
whole	1
lump.	1
	1
5:10	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
otherwise	1
minded:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
troubleth	1
you	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
judgment,	1
whosoever	1
he	1
be.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
if	1
I	1
yet	1
preach	1
circumcision,	1
why	1
do	1
I	1
yet	1
suffer	1
persecution?	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
ceased.	1
	1
5:12	1
I	1
would	1
they	1
were	1
even	1
cut	1
off	1
which	1
trouble	1
you.	1
	1
5:13	1
For,	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
unto	1
liberty;	1
only	1
use	1
not	1
liberty	1
for	1
an	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
by	1
love	1
serve	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
one	1
word,	1
even	1
in	1
this;	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
bite	1
and	1
devour	1
one	1
another,	1
take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
consumed	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
5:16	1
This	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Walk	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fulfil	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
the	1
flesh	1
lusteth	1
against	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
against	1
the	1
flesh:	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
contrary	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other:	1
so	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
would.	1
	1
5:18	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
led	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
5:19	1
Now	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
are	1
manifest,	1
which	1
are	1
these;	1
Adultery,	1
fornication,	1
uncleanness,	1
lasciviousness,	1
5:20	1
Idolatry,	1
witchcraft,	1
hatred,	1
variance,	1
emulations,	1
wrath,	1
strife,	1
seditions,	1
heresies,	1
5:21	1
Envyings,	1
murders,	1
drunkenness,	1
revellings,	1
and	1
such	1
like:	1
of	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
before,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
told	1
you	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
do	1
such	1
things	1
shall	1
not	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
love,	1
joy,	1
peace,	1
longsuffering,	1
gentleness,	1
goodness,	1
faith,	1
5:23	1
Meekness,	1
temperance:	1
against	1
such	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
Christ's	1
have	1
crucified	1
the	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
affections	1
and	1
lusts.	1
	1
5:25	1
If	1
we	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
let	1
us	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:26	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
desirous	1
of	1
vain	1
glory,	1
provoking	1
one	1
another,	1
envying	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
6:1	1
Brethren,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
overtaken	1
in	1
a	1
fault,	1
ye	1
which	1
are	1
spiritual,	1
restore	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
meekness;	1
considering	1
thyself,	1
lest	1
thou	1
also	1
be	1
tempted.	1
	1
6:2	1
Bear	1
ye	1
one	1
another's	1
burdens,	1
and	1
so	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:3	1
For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
something,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
nothing,	1
he	1
deceiveth	1
himself.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
prove	1
his	1
own	1
work,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
have	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
himself	1
alone,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
another.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
own	1
burden.	1
	1
6:6	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
communicate	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
teacheth	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
things.	1
	1
6:7	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived;	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
mocked:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
a	1
man	1
soweth,	1
that	1
shall	1
he	1
also	1
reap.	1
	1
6:8	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
to	1
his	1
flesh	1
shall	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
reap	1
corruption;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
shall	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
reap	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
weary	1
in	1
well	1
doing:	1
for	1
in	1
due	1
season	1
we	1
shall	1
reap,	1
if	1
we	1
faint	1
not.	1
	1
6:10	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
therefore	1
opportunity,	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
good	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
especially	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
6:11	1
Ye	1
see	1
how	1
large	1
a	1
letter	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
6:12	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
shew	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
they	1
constrain	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised;	1
only	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
suffer	1
persecution	1
for	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
neither	1
they	1
themselves	1
who	1
are	1
circumcised	1
keep	1
the	1
law;	1
but	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
glory	1
in	1
your	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:14	1
But	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
glory,	1
save	1
in	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
crucified	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
unto	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:15	1
For	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
neither	1
circumcision	1
availeth	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
uncircumcision,	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
creature.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
walk	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
rule,	1
peace	1
be	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
mercy,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
Israel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:17	1
From	1
henceforth	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
trouble	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
bear	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:18	1
Brethren,	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
spirit.	1
	1
Amen.	1

Paul,	1

to	1
the	1

Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
and	1

of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1

who	1
hath	1

us	1
with	1
all	1
spiritual	1

in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
in	1
Christ:	1
1:4	1
According	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
us	1
in	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
holy	1
and	1
without	1
blame	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
love:	1
1:5	1
Having	1
predestinated	1
us	1
unto	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
children	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
himself,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
1:6	1
To	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
beloved.	1
	1
1:7	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
redemption	1
through	1
his	1
blood,	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
grace;	1
1:8	1
Wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
abounded	1
toward	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
prudence;	1
1:9	1
Having	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
purposed	1
in	1
himself:	1
1:10	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
times	1
he	1
might	1
gather	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
Christ,	1
both	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
on	1
earth;	1
even	1
in	1
him:	1
1:11	1
In	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
have	1
obtained	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
being	1
predestinated	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
worketh	1
all	1
things	1
after	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
will:	1
1:12	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
who	1
first	1
trusted	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
In	1
whom	1
ye	1
also	1
trusted,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
your	1
salvation:	1
in	1
whom	1
also	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
believed,	1
ye	1
were	1
sealed	1
with	1
that	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
promise,	1
1:14	1
Which	1
is	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
until	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
purchased	1
possession,	1
unto	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
1:15	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
also,	1
after	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
love	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:16	1
Cease	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
for	1
you,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
prayers;	1
1:17	1
That	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
glory,	1
may	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
revelation	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him:	1
1:18	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
your	1
understanding	1
being	1
enlightened;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
calling,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:19	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
exceeding	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
us-ward	1
who	1
believe,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
power,	1
1:20	1
Which	1
he	1
wrought	1
in	1
Christ,	1
when	1
he	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
heavenly	1
places,	1
1:21	1
Far	1
above	1
all	1
principality,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
might,	1
and	1
dominion,	1
and	1
every	1
name	1
that	1
is	1
named,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come:	1
1:22	1
And	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
head	1
over	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
the	1
church,	1
1:23	1
Which	1
is	1
his	1
body,	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
filleth	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
you	1
hath	1
he	1
quickened,	1
who	1
were	1
dead	1
in	1
trespasses	1
and	1
sins;	1
2:2	1
Wherein	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
ye	1
walked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
now	1
worketh	1
in	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience:	1
2:3	1
Among	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
all	1
had	1
our	1
conversation	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
our	1
flesh,	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
mind;	1
and	1
were	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
wrath,	1
even	1
as	1
others.	1
	1
2:4	1
But	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
rich	1
in	1
mercy,	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
love	1
wherewith	1
he	1
loved	1
us,	1
2:5	1
Even	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
dead	1
in	1
sins,	1
hath	1
quickened	1
us	1
together	1
with	1
Christ,	1
(by	1
grace	1
ye	1
are	1
saved;)	1
2:6	1
And	1
hath	1
raised	1
us	1
up	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
us	1
sit	1
together	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
2:7	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
ages	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
might	1
shew	1
the	1
exceeding	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
grace	1
in	1
his	1
kindness	1
toward	1
us	1
through	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
by	1
grace	1
are	1
ye	1
saved	1
through	1
faith;	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
of	1
yourselves:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God:	1
2:9	1
Not	1
of	1
works,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
boast.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
workmanship,	1
created	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
good	1
works,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
before	1
ordained	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
2:11	1
Wherefore	1
remember,	1
that	1
ye	1
being	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
who	1
are	1
called	1
Uncircumcision	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Circumcision	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
made	1
by	1
hands;	1
2:12	1
That	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
ye	1
were	1
without	1
Christ,	1
being	1
aliens	1
from	1
the	1
commonwealth	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
strangers	1
from	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
promise,	1
having	1
no	1
hope,	1
and	1
without	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
world:	1
2:13	1
But	1
now	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
ye	1
who	1
sometimes	1
were	1
far	1
off	1
are	1
made	1
nigh	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
peace,	1
who	1
hath	1
made	1
both	1
one,	1
and	1
hath	1
broken	1
down	1
the	1
middle	1
wall	1
of	1
partition	1
between	1
us;	1
2:15	1
Having	1
abolished	1
in	1
his	1
flesh	1
the	1
enmity,	1
even	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
commandments	1
contained	1
in	1
ordinances;	1
for	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
himself	1
of	1
twain	1
one	1
new	1
man,	1
so	1
making	1
peace;	1
2:16	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
reconcile	1
both	1
unto	1
God	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
by	1
the	1
cross,	1
having	1
slain	1
the	1
enmity	1
thereby:	1
2:17	1
And	1
came	1
and	1
preached	1
peace	1
to	1
you	1
which	1
were	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
nigh.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
through	1
him	1
we	1
both	1
have	1
access	1
by	1
one	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:19	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
strangers	1
and	1
foreigners,	1
but	1
fellowcitizens	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
God;	1
2:20	1
And	1
are	1
built	1
upon	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself	1
being	1
the	1
chief	1
corner	1
stone;	1
2:21	1
In	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
building	1
fitly	1
framed	1
together	1
groweth	1
unto	1
an	1
holy	1
temple	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
2:22	1
In	1
whom	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
builded	1
together	1
for	1
an	1
habitation	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
3:1	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
Paul,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
you	1
Gentiles,	1
3:2	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
you-ward:	1
3:3	1
How	1
that	1
by	1
revelation	1
he	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
mystery;	1
(as	1
I	1
wrote	1
afore	1
in	1
few	1
words,	1
3:4	1
Whereby,	1
when	1
ye	1
read,	1
ye	1
may	1
understand	1
my	1
knowledge	1
in	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Christ)	1
3:5	1
Which	1
in	1
other	1
ages	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
revealed	1
unto	1
his	1
holy	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit;	1
3:6	1
That	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
should	1
be	1
fellowheirs,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
body,	1
and	1
partakers	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
in	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
gospel:	1
3:7	1
Whereof	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
minister,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
effectual	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
3:8	1
Unto	1
me,	1
who	1
am	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
saints,	1
is	1
this	1
grace	1
given,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
the	1
unsearchable	1
riches	1
of	1
Christ;	1
3:9	1
And	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
men	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
mystery,	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
been	1
hid	1
in	1
God,	1
who	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:10	1
To	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
now	1
unto	1
the	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
might	1
be	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
the	1
manifold	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God,	1
3:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
eternal	1
purpose	1
which	1
he	1
purposed	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord:	1
3:12	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
boldness	1
and	1
access	1
with	1
confidence	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:13	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
faint	1
not	1
at	1
my	1
tribulations	1
for	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
glory.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
bow	1
my	1
knees	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
3:15	1
Of	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
is	1
named,	1
3:16	1
That	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
you,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
to	1
be	1
strengthened	1
with	1
might	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
in	1
the	1
inner	1
man;	1
3:17	1
That	1
Christ	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
by	1
faith;	1
that	1
ye,	1
being	1
rooted	1
and	1
grounded	1
in	1
love,	1
3:18	1
May	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comprehend	1
with	1
all	1
saints	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
breadth,	1
and	1
length,	1
and	1
depth,	1
and	1
height;	1
3:19	1
And	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ,	1
which	1
passeth	1
knowledge,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:20	1
Now	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
exceeding	1
abundantly	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
ask	1
or	1
think,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
that	1
worketh	1
in	1
us,	1
3:21	1
Unto	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
throughout	1
all	1
ages,	1
world	1
without	1
end.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:1	1
I	1
therefore,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
beseech	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
vocation	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
are	1
called,	1
4:2	1
With	1
all	1
lowliness	1
and	1
meekness,	1
with	1
longsuffering,	1
forbearing	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
love;	1
4:3	1
Endeavouring	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
in	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
4:4	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
body,	1
and	1
one	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
hope	1
of	1
your	1
calling;	1
4:5	1
One	1
Lord,	1
one	1
faith,	1
one	1
baptism,	1
4:6	1
One	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
all,	1
who	1
is	1
above	1
all,	1
and	1
through	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
given	1
grace	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:8	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
When	1
he	1
ascended	1
up	1
on	1
high,	1
he	1
led	1
captivity	1
captive,	1
and	1
gave	1
gifts	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
4:9	1
(Now	1
that	1
he	1
ascended,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
also	1
descended	1
first	1
into	1
the	1
lower	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
4:10	1
He	1
that	1
descended	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
also	1
that	1
ascended	1
up	1
far	1
above	1
all	1
heavens,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
fill	1
all	1
things.)	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
some,	1
apostles;	1
and	1
some,	1
prophets;	1
and	1
some,	1
evangelists;	1
and	1
some,	1
pastors	1
and	1
teachers;	1
4:12	1
For	1
the	1
perfecting	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
ministry,	1
for	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ:	1
4:13	1
Till	1
we	1
all	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
unto	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
stature	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
Christ:	1
4:14	1
That	1
we	1
henceforth	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
children,	1
tossed	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
every	1
wind	1
of	1
doctrine,	1
by	1
the	1
sleight	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
cunning	1
craftiness,	1
whereby	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
to	1
deceive;	1
4:15	1
But	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
love,	1
may	1
grow	1
up	1
into	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
head,	1
even	1
Christ:	1
4:16	1
From	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
fitly	1
joined	1
together	1
and	1
compacted	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
every	1
joint	1
supplieth,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
effectual	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
every	1
part,	1
maketh	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
unto	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
itself	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
4:17	1
This	1
I	1
say	1
therefore,	1
and	1
testify	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
ye	1
henceforth	1
walk	1
not	1
as	1
other	1
Gentiles	1
walk,	1
in	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
their	1
mind,	1
4:18	1
Having	1
the	1
understanding	1
darkened,	1
being	1
alienated	1
from	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
ignorance	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
their	1
heart:	1
4:19	1
Who	1
being	1
past	1
feeling	1
have	1
given	1
themselves	1
over	1
unto	1
lasciviousness,	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
uncleanness	1
with	1
greediness.	1
	1
4:20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
learned	1
Christ;	1
4:21	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
by	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
in	1
Jesus:	1
4:22	1
That	1
ye	1
put	1
off	1
concerning	1
the	1
former	1
conversation	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
corrupt	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
deceitful	1
lusts;	1
4:23	1
And	1
be	1
renewed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
your	1
mind;	1
4:24	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
man,	1
which	1
after	1
God	1
is	1
created	1
in	1
righteousness	1
and	1
true	1
holiness.	1
	1
4:25	1
Wherefore	1
putting	1
away	1
lying,	1
speak	1
every	1
man	1
truth	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
members	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
4:26	1
Be	1
ye	1
angry,	1
and	1
sin	1
not:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
sun	1
go	1
down	1
upon	1
your	1
wrath:	1
4:27	1
Neither	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
4:28	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
stole	1
steal	1
no	1
more:	1
but	1
rather	1
let	1
him	1
labour,	1
working	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
needeth.	1
	1
4:29	1
Let	1
no	1
corrupt	1
communication	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
edifying,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
minister	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
hearers.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
grieve	1
not	1
the	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
whereby	1
ye	1
are	1
sealed	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
redemption.	1
	1
4:31	1
Let	1
all	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
wrath,	1
and	1
anger,	1
and	1
clamour,	1
and	1
evil	1
speaking,	1
be	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
with	1
all	1
malice:	1
4:32	1
And	1
be	1
ye	1
kind	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
tenderhearted,	1
forgiving	1
one	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
God	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake	1
hath	1
forgiven	1
you.	1
	1
5:1	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
followers	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
dear	1
children;	1
5:2	1
And	1
walk	1
in	1
love,	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
hath	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
himself	1
for	1
us	1
an	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
a	1
sweetsmelling	1
savour.	1
	1
5:3	1
But	1
fornication,	1
and	1
all	1
uncleanness,	1
or	1
covetousness,	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
once	1
named	1
among	1
you,	1
as	1
becometh	1
saints;	1
5:4	1
Neither	1
filthiness,	1
nor	1
foolish	1
talking,	1
nor	1
jesting,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
convenient:	1
but	1
rather	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks.	1
	1
5:5	1
For	1
this	1
ye	1
know,	1
that	1
no	1
whoremonger,	1
nor	1
unclean	1
person,	1
nor	1
covetous	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
idolater,	1
hath	1
any	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:6	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you	1
with	1
vain	1
words:	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
cometh	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience.	1
	1
5:7	1
Be	1
not	1
ye	1
therefore	1
partakers	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:8	1
For	1
ye	1
were	1
sometimes	1
darkness,	1
but	1
now	1
are	1
ye	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
walk	1
as	1
children	1
of	1
light:	1
5:9	1
(For	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
goodness	1
and	1
righteousness	1
and	1
truth;)	1
5:10	1
Proving	1
what	1
is	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
have	1
no	1
fellowship	1
with	1
the	1
unfruitful	1
works	1
of	1
darkness,	1
but	1
rather	1
reprove	1
them.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
even	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
done	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
secret.	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
reproved	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
light:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
doth	1
make	1
manifest	1
is	1
light.	1
	1
5:14	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
Awake	1
thou	1
that	1
sleepest,	1
and	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
Christ	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
light.	1
	1
5:15	1
See	1
then	1
that	1
ye	1
walk	1
circumspectly,	1
not	1
as	1
fools,	1
but	1
as	1
wise,	1
5:16	1
Redeeming	1
the	1
time,	1
because	1
the	1
days	1
are	1
evil.	1
	1
5:17	1
Wherefore	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
unwise,	1
but	1
understanding	1
what	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
drunk	1
with	1
wine,	1
wherein	1
is	1
excess;	1
but	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit;	1
5:19	1
Speaking	1
to	1
yourselves	1
in	1
psalms	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
spiritual	1
songs,	1
singing	1
and	1
making	1
melody	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;	1
5:20	1
Giving	1
thanks	1
always	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
5:21	1
Submitting	1
yourselves	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:22	1
Wives,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
your	1
own	1
husbands,	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:23	1
For	1
the	1
husband	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wife,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
church:	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
saviour	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
5:24	1
Therefore	1
as	1
the	1
church	1
is	1
subject	1
unto	1
Christ,	1
so	1
let	1
the	1
wives	1
be	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
husbands	1
in	1
every	1
thing.	1
	1
5:25	1
Husbands,	1
love	1
your	1
wives,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
loved	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
it;	1
5:26	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
sanctify	1
and	1
cleanse	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
water	1
by	1
the	1
word,	1
5:27	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
present	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
glorious	1
church,	1
not	1
having	1
spot,	1
or	1
wrinkle,	1
or	1
any	1
such	1
thing;	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
holy	1
and	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
5:28	1
So	1
ought	1
men	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
wives	1
as	1
their	1
own	1
bodies.	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
wife	1
loveth	1
himself.	1
	1
5:29	1
For	1
no	1
man	1
ever	1
yet	1
hated	1
his	1
own	1
flesh;	1
but	1
nourisheth	1
and	1
cherisheth	1
it,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
church:	1
5:30	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
members	1
of	1
his	1
body,	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
5:31	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:32	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
mystery:	1
but	1
I	1
speak	1
concerning	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
5:33	1
Nevertheless	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
particular	1
so	1
love	1
his	1
wife	1
even	1
as	1
himself;	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
reverence	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
6:1	1
Children,	1
obey	1
your	1
parents	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
right.	1
	1
6:2	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother;	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment	1
with	1
promise;	1
6:3	1
That	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
live	1
long	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:4	1
And,	1
ye	1
fathers,	1
provoke	1
not	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
wrath:	1
but	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
nurture	1
and	1
admonition	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:5	1
Servants,	1
be	1
obedient	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
your	1
masters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling,	1
in	1
singleness	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
as	1
unto	1
Christ;	1
6:6	1
Not	1
with	1
eyeservice,	1
as	1
menpleasers;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Christ,	1
doing	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
heart;	1
6:7	1
With	1
good	1
will	1
doing	1
service,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
men:	1
6:8	1
Knowing	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
good	1
thing	1
any	1
man	1
doeth,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
he	1
receive	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
bond	1
or	1
free.	1
	1
6:9	1
And,	1
ye	1
masters,	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
forbearing	1
threatening:	1
knowing	1
that	1
your	1
Master	1
also	1
is	1
in	1
heaven;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
6:10	1
Finally,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
be	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
might.	1
	1
6:11	1
Put	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
armour	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
6:12	1
For	1
we	1
wrestle	1
not	1
against	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
but	1
against	1
principalities,	1
against	1
powers,	1
against	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
against	1
spiritual	1
wickedness	1
in	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
6:13	1
Wherefore	1
take	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
armour	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
in	1
the	1
evil	1
day,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
all,	1
to	1
stand.	1
	1
6:14	1
Stand	1
therefore,	1
having	1
your	1
loins	1
girt	1
about	1
with	1
truth,	1
and	1
having	1
on	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
righteousness;	1
6:15	1
And	1
your	1
feet	1
shod	1
with	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
peace;	1
6:16	1
Above	1
all,	1
taking	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
faith,	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
quench	1
all	1
the	1
fiery	1
darts	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
take	1
the	1
helmet	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
6:18	1
Praying	1
always	1
with	1
all	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
watching	1
thereunto	1
with	1
all	1
perseverance	1
and	1
supplication	1
for	1
all	1
saints;	1
6:19	1
And	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
utterance	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
boldly,	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
6:20	1
For	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
ambassador	1
in	1
bonds:	1
that	1
therein	1
I	1
may	1
speak	1
boldly,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
6:21	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
know	1
my	1
affairs,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
do,	1
Tychicus,	1
a	1
beloved	1
brother	1
and	1
faithful	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
things:	1
6:22	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
our	1
affairs,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
comfort	1
your	1
hearts.	1
	1
6:23	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
love	1
with	1
faith,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:24	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
sincerity.	1
	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Philippians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Philippi,	1
with	1
the	1
bishops	1
and	1

1:2	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1

	1
1:3	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
upon	1
every	1
remembrance	1
of	1
you,	1
1:4	1
Always	1
in	1
every	1
prayer	1
of	1
mine	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
making	1
request	1
with	1
joy,	1
1:5	1
For	1
your	1
fellowship	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
until	1
now;	1
1:6	1
Being	1
confident	1
of	1
this	1
very	1
thing,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
begun	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
in	1
you	1
will	1
perform	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:7	1
Even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
meet	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
this	1
of	1
you	1
all,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
heart;	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
both	1
in	1
my	1
bonds,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
and	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
my	1
grace.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
record,	1
how	1
greatly	1
I	1
long	1
after	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
pray,	1
that	1
your	1
love	1
may	1
abound	1
yet	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
in	1
knowledge	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
judgment;	1
1:10	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
approve	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
excellent;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
sincere	1
and	1
without	1
offence	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:11	1
Being	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
are	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
unto	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
ye	1
should	1
understand,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
happened	1
unto	1
me	1
have	1
fallen	1
out	1
rather	1
unto	1
the	1
furtherance	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:13	1
So	1
that	1
my	1
bonds	1
in	1
Christ	1
are	1
manifest	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
other	1
places;	1
1:14	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
waxing	1
confident	1
by	1
my	1
bonds,	1
are	1
much	1
more	1
bold	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
word	1
without	1
fear.	1
	1
1:15	1
Some	1
indeed	1
preach	1
Christ	1
even	1
of	1
envy	1
and	1
strife;	1
and	1
some	1
also	1
of	1
good	1
will:	1
1:16	1
The	1
one	1
preach	1
Christ	1
of	1
contention,	1
not	1
sincerely,	1
supposing	1
to	1
add	1
affliction	1
to	1
my	1
bonds:	1
1:17	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
love,	1
knowing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
1:18	1
What	1
then?	1
notwithstanding,	1
every	1
way,	1
whether	1
in	1
pretence,	1
or	1
in	1
truth,	1
Christ	1
is	1
preached;	1
and	1
I	1
therein	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
yea,	1
and	1
will	1
rejoice.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
my	1
salvation	1
through	1
your	1
prayer,	1
and	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
1:20	1
According	1
to	1
my	1
earnest	1
expectation	1
and	1
my	1
hope,	1
that	1
in	1
nothing	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
but	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
boldness,	1
as	1
always,	1
so	1
now	1
also	1
Christ	1
shall	1
be	1
magnified	1
in	1
my	1
body,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
life,	1
or	1
by	1
death.	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
live	1
is	1
Christ,	1
and	1
to	1
die	1
is	1
gain.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
labour:	1
yet	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
choose	1
I	1
wot	1
not.	1
	1
1:23	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
strait	1
betwixt	1
two,	1
having	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
depart,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Christ;	1
which	1
is	1
far	1
better:	1
1:24	1
Nevertheless	1
to	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
more	1
needful	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
having	1
this	1
confidence,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
abide	1
and	1
continue	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
furtherance	1
and	1
joy	1
of	1
faith;	1
1:26	1
That	1
your	1
rejoicing	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
abundant	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
1:27	1
Only	1
let	1
your	1
conversation	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
becometh	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
that	1
whether	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you,	1
or	1
else	1
be	1
absent,	1
I	1
may	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
affairs,	1
that	1
ye	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
one	1
spirit,	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
striving	1
together	1
for	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:28	1
And	1
in	1
nothing	1
terrified	1
by	1
your	1
adversaries:	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
evident	1
token	1
of	1
perdition,	1
but	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:29	1
For	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
behalf	1
of	1
Christ,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
believe	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
his	1
sake;	1
1:30	1
Having	1
the	1
same	1
conflict	1
which	1
ye	1
saw	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
now	1
hear	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
2:1	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
therefore	1
any	1
consolation	1
in	1
Christ,	1
if	1
any	1
comfort	1
of	1
love,	1
if	1
any	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
if	1
any	1
bowels	1
and	1
mercies,	1
2:2	1
Fulfil	1
ye	1
my	1
joy,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
likeminded,	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
love,	1
being	1
of	1
one	1
accord,	1
of	1
one	1
mind.	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
nothing	1
be	1
done	1
through	1
strife	1
or	1
vainglory;	1
but	1
in	1
lowliness	1
of	1
mind	1
let	1
each	1
esteem	1
other	1
better	1
than	1
themselves.	1
	1
2:4	1
Look	1
not	1
every	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
things,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
others.	1
	1
2:5	1
Let	1
this	1
mind	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
2:6	1
Who,	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
God,	1
thought	1
it	1
not	1
robbery	1
to	1
be	1
equal	1
with	1
God:	1
2:7	1
But	1
made	1
himself	1
of	1
no	1
reputation,	1
and	1
took	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
servant,	1
and	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
men:	1
2:8	1
And	1
being	1
found	1
in	1
fashion	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
humbled	1
himself,	1
and	1
became	1
obedient	1
unto	1
death,	1
even	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
2:9	1
Wherefore	1
God	1
also	1
hath	1
highly	1
exalted	1
him,	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
name	1
which	1
is	1
above	1
every	1
name:	1
2:10	1
That	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
every	1
knee	1
should	1
bow,	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
things	1
in	1
earth,	1
and	1
things	1
under	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:11	1
And	1
that	1
every	1
tongue	1
should	1
confess	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
Lord,	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:12	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
beloved,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
always	1
obeyed,	1
not	1
as	1
in	1
my	1
presence	1
only,	1
but	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
absence,	1
work	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
salvation	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
God	1
which	1
worketh	1
in	1
you	1
both	1
to	1
will	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure.	1
	1
2:14	1
Do	1
all	1
things	1
without	1
murmurings	1
and	1
disputings:	1
2:15	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blameless	1
and	1
harmless,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
without	1
rebuke,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
crooked	1
and	1
perverse	1
nation,	1
among	1
whom	1
ye	1
shine	1
as	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
2:16	1
Holding	1
forth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
life;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
run	1
in	1
vain,	1
neither	1
laboured	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
2:17	1
Yea,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
service	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
I	1
joy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
cause	1
also	1
do	1
ye	1
joy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
to	1
send	1
Timotheus	1
shortly	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
when	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
state.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
man	1
likeminded,	1
who	1
will	1
naturally	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
state.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
all	1
seek	1
their	1
own,	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
Jesus	1
Christ's.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
him,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
son	1
with	1
the	1
father,	1
he	1
hath	1
served	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
2:23	1
Him	1
therefore	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
send	1
presently,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
myself	1
shall	1
come	1
shortly.	1
	1
2:25	1
Yet	1
I	1
supposed	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
you	1
Epaphroditus,	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
companion	1
in	1
labour,	1
and	1
fellowsoldier,	1
but	1
your	1
messenger,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
ministered	1
to	1
my	1
wants.	1
	1
2:26	1
For	1
he	1
longed	1
after	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
heaviness,	1
because	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sick.	1
	1
2:27	1
For	1
indeed	1
he	1
was	1
sick	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death:	1
but	1
God	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
him	1
only,	1
but	1
on	1
me	1
also,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sorrow	1
upon	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:28	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
therefore	1
the	1
more	1
carefully,	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
him	1
again,	1
ye	1
may	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
less	1
sorrowful.	1
	1
2:29	1
Receive	1
him	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
gladness;	1
and	1
hold	1
such	1
in	1
reputation:	1
2:30	1
Because	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Christ	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death,	1
not	1
regarding	1
his	1
life,	1
to	1
supply	1
your	1
lack	1
of	1
service	1
toward	1
me.	1
	1
3:1	1
Finally,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
To	1
write	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
me	1
indeed	1
is	1
not	1
grievous,	1
but	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
safe.	1
	1
3:2	1
Beware	1
of	1
dogs,	1
beware	1
of	1
evil	1
workers,	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
concision.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
circumcision,	1
which	1
worship	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
3:4	1
Though	1
I	1
might	1
also	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
If	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
thinketh	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
whereof	1
he	1
might	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
I	1
more:	1
3:5	1
Circumcised	1
the	1
eighth	1
day,	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
Israel,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews;	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
law,	1
a	1
Pharisee;	1
3:6	1
Concerning	1
zeal,	1
persecuting	1
the	1
church;	1
touching	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
what	1
things	1
were	1
gain	1
to	1
me,	1
those	1
I	1
counted	1
loss	1
for	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:8	1
Yea	1
doubtless,	1
and	1
I	1
count	1
all	1
things	1
but	1
loss	1
for	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
my	1
Lord:	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
do	1
count	1
them	1
but	1
dung,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
win	1
Christ,	1
3:9	1
And	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
him,	1
not	1
having	1
mine	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
through	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ,	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
faith:	1
3:10	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
his	1
sufferings,	1
being	1
made	1
conformable	1
unto	1
his	1
death;	1
3:11	1
If	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
might	1
attain	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
3:12	1
Not	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
attained,	1
either	1
were	1
already	1
perfect:	1
but	1
I	1
follow	1
after,	1
if	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
apprehend	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
apprehended	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:13	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
count	1
not	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
apprehended:	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
do,	1
forgetting	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
behind,	1
and	1
reaching	1
forth	1
unto	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
before,	1
3:14	1
I	1
press	1
toward	1
the	1
mark	1
for	1
the	1
prize	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
calling	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:15	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
be	1
perfect,	1
be	1
thus	1
minded:	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
any	1
thing	1
ye	1
be	1
otherwise	1
minded,	1
God	1
shall	1
reveal	1
even	1
this	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:16	1
Nevertheless,	1
whereto	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
attained,	1
let	1
us	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
rule,	1
let	1
us	1
mind	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
	1
3:17	1
Brethren,	1
be	1
followers	1
together	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
mark	1
them	1
which	1
walk	1
so	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
us	1
for	1
an	1
ensample.	1
	1
3:18	1
(For	1
many	1
walk,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
often,	1
and	1
now	1
tell	1
you	1
even	1
weeping,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ:	1
3:19	1
Whose	1
end	1
is	1
destruction,	1
whose	1
God	1
is	1
their	1
belly,	1
and	1
whose	1
glory	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
shame,	1
who	1
mind	1
earthly	1
things.)	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
our	1
conversation	1
is	1
in	1
heaven;	1
from	1
whence	1
also	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
Saviour,	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:21	1
Who	1
shall	1
change	1
our	1
vile	1
body,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fashioned	1
like	1
unto	1
his	1
glorious	1
body,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
working	1
whereby	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
even	1
to	1
subdue	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
himself.	1
	1
4:1	1
Therefore,	1
my	1
brethren	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
and	1
longed	1
for,	1
my	1
joy	1
and	1
crown,	1
so	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved.	1
	1
4:2	1
I	1
beseech	1
Euodias,	1
and	1
beseech	1
Syntyche,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
I	1
intreat	1
thee	1
also,	1
true	1
yokefellow,	1
help	1
those	1
women	1
which	1
laboured	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
gospel,	1
with	1
Clement	1
also,	1
and	1
with	1
other	1
my	1
fellowlabourers,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
4:4	1
Rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
alway:	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
say,	1
Rejoice.	1
	1
4:5	1
Let	1
your	1
moderation	1
be	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:6	1
Be	1
careful	1
for	1
nothing;	1
but	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
let	1
your	1
requests	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
passeth	1
all	1
understanding,	1
shall	1
keep	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
minds	1
through	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:8	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
true,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
honest,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
just,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
pure,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
lovely,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
of	1
good	1
report;	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
virtue,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
praise,	1
think	1
on	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
4:9	1
Those	1
things,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
both	1
learned,	1
and	1
received,	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
seen	1
in	1
me,	1
do:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:10	1
But	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
greatly,	1
that	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
your	1
care	1
of	1
me	1
hath	1
flourished	1
again;	1
wherein	1
ye	1
were	1
also	1
careful,	1
but	1
ye	1
lacked	1
opportunity.	1
	1
4:11	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
want:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
learned,	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
state	1
I	1
am,	1
therewith	1
to	1
be	1
content.	1
	1
4:12	1
I	1
know	1
both	1
how	1
to	1
be	1
abased,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
abound:	1
every	1
where	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
am	1
instructed	1
both	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
hungry,	1
both	1
to	1
abound	1
and	1
to	1
suffer	1
need.	1
	1
4:13	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
through	1
Christ	1
which	1
strengtheneth	1
me.	1
	1
4:14	1
Notwithstanding	1
ye	1
have	1
well	1
done,	1
that	1
ye	1
did	1
communicate	1
with	1
my	1
affliction.	1
	1
4:15	1
Now	1
ye	1
Philippians	1
know	1
also,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
when	1
I	1
departed	1
from	1
Macedonia,	1
no	1
church	1
communicated	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
concerning	1
giving	1
and	1
receiving,	1
but	1
ye	1
only.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
even	1
in	1
Thessalonica	1
ye	1
sent	1
once	1
and	1
again	1
unto	1
my	1
necessity.	1
	1
4:17	1
Not	1
because	1
I	1
desire	1
a	1
gift:	1
but	1
I	1
desire	1
fruit	1
that	1
may	1
abound	1
to	1
your	1
account.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
all,	1
and	1
abound:	1
I	1
am	1
full,	1
having	1
received	1
of	1
Epaphroditus	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
you,	1
an	1
odour	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
smell,	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
acceptable,	1
wellpleasing	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
supply	1
all	1
your	1
need	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
riches	1
in	1
glory	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:20	1
Now	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:21	1
Salute	1
every	1
saint	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
The	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
greet	1
you.	1
	1
4:22	1
All	1
the	1
saints	1
salute	1
you,	1
chiefly	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
Caesar's	1
household.	1
	1
4:23	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1

thanks	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
praying	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
1:4	1
	1
Since	1
we	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:5	1
	1
For	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
heaven,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
heard	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:6	1
	1
Which	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
as	1
it	1
doth	1
also	1
in	1
you,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
ye	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
knew	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth:	1
1:7	1
	1
As	1
ye	1
also	1
learned	1
of	1
Epaphras	1
our	1
dear	1
fellowservant,	1
who	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
a	1
faithful	1
minister	1
of	1
Christ;	1
1:8	1
	1
Who	1
also	1
declared	1
unto	1
us	1
your	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
1:9	1
	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
we	1
also,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
heard	1
it,	1
do	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
spiritual	1
understanding;	1
1:10	1
	1
That	1
ye	1
might	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
all	1
pleasing,	1
being	1
fruitful	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
work,	1
and	1
increasing	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God;	1

	1
Strengthened	1
with	1
all	1
might,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
glorious	1
power,	1

patience	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
with	1
joyfulness;	1
1:12	1
	1
Giving	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
which	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
in	1
light:	1
1:13	1
	1
Who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
hath	1
translated	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
his	1
dear	1
Son:	1
1:14	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
redemption	1
through	1
his	1
blood,	1
even	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins:	1
1:15	1
	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
invisible	1
God,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
every	1
creature:	1
1:16	1
	1
For	1
by	1
him	1
were	1
all	1
things	1
created,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
earth,	1
visible	1
and	1
invisible,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
thrones,	1
or	1
dominions,	1
or	1
principalities,	1
or	1
powers:	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
created	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
for	1
him:	1
1:17	1
	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
before	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
consist.	1
	1
1:18	1
	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
the	1
church:	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
beginning,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence.	1
	1
1:19	1
	1
For	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
all	1
fulness	1
dwell;	1
1:20	1
	1
And,	1
having	1
made	1
peace	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
cross,	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
reconcile	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
himself;	1
by	1
him,	1
I	1
say,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
things	1
in	1
earth,	1
or	1
things	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:21	1
	1
And	1
you,	1
that	1
were	1
sometime	1
alienated	1
and	1
enemies	1
in	1
your	1
mind	1
by	1
wicked	1
works,	1
yet	1
now	1
hath	1
he	1
reconciled	1
1:22	1
	1
In	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
through	1
death,	1
to	1
present	1
you	1
holy	1
and	1
unblameable	1
and	1
unreproveable	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
1:23	1
	1
If	1
ye	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
grounded	1
and	1
settled,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
preached	1
to	1
every	1
creature	1
which	1
is	1
under	1
heaven;	1
whereof	1
I	1
Paul	1
am	1
made	1
a	1
minister;	1
1:24	1
	1
Who	1
now	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
sufferings	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
fill	1
up	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
behind	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
Christ	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
for	1
his	1
body's	1
sake,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
church:	1
1:25	1
	1
Whereof	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
a	1
minister,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God;	1
1:26	1
	1
Even	1
the	1
mystery	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
hid	1
from	1
ages	1
and	1
from	1
generations,	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
made	1
manifest	1
to	1
his	1
saints:	1
1:27	1
	1
To	1
whom	1
God	1
would	1
make	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
mystery	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
which	1
is	1
Christ	1
in	1
you,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
glory:	1
1:28	1
	1
Whom	1
we	1
preach,	1
warning	1
every	1
man,	1
and	1
teaching	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
present	1
every	1
man	1
perfect	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
1:29	1
	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
also	1
labour,	1
striving	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
working,	1
which	1
worketh	1
in	1
me	1
mightily.	1
	1
2:1	1
	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
knew	1
what	1
great	1
conflict	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
my	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
flesh;	1
2:2	1
	1
That	1
their	1
hearts	1
might	1
be	1
comforted,	1
being	1
knit	1
together	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
understanding,	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledgement	1
of	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
of	1
Christ;	1
2:3	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
are	1
hid	1
all	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge.	1
	1
2:4	1
	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
beguile	1
you	1
with	1
enticing	1
words.	1
	1
2:5	1
	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
absent	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
joying	1
and	1
beholding	1
your	1
order,	1
and	1
the	1
stedfastness	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:6	1
	1
As	1
ye	1
have	1
therefore	1
received	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Lord,	1
so	1
walk	1
ye	1
in	1
him:	1
2:7	1
	1
Rooted	1
and	1
built	1
up	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
stablished	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
taught,	1
abounding	1
therein	1
with	1
thanksgiving.	1
	1
2:8	1
	1
Beware	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
spoil	1
you	1
through	1
philosophy	1
and	1
vain	1
deceit,	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
men,	1
after	1
the	1
rudiments	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:9	1
	1
For	1
in	1
him	1
dwelleth	1
all	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Godhead	1
bodily.	1
	1
2:10	1
	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
complete	1
in	1
him,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
all	1
principality	1
and	1
power:	1
2:11	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
circumcised	1
with	1
the	1
circumcision	1
made	1
without	1
hands,	1
in	1
putting	1
off	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
by	1
the	1
circumcision	1
of	1
Christ:	1
2:12	1
	1
Buried	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
baptism,	1
wherein	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
risen	1
with	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
2:13	1
	1
And	1
you,	1
being	1
dead	1
in	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
of	1
your	1
flesh,	1
hath	1
he	1
quickened	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
having	1
forgiven	1
you	1
all	1
trespasses;	1
2:14	1
	1
Blotting	1
out	1
the	1
handwriting	1
of	1
ordinances	1
that	1
was	1
against	1
us,	1
which	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
nailing	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
cross;	1
2:15	1
	1
And	1
having	1
spoiled	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
shew	1
of	1
them	1
openly,	1
triumphing	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
2:16	1
	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
therefore	1
judge	1
you	1
in	1
meat,	1
or	1
in	1
drink,	1
or	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
an	1
holyday,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
moon,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days:	1
2:17	1
	1
Which	1
are	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
but	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:18	1
	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
beguile	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
a	1
voluntary	1
humility	1
and	1
worshipping	1
of	1
angels,	1
intruding	1
into	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen,	1
vainly	1
puffed	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
fleshly	1
mind,	1
2:19	1
	1
And	1
not	1
holding	1
the	1
Head,	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
body	1
by	1
joints	1
and	1
bands	1
having	1
nourishment	1
ministered,	1
and	1
knit	1
together,	1
increaseth	1
with	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:20	1
	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
rudiments	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
why,	1
as	1
though	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
are	1
ye	1
subject	1
to	1
ordinances,	1
2:21	1
	1
(Touch	1
not;	1
taste	1
not;	1
handle	1
not;	1
2:22	1
	1
Which	1
all	1
are	1
to	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
using;)	1
after	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
doctrines	1
of	1
men?	1
2:23	1
	1
Which	1
things	1
have	1
indeed	1
a	1
shew	1
of	1
wisdom	1
in	1
will	1
worship,	1
and	1
humility,	1
and	1
neglecting	1
of	1
the	1
body:	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
honour	1
to	1
the	1
satisfying	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
3:1	1
	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
be	1
risen	1
with	1
Christ,	1
seek	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
above,	1
where	1
Christ	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:2	1
	1
Set	1
your	1
affection	1
on	1
things	1
above,	1
not	1
on	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:3	1
	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
dead,	1
and	1
your	1
life	1
is	1
hid	1
with	1
Christ	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
3:4	1
	1
When	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
our	1
life,	1
shall	1
appear,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
also	1
appear	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
3:5	1
	1
Mortify	1
therefore	1
your	1
members	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
fornication,	1
uncleanness,	1
inordinate	1
affection,	1
evil	1
concupiscence,	1
and	1
covetousness,	1
which	1
is	1
idolatry:	1
3:6	1
	1
For	1
which	1
things'	1
sake	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
cometh	1
on	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience:	1
3:7	1
	1
In	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
also	1
walked	1
some	1
time,	1
when	1
ye	1
lived	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:8	1
	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
also	1
put	1
off	1
all	1
these;	1
anger,	1
wrath,	1
malice,	1
blasphemy,	1
filthy	1
communication	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
3:9	1
	1
Lie	1
not	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
deeds;	1
3:10	1
	1
And	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
renewed	1
in	1
knowledge	1
after	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
created	1
him:	1
3:11	1
	1
Where	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
Greek	1
nor	1
Jew,	1
circumcision	1
nor	1
uncircumcision,	1
Barbarian,	1
Scythian,	1
bond	1
nor	1
free:	1
but	1
Christ	1
is	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
3:12	1
	1
Put	1
on	1
therefore,	1
as	1
the	1
elect	1
of	1
God,	1
holy	1
and	1
beloved,	1
bowels	1
of	1
mercies,	1
kindness,	1
humbleness	1
of	1
mind,	1
meekness,	1
longsuffering;	1
3:13	1
	1
Forbearing	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
forgiving	1
one	1
another,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
a	1
quarrel	1
against	1
any:	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
forgave	1
you,	1
so	1
also	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
3:14	1
	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
put	1
on	1
charity,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
perfectness.	1
	1
3:15	1
	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God	1
rule	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
to	1
the	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
body;	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
thankful.	1
	1
3:16	1
	1
Let	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Christ	1
dwell	1
in	1
you	1
richly	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom;	1
teaching	1
and	1
admonishing	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
psalms	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
spiritual	1
songs,	1
singing	1
with	1
grace	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
to	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:17	1
	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
word	1
or	1
deed,	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
giving	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
3:18	1
	1
Wives,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
your	1
own	1
husbands,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
fit	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:19	1
	1
Husbands,	1
love	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
bitter	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
3:20	1
	1
Children,	1
obey	1
your	1
parents	1
in	1
all	1
things:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
well	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:21	1
	1
Fathers,	1
provoke	1
not	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
anger,	1
lest	1
they	1
be	1
discouraged.	1
	1
3:22	1
	1
Servants,	1
obey	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
your	1
masters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh;	1
not	1
with	1
eyeservice,	1
as	1
menpleasers;	1
but	1
in	1
singleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
fearing	1
God;	1
3:23	1
	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do,	1
do	1
it	1
heartily,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
men;	1
3:24	1
	1
Knowing	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance:	1
for	1
ye	1
serve	1
the	1
Lord	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:25	1
	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
wrong	1
shall	1
receive	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
respect	1
of	1
persons.	1
	1
4:1	1
	1
Masters,	1
give	1
unto	1
your	1
servants	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
equal;	1
knowing	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
a	1
Master	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
4:2	1
	1
Continue	1
in	1
prayer,	1
and	1
watch	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
thanksgiving;	1
4:3	1
	1
Withal	1
praying	1
also	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
open	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
door	1
of	1
utterance,	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Christ,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
in	1
bonds:	1
4:4	1
	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
it	1
manifest,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
4:5	1
	1
Walk	1
in	1
wisdom	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
redeeming	1
the	1
time.	1
	1
4:6	1
	1
Let	1
your	1
speech	1
be	1
alway	1
with	1
grace,	1
seasoned	1
with	1
salt,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
answer	1
every	1
man.	1
	1
4:7	1
	1
All	1
my	1
state	1
shall	1
Tychicus	1
declare	1
unto	1
you,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
beloved	1
brother,	1
and	1
a	1
faithful	1
minister	1
and	1
fellowservant	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
4:8	1
	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
your	1
estate,	1
and	1
comfort	1
your	1
hearts;	1
4:9	1
	1
With	1
Onesimus,	1
a	1
faithful	1
and	1
beloved	1
brother,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
you.	1
They	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
done	1
here.	1
	1
4:10	1
	1
Aristarchus	1
my	1
fellowprisoner	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
and	1
Marcus,	1
sister's	1
son	1
to	1
Barnabas,	1
(touching	1
whom	1
ye	1
received	1
commandments:	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
receive	1
him;)	1
4:11	1
	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Justus,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
These	1
only	1
are	1
my	1
fellowworkers	1
unto	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
comfort	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
4:12	1
	1
Epaphras,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Christ,	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
always	1
labouring	1
fervently	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
prayers,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
stand	1
perfect	1
and	1
complete	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
	1
For	1
I	1
bear	1
him	1
record,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
great	1
zeal	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
them	1
in	1
Hierapolis.	1
	1
4:14	1
	1
Luke,	1
the	1
beloved	1
physician,	1
and	1
Demas,	1
greet	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
	1
Salute	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
Nymphas,	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
4:16	1
	1
And	1
when	1
this	1
epistle	1
is	1
read	1
among	1
you,	1
cause	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
read	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Laodiceans;	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
likewise	1
read	1
the	1
epistle	1
from	1
Laodicea.	1
	1
4:17	1
	1
And	1
say	1
to	1
Archippus,	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
thou	1
fulfil	1
it.	1
	1
4:18	1
	1
The	1
salutation	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
me	1
Paul.	1
Remember	1
my	1
bonds.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
and	1
Silvanus,	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:2	1
We	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
always	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
our	1
prayers;	1
1:3	1
Remembering	1
without	1
ceasing	1
your	1
work	1
of	1
faith,	1
and	1
labour	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
patience	1
of	1
hope	1
in	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father;	1
1:4	1
Knowing,	1
brethren	1
beloved,	1
your	1
election	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
our	1
gospel	1
came	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
word	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
assurance;	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
we	1
were	1
among	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
sake.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
ye	1
became	1
followers	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
much	1
affliction,	1
with	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:7	1
So	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
ensamples	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
from	1
you	1
sounded	1
out	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
your	1
faith	1
to	1
God-ward	1
is	1
spread	1
abroad;	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
any	1
thing.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
they	1
themselves	1
shew	1
of	1
us	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
entering	1
in	1
we	1
had	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
how	1
ye	1
turned	1
to	1
God	1
from	1
idols	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
living	1
and	1
true	1
God;	1
1:10	1
And	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
Son	1
from	1
heaven,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
2:1	1
For	1
yourselves,	1
brethren,	1
know	1
our	1
entrance	1
in	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
vain:	1
2:2	1
But	1
even	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
suffered	1
before,	1
and	1
were	1
shamefully	1
entreated,	1
as	1
ye	1
know,	1
at	1
Philippi,	1
we	1
were	1
bold	1
in	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
much	1
contention.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
our	1
exhortation	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
deceit,	1
nor	1
of	1
uncleanness,	1
nor	1
in	1
guile:	1
2:4	1
But	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
allowed	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
trust	1
with	1
the	1
gospel,	1
even	1
so	1
we	1
speak;	1
not	1
as	1
pleasing	1
men,	1
but	1
God,	1
which	1
trieth	1
our	1
hearts.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
neither	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
used	1
we	1
flattering	1
words,	1
as	1
ye	1
know,	1
nor	1
a	1
cloke	1
of	1
covetousness;	1
God	1
is	1
witness:	1
2:6	1
Nor	1
of	1
men	1
sought	1
we	1
glory,	1
neither	1
of	1
you,	1
nor	1
yet	1
of	1
others,	1
when	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
burdensome,	1
as	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:7	1
But	1
we	1
were	1
gentle	1
among	1
you,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
nurse	1
cherisheth	1
her	1
children:	1
2:8	1
So	1
being	1
affectionately	1
desirous	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
imparted	1
unto	1
you,	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
our	1
own	1
souls,	1
because	1
ye	1
were	1
dear	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
2:9	1
For	1
ye	1
remember,	1
brethren,	1
our	1
labour	1
and	1
travail:	1
for	1
labouring	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
because	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
chargeable	1
unto	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
preached	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:10	1
Ye	1
are	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
God	1
also,	1
how	1
holily	1
and	1
justly	1
and	1
unblameably	1
we	1
behaved	1
ourselves	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
believe:	1
2:11	1
As	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
we	1
exhorted	1
and	1
comforted	1
and	1
charged	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
father	1
doth	1
his	1
children,	1
2:12	1
That	1
ye	1
would	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
unto	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
also	1
thank	1
we	1
God	1
without	1
ceasing,	1
because,	1
when	1
ye	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
ye	1
heard	1
of	1
us,	1
ye	1
received	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
truth,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
effectually	1
worketh	1
also	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
became	1
followers	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
in	1
Judaea	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
for	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
suffered	1
like	1
things	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
2:15	1
Who	1
both	1
killed	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
prophets,	1
and	1
have	1
persecuted	1
us;	1
and	1
they	1
please	1
not	1
God,	1
and	1
are	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
men:	1
2:16	1
Forbidding	1
us	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved,	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
their	1
sins	1
alway:	1
for	1
the	1
wrath	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost.	1
	1
2:17	1
But	1
we,	1
brethren,	1
being	1
taken	1
from	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
in	1
presence,	1
not	1
in	1
heart,	1
endeavoured	1
the	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
face	1
with	1
great	1
desire.	1
	1
2:18	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
even	1
I	1
Paul,	1
once	1
and	1
again;	1
but	1
Satan	1
hindered	1
us.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
our	1
hope,	1
or	1
joy,	1
or	1
crown	1
of	1
rejoicing?	1
Are	1
not	1
even	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
at	1
his	1
coming?	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
our	1
glory	1
and	1
joy.	1
	1
3:1	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
we	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
forbear,	1
we	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
at	1
Athens	1
alone;	1
3:2	1
And	1
sent	1
Timotheus,	1
our	1
brother,	1
and	1
minister	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
our	1
fellowlabourer	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
to	1
establish	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
comfort	1
you	1
concerning	1
your	1
faith:	1
3:3	1
That	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
moved	1
by	1
these	1
afflictions:	1
for	1
yourselves	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
appointed	1
thereunto.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
verily,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
you,	1
we	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
suffer	1
tribulation;	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
ye	1
know.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
this	1
cause,	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
forbear,	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
know	1
your	1
faith,	1
lest	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
the	1
tempter	1
have	1
tempted	1
you,	1
and	1
our	1
labour	1
be	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:6	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
Timotheus	1
came	1
from	1
you	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
brought	1
us	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
charity,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
good	1
remembrance	1
of	1
us	1
always,	1
desiring	1
greatly	1
to	1
see	1
us,	1
as	1
we	1
also	1
to	1
see	1
you:	1
3:7	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
were	1
comforted	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
affliction	1
and	1
distress	1
by	1
your	1
faith:	1
3:8	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
live,	1
if	1
ye	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
what	1
thanks	1
can	1
we	1
render	1
to	1
God	1
again	1
for	1
you,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
joy	1
wherewith	1
we	1
joy	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
before	1
our	1
God;	1
3:10	1
Night	1
and	1
day	1
praying	1
exceedingly	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
see	1
your	1
face,	1
and	1
might	1
perfect	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lacking	1
in	1
your	1
faith?	1
	1
3:11	1
Now	1
God	1
himself	1
and	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
direct	1
our	1
way	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
make	1
you	1
to	1
increase	1
and	1
abound	1
in	1
love	1
one	1
toward	1
another,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
men,	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
toward	1
you:	1
3:13	1
To	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
may	1
stablish	1
your	1
hearts	1
unblameable	1
in	1
holiness	1
before	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
Father,	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
saints.	1
	1
4:1	1
Furthermore	1
then	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
exhort	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
us	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
walk	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
God,	1
so	1
ye	1
would	1
abound	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
commandments	1
we	1
gave	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
your	1
sanctification,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
abstain	1
from	1
fornication:	1
4:4	1
That	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
possess	1
his	1
vessel	1
in	1
sanctification	1
and	1
honour;	1
4:5	1
Not	1
in	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
concupiscence,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
know	1
not	1
God:	1
4:6	1
That	1
no	1
man	1
go	1
beyond	1
and	1
defraud	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
any	1
matter:	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
all	1
such,	1
as	1
we	1
also	1
have	1
forewarned	1
you	1
and	1
testified.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
called	1
us	1
unto	1
uncleanness,	1
but	1
unto	1
holiness.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
therefore	1
that	1
despiseth,	1
despiseth	1
not	1
man,	1
but	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
also	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
his	1
holy	1
Spirit.	1
	1
4:9	1
But	1
as	1
touching	1
brotherly	1
love	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
taught	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
indeed	1
ye	1
do	1
it	1
toward	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
Macedonia:	1
but	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
increase	1
more	1
and	1
more;	1
4:11	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
study	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
your	1
own	1
business,	1
and	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
hands,	1
as	1
we	1
commanded	1
you;	1
4:12	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
walk	1
honestly	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
lack	1
of	1
nothing.	1
	1
4:13	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
brethren,	1
concerning	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
asleep,	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrow	1
not,	1
even	1
as	1
others	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
hope.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
died	1
and	1
rose	1
again,	1
even	1
so	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
sleep	1
in	1
Jesus	1
will	1
God	1
bring	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
this	1
we	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
we	1
which	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
remain	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
not	1
prevent	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
asleep.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
himself	1
shall	1
descend	1
from	1
heaven	1
with	1
a	1
shout,	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
archangel,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
trump	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
rise	1
first:	1
4:17	1
Then	1
we	1
which	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
remain	1
shall	1
be	1
caught	1
up	1
together	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
clouds,	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
air:	1
and	1
so	1
shall	1
we	1
ever	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:18	1
Wherefore	1
comfort	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
5:1	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
seasons,	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
yourselves	1
know	1
perfectly	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
so	1
cometh	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Peace	1
and	1
safety;	1
then	1
sudden	1
destruction	1
cometh	1
upon	1
them,	1
as	1
travail	1
upon	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
darkness,	1
that	1
that	1
day	1
should	1
overtake	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
	1
5:5	1
Ye	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
nor	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
5:6	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
sleep,	1
as	1
do	1
others;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
watch	1
and	1
be	1
sober.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
sleep	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
drunken	1
are	1
drunken	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
let	1
us,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
be	1
sober,	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
love;	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
helmet,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
5:9	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
appointed	1
us	1
to	1
wrath,	1
but	1
to	1
obtain	1
salvation	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
5:10	1
Who	1
died	1
for	1
us,	1
that,	1
whether	1
we	1
wake	1
or	1
sleep,	1
we	1
should	1
live	1
together	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:11	1
Wherefore	1
comfort	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
and	1
edify	1
one	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
also	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
to	1
know	1
them	1
which	1
labour	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
are	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
admonish	1
you;	1
5:13	1
And	1
to	1
esteem	1
them	1
very	1
highly	1
in	1
love	1
for	1
their	1
work's	1
sake.	1
And	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
among	1
yourselves.	1
	1
5:14	1
Now	1
we	1
exhort	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
warn	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
unruly,	1
comfort	1
the	1
feebleminded,	1
support	1
the	1
weak,	1
be	1
patient	1
toward	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
5:15	1
See	1
that	1
none	1
render	1
evil	1
for	1
evil	1
unto	1
any	1
man;	1
but	1
ever	1
follow	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
both	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
5:16	1
Rejoice	1
evermore.	1
	1
5:17	1
Pray	1
without	1
ceasing.	1
	1
5:18	1
In	1
every	1
thing	1
give	1
thanks:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
concerning	1
you.	1
	1
5:19	1
Quench	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:20	1
Despise	1
not	1
prophesyings.	1
	1
5:21	1
Prove	1
all	1
things;	1
hold	1
fast	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
5:22	1
Abstain	1
from	1
all	1
appearance	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
the	1
very	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
sanctify	1
you	1
wholly;	1
and	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
your	1
whole	1
spirit	1
and	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
be	1
preserved	1
blameless	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
5:24	1
Faithful	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
calleth	1
you,	1
who	1
also	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
5:25	1
Brethren,	1
pray	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
5:26	1
Greet	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
5:27	1
I	1
charge	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
this	1
epistle	1
be	1
read	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
brethren.	1
	1
5:28	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
and	1
Silvanus,	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
in	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
We	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
thank	1
God	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
meet,	1
because	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
groweth	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
the	1
charity	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
all	1
toward	1
each	1
other	1
aboundeth;	1
1:4	1
So	1
that	1
we	1
ourselves	1
glory	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
your	1
patience	1
and	1
faith	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
persecutions	1
and	1
tribulations	1
that	1
ye	1
endure:	1
1:5	1
Which	1
is	1
a	1
manifest	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
for	1
which	1
ye	1
also	1
suffer:	1
1:6	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
righteous	1
thing	1
with	1
God	1
to	1
recompense	1
tribulation	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
trouble	1
you;	1
1:7	1
And	1
to	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
troubled	1
rest	1
with	1
us,	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
from	1
heaven	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
angels,	1
1:8	1
In	1
flaming	1
fire	1
taking	1
vengeance	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
not	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:9	1
Who	1
shall	1
be	1
punished	1
with	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
power;	1
1:10	1
When	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
his	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
admired	1
in	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
(because	1
our	1
testimony	1
among	1
you	1
was	1
believed)	1
in	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
1:11	1
Wherefore	1
also	1
we	1
pray	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
that	1
our	1
God	1
would	1
count	1
you	1
worthy	1
of	1
this	1
calling,	1
and	1
fulfil	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
faith	1
with	1
power:	1
1:12	1
That	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
in	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:1	1
Now	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
gathering	1
together	1
unto	1
him,	1
2:2	1
That	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
soon	1
shaken	1
in	1
mind,	1
or	1
be	1
troubled,	1
neither	1
by	1
spirit,	1
nor	1
by	1
word,	1
nor	1
by	1
letter	1
as	1
from	1
us,	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you	1
by	1
any	1
means:	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
not	1
come,	1
except	1
there	1
come	1
a	1
falling	1
away	1
first,	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
of	1
sin	1
be	1
revealed,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition;	1
2:4	1
Who	1
opposeth	1
and	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
God,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
worshipped;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
as	1
God	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
shewing	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
2:5	1
Remember	1
ye	1
not,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
withholdeth	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
his	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
For	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
iniquity	1
doth	1
already	1
work:	1
only	1
he	1
who	1
now	1
letteth	1
will	1
let,	1
until	1
he	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
that	1
Wicked	1
be	1
revealed,	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
consume	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
with	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
his	1
coming:	1
2:9	1
Even	1
him,	1
whose	1
coming	1
is	1
after	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
Satan	1
with	1
all	1
power	1
and	1
signs	1
and	1
lying	1
wonders,	1
2:10	1
And	1
with	1
all	1
deceivableness	1
of	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
perish;	1
because	1
they	1
received	1
not	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
God	1
shall	1
send	1
them	1
strong	1
delusion,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
a	1
lie:	1
2:12	1
That	1
they	1
all	1
might	1
be	1
damned	1
who	1
believed	1
not	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
had	1
pleasure	1
in	1
unrighteousness.	1
	1
2:13	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
alway	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
you,	1
brethren	1
beloved	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
because	1
God	1
hath	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
chosen	1
you	1
to	1
salvation	1
through	1
sanctification	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
truth:	1
2:14	1
Whereunto	1
he	1
called	1
you	1
by	1
our	1
gospel,	1
to	1
the	1
obtaining	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:15	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
stand	1
fast,	1
and	1
hold	1
the	1
traditions	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
taught,	1
whether	1
by	1
word,	1
or	1
our	1
epistle.	1
	1
2:16	1
Now	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself,	1
and	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
Father,	1
which	1
hath	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
everlasting	1
consolation	1
and	1
good	1
hope	1
through	1
grace,	1
2:17	1
Comfort	1
your	1
hearts,	1
and	1
stablish	1
you	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
word	1
and	1
work.	1
	1
3:1	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
pray	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
may	1
have	1
free	1
course,	1
and	1
be	1
glorified,	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
you:	1
3:2	1
And	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
unreasonable	1
and	1
wicked	1
men:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
have	1
not	1
faith.	1
	1
3:3	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
faithful,	1
who	1
shall	1
stablish	1
you,	1
and	1
keep	1
you	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
touching	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
both	1
do	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
direct	1
your	1
hearts	1
into	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
patient	1
waiting	1
for	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:6	1
Now	1
we	1
command	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
ye	1
withdraw	1
yourselves	1
from	1
every	1
brother	1
that	1
walketh	1
disorderly,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
yourselves	1
know	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
follow	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
behaved	1
not	1
ourselves	1
disorderly	1
among	1
you;	1
3:8	1
Neither	1
did	1
we	1
eat	1
any	1
man's	1
bread	1
for	1
nought;	1
but	1
wrought	1
with	1
labour	1
and	1
travail	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
chargeable	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
you:	1
3:9	1
Not	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
power,	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
ourselves	1
an	1
ensample	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
follow	1
us.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
even	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
you,	1
this	1
we	1
commanded	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
would	1
not	1
work,	1
neither	1
should	1
he	1
eat.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
we	1
hear	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
which	1
walk	1
among	1
you	1
disorderly,	1
working	1
not	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
are	1
busybodies.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
such	1
we	1
command	1
and	1
exhort	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
with	1
quietness	1
they	1
work,	1
and	1
eat	1
their	1
own	1
bread.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
weary	1
in	1
well	1
doing.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
obey	1
not	1
our	1
word	1
by	1
this	1
epistle,	1
note	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
company	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
3:15	1
Yet	1
count	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
enemy,	1
but	1
admonish	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
3:16	1
Now	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
peace	1
himself	1
give	1
you	1
peace	1
always	1
by	1
all	1
means.	1
The	1
Lord	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
3:17	1
The	1
salutation	1
of	1
Paul	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
token	1
in	1
every	1
epistle:	1
so	1
I	1
write.	1
	1
3:18	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Timothy	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour,	1
and	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
is	1
our	1
hope;	1
1:2	1
Unto	1
Timothy,	1
my	1
own	1
son	1
in	1
the	1
faith:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:3	1
As	1
I	1
besought	1
thee	1
to	1
abide	1
still	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
charge	1
some	1
that	1
they	1
teach	1
no	1
other	1
doctrine,	1
1:4	1
Neither	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
fables	1
and	1
endless	1
genealogies,	1
which	1
minister	1
questions,	1
rather	1
than	1
godly	1
edifying	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
faith:	1
so	1
do.	1
	1
1:5	1
Now	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
is	1
charity	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
heart,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conscience,	1
and	1
of	1
faith	1
unfeigned:	1
1:6	1
From	1
which	1
some	1
having	1
swerved	1
have	1
turned	1
aside	1
unto	1
vain	1
jangling;	1
1:7	1
Desiring	1
to	1
be	1
teachers	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
understanding	1
neither	1
what	1
they	1
say,	1
nor	1
whereof	1
they	1
affirm.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
good,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
use	1
it	1
lawfully;	1
1:9	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
man,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
lawless	1
and	1
disobedient,	1
for	1
the	1
ungodly	1
and	1
for	1
sinners,	1
for	1
unholy	1
and	1
profane,	1
for	1
murderers	1
of	1
fathers	1
and	1
murderers	1
of	1
mothers,	1
for	1
manslayers,	1
1:10	1
For	1
whoremongers,	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
defile	1
themselves	1
with	1
mankind,	1
for	1
menstealers,	1
for	1
liars,	1
for	1
perjured	1
persons,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
sound	1
doctrine;	1
1:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
glorious	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
blessed	1
God,	1
which	1
was	1
committed	1
to	1
my	1
trust.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
I	1
thank	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
enabled	1
me,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
counted	1
me	1
faithful,	1
putting	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
ministry;	1
1:13	1
Who	1
was	1
before	1
a	1
blasphemer,	1
and	1
a	1
persecutor,	1
and	1
injurious:	1
but	1
I	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
because	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
ignorantly	1
in	1
unbelief.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
was	1
exceeding	1
abundant	1
with	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:15	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying,	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
acceptation,	1
that	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
save	1
sinners;	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
chief.	1
	1
1:16	1
Howbeit	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
first	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
might	1
shew	1
forth	1
all	1
longsuffering,	1
for	1
a	1
pattern	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
should	1
hereafter	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
1:17	1
Now	1
unto	1
the	1
King	1
eternal,	1
immortal,	1
invisible,	1
the	1
only	1
wise	1
God,	1
be	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:18	1
This	1
charge	1
I	1
commit	1
unto	1
thee,	1
son	1
Timothy,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
on	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
by	1
them	1
mightest	1
war	1
a	1
good	1
warfare;	1
1:19	1
Holding	1
faith,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
conscience;	1
which	1
some	1
having	1
put	1
away	1
concerning	1
faith	1
have	1
made	1
shipwreck:	1
1:20	1
Of	1
whom	1
is	1
Hymenaeus	1
and	1
Alexander;	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn	1
not	1
to	1
blaspheme.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
exhort	1
therefore,	1
that,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
supplications,	1
prayers,	1
intercessions,	1
and	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks,	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
all	1
men;	1
2:2	1
For	1
kings,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
authority;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
lead	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
peaceable	1
life	1
in	1
all	1
godliness	1
and	1
honesty.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
acceptable	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
2:4	1
Who	1
will	1
have	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God,	1
and	1
one	1
mediator	1
between	1
God	1
and	1
men,	1
the	1
man	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
all,	1
to	1
be	1
testified	1
in	1
due	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
am	1
ordained	1
a	1
preacher,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle,	1
(I	1
speak	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
lie	1
not;)	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
verity.	1
	1
2:8	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
that	1
men	1
pray	1
every	1
where,	1
lifting	1
up	1
holy	1
hands,	1
without	1
wrath	1
and	1
doubting.	1
	1
2:9	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
also,	1
that	1
women	1
adorn	1
themselves	1
in	1
modest	1
apparel,	1
with	1
shamefacedness	1
and	1
sobriety;	1
not	1
with	1
broided	1
hair,	1
or	1
gold,	1
or	1
pearls,	1
or	1
costly	1
array;	1
2:10	1
But	1
(which	1
becometh	1
women	1
professing	1
godliness)	1
with	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
2:11	1
Let	1
the	1
woman	1
learn	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
all	1
subjection.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
I	1
suffer	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
teach,	1
nor	1
to	1
usurp	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
man,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
Adam	1
was	1
first	1
formed,	1
then	1
Eve.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
Adam	1
was	1
not	1
deceived,	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
being	1
deceived	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
transgression.	1
	1
2:15	1
Notwithstanding	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
childbearing,	1
if	1
they	1
continue	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
charity	1
and	1
holiness	1
with	1
sobriety.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
saying,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
desire	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
bishop,	1
he	1
desireth	1
a	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
3:2	1
A	1
bishop	1
then	1
must	1
be	1
blameless,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
vigilant,	1
sober,	1
of	1
good	1
behaviour,	1
given	1
to	1
hospitality,	1
apt	1
to	1
teach;	1
3:3	1
Not	1
given	1
to	1
wine,	1
no	1
striker,	1
not	1
greedy	1
of	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
but	1
patient,	1
not	1
a	1
brawler,	1
not	1
covetous;	1
3:4	1
One	1
that	1
ruleth	1
well	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
having	1
his	1
children	1
in	1
subjection	1
with	1
all	1
gravity;	1
3:5	1
(For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
rule	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God?)	1
	1
3:6	1
Not	1
a	1
novice,	1
lest	1
being	1
lifted	1
up	1
with	1
pride	1
he	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
condemnation	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:7	1
Moreover	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
without;	1
lest	1
he	1
fall	1
into	1
reproach	1
and	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:8	1
Likewise	1
must	1
the	1
deacons	1
be	1
grave,	1
not	1
doubletongued,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
much	1
wine,	1
not	1
greedy	1
of	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
3:9	1
Holding	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
a	1
pure	1
conscience.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
let	1
these	1
also	1
first	1
be	1
proved;	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
use	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
deacon,	1
being	1
found	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:11	1
Even	1
so	1
must	1
their	1
wives	1
be	1
grave,	1
not	1
slanderers,	1
sober,	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
3:12	1
Let	1
the	1
deacons	1
be	1
the	1
husbands	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
ruling	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
houses	1
well.	1
	1
3:13	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
deacon	1
well	1
purchase	1
to	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
degree,	1
and	1
great	1
boldness	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:14	1
These	1
things	1
write	1
I	1
unto	1
thee,	1
hoping	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
shortly:	1
3:15	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
tarry	1
long,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
how	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
behave	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
the	1
pillar	1
and	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
without	1
controversy	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
godliness:	1
God	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
justified	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
seen	1
of	1
angels,	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
believed	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
received	1
up	1
into	1
glory.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Spirit	1
speaketh	1
expressly,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
times	1
some	1
shall	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
faith,	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
seducing	1
spirits,	1
and	1
doctrines	1
of	1
devils;	1
4:2	1
Speaking	1
lies	1
in	1
hypocrisy;	1
having	1
their	1
conscience	1
seared	1
with	1
a	1
hot	1
iron;	1
4:3	1
Forbidding	1
to	1
marry,	1
and	1
commanding	1
to	1
abstain	1
from	1
meats,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
created	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
believe	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
every	1
creature	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
refused,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
thanksgiving:	1
4:5	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:6	1
If	1
thou	1
put	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
minister	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
nourished	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
doctrine,	1
whereunto	1
thou	1
hast	1
attained.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
refuse	1
profane	1
and	1
old	1
wives'	1
fables,	1
and	1
exercise	1
thyself	1
rather	1
unto	1
godliness.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
profiteth	1
little:	1
but	1
godliness	1
is	1
profitable	1
unto	1
all	1
things,	1
having	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
now	1
is,	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
4:9	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
acceptation.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
therefore	1
we	1
both	1
labour	1
and	1
suffer	1
reproach,	1
because	1
we	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
specially	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
4:11	1
These	1
things	1
command	1
and	1
teach.	1
	1
4:12	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
despise	1
thy	1
youth;	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
believers,	1
in	1
word,	1
in	1
conversation,	1
in	1
charity,	1
in	1
spirit,	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
purity.	1
	1
4:13	1
Till	1
I	1
come,	1
give	1
attendance	1
to	1
reading,	1
to	1
exhortation,	1
to	1
doctrine.	1
	1
4:14	1
Neglect	1
not	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
thee	1
by	1
prophecy,	1
with	1
the	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
presbytery.	1
	1
4:15	1
Meditate	1
upon	1
these	1
things;	1
give	1
thyself	1
wholly	1
to	1
them;	1
that	1
thy	1
profiting	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
all.	1
	1
4:16	1
Take	1
heed	1
unto	1
thyself,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
doctrine;	1
continue	1
in	1
them:	1
for	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
thou	1
shalt	1
both	1
save	1
thyself,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
hear	1
thee.	1
	1
5:1	1
Rebuke	1
not	1
an	1
elder,	1
but	1
intreat	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
father;	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
as	1
brethren;	1
5:2	1
The	1
elder	1
women	1
as	1
mothers;	1
the	1
younger	1
as	1
sisters,	1
with	1
all	1
purity.	1
	1
5:3	1
Honour	1
widows	1
that	1
are	1
widows	1
indeed.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
widow	1
have	1
children	1
or	1
nephews,	1
let	1
them	1
learn	1
first	1
to	1
shew	1
piety	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
to	1
requite	1
their	1
parents:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
acceptable	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
widow	1
indeed,	1
and	1
desolate,	1
trusteth	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
continueth	1
in	1
supplications	1
and	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
she	1
that	1
liveth	1
in	1
pleasure	1
is	1
dead	1
while	1
she	1
liveth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
give	1
in	1
charge,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
blameless.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
provide	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
specially	1
for	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
he	1
hath	1
denied	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
an	1
infidel.	1
	1
5:9	1
Let	1
not	1
a	1
widow	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
number	1
under	1
threescore	1
years	1
old,	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
5:10	1
Well	1
reported	1
of	1
for	1
good	1
works;	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
brought	1
up	1
children,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
lodged	1
strangers,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
washed	1
the	1
saints'	1
feet,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
relieved	1
the	1
afflicted,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
diligently	1
followed	1
every	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
the	1
younger	1
widows	1
refuse:	1
for	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
wax	1
wanton	1
against	1
Christ,	1
they	1
will	1
marry;	1
5:12	1
Having	1
damnation,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
first	1
faith.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
withal	1
they	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
idle,	1
wandering	1
about	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
idle,	1
but	1
tattlers	1
also	1
and	1
busybodies,	1
speaking	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
ought	1
not.	1
	1
5:14	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
younger	1
women	1
marry,	1
bear	1
children,	1
guide	1
the	1
house,	1
give	1
none	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
adversary	1
to	1
speak	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
5:15	1
For	1
some	1
are	1
already	1
turned	1
aside	1
after	1
Satan.	1
	1
5:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
that	1
believeth	1
have	1
widows,	1
let	1
them	1
relieve	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
church	1
be	1
charged;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
relieve	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
widows	1
indeed.	1
	1
5:17	1
Let	1
the	1
elders	1
that	1
rule	1
well	1
be	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
double	1
honour,	1
especially	1
they	1
who	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
doctrine.	1
	1
5:18	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
ox	1
that	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
And,	1
The	1
labourer	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
5:19	1
Against	1
an	1
elder	1
receive	1
not	1
an	1
accusation,	1
but	1
before	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses.	1
	1
5:20	1
Them	1
that	1
sin	1
rebuke	1
before	1
all,	1
that	1
others	1
also	1
may	1
fear.	1
	1
5:21	1
I	1
charge	1
thee	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
elect	1
angels,	1
that	1
thou	1
observe	1
these	1
things	1
without	1
preferring	1
one	1
before	1
another,	1
doing	1
nothing	1
by	1
partiality.	1
	1
5:22	1
Lay	1
hands	1
suddenly	1
on	1
no	1
man,	1
neither	1
be	1
partaker	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
sins:	1
keep	1
thyself	1
pure.	1
	1
5:23	1
Drink	1
no	1
longer	1
water,	1
but	1
use	1
a	1
little	1
wine	1
for	1
thy	1
stomach's	1
sake	1
and	1
thine	1
often	1
infirmities.	1
	1
5:24	1
Some	1
men's	1
sins	1
are	1
open	1
beforehand,	1
going	1
before	1
to	1
judgment;	1
and	1
some	1
men	1
they	1
follow	1
after.	1
	1
5:25	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
good	1
works	1
of	1
some	1
are	1
manifest	1
beforehand;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
otherwise	1
cannot	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
6:1	1
Let	1
as	1
many	1
servants	1
as	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
count	1
their	1
own	1
masters	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
honour,	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
doctrine	1
be	1
not	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
believing	1
masters,	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
despise	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
brethren;	1
but	1
rather	1
do	1
them	1
service,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
beloved,	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
benefit.	1
These	1
things	1
teach	1
and	1
exhort.	1
	1
6:3	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
teach	1
otherwise,	1
and	1
consent	1
not	1
to	1
wholesome	1
words,	1
even	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
which	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
godliness;	1
6:4	1
He	1
is	1
proud,	1
knowing	1
nothing,	1
but	1
doting	1
about	1
questions	1
and	1
strifes	1
of	1
words,	1
whereof	1
cometh	1
envy,	1
strife,	1
railings,	1
evil	1
surmisings,	1
6:5	1
Perverse	1
disputings	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
corrupt	1
minds,	1
and	1
destitute	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
supposing	1
that	1
gain	1
is	1
godliness:	1
from	1
such	1
withdraw	1
thyself.	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
godliness	1
with	1
contentment	1
is	1
great	1
gain.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
we	1
brought	1
nothing	1
into	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
we	1
can	1
carry	1
nothing	1
out.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
having	1
food	1
and	1
raiment	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
therewith	1
content.	1
	1
6:9	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
rich	1
fall	1
into	1
temptation	1
and	1
a	1
snare,	1
and	1
into	1
many	1
foolish	1
and	1
hurtful	1
lusts,	1
which	1
drown	1
men	1
in	1
destruction	1
and	1
perdition.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
money	1
is	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
evil:	1
which	1
while	1
some	1
coveted	1
after,	1
they	1
have	1
erred	1
from	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
pierced	1
themselves	1
through	1
with	1
many	1
sorrows.	1
	1
6:11	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
flee	1
these	1
things;	1
and	1
follow	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
godliness,	1
faith,	1
love,	1
patience,	1
meekness.	1
	1
6:12	1
Fight	1
the	1
good	1
fight	1
of	1
faith,	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
eternal	1
life,	1
whereunto	1
thou	1
art	1
also	1
called,	1
and	1
hast	1
professed	1
a	1
good	1
profession	1
before	1
many	1
witnesses.	1
	1
6:13	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
charge	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
quickeneth	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
before	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
before	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
witnessed	1
a	1
good	1
confession;	1
6:14	1
That	1
thou	1
keep	1
this	1
commandment	1
without	1
spot,	1
unrebukable,	1
until	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
6:15	1
Which	1
in	1
his	1
times	1
he	1
shall	1
shew,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
blessed	1
and	1
only	1
Potentate,	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords;	1
6:16	1
Who	1
only	1
hath	1
immortality,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
approach	1
unto;	1
whom	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
seen,	1
nor	1
can	1
see:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
honour	1
and	1
power	1
everlasting.	1
Amen.	1
	1
6:17	1
Charge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
rich	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
highminded,	1
nor	1
trust	1
in	1
uncertain	1
riches,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
who	1
giveth	1
us	1
richly	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
enjoy;	1
6:18	1
That	1
they	1
do	1
good,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
rich	1
in	1
good	1
works,	1
ready	1
to	1
distribute,	1
willing	1
to	1
communicate;	1
6:19	1
Laying	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
foundation	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
6:20	1
O	1
Timothy,	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
committed	1
to	1
thy	1
trust,	1
avoiding	1
profane	1
and	1
vain	1
babblings,	1
and	1
oppositions	1
of	1
science	1
falsely	1
so	1
called:	1
6:21	1
Which	1
some	1
professing	1
have	1
erred	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
Amen.	1

1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1

by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1

which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
1:2	1
To	1
Timothy,	1
my	1

Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1

	1
1:3	1
I	1
thank	1
God,	1
whom	1
I	1
serve	1
from	1
my	1
forefathers	1
with	1
pure	1
conscience,	1
that	1
without	1
ceasing	1
I	1
have	1
remembrance	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
my	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day;	1
1:4	1
Greatly	1
desiring	1
to	1
see	1
thee,	1
being	1
mindful	1
of	1
thy	1
tears,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
joy;	1
1:5	1
When	1
I	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
unfeigned	1
faith	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
first	1
in	1
thy	1
grandmother	1
Lois,	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
Eunice;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
in	1
thee	1
also.	1

Wherefore	1
I	1
put	1
thee	1
in	1
remembrance	1
that	1
thou	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
putting	1
on	1
of	1
my	1
hands.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
given	1
us	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
fear;	1
but	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sound	1
mind.	1
	1
1:8	1
Be	1
not	1
thou	1
therefore	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
our	1
Lord,	1
nor	1
of	1
me	1
his	1
prisoner:	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God;	1
1:9	1
Who	1
hath	1
saved	1
us,	1
and	1
called	1
us	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
calling,	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
works,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
purpose	1
and	1
grace,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
us	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
began,	1
1:10	1
But	1
is	1
now	1
made	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
hath	1
abolished	1
death,	1
and	1
hath	1
brought	1
life	1
and	1
immortality	1
to	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
gospel:	1
1:11	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
am	1
appointed	1
a	1
preacher,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle,	1
and	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
the	1
which	1
cause	1
I	1
also	1
suffer	1
these	1
things:	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
believed,	1
and	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
unto	1
him	1
against	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
1:13	1
Hold	1
fast	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
sound	1
words,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
me,	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:14	1
That	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
was	1
committed	1
unto	1
thee	1
keep	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
1:15	1
This	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
Phygellus	1
and	1
Hermogenes.	1
	1
1:16	1
The	1
Lord	1
give	1
mercy	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Onesiphorus;	1
for	1
he	1
oft	1
refreshed	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
my	1
chain:	1
1:17	1
But,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Rome,	1
he	1
sought	1
me	1
out	1
very	1
diligently,	1
and	1
found	1
me.	1
	1
1:18	1
The	1
Lord	1
grant	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
find	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
in	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
he	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
very	1
well.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thou	1
therefore,	1
my	1
son,	1
be	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
me	1
among	1
many	1
witnesses,	1
the	1
same	1
commit	1
thou	1
to	1
faithful	1
men,	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
teach	1
others	1
also.	1
	1
2:3	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
endure	1
hardness,	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
soldier	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:4	1
No	1
man	1
that	1
warreth	1
entangleth	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
this	1
life;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
chosen	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
soldier.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
also	1
strive	1
for	1
masteries,	1
yet	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
crowned,	1
except	1
he	1
strive	1
lawfully.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
husbandman	1
that	1
laboureth	1
must	1
be	1
first	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
fruits.	1
	1
2:7	1
Consider	1
what	1
I	1
say;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
give	1
thee	1
understanding	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:8	1
Remember	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
was	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel:	1
2:9	1
Wherein	1
I	1
suffer	1
trouble,	1
as	1
an	1
evil	1
doer,	1
even	1
unto	1
bonds;	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
bound.	1
	1
2:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
endure	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sakes,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
also	1
obtain	1
the	1
salvation	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
with	1
eternal	1
glory.	1
	1
2:11	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying:	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
him,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
live	1
with	1
him:	1
2:12	1
If	1
we	1
suffer,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
reign	1
with	1
him:	1
if	1
we	1
deny	1
him,	1
he	1
also	1
will	1
deny	1
us:	1
2:13	1
If	1
we	1
believe	1
not,	1
yet	1
he	1
abideth	1
faithful:	1
he	1
cannot	1
deny	1
himself.	1
	1
2:14	1
Of	1
these	1
things	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
charging	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
strive	1
not	1
about	1
words	1
to	1
no	1
profit,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
subverting	1
of	1
the	1
hearers.	1
	1
2:15	1
Study	1
to	1
shew	1
thyself	1
approved	1
unto	1
God,	1
a	1
workman	1
that	1
needeth	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
rightly	1
dividing	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth.	1
	1
2:16	1
But	1
shun	1
profane	1
and	1
vain	1
babblings:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
increase	1
unto	1
more	1
ungodliness.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
their	1
word	1
will	1
eat	1
as	1
doth	1
a	1
canker:	1
of	1
whom	1
is	1
Hymenaeus	1
and	1
Philetus;	1
2:18	1
Who	1
concerning	1
the	1
truth	1
have	1
erred,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
resurrection	1
is	1
past	1
already;	1
and	1
overthrow	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
some.	1
	1
2:19	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
God	1
standeth	1
sure,	1
having	1
this	1
seal,	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
his.	1
And,	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
nameth	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
depart	1
from	1
iniquity.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
house	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
of	1
earth;	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
honour,	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
dishonour.	1
	1
2:21	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
therefore	1
purge	1
himself	1
from	1
these,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
vessel	1
unto	1
honour,	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
master's	1
use,	1
and	1
prepared	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
2:22	1
Flee	1
also	1
youthful	1
lusts:	1
but	1
follow	1
righteousness,	1
faith,	1
charity,	1
peace,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
heart.	1
	1
2:23	1
But	1
foolish	1
and	1
unlearned	1
questions	1
avoid,	1
knowing	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
gender	1
strifes.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
must	1
not	1
strive;	1
but	1
be	1
gentle	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
apt	1
to	1
teach,	1
patient,	1
2:25	1
In	1
meekness	1
instructing	1
those	1
that	1
oppose	1
themselves;	1
if	1
God	1
peradventure	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
repentance	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
the	1
truth;	1
2:26	1
And	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
recover	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
who	1
are	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
know	1
also,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
perilous	1
times	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
3:2	1
For	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
lovers	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
selves,	1
covetous,	1
boasters,	1
proud,	1
blasphemers,	1
disobedient	1
to	1
parents,	1
unthankful,	1
unholy,	1
3:3	1
Without	1
natural	1
affection,	1
trucebreakers,	1
false	1
accusers,	1
incontinent,	1
fierce,	1
despisers	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
good,	1
3:4	1
Traitors,	1
heady,	1
highminded,	1
lovers	1
of	1
pleasures	1
more	1
than	1
lovers	1
of	1
God;	1
3:5	1
Having	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
godliness,	1
but	1
denying	1
the	1
power	1
thereof:	1
from	1
such	1
turn	1
away.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
creep	1
into	1
houses,	1
and	1
lead	1
captive	1
silly	1
women	1
laden	1
with	1
sins,	1
led	1
away	1
with	1
divers	1
lusts,	1
3:7	1
Ever	1
learning,	1
and	1
never	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
as	1
Jannes	1
and	1
Jambres	1
withstood	1
Moses,	1
so	1
do	1
these	1
also	1
resist	1
the	1
truth:	1
men	1
of	1
corrupt	1
minds,	1
reprobate	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
3:9	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
proceed	1
no	1
further:	1
for	1
their	1
folly	1
shall	1
be	1
manifest	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
as	1
their's	1
also	1
was.	1
	1
3:10	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
fully	1
known	1
my	1
doctrine,	1
manner	1
of	1
life,	1
purpose,	1
faith,	1
longsuffering,	1
charity,	1
patience,	1
3:11	1
Persecutions,	1
afflictions,	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Antioch,	1
at	1
Iconium,	1
at	1
Lystra;	1
what	1
persecutions	1
I	1
endured:	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
Lord	1
delivered	1
me.	1
	1
3:12	1
Yea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
live	1
godly	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
suffer	1
persecution.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
evil	1
men	1
and	1
seducers	1
shall	1
wax	1
worse	1
and	1
worse,	1
deceiving,	1
and	1
being	1
deceived.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
continue	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
learned	1
and	1
hast	1
been	1
assured	1
of,	1
knowing	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
learned	1
them;	1
3:15	1
And	1
that	1
from	1
a	1
child	1
thou	1
hast	1
known	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures,	1
which	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
wise	1
unto	1
salvation	1
through	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:16	1
All	1
scripture	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
inspiration	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
doctrine,	1
for	1
reproof,	1
for	1
correction,	1
for	1
instruction	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
3:17	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
perfect,	1
throughly	1
furnished	1
unto	1
all	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
4:1	1
I	1
charge	1
thee	1
therefore	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
at	1
his	1
appearing	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom;	1
4:2	1
Preach	1
the	1
word;	1
be	1
instant	1
in	1
season,	1
out	1
of	1
season;	1
reprove,	1
rebuke,	1
exhort	1
with	1
all	1
longsuffering	1
and	1
doctrine.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
endure	1
sound	1
doctrine;	1
but	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts	1
shall	1
they	1
heap	1
to	1
themselves	1
teachers,	1
having	1
itching	1
ears;	1
4:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
turn	1
away	1
their	1
ears	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
fables.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
watch	1
thou	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
endure	1
afflictions,	1
do	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
evangelist,	1
make	1
full	1
proof	1
of	1
thy	1
ministry.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
offered,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:7	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
a	1
good	1
fight,	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
my	1
course,	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
faith:	1
4:8	1
Henceforth	1
there	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
righteous	1
judge,	1
shall	1
give	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
me	1
only,	1
but	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
love	1
his	1
appearing.	1
	1
4:9	1
Do	1
thy	1
diligence	1
to	1
come	1
shortly	1
unto	1
me:	1
4:10	1
For	1
Demas	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
having	1
loved	1
this	1
present	1
world,	1
and	1
is	1
departed	1
unto	1
Thessalonica;	1
Crescens	1
to	1
Galatia,	1
Titus	1
unto	1
Dalmatia.	1
	1
4:11	1
Only	1
Luke	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
Take	1
Mark,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
profitable	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
ministry.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
Tychicus	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
4:13	1
The	1
cloke	1
that	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
Troas	1
with	1
Carpus,	1
when	1
thou	1
comest,	1
bring	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
books,	1
but	1
especially	1
the	1
parchments.	1
	1
4:14	1
Alexander	1
the	1
coppersmith	1
did	1
me	1
much	1
evil:	1
the	1
Lord	1
reward	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works:	1
4:15	1
Of	1
whom	1
be	1
thou	1
ware	1
also;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
greatly	1
withstood	1
our	1
words.	1
	1
4:16	1
At	1
my	1
first	1
answer	1
no	1
man	1
stood	1
with	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
men	1
forsook	1
me:	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
laid	1
to	1
their	1
charge.	1
	1
4:17	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
Lord	1
stood	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
me;	1
that	1
by	1
me	1
the	1
preaching	1
might	1
be	1
fully	1
known,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
hear:	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
lion.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
every	1
evil	1
work,	1
and	1
will	1
preserve	1
me	1
unto	1
his	1
heavenly	1
kingdom:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:19	1
Salute	1
Prisca	1
and	1
Aquila,	1
and	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
Onesiphorus.	1
	1
4:20	1
Erastus	1
abode	1
at	1
Corinth:	1
but	1
Trophimus	1
have	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
Miletum	1
sick.	1
	1
4:21	1
Do	1
thy	1
diligence	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
winter.	1
Eubulus	1
greeteth	1
thee,	1
and	1
Pudens,	1
and	1
Linus,	1
and	1
Claudia,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
4:22	1
The	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
spirit.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Titus	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
God's	1
elect,	1
and	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
which	1
is	1
after	1
godliness;	1
1:2	1
In	1
hope	1
of	1
eternal	1
life,	1
which	1
God,	1
that	1
cannot	1
lie,	1
promised	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
began;	1
1:3	1
But	1
hath	1
in	1
due	1
times	1
manifested	1
his	1
word	1
through	1
preaching,	1
which	1
is	1
committed	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
1:4	1
To	1
Titus,	1
mine	1
own	1
son	1
after	1
the	1
common	1
faith:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Saviour.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
left	1
I	1
thee	1
in	1
Crete,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
wanting,	1
and	1
ordain	1
elders	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
appointed	1
thee:	1
1:6	1
If	1
any	1
be	1
blameless,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
having	1
faithful	1
children	1
not	1
accused	1
of	1
riot	1
or	1
unruly.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
a	1
bishop	1
must	1
be	1
blameless,	1
as	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
God;	1
not	1
selfwilled,	1
not	1
soon	1
angry,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
wine,	1
no	1
striker,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
1:8	1
But	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
hospitality,	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
good	1
men,	1
sober,	1
just,	1
holy,	1
temperate;	1
1:9	1
Holding	1
fast	1
the	1
faithful	1
word	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
taught,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
by	1
sound	1
doctrine	1
both	1
to	1
exhort	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
the	1
gainsayers.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
unruly	1
and	1
vain	1
talkers	1
and	1
deceivers,	1
specially	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision:	1
1:11	1
Whose	1
mouths	1
must	1
be	1
stopped,	1
who	1
subvert	1
whole	1
houses,	1
teaching	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
ought	1
not,	1
for	1
filthy	1
lucre's	1
sake.	1
	1
1:12	1
One	1
of	1
themselves,	1
even	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
said,	1
The	1
Cretians	1
are	1
alway	1
liars,	1
evil	1
beasts,	1
slow	1
bellies.	1
	1
1:13	1
This	1
witness	1
is	1
true.	1
Wherefore	1
rebuke	1
them	1
sharply,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
faith;	1
1:14	1
Not	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
Jewish	1
fables,	1
and	1
commandments	1
of	1
men,	1
that	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:15	1
Unto	1
the	1
pure	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
pure:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
defiled	1
and	1
unbelieving	1
is	1
nothing	1
pure;	1
but	1
even	1
their	1
mind	1
and	1
conscience	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
1:16	1
They	1
profess	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
God;	1
but	1
in	1
works	1
they	1
deny	1
him,	1
being	1
abominable,	1
and	1
disobedient,	1
and	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
work	1
reprobate.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
speak	1
thou	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
become	1
sound	1
doctrine:	1
2:2	1
That	1
the	1
aged	1
men	1
be	1
sober,	1
grave,	1
temperate,	1
sound	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
charity,	1
in	1
patience.	1
	1
2:3	1
The	1
aged	1
women	1
likewise,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
in	1
behaviour	1
as	1
becometh	1
holiness,	1
not	1
false	1
accusers,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
much	1
wine,	1
teachers	1
of	1
good	1
things;	1
2:4	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
teach	1
the	1
young	1
women	1
to	1
be	1
sober,	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
husbands,	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
children,	1
2:5	1
To	1
be	1
discreet,	1
chaste,	1
keepers	1
at	1
home,	1
good,	1
obedient	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
husbands,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
not	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
2:6	1
Young	1
men	1
likewise	1
exhort	1
to	1
be	1
sober	1
minded.	1
	1
2:7	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
shewing	1
thyself	1
a	1
pattern	1
of	1
good	1
works:	1
in	1
doctrine	1
shewing	1
uncorruptness,	1
gravity,	1
sincerity,	1
2:8	1
Sound	1
speech,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
condemned;	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
contrary	1
part	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
having	1
no	1
evil	1
thing	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
2:9	1
Exhort	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
masters,	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
them	1
well	1
in	1
all	1
things;	1
not	1
answering	1
again;	1
2:10	1
Not	1
purloining,	1
but	1
shewing	1
all	1
good	1
fidelity;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
adorn	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
bringeth	1
salvation	1
hath	1
appeared	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
2:12	1
Teaching	1
us	1
that,	1
denying	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
worldly	1
lusts,	1
we	1
should	1
live	1
soberly,	1
righteously,	1
and	1
godly,	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
world;	1
2:13	1
Looking	1
for	1
that	1
blessed	1
hope,	1
and	1
the	1
glorious	1
appearing	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
2:14	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
redeem	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
purify	1
unto	1
himself	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people,	1
zealous	1
of	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
2:15	1
These	1
things	1
speak,	1
and	1
exhort,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
with	1
all	1
authority.	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
despise	1
thee.	1
	1
3:1	1
Put	1
them	1
in	1
mind	1
to	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers,	1
to	1
obey	1
magistrates,	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
every	1
good	1
work,	1
3:2	1
To	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
no	1
man,	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
brawlers,	1
but	1
gentle,	1
shewing	1
all	1
meekness	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
were	1
sometimes	1
foolish,	1
disobedient,	1
deceived,	1
serving	1
divers	1
lusts	1
and	1
pleasures,	1
living	1
in	1
malice	1
and	1
envy,	1
hateful,	1
and	1
hating	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
3:4	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
kindness	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour	1
toward	1
man	1
appeared,	1
3:5	1
Not	1
by	1
works	1
of	1
righteousness	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
done,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
mercy	1
he	1
saved	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
regeneration,	1
and	1
renewing	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost;	1
3:6	1
Which	1
he	1
shed	1
on	1
us	1
abundantly	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
3:7	1
That	1
being	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
grace,	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
heirs	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
3:8	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying,	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
thou	1
affirm	1
constantly,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
careful	1
to	1
maintain	1
good	1
works.	1
These	1
things	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
profitable	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
3:9	1
But	1
avoid	1
foolish	1
questions,	1
and	1
genealogies,	1
and	1
contentions,	1
and	1
strivings	1
about	1
the	1
law;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
unprofitable	1
and	1
vain.	1
	1
3:10	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
heretick	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
admonition	1
reject;	1
3:11	1
Knowing	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
such	1
is	1
subverted,	1
and	1
sinneth,	1
being	1
condemned	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
3:12	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
Artemas	1
unto	1
thee,	1
or	1
Tychicus,	1
be	1
diligent	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
Nicopolis:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
determined	1
there	1
to	1
winter.	1
	1
3:13	1
Bring	1
Zenas	1
the	1
lawyer	1
and	1
Apollos	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
diligently,	1
that	1
nothing	1
be	1
wanting	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
let	1
our's	1
also	1
learn	1
to	1
maintain	1
good	1
works	1
for	1
necessary	1
uses,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
3:15	1
All	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
salute	1
thee.	1
Greet	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
faith.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1

Apostle	1
to	1
Philemon	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
Timothy	1
our	1
brother,	1
unto	1
Philemon	1
our	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
and	1
fellowlabourer,	1
1:2	1
And	1
to	1
our	1
beloved	1
Apphia,	1
and	1
Archippus	1
our	1
fellowsoldier,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
thy	1
house:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
thee	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers,	1
1:5	1
Hearing	1
of	1
thy	1
love	1
and	1
faith,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
toward	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
saints;	1
1:6	1
That	1
the	1
communication	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
may	1
become	1
effectual	1
by	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
and	1
consolation	1
in	1
thy	1
love,	1
because	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
are	1
refreshed	1
by	1
thee,	1
brother.	1
	1
1:8	1
Wherefore,	1
though	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
much	1
bold	1
in	1
Christ	1
to	1
enjoin	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
convenient,	1
1:9	1
Yet	1
for	1
love's	1
sake	1
I	1
rather	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
being	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
Paul	1
the	1
aged,	1
and	1
now	1
also	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:10	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee	1
for	1
my	1
son	1
Onesimus,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
begotten	1
in	1
my	1
bonds:	1
1:11	1
Which	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
was	1
to	1
thee	1
unprofitable,	1
but	1
now	1
profitable	1
to	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
me:	1
1:12	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
again:	1
thou	1
therefore	1
receive	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
mine	1
own	1
bowels:	1
1:13	1
Whom	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
retained	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
in	1
thy	1
stead	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
the	1
gospel:	1
1:14	1
But	1
without	1
thy	1
mind	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
nothing;	1
that	1
thy	1
benefit	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
necessity,	1
but	1
willingly.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
perhaps	1
he	1
therefore	1
departed	1
for	1
a	1
season,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
receive	1
him	1
for	1
ever;	1
1:16	1
Not	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
servant,	1
but	1
above	1
a	1
servant,	1
a	1
brother	1
beloved,	1
specially	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
unto	1
thee,	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
1:17	1
If	1
thou	1
count	1
me	1
therefore	1
a	1
partner,	1
receive	1
him	1
as	1
myself.	1
	1
1:18	1
If	1
he	1
hath	1
wronged	1
thee,	1
or	1
oweth	1
thee	1
ought,	1
put	1
that	1
on	1
mine	1
account;	1
1:19	1
I	1
Paul	1
have	1
written	1
it	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand,	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
it:	1
albeit	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
thee	1
how	1
thou	1
owest	1
unto	1
me	1
even	1
thine	1
own	1
self	1
besides.	1
	1
1:20	1
Yea,	1
brother,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
joy	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
refresh	1
my	1
bowels	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:21	1
Having	1
confidence	1
in	1
thy	1
obedience	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
thee,	1
knowing	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
also	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
say.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
withal	1
prepare	1
me	1
also	1
a	1
lodging:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
prayers	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:23	1
There	1
salute	1
thee	1
Epaphras,	1
my	1
fellowprisoner	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
1:24	1
Marcus,	1
Aristarchus,	1
Demas,	1
Lucas,	1
my	1
fellowlabourers.	1
	1
1:25	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
spirit.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
God,	1
who	1
at	1
sundry	1
times	1
and	1
in	1
divers	1
manners	1
spake	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
1:2	1
Hath	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
spoken	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Son,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
appointed	1
heir	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
by	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
worlds;	1
1:3	1
Who	1
being	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
express	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
person,	1
and	1
upholding	1
all	1
things	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
power,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
by	1
himself	1
purged	1
our	1
sins,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Majesty	1
on	1
high:	1
1:4	1
Being	1
made	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
angels,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
by	1
inheritance	1
obtained	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
name	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
unto	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee?	1
And	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
Son?	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
again,	1
when	1
he	1
bringeth	1
in	1
the	1
firstbegotten	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
saith,	1
And	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
he	1
saith,	1
Who	1
maketh	1
his	1
angels	1
spirits,	1
and	1
his	1
ministers	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
he	1
saith,	1
Thy	1
throne,	1
O	1
God,	1
is	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
a	1
sceptre	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
1:9	1
Thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
hated	1
iniquity;	1
therefore	1
God,	1
even	1
thy	1
God,	1
hath	1
anointed	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
gladness	1
above	1
thy	1
fellows.	1
	1
1:10	1
And,	1
Thou,	1
Lord,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
hast	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thine	1
hands:	1
1:11	1
They	1
shall	1
perish;	1
but	1
thou	1
remainest;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
as	1
doth	1
a	1
garment;	1
1:12	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
vesture	1
shalt	1
thou	1
fold	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
changed:	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
thy	1
years	1
shall	1
not	1
fail.	1
	1
1:13	1
But	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
Sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
until	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool?	1
	1
1:14	1
Are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
ministering	1
spirits,	1
sent	1
forth	1
to	1
minister	1
for	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
heirs	1
of	1
salvation?	1
	1
2:1	1
Therefore	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
more	1
earnest	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
we	1
should	1
let	1
them	1
slip.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
word	1
spoken	1
by	1
angels	1
was	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
every	1
transgression	1
and	1
disobedience	1
received	1
a	1
just	1
recompence	1
of	1
reward;	1
2:3	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
escape,	1
if	1
we	1
neglect	1
so	1
great	1
salvation;	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
was	1
confirmed	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
him;	1
2:4	1
God	1
also	1
bearing	1
them	1
witness,	1
both	1
with	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
and	1
with	1
divers	1
miracles,	1
and	1
gifts	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
will?	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
unto	1
the	1
angels	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
put	1
in	1
subjection	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come,	1
whereof	1
we	1
speak.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place	1
testified,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
mindful	1
of	1
him?	1
or	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
thou	1
visitest	1
him?	1
2:7	1
Thou	1
madest	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels;	1
thou	1
crownedst	1
him	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
didst	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thy	1
hands:	1
2:8	1
Thou	1
hast	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
subjection	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
all	1
in	1
subjection	1
under	1
him,	1
he	1
left	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
put	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
not	1
yet	1
all	1
things	1
put	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
we	1
see	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels	1
for	1
the	1
suffering	1
of	1
death,	1
crowned	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour;	1
that	1
he	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
taste	1
death	1
for	1
every	1
man.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
it	1
became	1
him,	1
for	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
in	1
bringing	1
many	1
sons	1
unto	1
glory,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
salvation	1
perfect	1
through	1
sufferings.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
sanctified	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
one:	1
for	1
which	1
cause	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
brethren,	1
2:12	1
Saying,	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
praise	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
And	1
again,	1
Behold	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me.	1
	1
2:14	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
he	1
also	1
himself	1
likewise	1
took	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
same;	1
that	1
through	1
death	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
death,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
devil;	1
2:15	1
And	1
deliver	1
them	1
who	1
through	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
were	1
all	1
their	1
lifetime	1
subject	1
to	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
verily	1
he	1
took	1
not	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
angels;	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
2:17	1
Wherefore	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
it	1
behoved	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
merciful	1
and	1
faithful	1
high	1
priest	1
in	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
God,	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
hath	1
suffered	1
being	1
tempted,	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
succour	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
tempted.	1
	1
3:1	1
Wherefore,	1
holy	1
brethren,	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
calling,	1
consider	1
the	1
Apostle	1
and	1
High	1
Priest	1
of	1
our	1
profession,	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
3:2	1
Who	1
was	1
faithful	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
appointed	1
him,	1
as	1
also	1
Moses	1
was	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
more	1
glory	1
than	1
Moses,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
who	1
hath	1
builded	1
the	1
house	1
hath	1
more	1
honour	1
than	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
every	1
house	1
is	1
builded	1
by	1
some	1
man;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
built	1
all	1
things	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
verily	1
was	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
as	1
a	1
servant,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
after;	1
3:6	1
But	1
Christ	1
as	1
a	1
son	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
whose	1
house	1
are	1
we,	1
if	1
we	1
hold	1
fast	1
the	1
confidence	1
and	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
firm	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
3:7	1
Wherefore	1
(as	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
saith,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
3:8	1
Harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
temptation	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
3:9	1
When	1
your	1
fathers	1
tempted	1
me,	1
proved	1
me,	1
and	1
saw	1
my	1
works	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
3:10	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
was	1
grieved	1
with	1
that	1
generation,	1
and	1
said,	1
They	1
do	1
alway	1
err	1
in	1
their	1
heart;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
my	1
ways.	1
	1
3:11	1
So	1
I	1
sware	1
in	1
my	1
wrath,	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.)	1
	1
3:12	1
Take	1
heed,	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
an	1
evil	1
heart	1
of	1
unbelief,	1
in	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
exhort	1
one	1
another	1
daily,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
To	1
day;	1
lest	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
hardened	1
through	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
Christ,	1
if	1
we	1
hold	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
our	1
confidence	1
stedfast	1
unto	1
the	1
end;	1
3:15	1
While	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
some,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard,	1
did	1
provoke:	1
howbeit	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
Moses.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
with	1
whom	1
was	1
he	1
grieved	1
forty	1
years?	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
sinned,	1
whose	1
carcases	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
to	1
whom	1
sware	1
he	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not?	1
	1
3:19	1
So	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief.	1
	1
4:1	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
fear,	1
lest,	1
a	1
promise	1
being	1
left	1
us	1
of	1
entering	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
seem	1
to	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
unto	1
us	1
was	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
preached	1
did	1
not	1
profit	1
them,	1
not	1
being	1
mixed	1
with	1
faith	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
we	1
which	1
have	1
believed	1
do	1
enter	1
into	1
rest,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
in	1
my	1
wrath,	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest:	1
although	1
the	1
works	1
were	1
finished	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
And	1
God	1
did	1
rest	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
again,	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.	1
	1
4:6	1
Seeing	1
therefore	1
it	1
remaineth	1
that	1
some	1
must	1
enter	1
therein,	1
and	1
they	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
first	1
preached	1
entered	1
not	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief:	1
4:7	1
Again,	1
he	1
limiteth	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
saying	1
in	1
David,	1
To	1
day,	1
after	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
time;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
if	1
Jesus	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
rest,	1
then	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
afterward	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
another	1
day.	1
	1
4:9	1
There	1
remaineth	1
therefore	1
a	1
rest	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
he	1
also	1
hath	1
ceased	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
works,	1
as	1
God	1
did	1
from	1
his.	1
	1
4:11	1
Let	1
us	1
labour	1
therefore	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
that	1
rest,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
fall	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
example	1
of	1
unbelief.	1
	1
4:12	1
For	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
quick,	1
and	1
powerful,	1
and	1
sharper	1
than	1
any	1
twoedged	1
sword,	1
piercing	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dividing	1
asunder	1
of	1
soul	1
and	1
spirit,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
joints	1
and	1
marrow,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
discerner	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
intents	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
4:13	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
creature	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
manifest	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
naked	1
and	1
opened	1
unto	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
4:14	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
high	1
priest,	1
that	1
is	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
heavens,	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
let	1
us	1
hold	1
fast	1
our	1
profession.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
our	1
infirmities;	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
points	1
tempted	1
like	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
yet	1
without	1
sin.	1
	1
4:16	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
come	1
boldly	1
unto	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
grace,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
obtain	1
mercy,	1
and	1
find	1
grace	1
to	1
help	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
need.	1
	1
5:1	1
For	1
every	1
high	1
priest	1
taken	1
from	1
among	1
men	1
is	1
ordained	1
for	1
men	1
in	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
offer	1
both	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
sins:	1
5:2	1
Who	1
can	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
ignorant,	1
and	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
also	1
is	1
compassed	1
with	1
infirmity.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
by	1
reason	1
hereof	1
he	1
ought,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
so	1
also	1
for	1
himself,	1
to	1
offer	1
for	1
sins.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
this	1
honour	1
unto	1
himself,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
was	1
Aaron.	1
	1
5:5	1
So	1
also	1
Christ	1
glorified	1
not	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
an	1
high	1
priest;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
to	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
5:6	1
As	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
5:7	1
Who	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
up	1
prayers	1
and	1
supplications	1
with	1
strong	1
crying	1
and	1
tears	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
feared;	1
5:8	1
Though	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
Son,	1
yet	1
learned	1
he	1
obedience	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
suffered;	1
5:9	1
And	1
being	1
made	1
perfect,	1
he	1
became	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
eternal	1
salvation	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
him;	1
5:10	1
Called	1
of	1
God	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
5:11	1
Of	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
uttered,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
when	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
teachers,	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
that	1
one	1
teach	1
you	1
again	1
which	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
strong	1
meat.	1
	1
5:13	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
useth	1
milk	1
is	1
unskilful	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
babe.	1
	1
5:14	1
But	1
strong	1
meat	1
belongeth	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
full	1
age,	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
use	1
have	1
their	1
senses	1
exercised	1
to	1
discern	1
both	1
good	1
and	1
evil.	1
	1
6:1	1
Therefore	1
leaving	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
on	1
unto	1
perfection;	1
not	1
laying	1
again	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
repentance	1
from	1
dead	1
works,	1
and	1
of	1
faith	1
toward	1
God,	1
6:2	1
Of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
baptisms,	1
and	1
of	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
hands,	1
and	1
of	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
of	1
eternal	1
judgment.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
this	1
will	1
we	1
do,	1
if	1
God	1
permit.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
once	1
enlightened,	1
and	1
have	1
tasted	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
gift,	1
and	1
were	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
6:5	1
And	1
have	1
tasted	1
the	1
good	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come,	1
6:6	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
away,	1
to	1
renew	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
repentance;	1
seeing	1
they	1
crucify	1
to	1
themselves	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
afresh,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
shame.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
drinketh	1
in	1
the	1
rain	1
that	1
cometh	1
oft	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
herbs	1
meet	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
dressed,	1
receiveth	1
blessing	1
from	1
God:	1
6:8	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
beareth	1
thorns	1
and	1
briers	1
is	1
rejected,	1
and	1
is	1
nigh	1
unto	1
cursing;	1
whose	1
end	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
burned.	1
	1
6:9	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
we	1
are	1
persuaded	1
better	1
things	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
things	1
that	1
accompany	1
salvation,	1
though	1
we	1
thus	1
speak.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
unrighteous	1
to	1
forget	1
your	1
work	1
and	1
labour	1
of	1
love,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
shewed	1
toward	1
his	1
name,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
ministered	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
do	1
minister.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
we	1
desire	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
do	1
shew	1
the	1
same	1
diligence	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
hope	1
unto	1
the	1
end:	1
6:12	1
That	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
slothful,	1
but	1
followers	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
through	1
faith	1
and	1
patience	1
inherit	1
the	1
promises.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
when	1
God	1
made	1
promise	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
swear	1
by	1
no	1
greater,	1
he	1
sware	1
by	1
himself,	1
6:14	1
Saying,	1
Surely	1
blessing	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
multiplying	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
thee.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
so,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
patiently	1
endured,	1
he	1
obtained	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
6:16	1
For	1
men	1
verily	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
greater:	1
and	1
an	1
oath	1
for	1
confirmation	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
strife.	1
	1
6:17	1
Wherein	1
God,	1
willing	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
heirs	1
of	1
promise	1
the	1
immutability	1
of	1
his	1
counsel,	1
confirmed	1
it	1
by	1
an	1
oath:	1
6:18	1
That	1
by	1
two	1
immutable	1
things,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
God	1
to	1
lie,	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
consolation,	1
who	1
have	1
fled	1
for	1
refuge	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
hope	1
set	1
before	1
us:	1
6:19	1
Which	1
hope	1
we	1
have	1
as	1
an	1
anchor	1
of	1
the	1
soul,	1
both	1
sure	1
and	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
which	1
entereth	1
into	1
that	1
within	1
the	1
veil;	1
6:20	1
Whither	1
the	1
forerunner	1
is	1
for	1
us	1
entered,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
made	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
7:1	1
For	1
this	1
Melchisedec,	1
king	1
of	1
Salem,	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
who	1
met	1
Abraham	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
kings,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him;	1
7:2	1
To	1
whom	1
also	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
all;	1
first	1
being	1
by	1
interpretation	1
King	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
also	1
King	1
of	1
Salem,	1
which	1
is,	1
King	1
of	1
peace;	1
7:3	1
Without	1
father,	1
without	1
mother,	1
without	1
descent,	1
having	1
neither	1
beginning	1
of	1
days,	1
nor	1
end	1
of	1
life;	1
but	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
abideth	1
a	1
priest	1
continually.	1
	1
7:4	1
Now	1
consider	1
how	1
great	1
this	1
man	1
was,	1
unto	1
whom	1
even	1
the	1
patriarch	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
the	1
spoils.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
verily	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
who	1
receive	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
priesthood,	1
have	1
a	1
commandment	1
to	1
take	1
tithes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
their	1
brethren,	1
though	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Abraham:	1
7:6	1
But	1
he	1
whose	1
descent	1
is	1
not	1
counted	1
from	1
them	1
received	1
tithes	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
promises.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
without	1
all	1
contradiction	1
the	1
less	1
is	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
better.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
here	1
men	1
that	1
die	1
receive	1
tithes;	1
but	1
there	1
he	1
receiveth	1
them,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
witnessed	1
that	1
he	1
liveth.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
say,	1
Levi	1
also,	1
who	1
receiveth	1
tithes,	1
payed	1
tithes	1
in	1
Abraham.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
when	1
Melchisedec	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
7:11	1
If	1
therefore	1
perfection	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
Levitical	1
priesthood,	1
(for	1
under	1
it	1
the	1
people	1
received	1
the	1
law,)	1
what	1
further	1
need	1
was	1
there	1
that	1
another	1
priest	1
should	1
rise	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Aaron?	1
	1
7:12	1
For	1
the	1
priesthood	1
being	1
changed,	1
there	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
necessity	1
a	1
change	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
7:13	1
For	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
spoken	1
pertaineth	1
to	1
another	1
tribe,	1
of	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
gave	1
attendance	1
at	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
our	1
Lord	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
Juda;	1
of	1
which	1
tribe	1
Moses	1
spake	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
priesthood.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
far	1
more	1
evident:	1
for	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
Melchisedec	1
there	1
ariseth	1
another	1
priest,	1
7:16	1
Who	1
is	1
made,	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
a	1
carnal	1
commandment,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
an	1
endless	1
life.	1
	1
7:17	1
For	1
he	1
testifieth,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
7:18	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
verily	1
a	1
disannulling	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
going	1
before	1
for	1
the	1
weakness	1
and	1
unprofitableness	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
made	1
nothing	1
perfect,	1
but	1
the	1
bringing	1
in	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
hope	1
did;	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
we	1
draw	1
nigh	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
oath	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
priest:	1
7:21	1
(For	1
those	1
priests	1
were	1
made	1
without	1
an	1
oath;	1
but	1
this	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Lord	1
sware	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
repent,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec:)	1
7:22	1
By	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
Jesus	1
made	1
a	1
surety	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
testament.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
they	1
truly	1
were	1
many	1
priests,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
suffered	1
to	1
continue	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
death:	1
7:24	1
But	1
this	1
man,	1
because	1
he	1
continueth	1
ever,	1
hath	1
an	1
unchangeable	1
priesthood.	1
	1
7:25	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
that	1
come	1
unto	1
God	1
by	1
him,	1
seeing	1
he	1
ever	1
liveth	1
to	1
make	1
intercession	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
7:26	1
For	1
such	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
became	1
us,	1
who	1
is	1
holy,	1
harmless,	1
undefiled,	1
separate	1
from	1
sinners,	1
and	1
made	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
heavens;	1
7:27	1
Who	1
needeth	1
not	1
daily,	1
as	1
those	1
high	1
priests,	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
sacrifice,	1
first	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sins,	1
and	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
people's:	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
once,	1
when	1
he	1
offered	1
up	1
himself.	1
	1
7:28	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
maketh	1
men	1
high	1
priests	1
which	1
have	1
infirmity;	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
oath,	1
which	1
was	1
since	1
the	1
law,	1
maketh	1
the	1
Son,	1
who	1
is	1
consecrated	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
8:1	1
Now	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
spoken	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sum:	1
We	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
high	1
priest,	1
who	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
Majesty	1
in	1
the	1
heavens;	1
8:2	1
A	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
tabernacle,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
pitched,	1
and	1
not	1
man.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
every	1
high	1
priest	1
is	1
ordained	1
to	1
offer	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices:	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
necessity	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
have	1
somewhat	1
also	1
to	1
offer.	1
	1
8:4	1
For	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
on	1
earth,	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
priest,	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
priests	1
that	1
offer	1
gifts	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law:	1
8:5	1
Who	1
serve	1
unto	1
the	1
example	1
and	1
shadow	1
of	1
heavenly	1
things,	1
as	1
Moses	1
was	1
admonished	1
of	1
God	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
for,	1
See,	1
saith	1
he,	1
that	1
thou	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
pattern	1
shewed	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
8:6	1
But	1
now	1
hath	1
he	1
obtained	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
ministry,	1
by	1
how	1
much	1
also	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
covenant,	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
upon	1
better	1
promises.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
if	1
that	1
first	1
covenant	1
had	1
been	1
faultless,	1
then	1
should	1
no	1
place	1
have	1
been	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
8:8	1
For	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
when	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
8:9	1
Not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
because	1
they	1
continued	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
covenant,	1
and	1
I	1
regarded	1
them	1
not,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
after	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
laws	1
into	1
their	1
mind,	1
and	1
write	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hearts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
people:	1
8:11	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
teach	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
Know	1
the	1
Lord:	1
for	1
all	1
shall	1
know	1
me,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
their	1
unrighteousness,	1
and	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
their	1
iniquities	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
8:13	1
In	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
A	1
new	1
covenant,	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
first	1
old.	1
Now	1
that	1
which	1
decayeth	1
and	1
waxeth	1
old	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
vanish	1
away.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
verily	1
the	1
first	1
covenant	1
had	1
also	1
ordinances	1
of	1
divine	1
service,	1
and	1
a	1
worldly	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
9:2	1
For	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
made;	1
the	1
first,	1
wherein	1
was	1
the	1
candlestick,	1
and	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
shewbread;	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
second	1
veil,	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Holiest	1
of	1
all;	1
9:4	1
Which	1
had	1
the	1
golden	1
censer,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
overlaid	1
round	1
about	1
with	1
gold,	1
wherein	1
was	1
the	1
golden	1
pot	1
that	1
had	1
manna,	1
and	1
Aaron's	1
rod	1
that	1
budded,	1
and	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
covenant;	1
9:5	1
And	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
cherubims	1
of	1
glory	1
shadowing	1
the	1
mercyseat;	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
now	1
speak	1
particularly.	1
	1
9:6	1
Now	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
thus	1
ordained,	1
the	1
priests	1
went	1
always	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
tabernacle,	1
accomplishing	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:7	1
But	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
went	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
alone	1
once	1
every	1
year,	1
not	1
without	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
offered	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
errors	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
9:8	1
The	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
this	1
signifying,	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
holiest	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
made	1
manifest,	1
while	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
tabernacle	1
was	1
yet	1
standing:	1
9:9	1
Which	1
was	1
a	1
figure	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
then	1
present,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
offered	1
both	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices,	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
service	1
perfect,	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
conscience;	1
9:10	1
Which	1
stood	1
only	1
in	1
meats	1
and	1
drinks,	1
and	1
divers	1
washings,	1
and	1
carnal	1
ordinances,	1
imposed	1
on	1
them	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
reformation.	1
	1
9:11	1
But	1
Christ	1
being	1
come	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
by	1
a	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
perfect	1
tabernacle,	1
not	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
building;	1
9:12	1
Neither	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
goats	1
and	1
calves,	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
blood	1
he	1
entered	1
in	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
having	1
obtained	1
eternal	1
redemption	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:13	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
and	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
an	1
heifer	1
sprinkling	1
the	1
unclean,	1
sanctifieth	1
to	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
flesh:	1
9:14	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
through	1
the	1
eternal	1
Spirit	1
offered	1
himself	1
without	1
spot	1
to	1
God,	1
purge	1
your	1
conscience	1
from	1
dead	1
works	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
living	1
God?	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
that	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
death,	1
for	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
transgressions	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
testament,	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
eternal	1
inheritance.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
where	1
a	1
testament	1
is,	1
there	1
must	1
also	1
of	1
necessity	1
be	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
testator.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
a	1
testament	1
is	1
of	1
force	1
after	1
men	1
are	1
dead:	1
otherwise	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
strength	1
at	1
all	1
while	1
the	1
testator	1
liveth.	1
	1
9:18	1
Whereupon	1
neither	1
the	1
first	1
testament	1
was	1
dedicated	1
without	1
blood.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
when	1
Moses	1
had	1
spoken	1
every	1
precept	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
calves	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
scarlet	1
wool,	1
and	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
both	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
9:20	1
Saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
testament	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
enjoined	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:21	1
Moreover	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
blood	1
both	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
ministry.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
almost	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
purged	1
with	1
blood;	1
and	1
without	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
is	1
no	1
remission.	1
	1
9:23	1
It	1
was	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
patterns	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
should	1
be	1
purified	1
with	1
these;	1
but	1
the	1
heavenly	1
things	1
themselves	1
with	1
better	1
sacrifices	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
9:24	1
For	1
Christ	1
is	1
not	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
places	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
the	1
true;	1
but	1
into	1
heaven	1
itself,	1
now	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
us:	1
9:25	1
Nor	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offer	1
himself	1
often,	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
entereth	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
every	1
year	1
with	1
blood	1
of	1
others;	1
9:26	1
For	1
then	1
must	1
he	1
often	1
have	1
suffered	1
since	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
but	1
now	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
sin	1
by	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
appointed	1
unto	1
men	1
once	1
to	1
die,	1
but	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
judgment:	1
9:28	1
So	1
Christ	1
was	1
once	1
offered	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
many;	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
shall	1
he	1
appear	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
without	1
sin	1
unto	1
salvation.	1
	1
10:1	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
having	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
things,	1
can	1
never	1
with	1
those	1
sacrifices	1
which	1
they	1
offered	1
year	1
by	1
year	1
continually	1
make	1
the	1
comers	1
thereunto	1
perfect.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
then	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
offered?	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
worshippers	1
once	1
purged	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
conscience	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
10:3	1
But	1
in	1
those	1
sacrifices	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
remembrance	1
again	1
made	1
of	1
sins	1
every	1
year.	1
	1
10:4	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
of	1
goats	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
sins.	1
	1
10:5	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not,	1
but	1
a	1
body	1
hast	1
thou	1
prepared	1
me:	1
10:6	1
In	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
sin	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure.	1
	1
10:7	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
(in	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
me,)	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
God.	1
	1
10:8	1
Above	1
when	1
he	1
said,	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
offering	1
for	1
sin	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not,	1
neither	1
hadst	1
pleasure	1
therein;	1
which	1
are	1
offered	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
10:9	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
God.	1
He	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
establish	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
10:10	1
By	1
the	1
which	1
will	1
we	1
are	1
sanctified	1
through	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
once	1
for	1
all.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
every	1
priest	1
standeth	1
daily	1
ministering	1
and	1
offering	1
oftentimes	1
the	1
same	1
sacrifices,	1
which	1
can	1
never	1
take	1
away	1
sins:	1
10:12	1
But	1
this	1
man,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
one	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sins	1
for	1
ever,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God;	1
10:13	1
From	1
henceforth	1
expecting	1
till	1
his	1
enemies	1
be	1
made	1
his	1
footstool.	1
	1
10:14	1
For	1
by	1
one	1
offering	1
he	1
hath	1
perfected	1
for	1
ever	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified.	1
	1
10:15	1
Whereof	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
also	1
is	1
a	1
witness	1
to	1
us:	1
for	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
10:16	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
them	1
after	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
laws	1
into	1
their	1
hearts,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
will	1
I	1
write	1
them;	1
10:17	1
And	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
10:18	1
Now	1
where	1
remission	1
of	1
these	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
offering	1
for	1
sin.	1
	1
10:19	1
Having	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
boldness	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
holiest	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
10:20	1
By	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
living	1
way,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
consecrated	1
for	1
us,	1
through	1
the	1
veil,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
his	1
flesh;	1
10:21	1
And	1
having	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God;	1
10:22	1
Let	1
us	1
draw	1
near	1
with	1
a	1
true	1
heart	1
in	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
faith,	1
having	1
our	1
hearts	1
sprinkled	1
from	1
an	1
evil	1
conscience,	1
and	1
our	1
bodies	1
washed	1
with	1
pure	1
water.	1
	1
10:23	1
Let	1
us	1
hold	1
fast	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
our	1
faith	1
without	1
wavering;	1
(for	1
he	1
is	1
faithful	1
that	1
promised;)	1
10:24	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
provoke	1
unto	1
love	1
and	1
to	1
good	1
works:	1
10:25	1
Not	1
forsaking	1
the	1
assembling	1
of	1
ourselves	1
together,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
some	1
is;	1
but	1
exhorting	1
one	1
another:	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more,	1
as	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
day	1
approaching.	1
	1
10:26	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
sin	1
wilfully	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
there	1
remaineth	1
no	1
more	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sins,	1
10:27	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
fearful	1
looking	1
for	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
fiery	1
indignation,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
adversaries.	1
	1
10:28	1
He	1
that	1
despised	1
Moses'	1
law	1
died	1
without	1
mercy	1
under	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses:	1
10:29	1
Of	1
how	1
much	1
sorer	1
punishment,	1
suppose	1
ye,	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
thought	1
worthy,	1
who	1
hath	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
hath	1
counted	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
sanctified,	1
an	1
unholy	1
thing,	1
and	1
hath	1
done	1
despite	1
unto	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
grace?	1
10:30	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
said,	1
Vengeance	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
recompense,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
And	1
again,	1
The	1
Lord	1
shall	1
judge	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
10:31	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
fearful	1
thing	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
But	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
former	1
days,	1
in	1
which,	1
after	1
ye	1
were	1
illuminated,	1
ye	1
endured	1
a	1
great	1
fight	1
of	1
afflictions;	1
10:33	1
Partly,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
a	1
gazingstock	1
both	1
by	1
reproaches	1
and	1
afflictions;	1
and	1
partly,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
became	1
companions	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
used.	1
	1
10:34	1
For	1
ye	1
had	1
compassion	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
bonds,	1
and	1
took	1
joyfully	1
the	1
spoiling	1
of	1
your	1
goods,	1
knowing	1
in	1
yourselves	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
in	1
heaven	1
a	1
better	1
and	1
an	1
enduring	1
substance.	1
	1
10:35	1
Cast	1
not	1
away	1
therefore	1
your	1
confidence,	1
which	1
hath	1
great	1
recompence	1
of	1
reward.	1
	1
10:36	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
patience,	1
that,	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
10:37	1
For	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
will	1
come,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
tarry.	1
	1
10:38	1
Now	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith:	1
but	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
draw	1
back,	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
draw	1
back	1
unto	1
perdition;	1
but	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
to	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
the	1
soul.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
faith	1
is	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
things	1
hoped	1
for,	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
seen.	1
	1
11:2	1
For	1
by	1
it	1
the	1
elders	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
report.	1
	1
11:3	1
Through	1
faith	1
we	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
worlds	1
were	1
framed	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
so	1
that	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen	1
were	1
not	1
made	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
do	1
appear.	1
	1
11:4	1
By	1
faith	1
Abel	1
offered	1
unto	1
God	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
sacrifice	1
than	1
Cain,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
obtained	1
witness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
righteous,	1
God	1
testifying	1
of	1
his	1
gifts:	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
being	1
dead	1
yet	1
speaketh.	1
	1
11:5	1
By	1
faith	1
Enoch	1
was	1
translated	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
death;	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
found,	1
because	1
God	1
had	1
translated	1
him:	1
for	1
before	1
his	1
translation	1
he	1
had	1
this	1
testimony,	1
that	1
he	1
pleased	1
God.	1
	1
11:6	1
But	1
without	1
faith	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
please	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
God	1
must	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
rewarder	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
diligently	1
seek	1
him.	1
	1
11:7	1
By	1
faith	1
Noah,	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
seen	1
as	1
yet,	1
moved	1
with	1
fear,	1
prepared	1
an	1
ark	1
to	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
his	1
house;	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
condemned	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
became	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
11:8	1
By	1
faith	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
after	1
receive	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
obeyed;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whither	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
11:9	1
By	1
faith	1
he	1
sojourned	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
country,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
tabernacles	1
with	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
the	1
heirs	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
promise:	1
11:10	1
For	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
city	1
which	1
hath	1
foundations,	1
whose	1
builder	1
and	1
maker	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
11:11	1
Through	1
faith	1
also	1
Sara	1
herself	1
received	1
strength	1
to	1
conceive	1
seed,	1
and	1
was	1
delivered	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
past	1
age,	1
because	1
she	1
judged	1
him	1
faithful	1
who	1
had	1
promised.	1
	1
11:12	1
Therefore	1
sprang	1
there	1
even	1
of	1
one,	1
and	1
him	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
dead,	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
in	1
multitude,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
shore	1
innumerable.	1
	1
11:13	1
These	1
all	1
died	1
in	1
faith,	1
not	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
promises,	1
but	1
having	1
seen	1
them	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
were	1
persuaded	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them,	1
and	1
confessed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
strangers	1
and	1
pilgrims	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:14	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
say	1
such	1
things	1
declare	1
plainly	1
that	1
they	1
seek	1
a	1
country.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
truly,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
came	1
out,	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
opportunity	1
to	1
have	1
returned.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
desire	1
a	1
better	1
country,	1
that	1
is,	1
an	1
heavenly:	1
wherefore	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
city.	1
	1
11:17	1
By	1
faith	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tried,	1
offered	1
up	1
Isaac:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
promises	1
offered	1
up	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
son,	1
11:18	1
Of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
That	1
in	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called:	1
11:19	1
Accounting	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
up,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
from	1
whence	1
also	1
he	1
received	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
figure.	1
	1
11:20	1
By	1
faith	1
Isaac	1
blessed	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Esau	1
concerning	1
things	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
11:21	1
By	1
faith	1
Jacob,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
dying,	1
blessed	1
both	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joseph;	1
and	1
worshipped,	1
leaning	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
staff.	1
	1
11:22	1
By	1
faith	1
Joseph,	1
when	1
he	1
died,	1
made	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
departing	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
gave	1
commandment	1
concerning	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
11:23	1
By	1
faith	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
born,	1
was	1
hid	1
three	1
months	1
of	1
his	1
parents,	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
proper	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment.	1
	1
11:24	1
By	1
faith	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
years,	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter;	1
11:25	1
Choosing	1
rather	1
to	1
suffer	1
affliction	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God,	1
than	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
sin	1
for	1
a	1
season;	1
11:26	1
Esteeming	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
Christ	1
greater	1
riches	1
than	1
the	1
treasures	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
the	1
recompence	1
of	1
the	1
reward.	1
	1
11:27	1
By	1
faith	1
he	1
forsook	1
Egypt,	1
not	1
fearing	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
he	1
endured,	1
as	1
seeing	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
invisible.	1
	1
11:28	1
Through	1
faith	1
he	1
kept	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
the	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
blood,	1
lest	1
he	1
that	1
destroyed	1
the	1
firstborn	1
should	1
touch	1
them.	1
	1
11:29	1
By	1
faith	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
as	1
by	1
dry	1
land:	1
which	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
assaying	1
to	1
do	1
were	1
drowned.	1
	1
11:30	1
By	1
faith	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jericho	1
fell	1
down,	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
compassed	1
about	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
11:31	1
By	1
faith	1
the	1
harlot	1
Rahab	1
perished	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
spies	1
with	1
peace.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
more	1
say?	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
would	1
fail	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
Gedeon,	1
and	1
of	1
Barak,	1
and	1
of	1
Samson,	1
and	1
of	1
Jephthae;	1
of	1
David	1
also,	1
and	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
prophets:	1
11:33	1
Who	1
through	1
faith	1
subdued	1
kingdoms,	1
wrought	1
righteousness,	1
obtained	1
promises,	1
stopped	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
11:34	1
Quenched	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
fire,	1
escaped	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
out	1
of	1
weakness	1
were	1
made	1
strong,	1
waxed	1
valiant	1
in	1
fight,	1
turned	1
to	1
flight	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
aliens.	1
	1
11:35	1
Women	1
received	1
their	1
dead	1
raised	1
to	1
life	1
again:	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
tortured,	1
not	1
accepting	1
deliverance;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
obtain	1
a	1
better	1
resurrection:	1
11:36	1
And	1
others	1
had	1
trial	1
of	1
cruel	1
mockings	1
and	1
scourgings,	1
yea,	1
moreover	1
of	1
bonds	1
and	1
imprisonment:	1
11:37	1
They	1
were	1
stoned,	1
they	1
were	1
sawn	1
asunder,	1
were	1
tempted,	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
they	1
wandered	1
about	1
in	1
sheepskins	1
and	1
goatskins;	1
being	1
destitute,	1
afflicted,	1
tormented;	1
11:38	1
(Of	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
not	1
worthy:)	1
they	1
wandered	1
in	1
deserts,	1
and	1
in	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
dens	1
and	1
caves	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
these	1
all,	1
having	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
through	1
faith,	1
received	1
not	1
the	1
promise:	1
11:40	1
God	1
having	1
provided	1
some	1
better	1
thing	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
they	1
without	1
us	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
perfect.	1
	1
12:1	1
Wherefore	1
seeing	1
we	1
also	1
are	1
compassed	1
about	1
with	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
witnesses,	1
let	1
us	1
lay	1
aside	1
every	1
weight,	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
which	1
doth	1
so	1
easily	1
beset	1
us,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
run	1
with	1
patience	1
the	1
race	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
us,	1
12:2	1
Looking	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
the	1
author	1
and	1
finisher	1
of	1
our	1
faith;	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
before	1
him	1
endured	1
the	1
cross,	1
despising	1
the	1
shame,	1
and	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:3	1
For	1
consider	1
him	1
that	1
endured	1
such	1
contradiction	1
of	1
sinners	1
against	1
himself,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
wearied	1
and	1
faint	1
in	1
your	1
minds.	1
	1
12:4	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
resisted	1
unto	1
blood,	1
striving	1
against	1
sin.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
exhortation	1
which	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
unto	1
children,	1
My	1
son,	1
despise	1
not	1
thou	1
the	1
chastening	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
nor	1
faint	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
rebuked	1
of	1
him:	1
12:6	1
For	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
loveth	1
he	1
chasteneth,	1
and	1
scourgeth	1
every	1
son	1
whom	1
he	1
receiveth.	1
	1
12:7	1
If	1
ye	1
endure	1
chastening,	1
God	1
dealeth	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
with	1
sons;	1
for	1
what	1
son	1
is	1
he	1
whom	1
the	1
father	1
chasteneth	1
not?	1
	1
12:8	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
without	1
chastisement,	1
whereof	1
all	1
are	1
partakers,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
bastards,	1
and	1
not	1
sons.	1
	1
12:9	1
Furthermore	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
fathers	1
of	1
our	1
flesh	1
which	1
corrected	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
gave	1
them	1
reverence:	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
much	1
rather	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
spirits,	1
and	1
live?	1
	1
12:10	1
For	1
they	1
verily	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
chastened	1
us	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
pleasure;	1
but	1
he	1
for	1
our	1
profit,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
12:11	1
Now	1
no	1
chastening	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
joyous,	1
but	1
grievous:	1
nevertheless	1
afterward	1
it	1
yieldeth	1
the	1
peaceable	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
exercised	1
thereby.	1
	1
12:12	1
Wherefore	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
hands	1
which	1
hang	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
feeble	1
knees;	1
12:13	1
And	1
make	1
straight	1
paths	1
for	1
your	1
feet,	1
lest	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lame	1
be	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
but	1
let	1
it	1
rather	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
12:14	1
Follow	1
peace	1
with	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
holiness,	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Lord:	1
12:15	1
Looking	1
diligently	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
fail	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God;	1
lest	1
any	1
root	1
of	1
bitterness	1
springing	1
up	1
trouble	1
you,	1
and	1
thereby	1
many	1
be	1
defiled;	1
12:16	1
Lest	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
fornicator,	1
or	1
profane	1
person,	1
as	1
Esau,	1
who	1
for	1
one	1
morsel	1
of	1
meat	1
sold	1
his	1
birthright.	1
	1
12:17	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
afterward,	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
inherited	1
the	1
blessing,	1
he	1
was	1
rejected:	1
for	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
place	1
of	1
repentance,	1
though	1
he	1
sought	1
it	1
carefully	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
12:18	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
touched,	1
and	1
that	1
burned	1
with	1
fire,	1
nor	1
unto	1
blackness,	1
and	1
darkness,	1
and	1
tempest,	1
12:19	1
And	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
words;	1
which	1
voice	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
intreated	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
spoken	1
to	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
12:20	1
(For	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
commanded,	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
beast	1
touch	1
the	1
mountain,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
stoned,	1
or	1
thrust	1
through	1
with	1
a	1
dart:	1
12:21	1
And	1
so	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
sight,	1
that	1
Moses	1
said,	1
I	1
exceedingly	1
fear	1
and	1
quake:)	1
12:22	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
the	1
heavenly	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
innumerable	1
company	1
of	1
angels,	1
12:23	1
To	1
the	1
general	1
assembly	1
and	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
just	1
men	1
made	1
perfect,	1
12:24	1
And	1
to	1
Jesus	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
covenant,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
sprinkling,	1
that	1
speaketh	1
better	1
things	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
Abel.	1
	1
12:25	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
refuse	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh.	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
escaped	1
not	1
who	1
refused	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
on	1
earth,	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
not	1
we	1
escape,	1
if	1
we	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
from	1
heaven:	1
12:26	1
Whose	1
voice	1
then	1
shook	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
hath	1
promised,	1
saying,	1
Yet	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
shake	1
not	1
the	1
earth	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
this	1
word,	1
Yet	1
once	1
more,	1
signifieth	1
the	1
removing	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
shaken,	1
as	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
made,	1
that	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
shaken	1
may	1
remain.	1
	1
12:28	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
receiving	1
a	1
kingdom	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
moved,	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
grace,	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
serve	1
God	1
acceptably	1
with	1
reverence	1
and	1
godly	1
fear:	1
12:29	1
For	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
consuming	1
fire.	1
	1
13:1	1
Let	1
brotherly	1
love	1
continue.	1
	1
13:2	1
Be	1
not	1
forgetful	1
to	1
entertain	1
strangers:	1
for	1
thereby	1
some	1
have	1
entertained	1
angels	1
unawares.	1
	1
13:3	1
Remember	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
bonds,	1
as	1
bound	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
suffer	1
adversity,	1
as	1
being	1
yourselves	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
13:4	1
Marriage	1
is	1
honourable	1
in	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
bed	1
undefiled:	1
but	1
whoremongers	1
and	1
adulterers	1
God	1
will	1
judge.	1
	1
13:5	1
Let	1
your	1
conversation	1
be	1
without	1
covetousness;	1
and	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
ye	1
have:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
leave	1
thee,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
thee.	1
	1
13:6	1
So	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
boldly	1
say,	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
my	1
helper,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
fear	1
what	1
man	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
13:7	1
Remember	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
whose	1
faith	1
follow,	1
considering	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
conversation.	1
	1
13:8	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
13:9	1
Be	1
not	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
divers	1
and	1
strange	1
doctrines.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
heart	1
be	1
established	1
with	1
grace;	1
not	1
with	1
meats,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
profited	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
occupied	1
therein.	1
	1
13:10	1
We	1
have	1
an	1
altar,	1
whereof	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
eat	1
which	1
serve	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
those	1
beasts,	1
whose	1
blood	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
for	1
sin,	1
are	1
burned	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
13:12	1
Wherefore	1
Jesus	1
also,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
sanctify	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
blood,	1
suffered	1
without	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
13:13	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
forth	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
bearing	1
his	1
reproach.	1
	1
13:14	1
For	1
here	1
have	1
we	1
no	1
continuing	1
city,	1
but	1
we	1
seek	1
one	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
13:15	1
By	1
him	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
offer	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
praise	1
to	1
God	1
continually,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
our	1
lips	1
giving	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
13:16	1
But	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
communicate	1
forget	1
not:	1
for	1
with	1
such	1
sacrifices	1
God	1
is	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
13:17	1
Obey	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
submit	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
they	1
watch	1
for	1
your	1
souls,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
must	1
give	1
account,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
grief:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
unprofitable	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
13:18	1
Pray	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
trust	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
conscience,	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
willing	1
to	1
live	1
honestly.	1
	1
13:19	1
But	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
the	1
rather	1
to	1
do	1
this,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
sooner.	1
	1
13:20	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace,	1
that	1
brought	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
great	1
shepherd	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
13:21	1
Make	1
you	1
perfect	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
will,	1
working	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
wellpleasing	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
suffer	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
exhortation:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
13:23	1
Know	1
ye	1
that	1
our	1
brother	1
Timothy	1
is	1
set	1
at	1
liberty;	1
with	1
whom,	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
shortly,	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
you.	1
	1
13:24	1
Salute	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
They	1
of	1
Italy	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
13:25	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
James	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
James,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
which	1
are	1
scattered	1
abroad,	1
greeting.	1
	1
1:2	1
My	1
brethren,	1
count	1
it	1
all	1
joy	1
when	1
ye	1
fall	1
into	1
divers	1
temptations;	1
1:3	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
trying	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
worketh	1
patience.	1
	1
1:4	1
But	1
let	1
patience	1
have	1
her	1
perfect	1
work,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
perfect	1
and	1
entire,	1
wanting	1
nothing.	1
	1
1:5	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
lack	1
wisdom,	1
let	1
him	1
ask	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
giveth	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
liberally,	1
and	1
upbraideth	1
not;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
1:6	1
But	1
let	1
him	1
ask	1
in	1
faith,	1
nothing	1
wavering.	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
wavereth	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
driven	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
tossed.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
let	1
not	1
that	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:8	1
A	1
double	1
minded	1
man	1
is	1
unstable	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
1:9	1
Let	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
low	1
degree	1
rejoice	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
exalted:	1
1:10	1
But	1
the	1
rich,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
made	1
low:	1
because	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
no	1
sooner	1
risen	1
with	1
a	1
burning	1
heat,	1
but	1
it	1
withereth	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
thereof	1
falleth,	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
it	1
perisheth:	1
so	1
also	1
shall	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
fade	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
1:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
endureth	1
temptation:	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
tried,	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
promised	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him.	1
	1
1:13	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
tempted,	1
I	1
am	1
tempted	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
God	1
cannot	1
be	1
tempted	1
with	1
evil,	1
neither	1
tempteth	1
he	1
any	1
man:	1
1:14	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
tempted,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
drawn	1
away	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
lust,	1
and	1
enticed.	1
	1
1:15	1
Then	1
when	1
lust	1
hath	1
conceived,	1
it	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
sin:	1
and	1
sin,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
finished,	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
death.	1
	1
1:16	1
Do	1
not	1
err,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren.	1
	1
1:17	1
Every	1
good	1
gift	1
and	1
every	1
perfect	1
gift	1
is	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
lights,	1
with	1
whom	1
is	1
no	1
variableness,	1
neither	1
shadow	1
of	1
turning.	1
	1
1:18	1
Of	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
begat	1
he	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
his	1
creatures.	1
	1
1:19	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
swift	1
to	1
hear,	1
slow	1
to	1
speak,	1
slow	1
to	1
wrath:	1
1:20	1
For	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
man	1
worketh	1
not	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:21	1
Wherefore	1
lay	1
apart	1
all	1
filthiness	1
and	1
superfluity	1
of	1
naughtiness,	1
and	1
receive	1
with	1
meekness	1
the	1
engrafted	1
word,	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
be	1
ye	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
not	1
hearers	1
only,	1
deceiving	1
your	1
own	1
selves.	1
	1
1:23	1
For	1
if	1
any	1
be	1
a	1
hearer	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
doer,	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
beholding	1
his	1
natural	1
face	1
in	1
a	1
glass:	1
1:24	1
For	1
he	1
beholdeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
goeth	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
straightway	1
forgetteth	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
1:25	1
But	1
whoso	1
looketh	1
into	1
the	1
perfect	1
law	1
of	1
liberty,	1
and	1
continueth	1
therein,	1
he	1
being	1
not	1
a	1
forgetful	1
hearer,	1
but	1
a	1
doer	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
this	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
in	1
his	1
deed.	1
	1
1:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
religious,	1
and	1
bridleth	1
not	1
his	1
tongue,	1
but	1
deceiveth	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
this	1
man's	1
religion	1
is	1
vain.	1
	1
1:27	1
Pure	1
religion	1
and	1
undefiled	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
this,	1
To	1
visit	1
the	1
fatherless	1
and	1
widows	1
in	1
their	1
affliction,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
unspotted	1
from	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
brethren,	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
glory,	1
with	1
respect	1
of	1
persons.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
come	1
unto	1
your	1
assembly	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
gold	1
ring,	1
in	1
goodly	1
apparel,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
also	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
in	1
vile	1
raiment;	1
2:3	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
weareth	1
the	1
gay	1
clothing,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
place;	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
Stand	1
thou	1
there,	1
or	1
sit	1
here	1
under	1
my	1
footstool:	1
2:4	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
then	1
partial	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
judges	1
of	1
evil	1
thoughts?	1
	1
2:5	1
Hearken,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
Hath	1
not	1
God	1
chosen	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
rich	1
in	1
faith,	1
and	1
heirs	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him?	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
poor.	1
Do	1
not	1
rich	1
men	1
oppress	1
you,	1
and	1
draw	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seats?	1
	1
2:7	1
Do	1
not	1
they	1
blaspheme	1
that	1
worthy	1
name	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
called?	1
	1
2:8	1
If	1
ye	1
fulfil	1
the	1
royal	1
law	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scripture,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself,	1
ye	1
do	1
well:	1
2:9	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
persons,	1
ye	1
commit	1
sin,	1
and	1
are	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
transgressors.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
whole	1
law,	1
and	1
yet	1
offend	1
in	1
one	1
point,	1
he	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
said,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
said	1
also,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill.	1
Now	1
if	1
thou	1
commit	1
no	1
adultery,	1
yet	1
if	1
thou	1
kill,	1
thou	1
art	1
become	1
a	1
transgressor	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:12	1
So	1
speak	1
ye,	1
and	1
so	1
do,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
liberty.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
judgment	1
without	1
mercy,	1
that	1
hath	1
shewed	1
no	1
mercy;	1
and	1
mercy	1
rejoiceth	1
against	1
judgment.	1
	1
2:14	1
What	1
doth	1
it	1
profit,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
say	1
he	1
hath	1
faith,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
works?	1
can	1
faith	1
save	1
him?	1
	1
2:15	1
If	1
a	1
brother	1
or	1
sister	1
be	1
naked,	1
and	1
destitute	1
of	1
daily	1
food,	1
2:16	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Depart	1
in	1
peace,	1
be	1
ye	1
warmed	1
and	1
filled;	1
notwithstanding	1
ye	1
give	1
them	1
not	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
needful	1
to	1
the	1
body;	1
what	1
doth	1
it	1
profit?	1
	1
2:17	1
Even	1
so	1
faith,	1
if	1
it	1
hath	1
not	1
works,	1
is	1
dead,	1
being	1
alone.	1
	1
2:18	1
Yea,	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
say,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
faith,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
works:	1
shew	1
me	1
thy	1
faith	1
without	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
my	1
faith	1
by	1
my	1
works.	1
	1
2:19	1
Thou	1
believest	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God;	1
thou	1
doest	1
well:	1
the	1
devils	1
also	1
believe,	1
and	1
tremble.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
wilt	1
thou	1
know,	1
O	1
vain	1
man,	1
that	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead?	1
2:21	1
Was	1
not	1
Abraham	1
our	1
father	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son	1
upon	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
2:22	1
Seest	1
thou	1
how	1
faith	1
wrought	1
with	1
his	1
works,	1
and	1
by	1
works	1
was	1
faith	1
made	1
perfect?	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
the	1
scripture	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
saith,	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Friend	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:24	1
Ye	1
see	1
then	1
how	1
that	1
by	1
works	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
justified,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
faith	1
only.	1
	1
2:25	1
Likewise	1
also	1
was	1
not	1
Rahab	1
the	1
harlot	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
messengers,	1
and	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
out	1
another	1
way?	1
2:26	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
without	1
the	1
spirit	1
is	1
dead,	1
so	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
3:1	1
My	1
brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
many	1
masters,	1
knowing	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
greater	1
condemnation.	1
	1
3:2	1
For	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
we	1
offend	1
all.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
offend	1
not	1
in	1
word,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
and	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
bridle	1
the	1
whole	1
body.	1
	1
3:3	1
Behold,	1
we	1
put	1
bits	1
in	1
the	1
horses'	1
mouths,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
obey	1
us;	1
and	1
we	1
turn	1
about	1
their	1
whole	1
body.	1
	1
3:4	1
Behold	1
also	1
the	1
ships,	1
which	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
so	1
great,	1
and	1
are	1
driven	1
of	1
fierce	1
winds,	1
yet	1
are	1
they	1
turned	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
helm,	1
whithersoever	1
the	1
governor	1
listeth.	1
	1
3:5	1
Even	1
so	1
the	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
member,	1
and	1
boasteth	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
Behold,	1
how	1
great	1
a	1
matter	1
a	1
little	1
fire	1
kindleth!	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
fire,	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
iniquity:	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
tongue	1
among	1
our	1
members,	1
that	1
it	1
defileth	1
the	1
whole	1
body,	1
and	1
setteth	1
on	1
fire	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
nature;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
of	1
hell.	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
birds,	1
and	1
of	1
serpents,	1
and	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
is	1
tamed,	1
and	1
hath	1
been	1
tamed	1
of	1
mankind:	1
3:8	1
But	1
the	1
tongue	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
tame;	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unruly	1
evil,	1
full	1
of	1
deadly	1
poison.	1
	1
3:9	1
Therewith	1
bless	1
we	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
therewith	1
curse	1
we	1
men,	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mouth	1
proceedeth	1
blessing	1
and	1
cursing.	1
My	1
brethren,	1
these	1
things	1
ought	1
not	1
so	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
3:11	1
Doth	1
a	1
fountain	1
send	1
forth	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
sweet	1
water	1
and	1
bitter?	1
	1
3:12	1
Can	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
bear	1
olive	1
berries?	1
either	1
a	1
vine,	1
figs?	1
so	1
can	1
no	1
fountain	1
both	1
yield	1
salt	1
water	1
and	1
fresh.	1
	1
3:13	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
and	1
endued	1
with	1
knowledge	1
among	1
you?	1
let	1
him	1
shew	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conversation	1
his	1
works	1
with	1
meekness	1
of	1
wisdom.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
bitter	1
envying	1
and	1
strife	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
glory	1
not,	1
and	1
lie	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:15	1
This	1
wisdom	1
descendeth	1
not	1
from	1
above,	1
but	1
is	1
earthly,	1
sensual,	1
devilish.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
where	1
envying	1
and	1
strife	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
confusion	1
and	1
every	1
evil	1
work.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
the	1
wisdom	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
above	1
is	1
first	1
pure,	1
then	1
peaceable,	1
gentle,	1
and	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
intreated,	1
full	1
of	1
mercy	1
and	1
good	1
fruits,	1
without	1
partiality,	1
and	1
without	1
hypocrisy.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
peace	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
make	1
peace.	1
	1
4:1	1
From	1
whence	1
come	1
wars	1
and	1
fightings	1
among	1
you?	1
come	1
they	1
not	1
hence,	1
even	1
of	1
your	1
lusts	1
that	1
war	1
in	1
your	1
members?	1
	1
4:2	1
Ye	1
lust,	1
and	1
have	1
not:	1
ye	1
kill,	1
and	1
desire	1
to	1
have,	1
and	1
cannot	1
obtain:	1
ye	1
fight	1
and	1
war,	1
yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
not.	1
	1
4:3	1
Ye	1
ask,	1
and	1
receive	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
amiss,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
consume	1
it	1
upon	1
your	1
lusts.	1
	1
4:4	1
Ye	1
adulterers	1
and	1
adulteresses,	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
enmity	1
with	1
God?	1
whosoever	1
therefore	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
Do	1
ye	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
in	1
vain,	1
The	1
spirit	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us	1
lusteth	1
to	1
envy?	1
	1
4:6	1
But	1
he	1
giveth	1
more	1
grace.	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
God	1
resisteth	1
the	1
proud,	1
but	1
giveth	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
4:7	1
Submit	1
yourselves	1
therefore	1
to	1
God.	1
Resist	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
flee	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
4:8	1
Draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
you.	1
Cleanse	1
your	1
hands,	1
ye	1
sinners;	1
and	1
purify	1
your	1
hearts,	1
ye	1
double	1
minded.	1
	1
4:9	1
Be	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
mourn,	1
and	1
weep:	1
let	1
your	1
laughter	1
be	1
turned	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
your	1
joy	1
to	1
heaviness.	1
	1
4:10	1
Humble	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
lift	1
you	1
up.	1
	1
4:11	1
Speak	1
not	1
evil	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
brethren.	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
evil	1
of	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
judgeth	1
his	1
brother,	1
speaketh	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
judgeth	1
the	1
law:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
judge	1
the	1
law,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
a	1
doer	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
a	1
judge.	1
	1
4:12	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
lawgiver,	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
and	1
to	1
destroy:	1
who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
another?	1
	1
4:13	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
ye	1
that	1
say,	1
To	1
day	1
or	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
continue	1
there	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
buy	1
and	1
sell,	1
and	1
get	1
gain:	1
4:14	1
Whereas	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
morrow.	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
life?	1
It	1
is	1
even	1
a	1
vapour,	1
that	1
appeareth	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
vanisheth	1
away.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
that	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
say,	1
If	1
the	1
Lord	1
will,	1
we	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
do	1
this,	1
or	1
that.	1
	1
4:16	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
rejoice	1
in	1
your	1
boastings:	1
all	1
such	1
rejoicing	1
is	1
evil.	1
	1
4:17	1
Therefore	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knoweth	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
doeth	1
it	1
not,	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
5:1	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
ye	1
rich	1
men,	1
weep	1
and	1
howl	1
for	1
your	1
miseries	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
5:2	1
Your	1
riches	1
are	1
corrupted,	1
and	1
your	1
garments	1
are	1
motheaten.	1
	1
5:3	1
Your	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
is	1
cankered;	1
and	1
the	1
rust	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
your	1
flesh	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
fire.	1
Ye	1
have	1
heaped	1
treasure	1
together	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
days.	1
	1
5:4	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
the	1
labourers	1
who	1
have	1
reaped	1
down	1
your	1
fields,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
you	1
kept	1
back	1
by	1
fraud,	1
crieth:	1
and	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
reaped	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
sabaoth.	1
	1
5:5	1
Ye	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
pleasure	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
been	1
wanton;	1
ye	1
have	1
nourished	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
slaughter.	1
	1
5:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
condemned	1
and	1
killed	1
the	1
just;	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
resist	1
you.	1
	1
5:7	1
Be	1
patient	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
Behold,	1
the	1
husbandman	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hath	1
long	1
patience	1
for	1
it,	1
until	1
he	1
receive	1
the	1
early	1
and	1
latter	1
rain.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
ye	1
also	1
patient;	1
stablish	1
your	1
hearts:	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
draweth	1
nigh.	1
	1
5:9	1
Grudge	1
not	1
one	1
against	1
another,	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
condemned:	1
behold,	1
the	1
judge	1
standeth	1
before	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
5:10	1
Take,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
the	1
prophets,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
suffering	1
affliction,	1
and	1
of	1
patience.	1
	1
5:11	1
Behold,	1
we	1
count	1
them	1
happy	1
which	1
endure.	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
Job,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
very	1
pitiful,	1
and	1
of	1
tender	1
mercy.	1
	1
5:12	1
But	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
swear	1
not,	1
neither	1
by	1
heaven,	1
neither	1
by	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
oath:	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
yea	1
be	1
yea;	1
and	1
your	1
nay,	1
nay;	1
lest	1
ye	1
fall	1
into	1
condemnation.	1
	1
5:13	1
Is	1
any	1
among	1
you	1
afflicted?	1
let	1
him	1
pray.	1
Is	1
any	1
merry?	1
let	1
him	1
sing	1
psalms.	1
	1
5:14	1
Is	1
any	1
sick	1
among	1
you?	1
let	1
him	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
pray	1
over	1
him,	1
anointing	1
him	1
with	1
oil	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
faith	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
raise	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
committed	1
sins,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
5:16	1
Confess	1
your	1
faults	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
pray	1
one	1
for	1
another,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
healed.	1
The	1
effectual	1
fervent	1
prayer	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
availeth	1
much.	1
	1
5:17	1
Elias	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
subject	1
to	1
like	1
passions	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
and	1
he	1
prayed	1
earnestly	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
rain:	1
and	1
it	1
rained	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
he	1
prayed	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
gave	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
fruit.	1
	1
5:19	1
Brethren,	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
do	1
err	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
one	1
convert	1
him;	1
5:20	1
Let	1
him	1
know,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
converteth	1
the	1
sinner	1
from	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
shall	1
save	1
a	1
soul	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
hide	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
sins.	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
Peter	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Peter,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
the	1
strangers	1
scattered	1
throughout	1
Pontus,	1
Galatia,	1
Cappadocia,	1
Asia,	1
and	1
Bithynia,	1
1:2	1
Elect	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
through	1
sanctification	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
unto	1
obedience	1
and	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
Grace	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
be	1
multiplied.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
abundant	1
mercy	1
hath	1
begotten	1
us	1
again	1
unto	1
a	1
lively	1
hope	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
1:4	1
To	1
an	1
inheritance	1
incorruptible,	1
and	1
undefiled,	1
and	1
that	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away,	1
reserved	1
in	1
heaven	1
for	1
you,	1
1:5	1
Who	1
are	1
kept	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
faith	1
unto	1
salvation	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
1:6	1
Wherein	1
ye	1
greatly	1
rejoice,	1
though	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
season,	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
heaviness	1
through	1
manifold	1
temptations:	1
1:7	1
That	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
being	1
much	1
more	1
precious	1
than	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
perisheth,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
tried	1
with	1
fire,	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
unto	1
praise	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
at	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:8	1
Whom	1
having	1
not	1
seen,	1
ye	1
love;	1
in	1
whom,	1
though	1
now	1
ye	1
see	1
him	1
not,	1
yet	1
believing,	1
ye	1
rejoice	1
with	1
joy	1
unspeakable	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
glory:	1
1:9	1
Receiving	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
even	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
1:10	1
Of	1
which	1
salvation	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
enquired	1
and	1
searched	1
diligently,	1
who	1
prophesied	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
you:	1
1:11	1
Searching	1
what,	1
or	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
them	1
did	1
signify,	1
when	1
it	1
testified	1
beforehand	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
should	1
follow.	1
	1
1:12	1
Unto	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
revealed,	1
that	1
not	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
they	1
did	1
minister	1
the	1
things,	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
reported	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
sent	1
down	1
from	1
heaven;	1
which	1
things	1
the	1
angels	1
desire	1
to	1
look	1
into.	1
	1
1:13	1
Wherefore	1
gird	1
up	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
be	1
sober,	1
and	1
hope	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:14	1
As	1
obedient	1
children,	1
not	1
fashioning	1
yourselves	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
lusts	1
in	1
your	1
ignorance:	1
1:15	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
is	1
holy,	1
so	1
be	1
ye	1
holy	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
conversation;	1
1:16	1
Because	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Be	1
ye	1
holy;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
without	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
judgeth	1
according	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
work,	1
pass	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
your	1
sojourning	1
here	1
in	1
fear:	1
1:18	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
redeemed	1
with	1
corruptible	1
things,	1
as	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
from	1
your	1
vain	1
conversation	1
received	1
by	1
tradition	1
from	1
your	1
fathers;	1
1:19	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
lamb	1
without	1
blemish	1
and	1
without	1
spot:	1
1:20	1
Who	1
verily	1
was	1
foreordained	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
times	1
for	1
you,	1
1:21	1
Who	1
by	1
him	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
that	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
glory;	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
hope	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
1:22	1
Seeing	1
ye	1
have	1
purified	1
your	1
souls	1
in	1
obeying	1
the	1
truth	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
unfeigned	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
pure	1
heart	1
fervently:	1
1:23	1
Being	1
born	1
again,	1
not	1
of	1
corruptible	1
seed,	1
but	1
of	1
incorruptible,	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
liveth	1
and	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:24	1
For	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
as	1
grass,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
grass.	1
The	1
grass	1
withereth,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
thereof	1
falleth	1
away:	1
1:25	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
preached	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:1	1
Wherefore	1
laying	1
aside	1
all	1
malice,	1
and	1
all	1
guile,	1
and	1
hypocrisies,	1
and	1
envies,	1
all	1
evil	1
speakings,	1
2:2	1
As	1
newborn	1
babes,	1
desire	1
the	1
sincere	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
grow	1
thereby:	1
2:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
ye	1
have	1
tasted	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
gracious.	1
	1
2:4	1
To	1
whom	1
coming,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
living	1
stone,	1
disallowed	1
indeed	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
chosen	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
precious,	1
2:5	1
Ye	1
also,	1
as	1
lively	1
stones,	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
a	1
spiritual	1
house,	1
an	1
holy	1
priesthood,	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
spiritual	1
sacrifices,	1
acceptable	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:6	1
Wherefore	1
also	1
it	1
is	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
scripture,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Sion	1
a	1
chief	1
corner	1
stone,	1
elect,	1
precious:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
2:7	1
Unto	1
you	1
therefore	1
which	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
precious:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
be	1
disobedient,	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
disallowed,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
made	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner,	1
2:8	1
And	1
a	1
stone	1
of	1
stumbling,	1
and	1
a	1
rock	1
of	1
offence,	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
stumble	1
at	1
the	1
word,	1
being	1
disobedient:	1
whereunto	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
appointed.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
a	1
chosen	1
generation,	1
a	1
royal	1
priesthood,	1
an	1
holy	1
nation,	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people;	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
shew	1
forth	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
into	1
his	1
marvellous	1
light;	1
2:10	1
Which	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
people,	1
but	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God:	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
obtained	1
mercy.	1
	1
2:11	1
Dearly	1
beloved,	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
as	1
strangers	1
and	1
pilgrims,	1
abstain	1
from	1
fleshly	1
lusts,	1
which	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
soul;	1
2:12	1
Having	1
your	1
conversation	1
honest	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
that,	1
whereas	1
they	1
speak	1
against	1
you	1
as	1
evildoers,	1
they	1
may	1
by	1
your	1
good	1
works,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
behold,	1
glorify	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
visitation.	1
	1
2:13	1
Submit	1
yourselves	1
to	1
every	1
ordinance	1
of	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
Lord's	1
sake:	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
as	1
supreme;	1
2:14	1
Or	1
unto	1
governors,	1
as	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sent	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
well.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
with	1
well	1
doing	1
ye	1
may	1
put	1
to	1
silence	1
the	1
ignorance	1
of	1
foolish	1
men:	1
2:16	1
As	1
free,	1
and	1
not	1
using	1
your	1
liberty	1
for	1
a	1
cloke	1
of	1
maliciousness,	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:17	1
Honour	1
all	1
men.	1
Love	1
the	1
brotherhood.	1
Fear	1
God.	1
Honour	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:18	1
Servants,	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
your	1
masters	1
with	1
all	1
fear;	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
gentle,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
froward.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
thankworthy,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
conscience	1
toward	1
God	1
endure	1
grief,	1
suffering	1
wrongfully.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
what	1
glory	1
is	1
it,	1
if,	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
buffeted	1
for	1
your	1
faults,	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
patiently?	1
but	1
if,	1
when	1
ye	1
do	1
well,	1
and	1
suffer	1
for	1
it,	1
ye	1
take	1
it	1
patiently,	1
this	1
is	1
acceptable	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
even	1
hereunto	1
were	1
ye	1
called:	1
because	1
Christ	1
also	1
suffered	1
for	1
us,	1
leaving	1
us	1
an	1
example,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
follow	1
his	1
steps:	1
2:22	1
Who	1
did	1
no	1
sin,	1
neither	1
was	1
guile	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
mouth:	1
2:23	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reviled,	1
reviled	1
not	1
again;	1
when	1
he	1
suffered,	1
he	1
threatened	1
not;	1
but	1
committed	1
himself	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
judgeth	1
righteously:	1
2:24	1
Who	1
his	1
own	1
self	1
bare	1
our	1
sins	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
on	1
the	1
tree,	1
that	1
we,	1
being	1
dead	1
to	1
sins,	1
should	1
live	1
unto	1
righteousness:	1
by	1
whose	1
stripes	1
ye	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
ye	1
were	1
as	1
sheep	1
going	1
astray;	1
but	1
are	1
now	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
Shepherd	1
and	1
Bishop	1
of	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
3:1	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
wives,	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
husbands;	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
word,	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
without	1
the	1
word	1
be	1
won	1
by	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
wives;	1
3:2	1
While	1
they	1
behold	1
your	1
chaste	1
conversation	1
coupled	1
with	1
fear.	1
	1
3:3	1
Whose	1
adorning	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
outward	1
adorning	1
of	1
plaiting	1
the	1
hair,	1
and	1
of	1
wearing	1
of	1
gold,	1
or	1
of	1
putting	1
on	1
of	1
apparel;	1
3:4	1
But	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
hidden	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
corruptible,	1
even	1
the	1
ornament	1
of	1
a	1
meek	1
and	1
quiet	1
spirit,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
great	1
price.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
time	1
the	1
holy	1
women	1
also,	1
who	1
trusted	1
in	1
God,	1
adorned	1
themselves,	1
being	1
in	1
subjection	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
husbands:	1
3:6	1
Even	1
as	1
Sara	1
obeyed	1
Abraham,	1
calling	1
him	1
lord:	1
whose	1
daughters	1
ye	1
are,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
ye	1
do	1
well,	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
with	1
any	1
amazement.	1
	1
3:7	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
husbands,	1
dwell	1
with	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
knowledge,	1
giving	1
honour	1
unto	1
the	1
wife,	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
weaker	1
vessel,	1
and	1
as	1
being	1
heirs	1
together	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
life;	1
that	1
your	1
prayers	1
be	1
not	1
hindered.	1
	1
3:8	1
Finally,	1
be	1
ye	1
all	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
having	1
compassion	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
love	1
as	1
brethren,	1
be	1
pitiful,	1
be	1
courteous:	1
3:9	1
Not	1
rendering	1
evil	1
for	1
evil,	1
or	1
railing	1
for	1
railing:	1
but	1
contrariwise	1
blessing;	1
knowing	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
thereunto	1
called,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
inherit	1
a	1
blessing.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
love	1
life,	1
and	1
see	1
good	1
days,	1
let	1
him	1
refrain	1
his	1
tongue	1
from	1
evil,	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
no	1
guile:	1
3:11	1
Let	1
him	1
eschew	1
evil,	1
and	1
do	1
good;	1
let	1
him	1
seek	1
peace,	1
and	1
ensue	1
it.	1
	1
3:12	1
For	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
are	1
over	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
his	1
ears	1
are	1
open	1
unto	1
their	1
prayers:	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
harm	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
followers	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good?	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
suffer	1
for	1
righteousness'	1
sake,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye:	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
terror,	1
neither	1
be	1
troubled;	1
3:15	1
But	1
sanctify	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
in	1
your	1
hearts:	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
always	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
asketh	1
you	1
a	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
with	1
meekness	1
and	1
fear:	1
3:16	1
Having	1
a	1
good	1
conscience;	1
that,	1
whereas	1
they	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed	1
that	1
falsely	1
accuse	1
your	1
good	1
conversation	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:17	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
better,	1
if	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
so,	1
that	1
ye	1
suffer	1
for	1
well	1
doing,	1
than	1
for	1
evil	1
doing.	1
	1
3:18	1
For	1
Christ	1
also	1
hath	1
once	1
suffered	1
for	1
sins,	1
the	1
just	1
for	1
the	1
unjust,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
to	1
God,	1
being	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
quickened	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit:	1
3:19	1
By	1
which	1
also	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
spirits	1
in	1
prison;	1
3:20	1
Which	1
sometime	1
were	1
disobedient,	1
when	1
once	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
God	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noah,	1
while	1
the	1
ark	1
was	1
a	1
preparing,	1
wherein	1
few,	1
that	1
is,	1
eight	1
souls	1
were	1
saved	1
by	1
water.	1
	1
3:21	1
The	1
like	1
figure	1
whereunto	1
even	1
baptism	1
doth	1
also	1
now	1
save	1
us	1
(not	1
the	1
putting	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conscience	1
toward	1
God,)	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:22	1
Who	1
is	1
gone	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God;	1
angels	1
and	1
authorities	1
and	1
powers	1
being	1
made	1
subject	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:1	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
Christ	1
hath	1
suffered	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
arm	1
yourselves	1
likewise	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
mind:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
hath	1
ceased	1
from	1
sin;	1
4:2	1
That	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
should	1
live	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
to	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
past	1
of	1
our	1
life	1
may	1
suffice	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
wrought	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
when	1
we	1
walked	1
in	1
lasciviousness,	1
lusts,	1
excess	1
of	1
wine,	1
revellings,	1
banquetings,	1
and	1
abominable	1
idolatries:	1
4:4	1
Wherein	1
they	1
think	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
ye	1
run	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
excess	1
of	1
riot,	1
speaking	1
evil	1
of	1
you:	1
4:5	1
Who	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
was	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
live	1
according	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
spirit.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
sober,	1
and	1
watch	1
unto	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
have	1
fervent	1
charity	1
among	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
charity	1
shall	1
cover	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
4:9	1
Use	1
hospitality	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
without	1
grudging.	1
	1
4:10	1
As	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
received	1
the	1
gift,	1
even	1
so	1
minister	1
the	1
same	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
as	1
good	1
stewards	1
of	1
the	1
manifold	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:11	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
speak,	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
as	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God;	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
minister,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
ability	1
which	1
God	1
giveth:	1
that	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
praise	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:12	1
Beloved,	1
think	1
it	1
not	1
strange	1
concerning	1
the	1
fiery	1
trial	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
try	1
you,	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
strange	1
thing	1
happened	1
unto	1
you:	1
4:13	1
But	1
rejoice,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
Christ's	1
sufferings;	1
that,	1
when	1
his	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed,	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
glad	1
also	1
with	1
exceeding	1
joy.	1
	1
4:14	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
reproached	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye;	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
of	1
God	1
resteth	1
upon	1
you:	1
on	1
their	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of,	1
but	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
glorified.	1
	1
4:15	1
But	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
suffer	1
as	1
a	1
murderer,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
or	1
as	1
an	1
evildoer,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
busybody	1
in	1
other	1
men's	1
matters.	1
	1
4:16	1
Yet	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
suffer	1
as	1
a	1
Christian,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
glorify	1
God	1
on	1
this	1
behalf.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
that	1
judgment	1
must	1
begin	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
first	1
begin	1
at	1
us,	1
what	1
shall	1
the	1
end	1
be	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
righteous	1
scarcely	1
be	1
saved,	1
where	1
shall	1
the	1
ungodly	1
and	1
the	1
sinner	1
appear?	1
	1
4:19	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
suffer	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
commit	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
well	1
doing,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
faithful	1
Creator.	1
	1
5:1	1
The	1
elders	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
you	1
I	1
exhort,	1
who	1
am	1
also	1
an	1
elder,	1
and	1
a	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed:	1
5:2	1
Feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
taking	1
the	1
oversight	1
thereof,	1
not	1
by	1
constraint,	1
but	1
willingly;	1
not	1
for	1
filthy	1
lucre,	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
ready	1
mind;	1
5:3	1
Neither	1
as	1
being	1
lords	1
over	1
God's	1
heritage,	1
but	1
being	1
ensamples	1
to	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
Shepherd	1
shall	1
appear,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory	1
that	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away.	1
	1
5:5	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
younger,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
elder.	1
Yea,	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
subject	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
humility:	1
for	1
God	1
resisteth	1
the	1
proud,	1
and	1
giveth	1
grace	1
to	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
5:6	1
Humble	1
yourselves	1
therefore	1
under	1
the	1
mighty	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
exalt	1
you	1
in	1
due	1
time:	1
5:7	1
Casting	1
all	1
your	1
care	1
upon	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
careth	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
sober,	1
be	1
vigilant;	1
because	1
your	1
adversary	1
the	1
devil,	1
as	1
a	1
roaring	1
lion,	1
walketh	1
about,	1
seeking	1
whom	1
he	1
may	1
devour:	1
5:9	1
Whom	1
resist	1
stedfast	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
afflictions	1
are	1
accomplished	1
in	1
your	1
brethren	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
5:10	1
But	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
grace,	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
unto	1
his	1
eternal	1
glory	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
suffered	1
a	1
while,	1
make	1
you	1
perfect,	1
stablish,	1
strengthen,	1
settle	1
you.	1
	1
5:11	1
To	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
5:12	1
By	1
Silvanus,	1
a	1
faithful	1
brother	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
suppose,	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
briefly,	1
exhorting,	1
and	1
testifying	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
wherein	1
ye	1
stand.	1
	1
5:13	1
The	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
Babylon,	1
elected	1
together	1
with	1
you,	1
saluteth	1
you;	1
and	1
so	1
doth	1
Marcus	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
5:14	1
Greet	1
ye	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
kiss	1
of	1
charity.	1
Peace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
that	1

The	1
Second	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Peter	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
a	1
servant	1
and	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
obtained	1
like	1
precious	1
faith	1
with	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord,	1
1:3	1
According	1
as	1
his	1
divine	1
power	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
pertain	1
unto	1
life	1
and	1
godliness,	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
glory	1
and	1
virtue:	1
1:4	1
Whereby	1
are	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
exceeding	1
great	1
and	1
precious	1
promises:	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
nature,	1
having	1
escaped	1
the	1
corruption	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
lust.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
beside	1
this,	1
giving	1
all	1
diligence,	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
faith	1
virtue;	1
and	1
to	1
virtue	1
knowledge;	1
1:6	1
And	1
to	1
knowledge	1
temperance;	1
and	1
to	1
temperance	1
patience;	1
and	1
to	1
patience	1
godliness;	1
1:7	1
And	1
to	1
godliness	1
brotherly	1
kindness;	1
and	1
to	1
brotherly	1
kindness	1
charity.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
if	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
abound,	1
they	1
make	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
neither	1
be	1
barren	1
nor	1
unfruitful	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
lacketh	1
these	1
things	1
is	1
blind,	1
and	1
cannot	1
see	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
purged	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
sins.	1
	1
1:10	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
rather,	1
brethren,	1
give	1
diligence	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
calling	1
and	1
election	1
sure:	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
these	1
things,	1
ye	1
shall	1
never	1
fall:	1
1:11	1
For	1
so	1
an	1
entrance	1
shall	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto	1
you	1
abundantly	1
into	1
the	1
everlasting	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:12	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
negligent	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
though	1
ye	1
know	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
truth.	1
	1
1:13	1
Yea,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
meet,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle,	1
to	1
stir	1
you	1
up	1
by	1
putting	1
you	1
in	1
remembrance;	1
1:14	1
Knowing	1
that	1
shortly	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
off	1
this	1
my	1
tabernacle,	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me.	1
	1
1:15	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
after	1
my	1
decease	1
to	1
have	1
these	1
things	1
always	1
in	1
remembrance.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
followed	1
cunningly	1
devised	1
fables,	1
when	1
we	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
but	1
were	1
eyewitnesses	1
of	1
his	1
majesty.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
he	1
received	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
honour	1
and	1
glory,	1
when	1
there	1
came	1
such	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
excellent	1
glory,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
this	1
voice	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
heaven	1
we	1
heard,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
mount.	1
	1
1:19	1
We	1
have	1
also	1
a	1
more	1
sure	1
word	1
of	1
prophecy;	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
do	1
well	1
that	1
ye	1
take	1
heed,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
light	1
that	1
shineth	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
place,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
dawn,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
star	1
arise	1
in	1
your	1
hearts:	1
1:20	1
Knowing	1
this	1
first,	1
that	1
no	1
prophecy	1
of	1
the	1
scripture	1
is	1
of	1
any	1
private	1
interpretation.	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
the	1
prophecy	1
came	1
not	1
in	1
old	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
man:	1
but	1
holy	1
men	1
of	1
God	1
spake	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
false	1
prophets	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
as	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
false	1
teachers	1
among	1
you,	1
who	1
privily	1
shall	1
bring	1
in	1
damnable	1
heresies,	1
even	1
denying	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
bought	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
upon	1
themselves	1
swift	1
destruction.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
many	1
shall	1
follow	1
their	1
pernicious	1
ways;	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
truth	1
shall	1
be	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
through	1
covetousness	1
shall	1
they	1
with	1
feigned	1
words	1
make	1
merchandise	1
of	1
you:	1
whose	1
judgment	1
now	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
lingereth	1
not,	1
and	1
their	1
damnation	1
slumbereth	1
not.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
if	1
God	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
that	1
sinned,	1
but	1
cast	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
hell,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
chains	1
of	1
darkness,	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
unto	1
judgment;	1
2:5	1
And	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
old	1
world,	1
but	1
saved	1
Noah	1
the	1
eighth	1
person,	1
a	1
preacher	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
bringing	1
in	1
the	1
flood	1
upon	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
ungodly;	1
2:6	1
And	1
turning	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
into	1
ashes	1
condemned	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
overthrow,	1
making	1
them	1
an	1
ensample	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
after	1
should	1
live	1
ungodly;	1
2:7	1
And	1
delivered	1
just	1
Lot,	1
vexed	1
with	1
the	1
filthy	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
2:8	1
(For	1
that	1
righteous	1
man	1
dwelling	1
among	1
them,	1
in	1
seeing	1
and	1
hearing,	1
vexed	1
his	1
righteous	1
soul	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
with	1
their	1
unlawful	1
deeds;)	1
2:9	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
how	1
to	1
deliver	1
the	1
godly	1
out	1
of	1
temptations,	1
and	1
to	1
reserve	1
the	1
unjust	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
to	1
be	1
punished:	1
2:10	1
But	1
chiefly	1
them	1
that	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
uncleanness,	1
and	1
despise	1
government.	1
Presumptuous	1
are	1
they,	1
selfwilled,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
dignities.	1
	1
2:11	1
Whereas	1
angels,	1
which	1
are	1
greater	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
might,	1
bring	1
not	1
railing	1
accusation	1
against	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
these,	1
as	1
natural	1
brute	1
beasts,	1
made	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
and	1
destroyed,	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
understand	1
not;	1
and	1
shall	1
utterly	1
perish	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
corruption;	1
2:13	1
And	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
unrighteousness,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
count	1
it	1
pleasure	1
to	1
riot	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time.	1
Spots	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
blemishes,	1
sporting	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
deceivings	1
while	1
they	1
feast	1
with	1
you;	1
2:14	1
Having	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
adultery,	1
and	1
that	1
cannot	1
cease	1
from	1
sin;	1
beguiling	1
unstable	1
souls:	1
an	1
heart	1
they	1
have	1
exercised	1
with	1
covetous	1
practices;	1
cursed	1
children:	1
2:15	1
Which	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
right	1
way,	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
astray,	1
following	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bosor,	1
who	1
loved	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
unrighteousness;	1
2:16	1
But	1
was	1
rebuked	1
for	1
his	1
iniquity:	1
the	1
dumb	1
ass	1
speaking	1
with	1
man's	1
voice	1
forbad	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
2:17	1
These	1
are	1
wells	1
without	1
water,	1
clouds	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
with	1
a	1
tempest;	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
darkness	1
is	1
reserved	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
speak	1
great	1
swelling	1
words	1
of	1
vanity,	1
they	1
allure	1
through	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
through	1
much	1
wantonness,	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
clean	1
escaped	1
from	1
them	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
error.	1
	1
2:19	1
While	1
they	1
promise	1
them	1
liberty,	1
they	1
themselves	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
corruption:	1
for	1
of	1
whom	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
overcome,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
if	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
escaped	1
the	1
pollutions	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
they	1
are	1
again	1
entangled	1
therein,	1
and	1
overcome,	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
is	1
worse	1
with	1
them	1
than	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
than,	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
it,	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
holy	1
commandment	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
proverb,	1
The	1
dog	1
is	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
vomit	1
again;	1
and	1
the	1
sow	1
that	1
was	1
washed	1
to	1
her	1
wallowing	1
in	1
the	1
mire.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
second	1
epistle,	1
beloved,	1
I	1
now	1
write	1
unto	1
you;	1
in	1
both	1
which	1
I	1
stir	1
up	1
your	1
pure	1
minds	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
remembrance:	1
3:2	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
mindful	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
before	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
us	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour:	1
3:3	1
Knowing	1
this	1
first,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
scoffers,	1
walking	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts,	1
3:4	1
And	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
his	1
coming?	1
for	1
since	1
the	1
fathers	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
all	1
things	1
continue	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
this	1
they	1
willingly	1
are	1
ignorant	1
of,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
standing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
water:	1
3:6	1
Whereby	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
then	1
was,	1
being	1
overflowed	1
with	1
water,	1
perished:	1
3:7	1
But	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
are	1
now,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
word	1
are	1
kept	1
in	1
store,	1
reserved	1
unto	1
fire	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
perdition	1
of	1
ungodly	1
men.	1
	1
3:8	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
be	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
thing,	1
that	1
one	1
day	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
as	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
3:9	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
not	1
slack	1
concerning	1
his	1
promise,	1
as	1
some	1
men	1
count	1
slackness;	1
but	1
is	1
longsuffering	1
to	1
us-ward,	1
not	1
willing	1
that	1
any	1
should	1
perish,	1
but	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
3:10	1
But	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
noise,	1
and	1
the	1
elements	1
shall	1
melt	1
with	1
fervent	1
heat,	1
the	1
earth	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
are	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
up.	1
	1
3:11	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
persons	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
holy	1
conversation	1
and	1
godliness,	1
3:12	1
Looking	1
for	1
and	1
hasting	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
God,	1
wherein	1
the	1
heavens	1
being	1
on	1
fire	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
and	1
the	1
elements	1
shall	1
melt	1
with	1
fervent	1
heat?	1
	1
3:13	1
Nevertheless	1
we,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
promise,	1
look	1
for	1
new	1
heavens	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth,	1
wherein	1
dwelleth	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:14	1
Wherefore,	1
beloved,	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
look	1
for	1
such	1
things,	1
be	1
diligent	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
peace,	1
without	1
spot,	1
and	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
account	1
that	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
is	1
salvation;	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Paul	1
also	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
hath	1
written	1
unto	1
you;	1
3:16	1
As	1
also	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
epistles,	1
speaking	1
in	1
them	1
of	1
these	1
things;	1
in	1
which	1
are	1
some	1
things	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
which	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
unlearned	1
and	1
unstable	1
wrest,	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
also	1
the	1
other	1
scriptures,	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
destruction.	1
	1
3:17	1
Ye	1
therefore,	1
beloved,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
before,	1
beware	1
lest	1
ye	1
also,	1
being	1
led	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
fall	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
stedfastness.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
grow	1
in	1
grace,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
To	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
both	1
now	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1

	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
That	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
our	1
eyes,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
looked	1
upon,	1
and	1
our	1
hands	1
have	1
handled,	1
of	1
the	1
Word	1
of	1
life;	1
1:2	1
(For	1
the	1
life	1
was	1
manifested,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
it,	1
and	1
bear	1
witness,	1
and	1
shew	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
eternal	1
life,	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
was	1
manifested	1
unto	1
us;)	1
1:3	1
That	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
declare	1
we	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
us:	1
and	1
truly	1
our	1
fellowship	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
write	1
we	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
1:5	1
This	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
message	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
declare	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
light,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
darkness	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
1:6	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness,	1
we	1
lie,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
truth:	1
1:7	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
we	1
have	1
fellowship	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
his	1
Son	1
cleanseth	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
sin.	1
	1
1:8	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
sin,	1
we	1
deceive	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
1:9	1
If	1
we	1
confess	1
our	1
sins,	1
he	1
is	1
faithful	1
and	1
just	1
to	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
sins,	1
and	1
to	1
cleanse	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
unrighteousness.	1
	1
1:10	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
sinned,	1
we	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
his	1
word	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
these	1
things	1
write	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
sin	1
not.	1
	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
sin,	1
we	1
have	1
an	1
advocate	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
righteous:	1
2:2	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
propitiation	1
for	1
our	1
sins:	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
our's	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
him,	1
if	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
2:4	1
He	1
that	1
saith,	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
not	1
his	1
commandments,	1
is	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
whoso	1
keepeth	1
his	1
word,	1
in	1
him	1
verily	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
perfected:	1
hereby	1
know	1
we	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:6	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
abideth	1
in	1
him	1
ought	1
himself	1
also	1
so	1
to	1
walk,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
walked.	1
	1
2:7	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
write	1
no	1
new	1
commandment	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
an	1
old	1
commandment	1
which	1
ye	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
The	1
old	1
commandment	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
2:8	1
Again,	1
a	1
new	1
commandment	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
which	1
thing	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
you:	1
because	1
the	1
darkness	1
is	1
past,	1
and	1
the	1
true	1
light	1
now	1
shineth.	1
	1
2:9	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother,	1
is	1
in	1
darkness	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
2:10	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
brother	1
abideth	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
occasion	1
of	1
stumbling	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:11	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
not	1
whither	1
he	1
goeth,	1
because	1
that	1
darkness	1
hath	1
blinded	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
2:12	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
little	1
children,	1
because	1
your	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
you	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
2:13	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
fathers,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
young	1
men,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
wicked	1
one.	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
little	1
children,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:14	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you,	1
fathers,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you,	1
young	1
men,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
wicked	1
one.	1
	1
2:15	1
Love	1
not	1
the	1
world,	1
neither	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
life,	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
but	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
world	1
passeth	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
lust	1
thereof:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:18	1
Little	1
children,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time:	1
and	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
antichrist	1
shall	1
come,	1
even	1
now	1
are	1
there	1
many	1
antichrists;	1
whereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
2:19	1
They	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
us,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
us;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
us,	1
they	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
continued	1
with	1
us:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
an	1
unction	1
from	1
the	1
Holy	1
One,	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:21	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
lie	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
2:22	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
liar	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
denieth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ?	1
He	1
is	1
antichrist,	1
that	1
denieth	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
2:23	1
Whosoever	1
denieth	1
the	1
Son,	1
the	1
same	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
Father:	1
he	1
that	1
acknowledgeth	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
the	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
2:24	1
Let	1
that	1
therefore	1
abide	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
If	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
you,	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
us,	1
even	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
2:26	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
them	1
that	1
seduce	1
you.	1
	1
2:27	1
But	1
the	1
anointing	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
him	1
abideth	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
teach	1
you:	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
same	1
anointing	1
teacheth	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
is	1
truth,	1
and	1
is	1
no	1
lie,	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
taught	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
now,	1
little	1
children,	1
abide	1
in	1
him;	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
appear,	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
confidence,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
before	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
coming.	1
	1
2:29	1
If	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
righteous,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:1	1
Behold,	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God:	1
therefore	1
the	1
world	1
knoweth	1
us	1
not,	1
because	1
it	1
knew	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
3:2	1
Beloved,	1
now	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
doth	1
not	1
yet	1
appear	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
be:	1
but	1
we	1
know	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
appear,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
him;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
this	1
hope	1
in	1
him	1
purifieth	1
himself,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
pure.	1
	1
3:4	1
Whosoever	1
committeth	1
sin	1
transgresseth	1
also	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
manifested	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
our	1
sins;	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
sin.	1
	1
3:6	1
Whosoever	1
abideth	1
in	1
him	1
sinneth	1
not:	1
whosoever	1
sinneth	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
him,	1
neither	1
known	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
Little	1
children,	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you:	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
is	1
righteous,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:8	1
He	1
that	1
committeth	1
sin	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
sinneth	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
manifested,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:9	1
Whosoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
doth	1
not	1
commit	1
sin;	1
for	1
his	1
seed	1
remaineth	1
in	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
cannot	1
sin,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
In	1
this	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
manifest,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
devil:	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
not	1
righteousness	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
message	1
that	1
ye	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
3:12	1
Not	1
as	1
Cain,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
wicked	1
one,	1
and	1
slew	1
his	1
brother.	1
And	1
wherefore	1
slew	1
he	1
him?	1
Because	1
his	1
own	1
works	1
were	1
evil,	1
and	1
his	1
brother's	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:13	1
Marvel	1
not,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
hate	1
you.	1
	1
3:14	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
passed	1
from	1
death	1
unto	1
life,	1
because	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
brethren.	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
abideth	1
in	1
death.	1
	1
3:15	1
Whosoever	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
a	1
murderer:	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
murderer	1
hath	1
eternal	1
life	1
abiding	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
3:16	1
Hereby	1
perceive	1
we	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
he	1
laid	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
us:	1
and	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
our	1
lives	1
for	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
whoso	1
hath	1
this	1
world's	1
good,	1
and	1
seeth	1
his	1
brother	1
have	1
need,	1
and	1
shutteth	1
up	1
his	1
bowels	1
of	1
compassion	1
from	1
him,	1
how	1
dwelleth	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him?	1
	1
3:18	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
love	1
in	1
word,	1
neither	1
in	1
tongue;	1
but	1
in	1
deed	1
and	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
shall	1
assure	1
our	1
hearts	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
if	1
our	1
heart	1
condemn	1
us,	1
God	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
heart,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
3:21	1
Beloved,	1
if	1
our	1
heart	1
condemn	1
us	1
not,	1
then	1
have	1
we	1
confidence	1
toward	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
ask,	1
we	1
receive	1
of	1
him,	1
because	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
pleasing	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
commandment,	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
us	1
commandment.	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
his	1
commandments	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
abideth	1
in	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us.	1
	1
4:1	1
Beloved,	1
believe	1
not	1
every	1
spirit,	1
but	1
try	1
the	1
spirits	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
God:	1
because	1
many	1
false	1
prophets	1
are	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:2	1
Hereby	1
know	1
ye	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God:	1
Every	1
spirit	1
that	1
confesseth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
of	1
God:	1
4:3	1
And	1
every	1
spirit	1
that	1
confesseth	1
not	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
spirit	1
of	1
antichrist,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
come;	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
already	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:4	1
Ye	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
have	1
overcome	1
them:	1
because	1
greater	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:5	1
They	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
therefore	1
speak	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
heareth	1
them.	1
	1
4:6	1
We	1
are	1
of	1
God:	1
he	1
that	1
knoweth	1
God	1
heareth	1
us;	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God	1
heareth	1
not	1
us.	1
Hereby	1
know	1
we	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
error.	1
	1
4:7	1
Beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
love	1
one	1
another:	1
for	1
love	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
loveth	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
God.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
knoweth	1
not	1
God;	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
love.	1
	1
4:9	1
In	1
this	1
was	1
manifested	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
toward	1
us,	1
because	1
that	1
God	1
sent	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
live	1
through	1
him.	1
	1
4:10	1
Herein	1
is	1
love,	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
loved	1
God,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
Son	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
propitiation	1
for	1
our	1
sins.	1
	1
4:11	1
Beloved,	1
if	1
God	1
so	1
loved	1
us,	1
we	1
ought	1
also	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
4:12	1
No	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
God	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
If	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us,	1
and	1
his	1
love	1
is	1
perfected	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
4:13	1
Hereby	1
know	1
we	1
that	1
we	1
dwell	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
us,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
Spirit.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
do	1
testify	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
sent	1
the	1
Son	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:15	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
confess	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
and	1
believed	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
to	1
us.	1
God	1
is	1
love;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
love	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
God	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
4:17	1
Herein	1
is	1
our	1
love	1
made	1
perfect,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
boldness	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment:	1
because	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
so	1
are	1
we	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
4:18	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
in	1
love;	1
but	1
perfect	1
love	1
casteth	1
out	1
fear:	1
because	1
fear	1
hath	1
torment.	1
He	1
that	1
feareth	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
4:19	1
We	1
love	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
first	1
loved	1
us.	1
	1
4:20	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
say,	1
I	1
love	1
God,	1
and	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
seen,	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
love	1
God	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen?	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
this	1
commandment	1
have	1
we	1
from	1
him,	1
That	1
he	1
who	1
loveth	1
God	1
love	1
his	1
brother	1
also.	1
	1
5:1	1
Whosoever	1
believeth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
loveth	1
him	1
that	1
begat	1
loveth	1
him	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
begotten	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:2	1
By	1
this	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God,	1
when	1
we	1
love	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments:	1
and	1
his	1
commandments	1
are	1
not	1
grievous.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
our	1
faith.	1
	1
5:5	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
5:6	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
by	1
water	1
and	1
blood,	1
even	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
not	1
by	1
water	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
water	1
and	1
blood.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
beareth	1
witness,	1
because	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
that	1
bear	1
record	1
in	1
heaven,	1
the	1
Father,	1
the	1
Word,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
and	1
these	1
three	1
are	1
one.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
that	1
bear	1
witness	1
in	1
earth,	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
blood:	1
and	1
these	1
three	1
agree	1
in	1
one.	1
	1
5:9	1
If	1
we	1
receive	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
men,	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
greater:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
testified	1
of	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:10	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
the	1
witness	1
in	1
himself:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
liar;	1
because	1
he	1
believeth	1
not	1
the	1
record	1
that	1
God	1
gave	1
of	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
record,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
eternal	1
life,	1
and	1
this	1
life	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:12	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
life;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
life.	1
	1
5:13	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
eternal	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
confidence	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
him,	1
that,	1
if	1
we	1
ask	1
any	1
thing	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
he	1
heareth	1
us:	1
5:15	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
hear	1
us,	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
ask,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
petitions	1
that	1
we	1
desired	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
see	1
his	1
brother	1
sin	1
a	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
unto	1
death,	1
he	1
shall	1
ask,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
life	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
sin	1
not	1
unto	1
death.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
unto	1
death:	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
5:17	1
All	1
unrighteousness	1
is	1
sin:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
not	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
5:18	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
whosoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
sinneth	1
not;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
begotten	1
of	1
God	1
keepeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
wicked	1
one	1
toucheth	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
lieth	1
in	1
wickedness.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
an	1
understanding,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
5:21	1
Little	1
children,	1
keep	1
yourselves	1
from	1
idols.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
elder	1
unto	1
the	1
elect	1
lady	1
and	1
her	1
children,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
not	1
I	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
truth;	1
1:2	1
For	1
the	1
truth's	1
sake,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
love.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
greatly	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
of	1
thy	1
children	1
walking	1
in	1
truth,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
commandment	1
from	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
lady,	1
not	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
wrote	1
a	1
new	1
commandment	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
love,	1
that	1
we	1
walk	1
after	1
his	1
commandments.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
commandment,	1
That,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
ye	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
many	1
deceivers	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
who	1
confess	1
not	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
deceiver	1
and	1
an	1
antichrist.	1
	1
1:8	1
Look	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
we	1
lose	1
not	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
wrought,	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
receive	1
a	1
full	1
reward.	1
	1
1:9	1
Whosoever	1
transgresseth,	1
and	1
abideth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
hath	1
not	1
God.	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
hath	1
both	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
1:10	1
If	1
there	1
come	1
any	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
bring	1
not	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
receive	1
him	1
not	1
into	1
your	1
house,	1
neither	1
bid	1
him	1
God	1
speed:	1
1:11	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
biddeth	1
him	1
God	1
speed	1
is	1
partaker	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
deeds.	1
	1
1:12	1
Having	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
write	1
with	1
paper	1
and	1
ink:	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
speak	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
that	1
our	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
1:13	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
elect	1
sister	1
greet	1
thee.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Third	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
elder	1
unto	1
the	1
wellbeloved	1
Gaius,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:2	1
Beloved,	1
I	1
wish	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prosper	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
health,	1
even	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
prospereth.	1
	1
1:3	1
For	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
greatly,	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
came	1
and	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
walkest	1
in	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
greater	1
joy	1
than	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
walk	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
1:5	1
Beloved,	1
thou	1
doest	1
faithfully	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
doest	1
to	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
to	1
strangers;	1
1:6	1
Which	1
have	1
borne	1
witness	1
of	1
thy	1
charity	1
before	1
the	1
church:	1
whom	1
if	1
thou	1
bring	1
forward	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
sort,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
well:	1
1:7	1
Because	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
taking	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:8	1
We	1
therefore	1
ought	1
to	1
receive	1
such,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
fellowhelpers	1
to	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:9	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
the	1
church:	1
but	1
Diotrephes,	1
who	1
loveth	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence	1
among	1
them,	1
receiveth	1
us	1
not.	1
	1
1:10	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
I	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
his	1
deeds	1
which	1
he	1
doeth,	1
prating	1
against	1
us	1
with	1
malicious	1
words:	1
and	1
not	1
content	1
therewith,	1
neither	1
doth	1
he	1
himself	1
receive	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
forbiddeth	1
them	1
that	1
would,	1
and	1
casteth	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
1:11	1
Beloved,	1
follow	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
He	1
that	1
doeth	1
good	1
is	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
God.	1
	1
1:12	1
Demetrius	1
hath	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
itself:	1
yea,	1
and	1
we	1
also	1
bear	1
record;	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
our	1
record	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
1:13	1
I	1
had	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
write,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
with	1
ink	1
and	1
pen	1
write	1
unto	1
thee:	1
1:14	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
I	1
shall	1
shortly	1
see	1
thee,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
speak	1
face	1
to	1
face.	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
thee.	1
Our	1
friends	1
salute	1
thee.	1
Greet	1
the	1
friends	1
by	1
name.	1

The	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Jude	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Jude,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified	1
by	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
preserved	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
called:	1
1:2	1
Mercy	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
love,	1
be	1
multiplied.	1
	1
1:3	1
Beloved,	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
all	1
diligence	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
salvation,	1
it	1
was	1
needful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
exhort	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
earnestly	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
was	1
once	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
1:4	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
men	1
crept	1
in	1
unawares,	1
who	1
were	1
before	1
of	1
old	1
ordained	1
to	1
this	1
condemnation,	1
ungodly	1
men,	1
turning	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
into	1
lasciviousness,	1
and	1
denying	1
the	1
only	1
Lord	1
God,	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:5	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
put	1
you	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
though	1
ye	1
once	1
knew	1
this,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
Lord,	1
having	1
saved	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
afterward	1
destroyed	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
kept	1
not	1
their	1
first	1
estate,	1
but	1
left	1
their	1
own	1
habitation,	1
he	1
hath	1
reserved	1
in	1
everlasting	1
chains	1
under	1
darkness	1
unto	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
day.	1
	1
1:7	1
Even	1
as	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
about	1
them	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
giving	1
themselves	1
over	1
to	1
fornication,	1
and	1
going	1
after	1
strange	1
flesh,	1
are	1
set	1
forth	1
for	1
an	1
example,	1
suffering	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
eternal	1
fire.	1
	1
1:8	1
Likewise	1
also	1
these	1
filthy	1
dreamers	1
defile	1
the	1
flesh,	1
despise	1
dominion,	1
and	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
dignities.	1
	1
1:9	1
Yet	1
Michael	1
the	1
archangel,	1
when	1
contending	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
he	1
disputed	1
about	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Moses,	1
durst	1
not	1
bring	1
against	1
him	1
a	1
railing	1
accusation,	1
but	1
said,	1
The	1
Lord	1
rebuke	1
thee.	1
	1
1:10	1
But	1
these	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
know	1
not:	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
know	1
naturally,	1
as	1
brute	1
beasts,	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
they	1
corrupt	1
themselves.	1
	1
1:11	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Cain,	1
and	1
ran	1
greedily	1
after	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
Balaam	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
gainsaying	1
of	1
Core.	1
	1
1:12	1
These	1
are	1
spots	1
in	1
your	1
feasts	1
of	1
charity,	1
when	1
they	1
feast	1
with	1
you,	1
feeding	1
themselves	1
without	1
fear:	1
clouds	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
water,	1
carried	1
about	1
of	1
winds;	1
trees	1
whose	1
fruit	1
withereth,	1
without	1
fruit,	1
twice	1
dead,	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots;	1
1:13	1
Raging	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
foaming	1
out	1
their	1
own	1
shame;	1
wandering	1
stars,	1
to	1
whom	1
is	1
reserved	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
darkness	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
Enoch	1
also,	1
the	1
seventh	1
from	1
Adam,	1
prophesied	1
of	1
these,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
cometh	1
with	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
his	1
saints,	1
1:15	1
To	1
execute	1
judgment	1
upon	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
ungodly	1
among	1
them	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
ungodly	1
deeds	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
ungodly	1
committed,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
hard	1
speeches	1
which	1
ungodly	1
sinners	1
have	1
spoken	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
1:16	1
These	1
are	1
murmurers,	1
complainers,	1
walking	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts;	1
and	1
their	1
mouth	1
speaketh	1
great	1
swelling	1
words,	1
having	1
men's	1
persons	1
in	1
admiration	1
because	1
of	1
advantage.	1
	1
1:17	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
remember	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
before	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:18	1
How	1
that	1
they	1
told	1
you	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
mockers	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
who	1
should	1
walk	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
ungodly	1
lusts.	1
	1
1:19	1
These	1
be	1
they	1
who	1
separate	1
themselves,	1
sensual,	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
1:20	1
But	1
ye,	1
beloved,	1
building	1
up	1
yourselves	1
on	1
your	1
most	1
holy	1
faith,	1
praying	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
1:21	1
Keep	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
unto	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
of	1
some	1
have	1
compassion,	1
making	1
a	1
difference:	1
1:23	1
And	1
others	1
save	1
with	1
fear,	1
pulling	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fire;	1
hating	1
even	1
the	1
garment	1
spotted	1
by	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
1:24	1
Now	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1

	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
Revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
him,	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
and	1
signified	1
it	1
by	1
his	1
angel	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
John:	1
1:2	1
Who	1
bare	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
saw.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
readeth,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
keep	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
1:4	1
John	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia:	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
is,	1
and	1
which	1
was,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
which	1
are	1
before	1
his	1
throne;	1
1:5	1
And	1
from	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
faithful	1
witness,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
begotten	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Unto	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
washed	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
sins	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
blood,	1
1:6	1
And	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
kings	1
and	1
priests	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
Father;	1
to	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:7	1
Behold,	1
he	1
cometh	1
with	1
clouds;	1
and	1
every	1
eye	1
shall	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
which	1
pierced	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wail	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
Even	1
so,	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:8	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1

the	1

saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
which	1

and	1
which	1
was,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
to	1

	1
1:9	1
I	1
John,	1
who	1
also	1
am	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
companion	1
in	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
patience	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
isle	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Patmos,	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:10	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
on	1
the	1
Lord's	1
day,	1
and	1
heard	1
behind	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
voice,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
1:11	1
Saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last:	1
and,	1
What	1
thou	1
seest,	1
write	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
seven	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia;	1
unto	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
unto	1
Smyrna,	1
and	1
unto	1
Pergamos,	1
and	1
unto	1
Thyatira,	1
and	1
unto	1
Sardis,	1
and	1
unto	1
Philadelphia,	1
and	1
unto	1
Laodicea.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
I	1
turned	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
voice	1
that	1
spake	1
with	1
me.	1
And	1
being	1
turned,	1
I	1
saw	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks;	1
1:13	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
candlesticks	1
one	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
garment	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
foot,	1
and	1
girt	1
about	1
the	1
paps	1
with	1
a	1
golden	1
girdle.	1
	1
1:14	1
His	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
hairs	1
were	1
white	1
like	1
wool,	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow;	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire;	1
1:15	1
And	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
unto	1
fine	1
brass,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
burned	1
in	1
a	1
furnace;	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
many	1
waters.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
seven	1
stars:	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
went	1
a	1
sharp	1
twoedged	1
sword:	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
shineth	1
in	1
his	1
strength.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him,	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
dead.	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
me,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last:	1
1:18	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
liveth,	1
and	1
was	1
dead;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
alive	1
for	1
evermore,	1
Amen;	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
hell	1
and	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
1:19	1
Write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
hereafter;	1
1:20	1
The	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks.	1
The	1
seven	1
stars	1
are	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
churches:	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
candlesticks	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
churches.	1
	1
2:1	1
Unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Ephesus	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
who	1
walketh	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks;	1
2:2	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
thy	1
labour,	1
and	1
thy	1
patience,	1
and	1
how	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
bear	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
evil:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
tried	1
them	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
apostles,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
and	1
hast	1
found	1
them	1
liars:	1
2:3	1
And	1
hast	1
borne,	1
and	1
hast	1
patience,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake	1
hast	1
laboured,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
fainted.	1
	1
2:4	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
left	1
thy	1
first	1
love.	1
	1
2:5	1
Remember	1
therefore	1
from	1
whence	1
thou	1
art	1
fallen,	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
do	1
the	1
first	1
works;	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
quickly,	1
and	1
will	1
remove	1
thy	1
candlestick	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
except	1
thou	1
repent.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
this	1
thou	1
hast,	1
that	1
thou	1
hatest	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
Nicolaitanes,	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
hate.	1
	1
2:7	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
paradise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Smyrna	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last,	1
which	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive;	1
2:9	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
poverty,	1
(but	1
thou	1
art	1
rich)	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
Jews,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
but	1
are	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
Satan.	1
	1
2:10	1
Fear	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
suffer:	1
behold,	1
the	1
devil	1
shall	1
cast	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
into	1
prison,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
tried;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
tribulation	1
ten	1
days:	1
be	1
thou	1
faithful	1
unto	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
2:11	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Pergamos	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
the	1
sharp	1
sword	1
with	1
two	1
edges;	1
2:13	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
where	1
thou	1
dwellest,	1
even	1
where	1
Satan's	1
seat	1
is:	1
and	1
thou	1
holdest	1
fast	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
denied	1
my	1
faith,	1
even	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
wherein	1
Antipas	1
was	1
my	1
faithful	1
martyr,	1
who	1
was	1
slain	1
among	1
you,	1
where	1
Satan	1
dwelleth.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
there	1
them	1
that	1
hold	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Balaam,	1
who	1
taught	1
Balac	1
to	1
cast	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
eat	1
things	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols,	1
and	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication.	1
	1
2:15	1
So	1
hast	1
thou	1
also	1
them	1
that	1
hold	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Nicolaitanes,	1
which	1
thing	1
I	1
hate.	1
	1
2:16	1
Repent;	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
quickly,	1
and	1
will	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
2:17	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
hidden	1
manna,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
white	1
stone,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stone	1
a	1
new	1
name	1
written,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
saving	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
it.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Thyatira	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
his	1
eyes	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
are	1
like	1
fine	1
brass;	1
2:19	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
charity,	1
and	1
service,	1
and	1
faith,	1
and	1
thy	1
patience,	1
and	1
thy	1
works;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
2:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
sufferest	1
that	1
woman	1
Jezebel,	1
which	1
calleth	1
herself	1
a	1
prophetess,	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
to	1
seduce	1
my	1
servants	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
things	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
space	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
her	1
fornication;	1
and	1
she	1
repented	1
not.	1
	1
2:22	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
bed,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
commit	1
adultery	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
kill	1
her	1
children	1
with	1
death;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
which	1
searcheth	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
hearts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
works.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
rest	1
in	1
Thyatira,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
Satan,	1
as	1
they	1
speak;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
upon	1
you	1
none	1
other	1
burden.	1
	1
2:25	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
already	1
hold	1
fast	1
till	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
overcometh,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
my	1
works	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
nations:	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron;	1
as	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
a	1
potter	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
broken	1
to	1
shivers:	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
received	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
morning	1
star.	1
	1
2:29	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Sardis	1

These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
stars;	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
name	1
that	1
thou	1
livest,	1
and	1
art	1
dead.	1
	1
3:2	1
Be	1
watchful,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
remain,	1
that	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
die:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
thy	1
works	1
perfect	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
Remember	1
therefore	1
how	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
hold	1
fast,	1
and	1
repent.	1
If	1
therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
watch,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
on	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
hour	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
3:4	1
Thou	1
hast	1
a	1
few	1
names	1
even	1
in	1
Sardis	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
defiled	1
their	1
garments;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
white:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
raiment;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
blot	1
out	1
his	1
name	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
his	1
name	1
before	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
angels.	1
	1
3:6	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Philadelphia	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holy,	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
David,	1
he	1
that	1
openeth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shutteth;	1
and	1
shutteth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
openeth;	1
3:8	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
thee	1
an	1
open	1
door,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
shut	1
it:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
little	1
strength,	1
and	1
hast	1
kept	1
my	1
word,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
denied	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
3:9	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
Satan,	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
Jews,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
but	1
do	1
lie;	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee.	1
	1
3:10	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
my	1
patience,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
keep	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
temptation,	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
try	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:11	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly:	1
hold	1
that	1
fast	1
which	1
thou	1
hast,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
take	1
thy	1
crown.	1
	1
3:12	1
Him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
pillar	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
out:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
new	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
my	1
God:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
upon	1
him	1
my	1
new	1
name.	1
	1
3:13	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Laodiceans	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
Amen,	1
the	1
faithful	1
and	1
true	1
witness,	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
God;	1
3:15	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
neither	1
cold	1
nor	1
hot:	1
I	1
would	1
thou	1
wert	1
cold	1
or	1
hot.	1
	1
3:16	1
So	1
then	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
lukewarm,	1
and	1
neither	1
cold	1
nor	1
hot,	1
I	1
will	1
spue	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
3:17	1
Because	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
I	1
am	1
rich,	1
and	1
increased	1
with	1
goods,	1
and	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
nothing;	1
and	1
knowest	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
wretched,	1
and	1
miserable,	1
and	1
poor,	1
and	1
blind,	1
and	1
naked:	1
3:18	1
I	1
counsel	1
thee	1
to	1
buy	1
of	1
me	1
gold	1
tried	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
rich;	1
and	1
white	1
raiment,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
clothed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
thy	1
nakedness	1
do	1
not	1
appear;	1
and	1
anoint	1
thine	1
eyes	1
with	1
eyesalve,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
see.	1
	1
3:19	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
I	1
love,	1
I	1
rebuke	1
and	1
chasten:	1
be	1
zealous	1
therefore,	1
and	1
repent.	1
	1
3:20	1
Behold,	1
I	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
knock:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
sup	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
3:21	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
grant	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
throne,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
overcame,	1
and	1
am	1
set	1
down	1
with	1
my	1
Father	1
in	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
3:22	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
4:1	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet	1
talking	1
with	1
me;	1
which	1
said,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
hereafter.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
immediately	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
spirit:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
throne	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
one	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
was	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
like	1
a	1
jasper	1
and	1
a	1
sardine	1
stone:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rainbow	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
in	1
sight	1
like	1
unto	1
an	1
emerald.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne	1
were	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
seats:	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
seats	1
I	1
saw	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
sitting,	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
raiment;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
crowns	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
proceeded	1
lightnings	1
and	1
thunderings	1
and	1
voices:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
lamps	1
of	1
fire	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
glass	1
like	1
unto	1
crystal:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
were	1
four	1
beasts	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
before	1
and	1
behind.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
beast	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
beast	1
like	1
a	1
calf,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
beast	1
had	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
flying	1
eagle.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
had	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
six	1
wings	1
about	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
within:	1
and	1
they	1
rest	1
not	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
saying,	1
Holy,	1
holy,	1
holy,	1
LORD	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
which	1
was,	1
and	1
is,	1
and	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
when	1
those	1
beasts	1
give	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
thanks	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
who	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
4:10	1
The	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fall	1
down	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
and	1
cast	1
their	1
crowns	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
4:11	1
Thou	1
art	1
worthy,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
to	1
receive	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
power:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
created	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
pleasure	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
were	1
created.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
a	1
book	1
written	1
within	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
backside,	1
sealed	1
with	1
seven	1
seals.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
strong	1
angel	1
proclaiming	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Who	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
seals	1
thereof?	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
heaven,	1
nor	1
in	1
earth,	1
neither	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
neither	1
to	1
look	1
thereon.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
I	1
wept	1
much,	1
because	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
found	1
worthy	1
to	1
open	1
and	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
book,	1
neither	1
to	1
look	1
thereon.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Weep	1
not:	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lion	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Juda,	1
the	1
Root	1
of	1
David,	1
hath	1
prevailed	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
seven	1
seals	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
stood	1
a	1
Lamb	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
slain,	1
having	1
seven	1
horns	1
and	1
seven	1
eyes,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God	1
sent	1
forth	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
book,	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
and	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
having	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
harps,	1
and	1
golden	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
odours,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
they	1
sung	1
a	1
new	1
song,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
worthy	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
seals	1
thereof:	1
for	1
thou	1
wast	1
slain,	1
and	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
us	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
thy	1
blood	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
kindred,	1
and	1
tongue,	1
and	1
people,	1
and	1
nation;	1
5:10	1
And	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
unto	1
our	1
God	1
kings	1
and	1
priests:	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
reign	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
angels	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
and	1
the	1
elders:	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
and	1
thousands	1
of	1
thousands;	1
5:12	1
Saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Worthy	1
is	1
the	1
Lamb	1
that	1
was	1
slain	1
to	1
receive	1
power,	1
and	1
riches,	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
blessing.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
every	1
creature	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
them,	1
heard	1
I	1
saying,	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
power,	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
said,	1
Amen.	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
when	1
the	1
Lamb	1
opened	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seals,	1
and	1
I	1
heard,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thunder,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
saying,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
horse:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
a	1
bow;	1
and	1
a	1
crown	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
conquering,	1
and	1
to	1
conquer.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
second	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
second	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
another	1
horse	1
that	1
was	1
red:	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
thereon	1
to	1
take	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
kill	1
one	1
another:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
sword.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
third	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
third	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
lo	1
a	1
black	1
horse;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
balances	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
say,	1
A	1
measure	1
of	1
wheat	1
for	1
a	1
penny,	1
and	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
for	1
a	1
penny;	1
and	1
see	1
thou	1
hurt	1
not	1
the	1
oil	1
and	1
the	1
wine.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
fourth	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
pale	1
horse:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
was	1
Death,	1
and	1
Hell	1
followed	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
kill	1
with	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
hunger,	1
and	1
with	1
death,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
fifth	1
seal,	1
I	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
altar	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
which	1
they	1
held:	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
How	1
long,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
holy	1
and	1
true,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
judge	1
and	1
avenge	1
our	1
blood	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
white	1
robes	1
were	1
given	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
rest	1
yet	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
season,	1
until	1
their	1
fellowservants	1
also	1
and	1
their	1
brethren,	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
killed	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
sixth	1
seal,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
black	1
as	1
sackcloth	1
of	1
hair,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
became	1
as	1
blood;	1
6:13	1
And	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
casteth	1
her	1
untimely	1
figs,	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
shaken	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
wind.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
heaven	1
departed	1
as	1
a	1
scroll	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
rolled	1
together;	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
island	1
were	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
places.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
every	1
bondman,	1
and	1
every	1
free	1
man,	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
dens	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
6:16	1
And	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
rocks,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
hide	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb:	1
6:17	1
For	1
the	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
is	1
come;	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand?	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
four	1
angels	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
holding	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
the	1
wind	1
should	1
not	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
nor	1
on	1
any	1
tree.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
ascending	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
having	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God:	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
four	1
angels,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
hurt	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
7:3	1
Saying,	1
Hurt	1
not	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
the	1
sea,	1
nor	1
the	1
trees,	1
till	1
we	1
have	1
sealed	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
sealed:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
sealed	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:5	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Juda	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Reuben	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Gad	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:6	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Aser	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Nephthalim	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasses	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:7	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Simeon	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Issachar	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:8	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Zabulon	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Joseph	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:9	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
number,	1
of	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
kindreds,	1
and	1
people,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
clothed	1
with	1
white	1
robes,	1
and	1
palms	1
in	1
their	1
hands;	1
7:10	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Salvation	1
to	1
our	1
God	1
which	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
fell	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
on	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
7:12	1
Saying,	1
Amen:	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
might,	1
be	1
unto	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
answered,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
which	1
are	1
arrayed	1
in	1
white	1
robes?	1
and	1
whence	1
came	1
they?	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
thou	1
knowest.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
have	1
washed	1
their	1
robes,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
7:15	1
Therefore	1
are	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
in	1
his	1
temple:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
shall	1
dwell	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
7:16	1
They	1
shall	1
hunger	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
thirst	1
any	1
more;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sun	1
light	1
on	1
them,	1
nor	1
any	1
heat.	1
	1
7:17	1
For	1
the	1
Lamb	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
shall	1
feed	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
lead	1
them	1
unto	1
living	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters:	1
and	1
God	1
shall	1
wipe	1
away	1
all	1
tears	1
from	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
seventh	1
seal,	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
in	1
heaven	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
half	1
an	1
hour.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
stood	1
before	1
God;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
given	1
seven	1
trumpets.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
altar,	1
having	1
a	1
golden	1
censer;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
much	1
incense,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offer	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
all	1
saints	1
upon	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
incense,	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
ascended	1
up	1
before	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
angel's	1
hand.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
took	1
the	1
censer,	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
with	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
an	1
earthquake.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
trumpets	1
prepared	1
themselves	1
to	1
sound.	1
	1
8:7	1
The	1
first	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
there	1
followed	1
hail	1
and	1
fire	1
mingled	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
cast	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
trees	1
was	1
burnt	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
green	1
grass	1
was	1
burnt	1
up.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
mountain	1
burning	1
with	1
fire	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
became	1
blood;	1
8:9	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
creatures	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
had	1
life,	1
died;	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ships	1
were	1
destroyed.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
great	1
star	1
from	1
heaven,	1
burning	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
lamp,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters;	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
star	1
is	1
called	1
Wormwood:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
became	1
wormwood;	1
and	1
many	1
men	1
died	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
bitter.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
smitten,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stars;	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
shone	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
likewise.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
heard	1
an	1
angel	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Woe,	1
woe,	1
woe,	1
to	1
the	1
inhabiters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
angels,	1
which	1
are	1
yet	1
to	1
sound!	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
the	1
fifth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
star	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven	1
unto	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
given	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit;	1
and	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
furnace;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
were	1
darkened	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
locusts	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
was	1
given	1
power,	1
as	1
the	1
scorpions	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
power.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hurt	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
any	1
green	1
thing,	1
neither	1
any	1
tree;	1
but	1
only	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
kill	1
them,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
tormented	1
five	1
months:	1
and	1
their	1
torment	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
torment	1
of	1
a	1
scorpion,	1
when	1
he	1
striketh	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
men	1
seek	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it;	1
and	1
shall	1
desire	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
death	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
locusts	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
horses	1
prepared	1
unto	1
battle;	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
were	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
crowns	1
like	1
gold,	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
hair	1
as	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
women,	1
and	1
their	1
teeth	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
breastplates,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
breastplates	1
of	1
iron;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
wings	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
chariots	1
of	1
many	1
horses	1
running	1
to	1
battle.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
tails	1
like	1
unto	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
stings	1
in	1
their	1
tails:	1
and	1
their	1
power	1
was	1
to	1
hurt	1
men	1
five	1
months.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
them,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
whose	1
name	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
is	1
Abaddon,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Greek	1
tongue	1
hath	1
his	1
name	1
Apollyon.	1
	1
9:12	1
One	1
woe	1
is	1
past;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
come	1
two	1
woes	1
more	1
hereafter.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
God,	1
9:14	1
Saying	1
to	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
Loose	1
the	1
four	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
angels	1
were	1
loosed,	1
which	1
were	1
prepared	1
for	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
a	1
year,	1
for	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
thousand:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
them,	1
having	1
breastplates	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
of	1
jacinth,	1
and	1
brimstone:	1
and	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
lions;	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouths	1
issued	1
fire	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
brimstone.	1
	1
9:18	1
By	1
these	1
three	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
men	1
killed,	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
brimstone,	1
which	1
issued	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouths.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
their	1
power	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
tails:	1
for	1
their	1
tails	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
serpents,	1
and	1
had	1
heads,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
they	1
do	1
hurt.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
killed	1
by	1
these	1
plagues	1
yet	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
worship	1
devils,	1
and	1
idols	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
brass,	1
and	1
stone,	1
and	1
of	1
wood:	1
which	1
neither	1
can	1
see,	1
nor	1
hear,	1
nor	1
walk:	1
9:21	1
Neither	1
repented	1
they	1
of	1
their	1
murders,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
sorceries,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
fornication,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
thefts.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
mighty	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
cloud:	1
and	1
a	1
rainbow	1
was	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
pillars	1
of	1
fire:	1
10:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
little	1
book	1
open:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
right	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
10:3	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
lion	1
roareth:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cried,	1
seven	1
thunders	1
uttered	1
their	1
voices.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
thunders	1
had	1
uttered	1
their	1
voices,	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
write:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Seal	1
up	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
seven	1
thunders	1
uttered,	1
and	1
write	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
heaven,	1
10:6	1
And	1
sware	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
who	1
created	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
therein,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
time	1
no	1
longer:	1
10:7	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
sound,	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
finished,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
declared	1
to	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
from	1
heaven	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
which	1
is	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
standeth	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
little	1
book.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
it,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
up;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
make	1
thy	1
belly	1
bitter,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth	1
sweet	1
as	1
honey.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
angel's	1
hand,	1
and	1
ate	1
it	1
up;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
mouth	1
sweet	1
as	1
honey:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
eaten	1
it,	1
my	1
belly	1
was	1
bitter.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
must	1
prophesy	1
again	1
before	1
many	1
peoples,	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
and	1
kings.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
reed	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
rod:	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
stood,	1
saying,	1
Rise,	1
and	1
measure	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
therein.	1
	1
11:2	1
But	1
the	1
court	1
which	1
is	1
without	1
the	1
temple	1
leave	1
out,	1
and	1
measure	1
it	1
not;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
city	1
shall	1
they	1
tread	1
under	1
foot	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
power	1
unto	1
my	1
two	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
days,	1
clothed	1
in	1
sackcloth.	1
	1
11:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
olive	1
trees,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
candlesticks	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
fire	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
devoureth	1
their	1
enemies:	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
he	1
must	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
11:6	1
These	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
shut	1
heaven,	1
that	1
it	1
rain	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
prophecy:	1
and	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
waters	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
to	1
blood,	1
and	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
all	1
plagues,	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
they	1
will.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
finished	1
their	1
testimony,	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
ascendeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
shall	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
overcome	1
them,	1
and	1
kill	1
them.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
shall	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
city,	1
which	1
spiritually	1
is	1
called	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Egypt,	1
where	1
also	1
our	1
Lord	1
was	1
crucified.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
kindreds	1
and	1
tongues	1
and	1
nations	1
shall	1
see	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
an	1
half,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
suffer	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
graves.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
merry,	1
and	1
shall	1
send	1
gifts	1
one	1
to	1
another;	1
because	1
these	1
two	1
prophets	1
tormented	1
them	1
that	1
dwelt	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
an	1
half	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
God	1
entered	1
into	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
upon	1
their	1
feet;	1
and	1
great	1
fear	1
fell	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
saw	1
them.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither.	1
And	1
they	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
in	1
a	1
cloud;	1
and	1
their	1
enemies	1
beheld	1
them.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
fell,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earthquake	1
were	1
slain	1
of	1
men	1
seven	1
thousand:	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
were	1
affrighted,	1
and	1
gave	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:14	1
The	1
second	1
woe	1
is	1
past;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
third	1
woe	1
cometh	1
quickly.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel	1
sounded;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
voices	1
in	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
are	1
become	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
our	1
Lord,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
Christ;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders,	1
which	1
sat	1
before	1
God	1
on	1
their	1
seats,	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
11:17	1
Saying,	1
We	1
give	1
thee	1
thanks,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
which	1
art,	1
and	1
wast,	1
and	1
art	1
to	1
come;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
to	1
thee	1
thy	1
great	1
power,	1
and	1
hast	1
reigned.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
nations	1
were	1
angry,	1
and	1
thy	1
wrath	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
judged,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
give	1
reward	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
thy	1
name,	1
small	1
and	1
great;	1
and	1
shouldest	1
destroy	1
them	1
which	1
destroy	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
opened	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
seen	1
in	1
his	1
temple	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
his	1
testament:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
great	1
hail.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
a	1
great	1
wonder	1
in	1
heaven;	1
a	1
woman	1
clothed	1
with	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
under	1
her	1
feet,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
twelve	1
stars:	1
12:2	1
And	1
she	1
being	1
with	1
child	1
cried,	1
travailing	1
in	1
birth,	1
and	1
pained	1
to	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
another	1
wonder	1
in	1
heaven;	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
great	1
red	1
dragon,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns,	1
and	1
seven	1
crowns	1
upon	1
his	1
heads.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
his	1
tail	1
drew	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
delivered,	1
for	1
to	1
devour	1
her	1
child	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
born.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
a	1
man	1
child,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
rule	1
all	1
nations	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
her	1
child	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
unto	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
where	1
she	1
hath	1
a	1
place	1
prepared	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
feed	1
her	1
there	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
days.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
in	1
heaven:	1
Michael	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
dragon;	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
fought	1
and	1
his	1
angels,	1
12:8	1
And	1
prevailed	1
not;	1
neither	1
was	1
their	1
place	1
found	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
dragon	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
that	1
old	1
serpent,	1
called	1
the	1
Devil,	1
and	1
Satan,	1
which	1
deceiveth	1
the	1
whole	1
world:	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
were	1
cast	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Now	1
is	1
come	1
salvation,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
Christ:	1
for	1
the	1
accuser	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
is	1
cast	1
down,	1
which	1
accused	1
them	1
before	1
our	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
they	1
overcame	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
their	1
testimony;	1
and	1
they	1
loved	1
not	1
their	1
lives	1
unto	1
the	1
death.	1
	1
12:12	1
Therefore	1
rejoice,	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
them.	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
inhabiters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sea!	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
you,	1
having	1
great	1
wrath,	1
because	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
dragon	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
unto	1
the	1
earth,	1
he	1
persecuted	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
man	1
child.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
were	1
given	1
two	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
eagle,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
fly	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
into	1
her	1
place,	1
where	1
she	1
is	1
nourished	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
times,	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
time,	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
serpent.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
the	1
serpent	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
water	1
as	1
a	1
flood	1
after	1
the	1
woman,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
helped	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
up	1
the	1
flood	1
which	1
the	1
dragon	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
the	1
dragon	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
her	1
seed,	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
beast	1
rise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
horns	1
ten	1
crowns,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
heads	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
blasphemy.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
leopard,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
as	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
lion:	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
great	1
authority.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
heads	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
wounded	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
his	1
deadly	1
wound	1
was	1
healed:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
wondered	1
after	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
dragon	1
which	1
gave	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
beast:	1
and	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
beast,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
beast?	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
mouth	1
speaking	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
blasphemies;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
continue	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
blasphemy	1
against	1
God,	1
to	1
blaspheme	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
overcome	1
them:	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
over	1
all	1
kindreds,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
and	1
nations.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
worship	1
him,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
slain	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
13:9	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:10	1
He	1
that	1
leadeth	1
into	1
captivity	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
must	1
be	1
killed	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
patience	1
and	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
another	1
beast	1
coming	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
horns	1
like	1
a	1
lamb,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
as	1
a	1
dragon.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
he	1
exerciseth	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
beast	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
causeth	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
dwell	1
therein	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
first	1
beast,	1
whose	1
deadly	1
wound	1
was	1
healed.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
he	1
doeth	1
great	1
wonders,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
maketh	1
fire	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men,	1
13:14	1
And	1
deceiveth	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
those	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
beast;	1
saying	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
an	1
image	1
to	1
the	1
beast,	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
wound	1
by	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
did	1
live.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
life	1
unto	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
that	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
should	1
both	1
speak,	1
and	1
cause	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
not	1
worship	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
should	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
he	1
causeth	1
all,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
rich	1
and	1
poor,	1
free	1
and	1
bond,	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
mark	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads:	1
13:17	1
And	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
might	1
buy	1
or	1
sell,	1
save	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
mark,	1
or	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
13:18	1
Here	1
is	1
wisdom.	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding	1
count	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
beast:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
a	1
man;	1
and	1
his	1
number	1
is	1
Six	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
six.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
Lamb	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
hundred	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand,	1
having	1
his	1
Father's	1
name	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
thunder:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
harpers	1
harping	1
with	1
their	1
harps:	1
14:3	1
And	1
they	1
sung	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
new	1
song	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
the	1
elders:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
learn	1
that	1
song	1
but	1
the	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand,	1
which	1
were	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:4	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
defiled	1
with	1
women;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
virgins.	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
follow	1
the	1
Lamb	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
goeth.	1
These	1
were	1
redeemed	1
from	1
among	1
men,	1
being	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
mouth	1
was	1
found	1
no	1
guile:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
fault	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
having	1
the	1
everlasting	1
gospel	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
nation,	1
and	1
kindred,	1
and	1
tongue,	1
and	1
people,	1
14:7	1
Saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Fear	1
God,	1
and	1
give	1
glory	1
to	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
his	1
judgment	1
is	1
come:	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
another	1
angel,	1
saying,	1
Babylon	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
because	1
she	1
made	1
all	1
nations	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
fornication.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
followed	1
them,	1
saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
worship	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
receive	1
his	1
mark	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
or	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
14:10	1
The	1
same	1
shall	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
without	1
mixture	1
into	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
his	1
indignation;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
tormented	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
angels,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb:	1
14:11	1
And	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
their	1
torment	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
rest	1
day	1
nor	1
night,	1
who	1
worship	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
receiveth	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
14:12	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
the	1
saints:	1
here	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
henceforth:	1
Yea,	1
saith	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
rest	1
from	1
their	1
labours;	1
and	1
their	1
works	1
do	1
follow	1
them.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
cloud,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
cloud	1
one	1
sat	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
having	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
golden	1
crown,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
sharp	1
sickle.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
crying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
cloud,	1
Thrust	1
in	1
thy	1
sickle,	1
and	1
reap:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
reap;	1
for	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
ripe.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
cloud	1
thrust	1
in	1
his	1
sickle	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
reaped.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
he	1
also	1
having	1
a	1
sharp	1
sickle.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
altar,	1
which	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
fire;	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
cry	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
sharp	1
sickle,	1
saying,	1
Thrust	1
in	1
thy	1
sharp	1
sickle,	1
and	1
gather	1
the	1
clusters	1
of	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
her	1
grapes	1
are	1
fully	1
ripe.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
thrust	1
in	1
his	1
sickle	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
winepress	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
the	1
winepress	1
was	1
trodden	1
without	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
blood	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
winepress,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
horse	1
bridles,	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred	1
furlongs.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
sign	1
in	1
heaven,	1
great	1
and	1
marvellous,	1
seven	1
angels	1
having	1
the	1
seven	1
last	1
plagues;	1
for	1
in	1
them	1
is	1
filled	1
up	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
glass	1
mingled	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
gotten	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
mark,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
name,	1
stand	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
glass,	1
having	1
the	1
harps	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
they	1
sing	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
saying,	1
Great	1
and	1
marvellous	1
are	1
thy	1
works,	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty;	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
are	1
thy	1
ways,	1
thou	1
King	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
15:4	1
Who	1
shall	1
not	1
fear	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
and	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name?	1
for	1
thou	1
only	1
art	1
holy:	1
for	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thee;	1
for	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
made	1
manifest.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
in	1
heaven	1
was	1
opened:	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
having	1
the	1
seven	1
plagues,	1
clothed	1
in	1
pure	1
and	1
white	1
linen,	1
and	1
having	1
their	1
breasts	1
girded	1
with	1
golden	1
girdles.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
seven	1
golden	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
smoke	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
power;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
till	1
the	1
seven	1
plagues	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
were	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
saying	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
angels,	1
Go	1
your	1
ways,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
vials	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
went,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
noisome	1
and	1
grievous	1
sore	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
worshipped	1
his	1
image.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
as	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
man:	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
soul	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
rivers	1
and	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters;	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
blood.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
say,	1
Thou	1
art	1
righteous,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
which	1
art,	1
and	1
wast,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
judged	1
thus.	1
	1
16:6	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
saints	1
and	1
prophets,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
them	1
blood	1
to	1
drink;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
another	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
say,	1
Even	1
so,	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
are	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
scorch	1
men	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
men	1
were	1
scorched	1
with	1
great	1
heat,	1
and	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
these	1
plagues:	1
and	1
they	1
repented	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
glory.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
the	1
fifth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
beast;	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
darkness;	1
and	1
they	1
gnawed	1
their	1
tongues	1
for	1
pain,	1
16:11	1
And	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
pains	1
and	1
their	1
sores,	1
and	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Euphrates;	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
thereof	1
was	1
dried	1
up,	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
might	1
be	1
prepared.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
three	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
like	1
frogs	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
dragon,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
false	1
prophet.	1
	1
16:14	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
devils,	1
working	1
miracles,	1
which	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
to	1
gather	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
God	1
Almighty.	1
	1
16:15	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
watcheth,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
his	1
garments,	1
lest	1
he	1
walk	1
naked,	1
and	1
they	1
see	1
his	1
shame.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
Armageddon.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
heaven,	1
from	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
done.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunders,	1
and	1
lightnings;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
since	1
men	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
so	1
mighty	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
so	1
great.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
three	1
parts,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
fell:	1
and	1
great	1
Babylon	1
came	1
in	1
remembrance	1
before	1
God,	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
her	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
every	1
island	1
fled	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
not	1
found.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
there	1
fell	1
upon	1
men	1
a	1
great	1
hail	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
every	1
stone	1
about	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
a	1
talent:	1
and	1
men	1
blasphemed	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
the	1
hail;	1
for	1
the	1
plague	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceeding	1
great.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
vials,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Come	1
hither;	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
whore	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
many	1
waters:	1
17:2	1
With	1
whom	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
drunk	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
her	1
fornication.	1
	1
17:3	1
So	1
he	1
carried	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
woman	1
sit	1
upon	1
a	1
scarlet	1
coloured	1
beast,	1
full	1
of	1
names	1
of	1
blasphemy,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
arrayed	1
in	1
purple	1
and	1
scarlet	1
colour,	1
and	1
decked	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
precious	1
stones	1
and	1
pearls,	1
having	1
a	1
golden	1
cup	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
full	1
of	1
abominations	1
and	1
filthiness	1
of	1
her	1
fornication:	1
17:5	1
And	1
upon	1
her	1
forehead	1
was	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
MYSTERY,	1
BABYLON	1
THE	1
GREAT,	1
THE	1
MOTHER	1
OF	1
HARLOTS	1
AND	1
ABOMINATIONS	1
OF	1
THE	1
EARTH.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
woman	1
drunken	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
martyrs	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
her,	1
I	1
wondered	1
with	1
great	1
admiration.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
marvel?	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
carrieth	1
her,	1
which	1
hath	1
the	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
17:8	1
The	1
beast	1
that	1
thou	1
sawest	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not;	1
and	1
shall	1
ascend	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
perdition:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wonder,	1
whose	1
names	1
were	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
when	1
they	1
behold	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
yet	1
is.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
hath	1
wisdom.	1
The	1
seven	1
heads	1
are	1
seven	1
mountains,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
woman	1
sitteth.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
seven	1
kings:	1
five	1
are	1
fallen,	1
and	1
one	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
he	1
must	1
continue	1
a	1
short	1
space.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not,	1
even	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
eighth,	1
and	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
seven,	1
and	1
goeth	1
into	1
perdition.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
are	1
ten	1
kings,	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
no	1
kingdom	1
as	1
yet;	1
but	1
receive	1
power	1
as	1
kings	1
one	1
hour	1
with	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
17:13	1
These	1
have	1
one	1
mind,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
their	1
power	1
and	1
strength	1
unto	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
17:14	1
These	1
shall	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
overcome	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords,	1
and	1
King	1
of	1
kings:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him	1
are	1
called,	1
and	1
chosen,	1
and	1
faithful.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
waters	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
where	1
the	1
whore	1
sitteth,	1
are	1
peoples,	1
and	1
multitudes,	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
tongues.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
upon	1
the	1
beast,	1
these	1
shall	1
hate	1
the	1
whore,	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
her	1
desolate	1
and	1
naked,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
her	1
flesh,	1
and	1
burn	1
her	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
17:17	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
fulfil	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
to	1
agree,	1
and	1
give	1
their	1
kingdom	1
unto	1
the	1
beast,	1
until	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
is	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
which	1
reigneth	1
over	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
having	1
great	1
power;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
lightened	1
with	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
mightily	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Babylon	1
the	1
great	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen,	1
and	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
devils,	1
and	1
the	1
hold	1
of	1
every	1
foul	1
spirit,	1
and	1
a	1
cage	1
of	1
every	1
unclean	1
and	1
hateful	1
bird.	1
	1
18:3	1
For	1
all	1
nations	1
have	1
drunk	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
fornication,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
waxed	1
rich	1
through	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
her	1
delicacies.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
another	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
out	1
of	1
her,	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
partakers	1
of	1
her	1
sins,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
of	1
her	1
plagues.	1
	1
18:5	1
For	1
her	1
sins	1
have	1
reached	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
remembered	1
her	1
iniquities.	1
	1
18:6	1
Reward	1
her	1
even	1
as	1
she	1
rewarded	1
you,	1
and	1
double	1
unto	1
her	1
double	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
works:	1
in	1
the	1
cup	1
which	1
she	1
hath	1
filled	1
fill	1
to	1
her	1
double.	1
	1
18:7	1
How	1
much	1
she	1
hath	1
glorified	1
herself,	1
and	1
lived	1
deliciously,	1
so	1
much	1
torment	1
and	1
sorrow	1
give	1
her:	1
for	1
she	1
saith	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
I	1
sit	1
a	1
queen,	1
and	1
am	1
no	1
widow,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
no	1
sorrow.	1
	1
18:8	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
her	1
plagues	1
come	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
death,	1
and	1
mourning,	1
and	1
famine;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
burned	1
with	1
fire:	1
for	1
strong	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
who	1
judgeth	1
her.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
who	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication	1
and	1
lived	1
deliciously	1
with	1
her,	1
shall	1
bewail	1
her,	1
and	1
lament	1
for	1
her,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
her	1
burning,	1
18:10	1
Standing	1
afar	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
torment,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
mighty	1
city!	1
for	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
is	1
thy	1
judgment	1
come.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
weep	1
and	1
mourn	1
over	1
her;	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
buyeth	1
their	1
merchandise	1
any	1
more:	1
18:12	1
The	1
merchandise	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
of	1
pearls,	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
silk,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
all	1
thyine	1
wood,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
vessels	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
vessels	1
of	1
most	1
precious	1
wood,	1
and	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
iron,	1
and	1
marble,	1
18:13	1
And	1
cinnamon,	1
and	1
odours,	1
and	1
ointments,	1
and	1
frankincense,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
wheat,	1
and	1
beasts,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
chariots,	1
and	1
slaves,	1
and	1
souls	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
the	1
fruits	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
lusted	1
after	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
dainty	1
and	1
goodly	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
them	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:15	1
The	1
merchants	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
rich	1
by	1
her,	1
shall	1
stand	1
afar	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
torment,	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
18:16	1
And	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
that	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
decked	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
pearls!	1
	1
18:17	1
For	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
so	1
great	1
riches	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
nought.	1
And	1
every	1
shipmaster,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
ships,	1
and	1
sailors,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
trade	1
by	1
sea,	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
18:18	1
And	1
cried	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
her	1
burning,	1
saying,	1
What	1
city	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city!	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
dust	1
on	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
cried,	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
wherein	1
were	1
made	1
rich	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
ships	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
her	1
costliness!	1
for	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
is	1
she	1
made	1
desolate.	1
	1
18:20	1
Rejoice	1
over	1
her,	1
thou	1
heaven,	1
and	1
ye	1
holy	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
avenged	1
you	1
on	1
her.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
a	1
mighty	1
angel	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
stone	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
millstone,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
with	1
violence	1
shall	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Babylon	1
be	1
thrown	1
down,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
harpers,	1
and	1
musicians,	1
and	1
of	1
pipers,	1
and	1
trumpeters,	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
no	1
craftsman,	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
craft	1
he	1
be,	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
millstone	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
18:23	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
shall	1
shine	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee:	1
for	1
thy	1
merchants	1
were	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
by	1
thy	1
sorceries	1
were	1
all	1
nations	1
deceived.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
was	1
found	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
saints,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
of	1
much	1
people	1
in	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Alleluia;	1
Salvation,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
power,	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God:	1
19:2	1
For	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
are	1
his	1
judgments:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
judged	1
the	1
great	1
whore,	1
which	1
did	1
corrupt	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
her	1
fornication,	1
and	1
hath	1
avenged	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
at	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
again	1
they	1
said,	1
Alleluia	1
And	1
her	1
smoke	1
rose	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
Amen;	1
Alleluia.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
Praise	1
our	1
God,	1
all	1
ye	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
him,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mighty	1
thunderings,	1
saying,	1
Alleluia:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
omnipotent	1
reigneth.	1
	1
19:7	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
give	1
honour	1
to	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hath	1
made	1
herself	1
ready.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
granted	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
arrayed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
clean	1
and	1
white:	1
for	1
the	1
fine	1
linen	1
is	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
marriage	1
supper	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
true	1
sayings	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
See	1
thou	1
do	1
it	1
not:	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
worship	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
heaven	1
opened,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
horse;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
him	1
was	1
called	1
Faithful	1
and	1
True,	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness	1
he	1
doth	1
judge	1
and	1
make	1
war.	1
	1
19:12	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
were	1
many	1
crowns;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
knew,	1
but	1
he	1
himself.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
vesture	1
dipped	1
in	1
blood:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
called	1
The	1
Word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
the	1
armies	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
heaven	1
followed	1
him	1
upon	1
white	1
horses,	1
clothed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
white	1
and	1
clean.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
goeth	1
a	1
sharp	1
sword,	1
that	1
with	1
it	1
he	1
should	1
smite	1
the	1
nations:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
he	1
treadeth	1
the	1
winepress	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
and	1
wrath	1
of	1
Almighty	1
God.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
on	1
his	1
vesture	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
thigh	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
KING	1
OF	1
KINGS,	1
AND	1
LORD	1
OF	1
LORDS.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
angel	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
that	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
Come	1
and	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
supper	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God;	1
19:18	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
horses,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
both	1
free	1
and	1
bond,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
armies,	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
horse,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
false	1
prophet	1
that	1
wrought	1
miracles	1
before	1
him,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
deceived	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worshipped	1
his	1
image.	1
These	1
both	1
were	1
cast	1
alive	1
into	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
burning	1
with	1
brimstone.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
horse,	1
which	1
sword	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
their	1
flesh.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
having	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
chain	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
dragon,	1
that	1
old	1
serpent,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Devil,	1
and	1
Satan,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
20:3	1
And	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
and	1
shut	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
seal	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
deceive	1
the	1
nations	1
no	1
more,	1
till	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
loosed	1
a	1
little	1
season.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
thrones,	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
judgment	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
beheaded	1
for	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
worshipped	1
the	1
beast,	1
neither	1
his	1
image,	1
neither	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
mark	1
upon	1
their	1
foreheads,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
they	1
lived	1
and	1
reigned	1
with	1
Christ	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
	1
20:5	1
But	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
lived	1
not	1
again	1
until	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
were	1
finished.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection.	1
	1
20:6	1
Blessed	1
and	1
holy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection:	1
on	1
such	1
the	1
second	1
death	1
hath	1
no	1
power,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
priests	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
shall	1
reign	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
are	1
expired,	1
Satan	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
prison,	1
20:8	1
And	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
deceive	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Gog,	1
and	1
Magog,	1
to	1
gather	1
them	1
together	1
to	1
battle:	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
whom	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
compassed	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
beloved	1
city:	1
and	1
fire	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
devoured	1
them.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
that	1
deceived	1
them	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone,	1
where	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
the	1
false	1
prophet	1
are,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
tormented	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
white	1
throne,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
it,	1
from	1
whose	1
face	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
fled	1
away;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
found	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
dead,	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
stand	1
before	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
opened:	1
and	1
another	1
book	1
was	1
opened,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life:	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
were	1
judged	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
books,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
death	1
and	1
hell	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
judged	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
death	1
and	1
hell	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
whosoever	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
heaven	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
earth	1
were	1
passed	1
away;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
sea.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
I	1
John	1
saw	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
new	1
Jerusalem,	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
prepared	1
as	1
a	1
bride	1
adorned	1
for	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
dwell	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
God	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
God	1
shall	1
wipe	1
away	1
all	1
tears	1
from	1
their	1
eyes;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
death,	1
neither	1
sorrow,	1
nor	1
crying,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
pain:	1
for	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
are	1
passed	1
away.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
new.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write:	1
for	1
these	1
words	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
faithful.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
It	1
is	1
done.	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end.	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
athirst	1
of	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
life	1
freely.	1
	1
21:7	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh	1
shall	1
inherit	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
21:8	1
But	1
the	1
fearful,	1
and	1
unbelieving,	1
and	1
the	1
abominable,	1
and	1
murderers,	1
and	1
whoremongers,	1
and	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
idolaters,	1
and	1
all	1
liars,	1
shall	1
have	1
their	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
lake	1
which	1
burneth	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone:	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
last	1
plagues,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
hither,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
bride,	1
the	1
Lamb's	1
wife.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
the	1
holy	1
Jerusalem,	1
descending	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
God,	1
21:11	1
Having	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
her	1
light	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
stone	1
most	1
precious,	1
even	1
like	1
a	1
jasper	1
stone,	1
clear	1
as	1
crystal;	1
21:12	1
And	1
had	1
a	1
wall	1
great	1
and	1
high,	1
and	1
had	1
twelve	1
gates,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
twelve	1
angels,	1
and	1
names	1
written	1
thereon,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
21:13	1
On	1
the	1
east	1
three	1
gates;	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
three	1
gates;	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
three	1
gates;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
three	1
gates.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
twelve	1
foundations,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
had	1
a	1
golden	1
reed	1
to	1
measure	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
lieth	1
foursquare,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
is	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
breadth:	1
and	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
reed,	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
furlongs.	1
	1
The	1
length	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
equal.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
cubits,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
the	1
angel.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
jasper:	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
pure	1
gold,	1
like	1
unto	1
clear	1
glass.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
were	1
garnished	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
stones.	1
The	1
first	1
foundation	1
was	1
jasper;	1
the	1
second,	1
sapphire;	1
the	1
third,	1
a	1
chalcedony;	1
the	1
fourth,	1
an	1
emerald;	1
21:20	1
The	1
fifth,	1
sardonyx;	1
the	1
sixth,	1
sardius;	1
the	1
seventh,	1
chrysolyte;	1
the	1
eighth,	1
beryl;	1
the	1
ninth,	1
a	1
topaz;	1
the	1
tenth,	1
a	1
chrysoprasus;	1
the	1
eleventh,	1
a	1
jacinth;	1
the	1
twelfth,	1
an	1
amethyst.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
the	1
twelve	1
gates	1
were	1
twelve	1
pearls:	1
every	1
several	1
gate	1
was	1
of	1
one	1
pearl:	1
and	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
pure	1
gold,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
transparent	1
glass.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
temple	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
to	1
shine	1
in	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
lighten	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
saved	1
shall	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
bring	1
their	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
day:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
night	1
there.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
enter	1
into	1
it	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
defileth,	1
neither	1
whatsoever	1
worketh	1
abomination,	1
or	1
maketh	1
a	1
lie:	1
but	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
Lamb's	1
book	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
me	1
a	1
pure	1
river	1
of	1
water	1
of	1
life,	1
clear	1
as	1
crystal,	1
proceeding	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
22:2	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
bare	1
twelve	1
manner	1
of	1
fruits,	1
and	1
yielded	1
her	1
fruit	1
every	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
healing	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
curse:	1
but	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
shall	1
serve	1
him:	1
22:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
face;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
night	1
there;	1
and	1
they	1
need	1
no	1
candle,	1
neither	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun;	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
giveth	1
them	1
light:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
sayings	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
true:	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
sent	1
his	1
angel	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
22:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly:	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
I	1
John	1
saw	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
heard	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen,	1
I	1
fell	1
down	1
to	1
worship	1
before	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
shewed	1
me	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
See	1
thou	1
do	1
it	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
this	1
book:	1
worship	1
God.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Seal	1
not	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
22:11	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unjust,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
unjust	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
filthy,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
filthy	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
righteous,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
righteous	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holy,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
holy	1
still.	1
	1
22:12	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly;	1
and	1
my	1
reward	1
is	1
with	1
me,	1
to	1
give	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
his	1
work	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
22:13	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last.	1
	1
22:14	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
do	1
his	1
commandments,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
may	1
enter	1
in	1

	1
22:15	1
For	1
without	1

dogs,	1
and	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
whoremongers,	1
and	1
murderers,	1
and	1
idolaters,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
loveth	1
and	1
maketh	1
a	1
lie.	1
	1
22:16	1
I	1
Jesus	1
have	1
sent	1
mine	1
angel	1
to	1
testify	1
unto	1
you	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
the	1

I	1
am	1

and	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
and	1
morning	1
star.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
the	1
bride	1
say,	1
Come.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
heareth	1
say,	1
Come.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
athirst	1
come.	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
life	1
freely.	1
	1
22:18	1
For	1
I	1
testify	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1

If	1

add	1
unto	1
him	1

that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1

22:19	1

man	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1

the	1
words	1

The	1

Moses:	1

Called	1
Genesis	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
God	1
created	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
without	1
form,	1
and	1
void;	1
and	1
darkness	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
deep.	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
moved	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
light:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
light.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
God	1
saw	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good:	1
and	1
God	1
divided	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
God	1
called	1
the	1
light	1
Day,	1
and	1
the	1
darkness	1
he	1
called	1
Night.	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
day.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
firmament	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
divide	1
the	1
waters	1
from	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
God	1
made	1
the	1
firmament,	1
and	1
divided	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
firmament	1
from	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
were	1
above	1
the	1
firmament:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
God	1
called	1
the	1
firmament	1
Heaven.	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
second	1
day.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
waters	1
under	1
the	1
heaven	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
one	1
place,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
appear:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
God	1
called	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
Earth;	1
and	1
the	1
gathering	1
together	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
called	1
he	1
Seas:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
earth	1
bring	1
forth	1
grass,	1
the	1
herb	1
yielding	1
seed,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
tree	1
yielding	1
fruit	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
whose	1
seed	1
is	1
in	1
itself,	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
brought	1
forth	1
grass,	1
and	1
herb	1
yielding	1
seed	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1

	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
night;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
for	1
signs,	1
and	1
for	1
seasons,	1
and	1
for	1
days,	1
and	1
years:	1
1:15	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
for	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
to	1
give	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
God	1
made	1
two	1
great	1
lights;	1
the	1
greater	1
light	1
to	1
rule	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
lesser	1
light	1
to	1
rule	1
the	1
night:	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
stars	1
also.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
God	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
to	1
give	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
1:18	1
And	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
darkness:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
fourth	1
day.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
waters	1
bring	1
forth	1
abundantly	1
the	1
moving	1
creature	1
that	1
hath	1
life,	1
and	1
fowl	1
that	1
may	1
fly	1
above	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
firmament	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
God	1
created	1
great	1
whales,	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
moveth,	1
which	1
the	1
waters	1
brought	1
forth	1
abundantly,	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
and	1
every	1
winged	1
fowl	1
after	1
his	1
kind:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
God	1
blessed	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Be	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply,	1
and	1
fill	1
the	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
let	1
fowl	1
multiply	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
fifth	1
day.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
earth	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
cattle,	1
and	1
creeping	1
thing,	1
and	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
God	1
made	1
the	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
and	1
cattle	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
make	1
man	1
in	1
our	1
image,	1
after	1
our	1
likeness:	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
cattle,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
over	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:27	1
So	1
God	1
created	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
image,	1
in	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
created	1
he	1
him;	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
created	1
he	1
them.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
God	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply,	1
and	1
replenish	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
subdue	1
it:	1
and	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
over	1
every	1
living	1
thing	1
that	1
moveth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
every	1
herb	1
bearing	1
seed,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
every	1
tree,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
yielding	1
seed;	1
to	1
you	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
meat.	1
	1
1:30	1
And	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
wherein	1
there	1
is	1
life,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
every	1
green	1
herb	1
for	1
meat:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
God	1
saw	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
good.	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
sixth	1
day.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thus	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
were	1
finished,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
God	1
ended	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made;	1
and	1
he	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
God	1
blessed	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
it:	1
because	1
that	1
in	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
rested	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
God	1
created	1
and	1
made.	1
	1
2:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
created,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heavens,	1
2:5	1
And	1
every	1
plant	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
before	1
it	1
grew:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
had	1
not	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
there	1
went	1
up	1
a	1
mist	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
watered	1
the	1
whole	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
formed	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
breathed	1
into	1
his	1
nostrils	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
man	1
became	1
a	1
living	1
soul.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
planted	1
a	1
garden	1
eastward	1
in	1
Eden;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
formed.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
made	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
to	1
grow	1
every	1
tree	1
that	1
is	1
pleasant	1
to	1
the	1
sight,	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
food;	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
a	1
river	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Eden	1
to	1
water	1
the	1
garden;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
it	1
was	1
parted,	1
and	1
became	1
into	1
four	1
heads.	1
	1
2:11	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
Pison:	1
that	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
compasseth	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
of	1
Havilah,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
gold;	1
2:12	1
And	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
is	1
good:	1
there	1
is	1
bdellium	1
and	1
the	1
onyx	1
stone.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
river	1
is	1
Gihon:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
compasseth	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
of	1
Ethiopia.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
river	1
is	1
Hiddekel:	1
that	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
goeth	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
river	1
is	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
took	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
to	1
dress	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
commanded	1
the	1
man,	1
saying,	1
Of	1
every	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
thou	1
mayest	1
freely	1
eat:	1
2:17	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
it:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
eatest	1
thereof	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
alone;	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
an	1
help	1
meet	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
formed	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
every	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
Adam	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
them:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
Adam	1
called	1
every	1
living	1
creature,	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
Adam	1
gave	1
names	1
to	1
all	1
cattle,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
but	1
for	1
Adam	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
an	1
help	1
meet	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
caused	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
Adam,	1
and	1
he	1
slept:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
ribs,	1
and	1
closed	1
up	1
the	1
flesh	1
instead	1
thereof;	1
2:22	1
And	1
the	1
rib,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
man,	1
made	1
he	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
unto	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
Adam	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
now	1
bone	1
of	1
my	1
bones,	1
and	1
flesh	1
of	1
my	1
flesh:	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
Woman,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
Man.	1
	1
2:24	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
cleave	1
unto	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
naked,	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
ashamed.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
the	1
serpent	1
was	1
more	1
subtil	1
than	1
any	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
had	1
made.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Yea,	1
hath	1
God	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
every	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
garden?	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
serpent,	1
We	1
may	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
garden:	1
3:3	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
God	1
hath	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
it,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
touch	1
it,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
serpent	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
surely	1
die:	1
3:5	1
For	1
God	1
doth	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
ye	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
then	1
your	1
eyes	1
shall	1
be	1
opened,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
gods,	1
knowing	1
good	1
and	1
evil.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
tree	1
was	1
good	1
for	1
food,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
a	1
tree	1
to	1
be	1
desired	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
wise,	1
she	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
gave	1
also	1
unto	1
her	1
husband	1
with	1
her;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
them	1
both	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
naked;	1
and	1
they	1
sewed	1
fig	1
leaves	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
themselves	1
aprons.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
and	1
Adam	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hid	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
amongst	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
called	1
unto	1
Adam,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
heard	1
thy	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
naked;	1
and	1
I	1
hid	1
myself.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
told	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
naked?	1
Hast	1
thou	1
eaten	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
whereof	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
eat?	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said,	1
The	1
woman	1
whom	1
thou	1
gavest	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
me,	1
she	1
gave	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done?	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
The	1
serpent	1
beguiled	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
serpent,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this,	1
thou	1
art	1
cursed	1
above	1
all	1
cattle,	1
and	1
above	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
upon	1
thy	1
belly	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go,	1
and	1
dust	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life:	1
3:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
enmity	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
between	1
thy	1
seed	1
and	1
her	1
seed;	1
it	1
shall	1
bruise	1
thy	1
head,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bruise	1
his	1
heel.	1
	1
3:16	1
Unto	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
greatly	1
multiply	1
thy	1
sorrow	1
and	1
thy	1
conception;	1
in	1
sorrow	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
forth	1
children;	1
and	1
thy	1
desire	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
thy	1
husband,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
thee.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
unto	1
Adam	1
he	1
said,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
hast	1
eaten	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
it:	1
cursed	1
is	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
thy	1
sake;	1
in	1
sorrow	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life;	1
3:18	1
Thorns	1
also	1
and	1
thistles	1
shall	1
it	1
bring	1
forth	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
the	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
3:19	1
In	1
the	1
sweat	1
of	1
thy	1
face	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
bread,	1
till	1
thou	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
ground;	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
wast	1
thou	1
taken:	1
for	1
dust	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
unto	1
dust	1
shalt	1
thou	1
return.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
Adam	1
called	1
his	1
wife's	1
name	1
Eve;	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
all	1
living.	1
	1
3:21	1
Unto	1
Adam	1
also	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
did	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
make	1
coats	1
of	1
skins,	1
and	1
clothed	1
them.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
become	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
us,	1
to	1
know	1
good	1
and	1
evil:	1
and	1
now,	1
lest	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
take	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
eat,	1
and	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
3:23	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
sent	1
him	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden,	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
3:24	1
So	1
he	1
drove	1
out	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
Cherubims,	1
and	1
a	1
flaming	1
sword	1
which	1
turned	1
every	1
way,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
Adam	1
knew	1
Eve	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Cain,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
gotten	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
she	1
again	1
bare	1
his	1
brother	1
Abel.	1
And	1
Abel	1
was	1
a	1
keeper	1
of	1
sheep,	1
but	1
Cain	1
was	1
a	1
tiller	1
of	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
Cain	1
brought	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Abel,	1
he	1
also	1
brought	1
of	1
the	1
firstlings	1
of	1
his	1
flock	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
thereof.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
Abel	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
offering:	1
4:5	1
But	1
unto	1
Cain	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
offering	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
respect.	1
And	1
Cain	1
was	1
very	1
wroth,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
fell.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Cain,	1
Why	1
art	1
thou	1
wroth?	1
and	1
why	1
is	1
thy	1
countenance	1
fallen?	1
	1
4:7	1
If	1
thou	1
doest	1
well,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
be	1
accepted?	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
doest	1
not	1
well,	1
sin	1
lieth	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
And	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
desire,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rule	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
Cain	1
talked	1
with	1
Abel	1
his	1
brother:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
that	1
Cain	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
Abel	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Cain,	1
Where	1
is	1
Abel	1
thy	1
brother?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
not:	1
Am	1
I	1
my	1
brother's	1
keeper?	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
brother's	1
blood	1
crieth	1
unto	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
now	1
art	1
thou	1
cursed	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
hath	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
to	1
receive	1
thy	1
brother's	1
blood	1
from	1
thy	1
hand;	1
4:12	1
When	1
thou	1
tillest	1
the	1
ground,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
henceforth	1
yield	1
unto	1
thee	1
her	1
strength;	1
a	1
fugitive	1
and	1
a	1
vagabond	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
Cain	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
My	1
punishment	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
bear.	1
	1
4:14	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
driven	1
me	1
out	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
face	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
hid;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fugitive	1
and	1
a	1
vagabond	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
findeth	1
me	1
shall	1
slay	1
me.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Therefore	1
whosoever	1
slayeth	1
Cain,	1
vengeance	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
on	1
him	1
sevenfold.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
set	1
a	1
mark	1
upon	1
Cain,	1
lest	1
any	1
finding	1
him	1
should	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
Cain	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nod,	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Eden.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
Cain	1
knew	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Enoch:	1
and	1
he	1
builded	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
son,	1
Enoch.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
unto	1
Enoch	1
was	1
born	1
Irad:	1
and	1
Irad	1
begat	1
Mehujael:	1
and	1
Mehujael	1
begat	1
Methusael:	1
and	1
Methusael	1
begat	1
Lamech.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
Lamech	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
wives:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Adah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Zillah.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
Adah	1
bare	1
Jabal:	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
dwell	1
in	1
tents,	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
cattle.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
his	1
brother's	1
name	1
was	1
Jubal:	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
handle	1
the	1
harp	1
and	1
organ.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
Zillah,	1
she	1
also	1
bare	1
Tubalcain,	1
an	1
instructer	1
of	1
every	1
artificer	1
in	1
brass	1
and	1
iron:	1
and	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Tubalcain	1
was	1
Naamah.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
Lamech	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
wives,	1
Adah	1
and	1
Zillah,	1
Hear	1
my	1
voice;	1
ye	1
wives	1
of	1
Lamech,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
speech:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
slain	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
my	1
wounding,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
my	1
hurt.	1
	1
4:24	1
If	1
Cain	1
shall	1
be	1
avenged	1
sevenfold,	1
truly	1
Lamech	1
seventy	1
and	1
sevenfold.	1
	1
4:25	1
And	1
Adam	1
knew	1
his	1
wife	1
again;	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Seth:	1
For	1
God,	1
said	1
she,	1
hath	1
appointed	1
me	1
another	1
seed	1
instead	1
of	1
Abel,	1
whom	1
Cain	1
slew.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
to	1
Seth,	1
to	1
him	1
also	1
there	1
was	1
born	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Enos:	1
then	1
began	1
men	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:1	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Adam.	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
God	1

man,	1
in	1
the	1

them,	1

concerning	1
our	1
work	1
and	1
toil	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1

which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
cursed.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1

Shem,	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
multiply	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
daughters	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
them,	1
6:2	1
That	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
saw	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
fair;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
them	1
wives	1
of	1
all	1
which	1
they	1
chose.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
My	1
spirit	1
shall	1
not	1
always	1
strive	1
with	1
man,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
flesh:	1
yet	1
his	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
years.	1
	1
6:4	1
There	1
were	1
giants	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
those	1
days;	1
and	1
also	1
after	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
bare	1
children	1
to	1
them,	1
the	1
same	1
became	1
mighty	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
old,	1
men	1
of	1
renown.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
man	1
was	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
every	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
only	1
evil	1
continually.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
it	1
repented	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
grieved	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
both	1
man,	1
and	1
beast,	1
and	1
the	1
creeping	1
thing,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air;	1
for	1
it	1
repenteth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
them.	1
	1
6:8	1
But	1
Noah	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:9	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Noah:	1
Noah	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
and	1
perfect	1
in	1
his	1
generations,	1
and	1
Noah	1
walked	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
Noah	1
begat	1
three	1
sons,	1
Shem,	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth.	1
	1
6:11	1
The	1
earth	1
also	1
was	1
corrupt	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
violence.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
God	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
corrupt;	1
for	1
all	1
flesh	1
had	1
corrupted	1
his	1
way	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
The	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
come	1
before	1
me;	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
violence	1
through	1
them;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:14	1
Make	1
thee	1
an	1
ark	1
of	1
gopher	1
wood;	1
rooms	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
shalt	1
pitch	1
it	1
within	1
and	1
without	1
with	1
pitch.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fashion	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
it	1
of:	1
The	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
shall	1
be	1
three	1
hundred	1
cubits,	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
it	1
fifty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
it	1
thirty	1
cubits.	1
	1
6:16	1
A	1
window	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
to	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
cubit	1
shalt	1
thou	1
finish	1
it	1
above;	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
shalt	1
thou	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
thereof;	1
with	1
lower,	1
second,	1
and	1
third	1
stories	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
it.	1
	1
6:17	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
do	1
bring	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
waters	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
flesh,	1
wherein	1
is	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life,	1
from	1
under	1
heaven;	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
6:18	1
But	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
wives	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
of	1
every	1
living	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
two	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
alive	1
with	1
thee;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
male	1
and	1
female.	1
	1
6:20	1
Of	1
fowls	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
and	1
of	1
cattle	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
of	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
two	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
alive.	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
take	1
thou	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
all	1
food	1
that	1
is	1
eaten,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
gather	1
it	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
food	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
6:22	1
Thus	1
did	1
Noah;	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
God	1
commanded	1
him,	1
so	1
did	1
he.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
Come	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
house	1
into	1
the	1
ark;	1
for	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
righteous	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
7:2	1
Of	1
every	1
clean	1
beast	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
to	1
thee	1
by	1
sevens,	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
his	1
female:	1
and	1
of	1
beasts	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
clean	1
by	1
two,	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
his	1
female.	1
	1
7:3	1
Of	1
fowls	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
by	1
sevens,	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
the	1
female;	1
to	1
keep	1
seed	1
alive	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:4	1
For	1
yet	1
seven	1
days,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights;	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
substance	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
Noah	1
did	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
Noah	1
was	1
six	1
hundred	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
waters	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
Noah	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
wives	1
with	1
him,	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
7:8	1
Of	1
clean	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
beasts	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
clean,	1
and	1
of	1
fowls,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
7:9	1
There	1
went	1
in	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
unto	1
Noah	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
the	1
female,	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
commanded	1
Noah.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
seven	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
flood	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:11	1
In	1
the	1
six	1
hundredth	1
year	1
of	1
Noah's	1
life,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
deep	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
heaven	1
were	1
opened.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights.	1
	1
7:13	1
In	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day	1
entered	1
Noah,	1
and	1
Shem,	1
and	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah,	1
and	1
Noah's	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
wives	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
with	1
them,	1
into	1
the	1
ark;	1
7:14	1
They,	1
and	1
every	1
beast	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
and	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
and	1
every	1
fowl	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
every	1
bird	1
of	1
every	1
sort.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Noah	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
wherein	1
is	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
went	1
in,	1
went	1
in	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
commanded	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shut	1
him	1
in.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
the	1
flood	1
was	1
forty	1
days	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
increased,	1
and	1
bare	1
up	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
lift	1
up	1
above	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
prevailed,	1
and	1
were	1
increased	1
greatly	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
went	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
prevailed	1
exceedingly	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
high	1
hills,	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven,	1
were	1
covered.	1
	1
7:20	1
Fifteen	1
cubits	1
upward	1
did	1
the	1
waters	1
prevail;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
covered.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
all	1
flesh	1
died	1
that	1
moved	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
both	1
of	1
fowl,	1
and	1
of	1
cattle,	1
and	1
of	1
beast,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
every	1
man:	1
7:22	1
All	1
in	1
whose	1
nostrils	1
was	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
dry	1
land,	1
died.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
every	1
living	1
substance	1
was	1
destroyed	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
both	1
man,	1
and	1
cattle,	1
and	1
the	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
heaven;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
destroyed	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
Noah	1
only	1
remained	1
alive,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
days.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
God	1
remembered	1
Noah,	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
thing,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ark:	1
and	1
God	1
made	1
a	1
wind	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
asswaged;	1
8:2	1
The	1
fountains	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
heaven	1
were	1
stopped,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
from	1
heaven	1
was	1
restrained;	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
returned	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth	1
continually:	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
days	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
abated.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
rested	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Ararat.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
decreased	1
continually	1
until	1
the	1
tenth	1
month:	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
were	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
seen.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
forty	1
days,	1
that	1
Noah	1
opened	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made:	1
8:7	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
a	1
raven,	1
which	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
until	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
dried	1
up	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:8	1
Also	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
a	1
dove	1
from	1
him,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
abated	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ground;	1
8:9	1
But	1
the	1
dove	1
found	1
no	1
rest	1
for	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
her	1
foot,	1
and	1
she	1
returned	1
unto	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth:	1
then	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
pulled	1
her	1
in	1
unto	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
he	1
stayed	1
yet	1
other	1
seven	1
days;	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
the	1
dove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ark;	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
dove	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
in	1
her	1
mouth	1
was	1
an	1
olive	1
leaf	1
pluckt	1
off:	1
so	1
Noah	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
abated	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
stayed	1
yet	1
other	1
seven	1
days;	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
the	1
dove;	1
which	1
returned	1
not	1
again	1
unto	1
him	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
six	1
hundredth	1
and	1
first	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
dried	1
up	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
Noah	1
removed	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
dry.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
seven	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
was	1
the	1
earth	1
dried.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
saying,	1
8:16	1
Go	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
wives	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
8:17	1
Bring	1
forth	1
with	1
thee	1
every	1
living	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
both	1
of	1
fowl,	1
and	1
of	1
cattle,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
breed	1
abundantly	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
be	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
Noah	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
wives	1
with	1
him:	1
8:19	1
Every	1
beast,	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing,	1
and	1
every	1
fowl,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
after	1
their	1
kinds,	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
Noah	1
builded	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
took	1
of	1
every	1
clean	1
beast,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
clean	1
fowl,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
on	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
smelled	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
again	1
curse	1
the	1
ground	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
man's	1
sake;	1
for	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
man's	1
heart	1
is	1
evil	1
from	1
his	1
youth;	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
again	1
smite	1
any	1
more	1
every	1
thing	1
living,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done.	1
	1
8:22	1
While	1
the	1
earth	1
remaineth,	1
seedtime	1
and	1
harvest,	1
and	1
cold	1
and	1
heat,	1
and	1
summer	1
and	1
winter,	1
and	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
shall	1
not	1
cease.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
God	1
blessed	1
Noah	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply,	1
and	1
replenish	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
moveth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
into	1
your	1
hand	1
are	1
they	1
delivered.	1
	1
9:3	1
Every	1
moving	1
thing	1
that	1
liveth	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
you;	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
green	1
herb	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
you	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
9:4	1
But	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
thereof,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
eat.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
surely	1
your	1
blood	1
of	1
your	1
lives	1
will	1
I	1
require;	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
every	1
beast	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
it,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
man;	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
every	1
man's	1
brother	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
9:6	1
Whoso	1
sheddeth	1
man's	1
blood,	1
by	1
man	1
shall	1
his	1
blood	1
be	1
shed:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
made	1
he	1
man.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
you,	1
be	1
ye	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply;	1
bring	1
forth	1
abundantly	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
multiply	1
therein.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons	1
with	1
him,	1
saying,	1
9:9	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
seed	1
after	1
you;	1
9:10	1
And	1
with	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
you,	1
of	1
the	1
fowl,	1
of	1
the	1
cattle,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
you;	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
you,	1
neither	1
shall	1
all	1
flesh	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
any	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
a	1
flood;	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
any	1
more	1
be	1
a	1
flood	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
you,	1
for	1
perpetual	1
generations:	1
9:13	1
I	1
do	1
set	1
my	1
bow	1
in	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
of	1
a	1
covenant	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I	1
bring	1
a	1
cloud	1
over	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
the	1
bow	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
cloud:	1
9:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
my	1
covenant,	1
which	1
is	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
of	1
all	1
flesh;	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
become	1
a	1
flood	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
flesh.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
bow	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
cloud;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
upon	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
remember	1
the	1
everlasting	1
covenant	1
between	1
God	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
of	1
all	1
flesh	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
established	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah,	1
that	1
went	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
were	1
Shem,	1
and	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth:	1
and	1
Ham	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
9:19	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
three	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah:	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
overspread.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
Noah	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
husbandman,	1
and	1
he	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard:	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
drank	1
of	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
was	1
drunken;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
uncovered	1
within	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
Ham,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
saw	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
told	1
his	1
two	1
brethren	1
without.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Shem	1
and	1
Japheth	1
took	1
a	1
garment,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
both	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
went	1
backward,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
their	1
father;	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
backward,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
not	1
their	1
father's	1
nakedness.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
Noah	1
awoke	1
from	1
his	1
wine,	1
and	1
knew	1
what	1
his	1
younger	1
son	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
Canaan;	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
servants	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Shem;	1
and	1
Canaan	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
9:27	1
God	1
shall	1
enlarge	1
Japheth,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Shem;	1
and	1
Canaan	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
Noah	1
lived	1
after	1
the	1
flood	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noah	1
were	1
nine	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years:	1
and	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah,	1
Shem,	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth:	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
were	1
sons	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
10:2	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Japheth;	1
Gomer,	1
and	1
Magog,	1
and	1
Madai,	1
and	1
Javan,	1
and	1
Tubal,	1
and	1
Meshech,	1
and	1
Tiras.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Gomer;	1
Ashkenaz,	1
and	1
Riphath,	1
and	1
Togarmah.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Javan;	1
Elishah,	1
and	1
Tarshish,	1
Kittim,	1
and	1
Dodanim.	1
	1
10:5	1
By	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
divided	1
in	1
their	1
lands;	1
every	1
one	1
after	1
his	1
tongue,	1
after	1
their	1
families,	1
in	1
their	1
nations.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ham;	1
Cush,	1
and	1
Mizraim,	1
and	1
Phut,	1
and	1
Canaan.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Cush;	1
Seba,	1
and	1
Havilah,	1
and	1
Sabtah,	1
and	1
Raamah,	1
and	1
Sabtechah:	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Raamah;	1
Sheba,	1
and	1
Dedan.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
Cush	1
begat	1
Nimrod:	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mighty	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
10:9	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
hunter	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
Even	1
as	1
Nimrod	1
the	1
mighty	1
hunter	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
was	1
Babel,	1
and	1
Erech,	1
and	1
Accad,	1
and	1
Calneh,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar.	1
	1
10:11	1
Out	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
went	1
forth	1
Asshur,	1
and	1
builded	1
Nineveh,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
Rehoboth,	1
and	1
Calah,	1
10:12	1
And	1
Resen	1
between	1
Nineveh	1
and	1
Calah:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
city.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
Mizraim	1
begat	1
Ludim,	1
and	1
Anamim,	1
and	1
Lehabim,	1
and	1
Naphtuhim,	1
10:14	1
And	1
Pathrusim,	1
and	1
Casluhim,	1
(out	1
of	1
whom	1
came	1
Philistim,)	1
and	1
Caphtorim.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
Canaan	1
begat	1
Sidon	1
his	1
first	1
born,	1
and	1
Heth,	1
10:16	1
And	1

10:17	1
And	1

And	1

the	1
Hamathite:	1
and	1
afterward	1
were	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
spread	1
abroad.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
was	1
from	1
Sidon,	1
as	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
Gerar,	1
unto	1
Gaza;	1
as	1
thou	1
goest,	1
unto	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
Admah,	1
and	1
Zeboim,	1
even	1
unto	1
Lasha.	1
	1
10:20	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ham,	1
after	1
their	1
families,	1
after	1
their	1
tongues,	1
in	1
their	1
countries,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
nations.	1
	1
10:21	1
Unto	1
Shem	1
also,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Eber,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Japheth	1
the	1
elder,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
were	1
children	1
born.	1
	1
10:22	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
Shem;	1
Elam,	1
and	1
Asshur,	1
and	1
Arphaxad,	1
and	1
Lud,	1
and	1
Aram.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Aram;	1
Uz,	1
and	1
Hul,	1
and	1
Gether,	1
and	1
Mash.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
Arphaxad	1
begat	1
Salah;	1
and	1
Salah	1
begat	1
Eber.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
unto	1
Eber	1
were	1
born	1
two	1
sons:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
one	1
was	1
Peleg;	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
days	1
was	1
the	1
earth	1
divided;	1
and	1
his	1
brother's	1
name	1
was	1
Joktan.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
Joktan	1
begat	1
Almodad,	1
and	1
Sheleph,	1
and	1
Hazarmaveth,	1
and	1
Jerah,	1
10:27	1
And	1
Hadoram,	1
and	1
Uzal,	1
and	1
Diklah,	1
10:28	1
And	1
Obal,	1
and	1
Abimael,	1
and	1
Sheba,	1
10:29	1
And	1
Ophir,	1
and	1
Havilah,	1
and	1
Jobab:	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joktan.	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
their	1
dwelling	1
was	1
from	1
Mesha,	1
as	1
thou	1
goest	1
unto	1
Sephar	1
a	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
10:31	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Shem,	1
after	1
their	1
families,	1
after	1
their	1
tongues,	1
in	1
their	1
lands,	1
after	1
their	1
nations.	1
	1
10:32	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah,	1
after	1
their	1
generations,	1
in	1
their	1
nations:	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
nations	1
divided	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
was	1
of	1
one	1
language,	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
speech.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
journeyed	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
plain	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar;	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
there.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Go	1
to,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
brick,	1
and	1
burn	1
them	1
thoroughly.	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
brick	1
for	1
stone,	1
and	1
slime	1
had	1
they	1
for	1
morter.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Go	1
to,	1
let	1
us	1
build	1
us	1
a	1
city	1
and	1
a	1
tower,	1
whose	1
top	1
may	1
reach	1
unto	1
heaven;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
us	1
a	1
name,	1
lest	1
we	1
be	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
the	1
tower,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
builded.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
all	1
one	1
language;	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
begin	1
to	1
do:	1
and	1
now	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
restrained	1
from	1
them,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
imagined	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
11:7	1
Go	1
to,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
there	1
confound	1
their	1
language,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
understand	1
one	1
another's	1
speech.	1
	1
11:8	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
scattered	1
them	1
abroad	1
from	1
thence	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
off	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:9	1
Therefore	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
called	1
Babel;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
there	1
confound	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
did	1
the	1
LORD	1
scatter	1
them	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:10	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Shem:	1
Shem	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
begat	1
Arphaxad	1
two	1
years	1
after	1
the	1
flood:	1
11:11	1
And	1
Shem	1
lived	1
after	1
he	1
begat	1
Arphaxad	1
five	1
hundred	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
Arphaxad	1
lived	1

	1
11:26	1
And	1
Terah	1
lived	1
seventy	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
Abram,	1
Nahor,	1
and	1
Haran.	1
	1
11:27	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Terah:	1
Terah	1
begat	1
Abram,	1
Nahor,	1
and	1
Haran;	1
and	1
Haran	1
begat	1
Lot.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
Haran	1
died	1
before	1
his	1
father	1
Terah	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
nativity,	1
in	1
Ur	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
Abram	1
and	1
Nahor	1
took	1
them	1
wives:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Abram's	1
wife	1
was	1
Sarai;	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Nahor's	1
wife,	1
Milcah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Haran,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Milcah,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Iscah.	1
	1
11:30	1
But	1
Sarai	1
was	1
barren;	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
child.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
Terah	1
took	1
Abram	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
Lot	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Haran	1
his	1
son's	1
son,	1
and	1
Sarai	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
his	1
son	1
Abram's	1
wife;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
with	1
them	1
from	1
Ur	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees,	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
Haran,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
there.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Terah	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
five	1
years:	1
and	1
Terah	1
died	1
in	1
Haran.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee:	1
12:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
nation,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
name	1
great;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
blessing:	1
12:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
them	1
that	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
curse	1
him	1
that	1
curseth	1
thee:	1
and	1
in	1
thee	1
shall	1
all	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
12:4	1
So	1
Abram	1
departed,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
Lot	1
went	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
Abram	1
was	1
seventy	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
Haran.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
Abram	1
took	1
Sarai	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
Lot	1
his	1
brother's	1
son,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
substance	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
gathered,	1
and	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
gotten	1
in	1
Haran;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
they	1
came.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
Abram	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Sichem,	1
unto	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Moreh.	1
And	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
and	1
said,	1
Unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
this	1
land:	1
and	1
there	1
builded	1
he	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
he	1
removed	1
from	1
thence	1
unto	1
a	1
mountain	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent,	1
having	1
Bethel	1
on	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
Hai	1
on	1
the	1
east:	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
builded	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
Abram	1
journeyed,	1
going	1
on	1
still	1
toward	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
Abram	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there;	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
grievous	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Sarai	1
his	1
wife,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
fair	1
woman	1
to	1
look	1
upon:	1
12:12	1
Therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
see	1
thee,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
This	1
is	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
kill	1
me,	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
save	1
thee	1
alive.	1
	1
12:13	1
Say,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
sister:	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
sake;	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
live	1
because	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Abram	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
beheld	1
the	1
woman	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
fair.	1
	1
12:15	1
The	1
princes	1
also	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
saw	1
her,	1
and	1
commended	1
her	1
before	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
taken	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
house.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
he	1
entreated	1
Abram	1
well	1
for	1
her	1
sake:	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
sheep,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
he	1
asses,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
she	1
asses,	1
and	1
camels.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
plagued	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
his	1
house	1
with	1
great	1
plagues	1
because	1
of	1
Sarai	1
Abram's	1
wife.	1
	1
12:18	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
Abram	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
me?	1
why	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
thy	1
wife?	1
	1
12:19	1
Why	1
saidst	1
thou,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister?	1
so	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
her	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
wife:	1
now	1
therefore	1
behold	1
thy	1
wife,	1
take	1
her,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
commanded	1
his	1
men	1
concerning	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
Abram	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
Lot	1
with	1
him,	1
into	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
Abram	1
was	1
very	1
rich	1
in	1
cattle,	1
in	1
silver,	1
and	1
in	1
gold.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
journeys	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
even	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
his	1
tent	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
between	1
Bethel	1
and	1
Hai;	1
13:4	1
Unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
make	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
first:	1
and	1
there	1
Abram	1
called	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
Lot	1
also,	1
which	1
went	1
with	1
Abram,	1
had	1
flocks,	1
and	1
herds,	1
and	1
tents.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
dwell	1
together:	1
for	1
their	1
substance	1
was	1
great,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
dwell	1
together.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strife	1
between	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Abram's	1
cattle	1
and	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Lot's	1
cattle:	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzite	1
dwelled	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
Abram	1
said	1
unto	1
Lot,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
strife,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
between	1
my	1
herdmen	1
and	1
thy	1
herdmen;	1
for	1
we	1
be	1
brethren.	1
	1
13:9	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
before	1
thee?	1
separate	1
thyself,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
from	1
me:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
take	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
right;	1
or	1
if	1
thou	1
depart	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
Lot	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
beheld	1
all	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
watered	1
every	1
where,	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
destroyed	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
like	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
as	1
thou	1
comest	1
unto	1
Zoar.	1
	1
13:11	1
Then	1
Lot	1
chose	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
Lot	1
journeyed	1
east:	1
and	1
they	1
separated	1
themselves	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
13:12	1
Abram	1
dwelled	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
Lot	1
dwelled	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
toward	1
Sodom.	1
	1
13:13	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Sodom	1
were	1
wicked	1
and	1
sinners	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
after	1
that	1
Lot	1
was	1
separated	1
from	1
him,	1
Lift	1
up	1
now	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
look	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
art	1
northward,	1
and	1
southward,	1
and	1
eastward,	1
and	1
westward:	1
13:15	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
seest,	1
to	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
seed	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
number	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
then	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
also	1
be	1
numbered.	1
	1
13:17	1
Arise,	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
13:18	1
Then	1
Abram	1
removed	1
his	1
tent,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Mamre,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Amraphel	1
king	1
of	1
Shinar,	1
Arioch	1
king	1
of	1
Ellasar,	1
Chedorlaomer	1
king	1
of	1
Elam,	1
and	1
Tidal	1
king	1
of	1
nations;	1
14:2	1
That	1
these	1
made	1
war	1
with	1
Bera	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
with	1
Birsha	1
king	1
of	1
Gomorrah,	1
Shinab	1
king	1
of	1
Admah,	1
and	1
Shemeber	1
king	1
of	1
Zeboiim,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bela,	1
which	1
is	1
Zoar.	1
	1
14:3	1
All	1
these	1
were	1
joined	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Siddim,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
salt	1
sea.	1
	1
14:4	1
Twelve	1
years	1
they	1
served	1
Chedorlaomer,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
they	1
rebelled.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
came	1
Chedorlaomer,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Rephaims	1
in	1
Ashteroth	1
Karnaim,	1
and	1
the	1
Zuzims	1
in	1
Ham,	1
and	1
the	1
Emins	1
in	1
Shaveh	1
Kiriathaim,	1
14:6	1
And	1
the	1
Horites	1
in	1
their	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
unto	1
Elparan,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
they	1
returned,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Enmishpat,	1
which	1
is	1
Kadesh,	1
and	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Hazezontamar.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Admah,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Zeboiim,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bela	1
(the	1
same	1
is	1
Zoar;)	1
and	1
they	1
joined	1
battle	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Siddim;	1
14:9	1
With	1
Chedorlaomer	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Elam,	1
and	1
with	1
Tidal	1
king	1
of	1
nations,	1
and	1
Amraphel	1
king	1
of	1
Shinar,	1
and	1
Arioch	1
king	1
of	1
Ellasar;	1
four	1
kings	1
with	1
five.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Siddim	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
slimepits;	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah	1
fled,	1
and	1
fell	1
there;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
remained	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
mountain.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
goods	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
victuals,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Lot,	1
Abram's	1
brother's	1
son,	1
who	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
his	1
goods,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
escaped,	1
and	1
told	1
Abram	1
the	1
Hebrew;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Mamre	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
brother	1
of	1
Eshcol,	1
and	1
brother	1
of	1
Aner:	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
confederate	1
with	1
Abram.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
when	1
Abram	1
heard	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
taken	1
captive,	1
he	1
armed	1
his	1
trained	1
servants,	1
born	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
eighteen,	1
and	1
pursued	1
them	1
unto	1
Dan.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
himself	1
against	1
them,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
pursued	1
them	1
unto	1
Hobah,	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
of	1
Damascus.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
back	1
all	1
the	1
goods,	1
and	1
also	1
brought	1
again	1
his	1
brother	1
Lot,	1
and	1
his	1
goods,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
Chedorlaomer,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
at	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Shaveh,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
dale.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
Melchizedek	1
king	1
of	1
Salem	1
brought	1
forth	1
bread	1
and	1
wine:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
he	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
Abram	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
possessor	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth:	1
14:20	1
And	1
blessed	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
delivered	1
thine	1
enemies	1
into	1
thy	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
tithes	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
persons,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
goods	1
to	1
thyself.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
Abram	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
I	1
have	1
lift	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
14:23	1
That	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
from	1
a	1
thread	1
even	1
to	1
a	1
shoelatchet,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
thine,	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
Abram	1
rich:	1
14:24	1
Save	1
only	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
eaten,	1
and	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
went	1
with	1
me,	1
Aner,	1
Eshcol,	1
and	1
Mamre;	1
let	1
them	1
take	1
their	1
portion.	1
	1
15:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Abram	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
saying,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Abram:	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
shield,	1
and	1
thy	1
exceeding	1
great	1
reward.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
Abram	1
said,	1
LORD	1
God,	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
give	1
me,	1
seeing	1
I	1
go	1
childless,	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
my	1
house	1
is	1
this	1
Eliezer	1
of	1
Damascus?	1
15:3	1
And	1
Abram	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
to	1
me	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
no	1
seed:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
one	1
born	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
is	1
mine	1
heir.	1
	1
15:4	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
This	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thine	1
heir;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
bowels	1
shall	1
be	1
thine	1
heir.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
abroad,	1
and	1
said,	1
Look	1
now	1
toward	1
heaven,	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
stars,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
number	1
them:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
he	1
counted	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
Ur	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees,	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
this	1
land	1
to	1
inherit	1
it.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
LORD	1
God,	1
whereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
inherit	1
it?	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
me	1
an	1
heifer	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
a	1
she	1
goat	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
a	1
turtledove,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
pigeon.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
these,	1
and	1
divided	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
laid	1
each	1
piece	1
one	1
against	1
another:	1
but	1
the	1
birds	1
divided	1
he	1
not.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
fowls	1
came	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
carcases,	1
Abram	1
drove	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
going	1
down,	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
fell	1
upon	1
Abram;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
an	1
horror	1
of	1
great	1
darkness	1
fell	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
Know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
their's,	1
and	1
shall	1
serve	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
afflict	1
them	1
four	1
hundred	1
years;	1
15:14	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
nation,	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
serve,	1
will	1
I	1
judge:	1
and	1
afterward	1
shall	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
great	1
substance.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
to	1
thy	1
fathers	1
in	1
peace;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
old	1
age.	1
	1
15:16	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
hither	1
again:	1
for	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
full.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
dark,	1
behold	1
a	1
smoking	1
furnace,	1
and	1
a	1
burning	1
lamp	1
that	1
passed	1
between	1
those	1
pieces.	1
	1
15:18	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
Abram,	1
saying,	1
Unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
this	1
land,	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
river,	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates:	1
15:19	1
The	1
Kenites,	1
and	1
the	1
Kenizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Kadmonites,	1
15:20	1
And	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Rephaims,	1
15:21	1
And	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Girgashites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites.	1
	1
16:1	1
Now	1
Sarai	1
Abram's	1
wife	1
bare	1
him	1
no	1
children:	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
an	1
handmaid,	1
an	1
Egyptian,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Hagar.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
Sarai	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
restrained	1
me	1
from	1
bearing:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
my	1
maid;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
obtain	1
children	1
by	1
her.	1
And	1
Abram	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Sarai.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
Sarai	1
Abram's	1
wife	1
took	1
Hagar	1
her	1
maid	1
the	1
Egyptian,	1
after	1
Abram	1
had	1
dwelt	1
ten	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
Abram	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Hagar,	1
and	1
she	1
conceived:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
conceived,	1
her	1
mistress	1
was	1
despised	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
Sarai	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
My	1
wrong	1
be	1
upon	1
thee:	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
my	1
maid	1
into	1
thy	1
bosom;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
conceived,	1
I	1
was	1
despised	1
in	1
her	1
eyes:	1
the	1
LORD	1
judge	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
16:6	1
But	1
Abram	1
said	1
unto	1
Sarai,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
maid	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
hand;	1
do	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
it	1
pleaseth	1
thee.	1
And	1
when	1
Sarai	1
dealt	1
hardly	1
with	1
her,	1
she	1
fled	1
from	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
found	1
her	1
by	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
by	1
the	1
fountain	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Shur.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hagar,	1
Sarai's	1
maid,	1
whence	1
camest	1
thou?	1
and	1
whither	1
wilt	1
thou	1
go?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
my	1
mistress	1
Sarai.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Return	1
to	1
thy	1
mistress,	1
and	1
submit	1
thyself	1
under	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
thy	1
seed	1
exceedingly,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
numbered	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
with	1
child	1
and	1
shalt	1
bear	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Ishmael;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
heard	1
thy	1
affliction.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
wild	1
man;	1
his	1
hand	1
will	1
be	1
against	1
every	1
man,	1
and	1
every	1
man's	1
hand	1
against	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
she	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
spake	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
God	1
seest	1
me:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
Have	1
I	1
also	1
here	1
looked	1
after	1
him	1
that	1
seeth	1
me?	1
	1
16:14	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
well	1
was	1
called	1
Beerlahairoi;	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
between	1
Kadesh	1
and	1
Bered.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
Hagar	1
bare	1
Abram	1
a	1
son:	1
and	1
Abram	1
called	1
his	1
son's	1
name,	1
which	1
Hagar	1
bare,	1
Ishmael.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
Abram	1
was	1
fourscore	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
old,	1
when	1
Hagar	1
bare	1
Ishmael	1
to	1
Abram.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
when	1
Abram	1
was	1
ninety	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
nine,	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
to	1
Abram,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Almighty	1
God;	1
walk	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
perfect.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
covenant	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
multiply	1
thee	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
Abram	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face:	1
and	1
God	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
saying,	1
17:4	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
behold,	1
my	1
covenant	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations.	1
	1
17:5	1
Neither	1
shall	1
thy	1
name	1
any	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
Abram,	1
but	1
thy	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
Abraham;	1
for	1
a	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
thee.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
exceeding	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
nations	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
kings	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee	1
in	1
their	1
generations	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
God	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee,	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stranger,	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
possession;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
my	1
covenant	1
therefore,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee	1
in	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
17:10	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
covenant,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep,	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee;	1
Every	1
man	1
child	1
among	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
circumcised.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
circumcise	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
your	1
foreskin;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
you.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
eight	1
days	1
old	1
shall	1
be	1
circumcised	1
among	1
you,	1
every	1
man	1
child	1
in	1
your	1
generations,	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
or	1
bought	1
with	1
money	1
of	1
any	1
stranger,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
thy	1
seed.	1
	1
17:13	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
thy	1
house,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
bought	1
with	1
thy	1
money,	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
circumcised:	1
and	1
my	1
covenant	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
flesh	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
man	1
child	1
whose	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
foreskin	1
is	1
not	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
people;	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
my	1
covenant.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
As	1
for	1
Sarai	1
thy	1
wife,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
call	1
her	1
name	1
Sarai,	1
but	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
her	1
name	1
be.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
her,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
son	1
also	1
of	1
her:	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
mother	1
of	1
nations;	1
kings	1
of	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
17:17	1
Then	1
Abraham	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
laughed,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
Shall	1
a	1
child	1
be	1
born	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old?	1
and	1
shall	1
Sarah,	1
that	1
is	1
ninety	1
years	1
old,	1
bear?	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
O	1
that	1
Ishmael	1
might	1
live	1
before	1
thee!	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Sarah	1
thy	1
wife	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
a	1
son	1
indeed;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Isaac:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
Ishmael,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thee:	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
will	1
multiply	1
him	1
exceedingly;	1
twelve	1
princes	1
shall	1
he	1
beget,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
nation.	1
	1
17:21	1
But	1
my	1
covenant	1
will	1
I	1
establish	1
with	1
Isaac,	1
which	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
bear	1
unto	1
thee	1
at	1
this	1
set	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
year.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
off	1
talking	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
God	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Abraham.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
Abraham	1
took	1
Ishmael	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
born	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
bought	1
with	1
his	1
money,	1
every	1
male	1
among	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Abraham's	1
house;	1
and	1
circumcised	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
their	1
foreskin	1
in	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day,	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
Abraham	1
was	1
ninety	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
nine,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
circumcised	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
foreskin.	1
	1
17:25	1
And	1
Ishmael	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
thirteen	1
years	1
old,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
circumcised	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
foreskin.	1
	1
17:26	1
In	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day	1
was	1
Abraham	1
circumcised,	1
and	1
Ishmael	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
17:27	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
bought	1
with	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
stranger,	1
were	1
circumcised	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Mamre:	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
18:2	1
And	1
he	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
three	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them,	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
tent	1
door,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
toward	1
the	1
ground,	1
18:3	1
And	1
said,	1
My	1
LORD,	1
if	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
pass	1
not	1
away,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
from	1
thy	1
servant:	1
18:4	1
Let	1
a	1
little	1
water,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
be	1
fetched,	1
and	1
wash	1
your	1
feet,	1
and	1
rest	1
yourselves	1
under	1
the	1
tree:	1
18:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
fetch	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
comfort	1
ye	1
your	1
hearts;	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
pass	1
on:	1
for	1
therefore	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
to	1
your	1
servant.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
So	1
do,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
Abraham	1
hastened	1
into	1
the	1
tent	1
unto	1
Sarah,	1
and	1
said,	1
Make	1
ready	1
quickly	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
fine	1
meal,	1
knead	1
it,	1
and	1
make	1
cakes	1
upon	1
the	1
hearth.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
Abraham	1
ran	1
unto	1
the	1
herd,	1
and	1
fetcht	1
a	1
calf	1
tender	1
and	1
good,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
a	1
young	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
hasted	1
to	1
dress	1
it.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
butter,	1
and	1
milk,	1
and	1
the	1
calf	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
dressed,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
under	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
Sarah	1
thy	1
wife?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
in	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
certainly	1
return	1
unto	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
life;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
Sarah	1
thy	1
wife	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
And	1
Sarah	1
heard	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
door,	1
which	1
was	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
18:11	1
Now	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Sarah	1
were	1
old	1
and	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
age;	1
and	1
it	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Sarah	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
women.	1
	1
18:12	1
Therefore	1
Sarah	1
laughed	1
within	1
herself,	1
saying,	1
After	1
I	1
am	1
waxed	1
old	1
shall	1
I	1
have	1
pleasure,	1
my	1
lord	1
being	1
old	1
also?	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
Wherefore	1
did	1
Sarah	1
laugh,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
bear	1
a	1
child,	1
which	1
am	1
old?	1
	1
18:14	1
Is	1
any	1
thing	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
the	1
LORD?	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
thee,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
18:15	1
Then	1
Sarah	1
denied,	1
saying,	1
I	1
laughed	1
not;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
afraid.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
thou	1
didst	1
laugh.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
looked	1
toward	1
Sodom:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
went	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Shall	1
I	1
hide	1
from	1
Abraham	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
do;	1
18:18	1
Seeing	1
that	1
Abraham	1
shall	1
surely	1
become	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
mighty	1
nation,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
in	1
him?	1
18:19	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
command	1
his	1
children	1
and	1
his	1
household	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
do	1
justice	1
and	1
judgment;	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
may	1
bring	1
upon	1
Abraham	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah	1
is	1
great,	1
and	1
because	1
their	1
sin	1
is	1
very	1
grievous;	1
18:21	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
now,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
altogether	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
I	1
will	1
know.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
turned	1
their	1
faces	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
went	1
toward	1
Sodom:	1
but	1
Abraham	1
stood	1
yet	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
Abraham	1
drew	1
near,	1
and	1
said,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
also	1
destroy	1
the	1
righteous	1
with	1
the	1
wicked?	1
	1
18:24	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
be	1
fifty	1
righteous	1
within	1
the	1
city:	1
wilt	1
thou	1
also	1
destroy	1
and	1
not	1
spare	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
fifty	1
righteous	1
that	1
are	1
therein?	1
	1
18:25	1
That	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
thee	1
to	1
do	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
righteous	1
with	1
the	1
wicked:	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
wicked,	1
that	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
thee:	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
right?	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
If	1
I	1
find	1
in	1
Sodom	1
fifty	1
righteous	1
within	1
the	1
city,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
all	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
their	1
sakes.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
Abraham	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
am	1
but	1
dust	1
and	1
ashes:	1
18:28	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
shall	1
lack	1
five	1
of	1
the	1
fifty	1
righteous:	1
wilt	1
thou	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
five?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
I	1
find	1
there	1
forty	1
and	1
five,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
yet	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
forty	1
found	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
forty's	1
sake.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Oh	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
angry,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak:	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
shall	1
thirty	1
be	1
found	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
it,	1
if	1
I	1
find	1
thirty	1
there.	1
	1
18:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
twenty	1
found	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
destroy	1
it	1
for	1
twenty's	1
sake.	1
	1
18:32	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Oh	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
angry,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
yet	1
but	1
this	1
once:	1
Peradventure	1
ten	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
destroy	1
it	1
for	1
ten's	1
sake.	1
	1
18:33	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
communing	1
with	1
Abraham:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
two	1
angels	1
to	1
Sodom	1
at	1
even;	1
and	1
Lot	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Sodom:	1
and	1
Lot	1
seeing	1
them	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground;	1
19:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
my	1
lords,	1
turn	1
in,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
into	1
your	1
servant's	1
house,	1
and	1
tarry	1
all	1
night,	1
and	1
wash	1
your	1
feet,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
your	1
ways.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
all	1
night.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
pressed	1
upon	1
them	1
greatly;	1
and	1
they	1
turned	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
did	1
bake	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
19:4	1
But	1
before	1
they	1
lay	1
down,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
even	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
compassed	1
the	1
house	1
round,	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
every	1
quarter:	1
19:5	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
unto	1
Lot,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
thee	1
this	1
night?	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
unto	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
Lot	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
him,	1
19:7	1
And	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
wickedly.	1
	1
19:8	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
two	1
daughters	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
man;	1
let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
do	1
ye	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
your	1
eyes:	1
only	1
unto	1
these	1
men	1
do	1
nothing;	1
for	1
therefore	1
came	1
they	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
my	1
roof.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Stand	1
back.	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
again,	1
This	1
one	1
fellow	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
sojourn,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
needs	1
be	1
a	1
judge:	1
now	1
will	1
we	1
deal	1
worse	1
with	1
thee,	1
than	1
with	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
pressed	1
sore	1
upon	1
the	1
man,	1
even	1
Lot,	1
and	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
19:10	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
put	1
forth	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
pulled	1
Lot	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
shut	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
blindness,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great:	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
wearied	1
themselves	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
said	1
unto	1
Lot,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
here	1
any	1
besides?	1
son	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place:	1
19:13	1
For	1
we	1
will	1
destroy	1
this	1
place,	1
because	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
waxen	1
great	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
us	1
to	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
Lot	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
sons	1
in	1
law,	1
which	1
married	1
his	1
daughters,	1
and	1
said,	1
Up,	1
get	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
destroy	1
this	1
city.	1
But	1
he	1
seemed	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
mocked	1
unto	1
his	1
sons	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
arose,	1
then	1
the	1
angels	1
hastened	1
Lot,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
take	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
thy	1
two	1
daughters,	1
which	1
are	1
here;	1
lest	1
thou	1
be	1
consumed	1
in	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
lingered,	1
the	1
men	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
daughters;	1
the	1
LORD	1
being	1
merciful	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
forth,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
abroad,	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Escape	1
for	1
thy	1
life;	1
look	1
not	1
behind	1
thee,	1
neither	1
stay	1
thou	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
plain;	1
escape	1
to	1
the	1
mountain,	1
lest	1
thou	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
Lot	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Oh,	1
not	1
so,	1
my	1
LORD:	1
19:19	1
Behold	1
now,	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
magnified	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
saving	1
my	1
life;	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
escape	1
to	1
the	1
mountain,	1
lest	1
some	1
evil	1
take	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
die:	1
19:20	1
Behold	1
now,	1
this	1
city	1
is	1
near	1
to	1
flee	1
unto,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
one:	1
Oh,	1
let	1
me	1
escape	1
thither,	1
(is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
one?)	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
accepted	1
thee	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing	1
also,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
overthrow	1
this	1
city,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken.	1
	1
19:22	1
Haste	1
thee,	1
escape	1
thither;	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
anything	1
till	1
thou	1
be	1
come	1
thither.	1
Therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
called	1
Zoar.	1
	1
19:23	1
The	1
sun	1
was	1
risen	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
when	1
Lot	1
entered	1
into	1
Zoar.	1
	1
19:24	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
rained	1
upon	1
Sodom	1
and	1
upon	1
Gomorrah	1
brimstone	1
and	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
heaven;	1
19:25	1
And	1
he	1
overthrew	1
those	1
cities,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
grew	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
19:26	1
But	1
his	1
wife	1
looked	1
back	1
from	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
salt.	1
	1
19:27	1
And	1
Abraham	1
gat	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
19:28	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
toward	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
went	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
furnace.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
God	1
destroyed	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
that	1
God	1
remembered	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
sent	1
Lot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
overthrow,	1
when	1
he	1
overthrew	1
the	1
cities	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
Lot	1
dwelt.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
Lot	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Zoar,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
daughters	1
with	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
Zoar:	1
and	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
cave,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
daughters.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
the	1
firstborn	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
younger,	1
Our	1
father	1
is	1
old,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
us	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
19:32	1
Come,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
our	1
father	1
drink	1
wine,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
lie	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
preserve	1
seed	1
of	1
our	1
father.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
father	1
drink	1
wine	1
that	1
night:	1
and	1
the	1
firstborn	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
her	1
father;	1
and	1
he	1
perceived	1
not	1
when	1
she	1
lay	1
down,	1
nor	1
when	1
she	1
arose.	1
	1
19:34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
the	1
firstborn	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
younger,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
yesternight	1
with	1
my	1
father:	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
him	1
drink	1
wine	1
this	1
night	1
also;	1
and	1
go	1
thou	1
in,	1
and	1
lie	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
preserve	1
seed	1
of	1
our	1
father.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
father	1
drink	1
wine	1
that	1
night	1
also:	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
arose,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
perceived	1
not	1
when	1
she	1
lay	1
down,	1
nor	1
when	1
she	1
arose.	1
	1
19:36	1
Thus	1
were	1
both	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Lot	1
with	1
child	1
by	1
their	1
father.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
born	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Moab:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
19:38	1
And	1
the	1
younger,	1
she	1
also	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Benammi:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
Abraham	1
journeyed	1
from	1
thence	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
country,	1
and	1
dwelled	1
between	1
Kadesh	1
and	1
Shur,	1
and	1
sojourned	1
in	1
Gerar.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
of	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister:	1
and	1
Abimelech	1
king	1
of	1
Gerar	1
sent,	1
and	1
took	1
Sarah.	1
	1
20:3	1
But	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
Abimelech	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
but	1
a	1
dead	1
man,	1
for	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken;	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
man's	1
wife.	1
	1
20:4	1
But	1
Abimelech	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
near	1
her:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
slay	1
also	1
a	1
righteous	1
nation?	1
	1
20:5	1
Said	1
he	1
not	1
unto	1
me,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister?	1
and	1
she,	1
even	1
she	1
herself	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
my	1
brother:	1
in	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
innocency	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
this.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
Yea,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
thy	1
heart;	1
for	1
I	1
also	1
withheld	1
thee	1
from	1
sinning	1
against	1
me:	1
therefore	1
suffered	1
I	1
thee	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
her.	1
	1
20:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
restore	1
the	1
man	1
his	1
wife;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
prophet,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
live:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
restore	1
her	1
not,	1
know	1
thou	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
thine.	1
	1
20:8	1
Therefore	1
Abimelech	1
rose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
called	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
told	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
their	1
ears:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
20:9	1
Then	1
Abimelech	1
called	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
unto	1
us?	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
offended	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
on	1
me	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
kingdom	1
a	1
great	1
sin?	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
deeds	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
What	1
sawest	1
thou,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this	1
thing?	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
Because	1
I	1
thought,	1
Surely	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
this	1
place;	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
slay	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
wife's	1
sake.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
yet	1
indeed	1
she	1
is	1
my	1
sister;	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
father,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
mother;	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
my	1
wife.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
God	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
wander	1
from	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
This	1
is	1
thy	1
kindness	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shew	1
unto	1
me;	1
at	1
every	1
place	1
whither	1
we	1
shall	1
come,	1
say	1
of	1
me,	1
He	1
is	1
my	1
brother.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
took	1
sheep,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
womenservants,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
restored	1
him	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
land	1
is	1
before	1
thee:	1
dwell	1
where	1
it	1
pleaseth	1
thee.	1
	1
20:16	1
And	1
unto	1
Sarah	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thy	1
brother	1
a	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
thee	1
a	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
eyes,	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
other:	1
thus	1
she	1
was	1
reproved.	1
	1
20:17	1
So	1
Abraham	1
prayed	1
unto	1
God:	1
and	1
God	1
healed	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
maidservants;	1
and	1
they	1
bare	1
children.	1
	1
20:18	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
fast	1
closed	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
wombs	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abimelech,	1
because	1
of	1
Sarah	1
Abraham's	1
wife.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
visited	1
Sarah	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
unto	1
Sarah	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
spoken.	1
	1
21:2	1
For	1
Sarah	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Abraham	1
a	1
son	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age,	1
at	1
the	1
set	1
time	1
of	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
Abraham	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
unto	1
him,	1
whom	1
Sarah	1
bare	1
to	1
him,	1
Isaac.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
Abraham	1
circumcised	1
his	1
son	1
Isaac	1
being	1
eight	1
days	1
old,	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
Abraham	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old,	1
when	1
his	1
son	1
Isaac	1
was	1
born	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
Sarah	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
to	1
laugh,	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
will	1
laugh	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
that	1
Sarah	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
children	1
suck?	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
a	1
son	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
was	1
weaned:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
Isaac	1
was	1
weaned.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
Sarah	1
saw	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hagar	1
the	1
Egyptian,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
born	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
mocking.	1
	1
21:10	1
Wherefore	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
Cast	1
out	1
this	1
bondwoman	1
and	1
her	1
son:	1
for	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
this	1
bondwoman	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
heir	1
with	1
my	1
son,	1
even	1
with	1
Isaac.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
very	1
grievous	1
in	1
Abraham's	1
sight	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
Let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
grievous	1
in	1
thy	1
sight	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
lad,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
bondwoman;	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
Sarah	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
her	1
voice;	1
for	1
in	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
nation,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
thy	1
seed.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
Abraham	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
Hagar,	1
putting	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
sent	1
her	1
away:	1
and	1
she	1
departed,	1
and	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
bottle,	1
and	1
she	1
cast	1
the	1
child	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
shrubs.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
sat	1
her	1
down	1
over	1
against	1
him	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
off,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
bow	1
shot:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
child.	1
And	1
she	1
sat	1
over	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
her	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
God	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
lad;	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
called	1
to	1
Hagar	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee,	1
Hagar?	1
fear	1
not;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
lad	1
where	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
21:18	1
Arise,	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
lad,	1
and	1
hold	1
him	1
in	1
thine	1
hand;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
nation.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
God	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water;	1
and	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
bottle	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
lad	1
drink.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
lad;	1
and	1
he	1
grew,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
became	1
an	1
archer.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran:	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
took	1
him	1
a	1
wife	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
that	1
Abimelech	1
and	1
Phichol	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
host	1
spake	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
saying,	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
doest:	1
21:23	1
Now	1
therefore	1
swear	1
unto	1
me	1
here	1
by	1
God	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
deal	1
falsely	1
with	1
me,	1
nor	1
with	1
my	1
son,	1
nor	1
with	1
my	1
son's	1
son:	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
kindness	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
sojourned.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
swear.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
Abraham	1
reproved	1
Abimelech	1
because	1
of	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water,	1
which	1
Abimelech's	1
servants	1
had	1
violently	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said,	1
I	1
wot	1
not	1
who	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
thing;	1
neither	1
didst	1
thou	1
tell	1
me,	1
neither	1
yet	1
heard	1
I	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
Abraham	1
took	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
Abimelech;	1
and	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
made	1
a	1
covenant.	1
	1
21:28	1
And	1
Abraham	1
set	1
seven	1
ewe	1
lambs	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
by	1
themselves.	1
	1
21:29	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
What	1
mean	1
these	1
seven	1
ewe	1
lambs	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
by	1
themselves?	1
	1
21:30	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
For	1
these	1
seven	1
ewe	1
lambs	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
of	1
my	1
hand,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
digged	1
this	1
well.	1
	1
21:31	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
called	1
that	1
place	1
Beersheba;	1
because	1
there	1
they	1
sware	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:32	1
Thus	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
at	1
Beersheba:	1
then	1
Abimelech	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
Phichol	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
host,	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
21:33	1
And	1
Abraham	1
planted	1
a	1
grove	1
in	1
Beersheba,	1
and	1
called	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
Abraham	1
sojourned	1
in	1
the	1
Philistines'	1
land	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
God	1
did	1
tempt	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Abraham:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
here	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Take	1
now	1
thy	1
son,	1
thine	1
only	1
son	1
Isaac,	1
whom	1
thou	1
lovest,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moriah;	1
and	1
offer	1
him	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
of.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
Abraham	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
saddled	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
took	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
clave	1
the	1
wood	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
told	1
him.	1
	1
22:4	1
Then	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
Abraham	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
place	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
Abide	1
ye	1
here	1
with	1
the	1
ass;	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
will	1
go	1
yonder	1
and	1
worship,	1
and	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
Abraham	1
took	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
knife;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
together.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
Isaac	1
spake	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
father:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I,	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
wood:	1
but	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
lamb	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering?	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
My	1
son,	1
God	1
will	1
provide	1
himself	1
a	1
lamb	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
so	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
together.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
of;	1
and	1
Abraham	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
there,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
wood	1
in	1
order,	1
and	1
bound	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
upon	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
Abraham	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
knife	1
to	1
slay	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
said,	1
Abraham,	1
Abraham:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lay	1
not	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
lad,	1
neither	1
do	1
thou	1
any	1
thing	1
unto	1
him:	1
for	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
fearest	1
God,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
withheld	1
thy	1
son,	1
thine	1
only	1
son	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
Abraham	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
ram	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
thicket	1
by	1
his	1
horns:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
of	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
Abraham	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Jehovahjireh:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
In	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
22:16	1
And	1
said,	1
By	1
myself	1
have	1
I	1
sworn,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
withheld	1
thy	1
son,	1
thine	1
only	1
son:	1
22:17	1
That	1
in	1
blessing	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
in	1
multiplying	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
thy	1
seed	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
shore;	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
enemies;	1
22:18	1
And	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
22:19	1
So	1
Abraham	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
together	1
to	1
Beersheba;	1
and	1
Abraham	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Abraham,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
Milcah,	1
she	1
hath	1
also	1
born	1
children	1
unto	1
thy	1
brother	1
Nahor;	1
22:21	1
Huz	1
his	1
firstborn,	1
and	1
Buz	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
Kemuel	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Aram,	1
22:22	1
And	1
Chesed,	1
and	1
Hazo,	1
and	1
Pildash,	1
and	1
Jidlaph,	1
and	1
Bethuel.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
Bethuel	1
begat	1
Rebekah:	1
these	1
eight	1
Milcah	1
did	1
bear	1
to	1
Nahor,	1
Abraham's	1
brother.	1
	1
22:24	1
And	1
his	1
concubine,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Reumah,	1
she	1
bare	1
also	1
Tebah,	1
and	1
Gaham,	1
and	1
Thahash,	1
and	1
Maachah.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
Sarah	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
seven	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old:	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Sarah.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
Sarah	1
died	1
in	1
Kirjatharba;	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
Hebron	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
came	1
to	1
mourn	1
for	1
Sarah,	1
and	1
to	1
weep	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
Abraham	1
stood	1
up	1
from	1
before	1
his	1
dead,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heth,	1
saying,	1
23:4	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
a	1
sojourner	1
with	1
you:	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
bury	1
my	1
dead	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth	1
answered	1
Abraham,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
23:6	1
Hear	1
us,	1
my	1
lord:	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
mighty	1
prince	1
among	1
us:	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
our	1
sepulchres	1
bury	1
thy	1
dead;	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
withhold	1
from	1
thee	1
his	1
sepulchre,	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bury	1
thy	1
dead.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
Abraham	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
he	1
communed	1
with	1
them,	1
saying,	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
your	1
mind	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bury	1
my	1
dead	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight;	1
hear	1
me,	1
and	1
intreat	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
Ephron	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zohar,	1
23:9	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Machpelah,	1
which	1
he	1
hath,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
field;	1
for	1
as	1
much	1
money	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
worth	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
it	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace	1
amongst	1
you.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
Ephron	1
dwelt	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth:	1
and	1
Ephron	1
the	1
Hittite	1
answered	1
Abraham	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth,	1
even	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
city,	1
saying,	1
23:11	1
Nay,	1
my	1
lord,	1
hear	1
me:	1
the	1
field	1
give	1
I	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
thee;	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
give	1
I	1
it	1
thee:	1
bury	1
thy	1
dead.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
Abraham	1
bowed	1
down	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Ephron	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saying,	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
give	1
it,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
hear	1
me:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
field;	1
take	1
it	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bury	1
my	1
dead	1
there.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
Ephron	1
answered	1
Abraham,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
23:15	1
My	1
lord,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
worth	1
four	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver;	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
thee?	1
bury	1
therefore	1
thy	1
dead.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
Abraham	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
Ephron;	1
and	1
Abraham	1
weighed	1
to	1
Ephron	1
the	1
silver,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
named	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heth,	1
four	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
current	1
money	1
with	1
the	1
merchant.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Ephron	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Machpelah,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
Mamre,	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
cave	1
which	1
was	1
therein,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
borders	1
round	1
about,	1
were	1
made	1
sure	1
23:18	1
Unto	1
Abraham	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth,	1
before	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
city.	1
	1
23:19	1
And	1
after	1
this,	1
Abraham	1
buried	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Machpelah	1
before	1
Mamre:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
Hebron	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
23:20	1
And	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
were	1
made	1
sure	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace	1
by	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heth.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
Abraham	1
was	1
old,	1
and	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
age:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
blessed	1
Abraham	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
eldest	1
servant	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
that	1
ruled	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
Put,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
hand	1
under	1
my	1
thigh:	1
24:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
dwell:	1
24:4	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
country,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
kindred,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
Isaac.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Peradventure	1
the	1
woman	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
follow	1
me	1
unto	1
this	1
land:	1
must	1
I	1
needs	1
bring	1
thy	1
son	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
whence	1
thou	1
camest?	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Beware	1
thou	1
that	1
thou	1
bring	1
not	1
my	1
son	1
thither	1
again.	1
	1
24:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
which	1
took	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
kindred,	1
and	1
which	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
sware	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
this	1
land;	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
his	1
angel	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
follow	1
thee,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
clear	1
from	1
this	1
my	1
oath:	1
only	1
bring	1
not	1
my	1
son	1
thither	1
again.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
under	1
the	1
thigh	1
of	1
Abraham	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
sware	1
to	1
him	1
concerning	1
that	1
matter.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
took	1
ten	1
camels	1
of	1
the	1
camels	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
departed;	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
goods	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Mesopotamia,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nahor.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
camels	1
to	1
kneel	1
down	1
without	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
even	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
women	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
draw	1
water.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
send	1
me	1
good	1
speed	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
shew	1
kindness	1
unto	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham.	1
	1
24:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
stand	1
here	1
by	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
water;	1
and	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
draw	1
water:	1
24:14	1
And	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
damsel	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
say,	1
Let	1
down	1
thy	1
pitcher,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
drink;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
say,	1
Drink,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
camels	1
drink	1
also:	1
let	1
the	1
same	1
be	1
she	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
appointed	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
Isaac;	1
and	1
thereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
kindness	1
unto	1
my	1
master.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
speaking,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
Rebekah	1
came	1
out,	1
who	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
Bethuel,	1
son	1
of	1
Milcah,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Nahor,	1
Abraham's	1
brother,	1
with	1
her	1
pitcher	1
upon	1
her	1
shoulder.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
the	1
damsel	1
was	1
very	1
fair	1
to	1
look	1
upon,	1
a	1
virgin,	1
neither	1
had	1
any	1
man	1
known	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
filled	1
her	1
pitcher,	1
and	1
came	1
up.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
drink	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
of	1
thy	1
pitcher.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Drink,	1
my	1
lord:	1
and	1
she	1
hasted,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
her	1
pitcher	1
upon	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
drink.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
giving	1
him	1
drink,	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
water	1
for	1
thy	1
camels	1
also,	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
drinking.	1
	1
24:20	1
And	1
she	1
hasted,	1
and	1
emptied	1
her	1
pitcher	1
into	1
the	1
trough,	1
and	1
ran	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
well	1
to	1
draw	1
water,	1
and	1
drew	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
camels.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
wondering	1
at	1
her	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
to	1
wit	1
whether	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
journey	1
prosperous	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
camels	1
had	1
done	1
drinking,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
took	1
a	1
golden	1
earring	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
shekel	1
weight,	1
and	1
two	1
bracelets	1
for	1
her	1
hands	1
of	1
ten	1
shekels	1
weight	1
of	1
gold;	1
24:23	1
And	1
said,	1
Whose	1
daughter	1
art	1
thou?	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee:	1
is	1
there	1
room	1
in	1
thy	1
father's	1
house	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
lodge	1
in?	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Bethuel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Milcah,	1
which	1
she	1
bare	1
unto	1
Nahor.	1
	1
24:25	1
She	1
said	1
moreover	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
both	1
straw	1
and	1
provender	1
enough,	1
and	1
room	1
to	1
lodge	1
in.	1
	1
24:26	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
bowed	1
down	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:27	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham,	1
who	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
destitute	1
my	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
his	1
truth:	1
I	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
the	1
LORD	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
master's	1
brethren.	1
	1
24:28	1
And	1
the	1
damsel	1
ran,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
house	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
24:29	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
had	1
a	1
brother,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Laban:	1
and	1
Laban	1
ran	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
unto	1
the	1
well.	1
	1
24:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
earring	1
and	1
bracelets	1
upon	1
his	1
sister's	1
hands,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
sister,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
spake	1
the	1
man	1
unto	1
me;	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
man;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
camels	1
at	1
the	1
well.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Come	1
in,	1
thou	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
wherefore	1
standest	1
thou	1
without?	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
camels.	1
	1
24:32	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
he	1
ungirded	1
his	1
camels,	1
and	1
gave	1
straw	1
and	1
provender	1
for	1
the	1
camels,	1
and	1
water	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
the	1
men's	1
feet	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
24:33	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
set	1
meat	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
eat:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
eat,	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
mine	1
errand.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Speak	1
on.	1
	1
24:34	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Abraham's	1
servant.	1
	1
24:35	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
my	1
master	1
greatly;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
become	1
great:	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
flocks,	1
and	1
herds,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
camels,	1
and	1
asses.	1
	1
24:36	1
And	1
Sarah	1
my	1
master's	1
wife	1
bare	1
a	1
son	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
old:	1
and	1
unto	1
him	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
24:37	1
And	1
my	1
master	1
made	1
me	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
to	1
my	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
in	1
whose	1
land	1
I	1
dwell:	1
24:38	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
kindred,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
unto	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
24:39	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
master,	1
Peradventure	1
the	1
woman	1
will	1
not	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
24:40	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
LORD,	1
before	1
whom	1
I	1
walk,	1
will	1
send	1
his	1
angel	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
prosper	1
thy	1
way;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
for	1
my	1
son	1
of	1
my	1
kindred,	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house:	1
24:41	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
clear	1
from	1
this	1
my	1
oath,	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
my	1
kindred;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
give	1
not	1
thee	1
one,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
clear	1
from	1
my	1
oath.	1
	1
24:42	1
And	1
I	1
came	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham,	1
if	1
now	1
thou	1
do	1
prosper	1
my	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
go:	1
24:43	1
Behold,	1
I	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
water;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
virgin	1
cometh	1
forth	1
to	1
draw	1
water,	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
her,	1
Give	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
of	1
thy	1
pitcher	1
to	1
drink;	1
24:44	1
And	1
she	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
Both	1
drink	1
thou,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
draw	1
for	1
thy	1
camels:	1
let	1
the	1
same	1
be	1
the	1
woman	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
appointed	1
out	1
for	1
my	1
master's	1
son.	1
	1
24:45	1
And	1
before	1
I	1
had	1
done	1
speaking	1
in	1
mine	1
heart,	1
behold,	1
Rebekah	1
came	1
forth	1
with	1
her	1
pitcher	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder;	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
drew	1
water:	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Let	1
me	1
drink,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee.	1
	1
24:46	1
And	1
she	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
her	1
pitcher	1
from	1
her	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
said,	1
Drink,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
camels	1
drink	1
also:	1
so	1
I	1
drank,	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
the	1
camels	1
drink	1
also.	1
	1
24:47	1
And	1
I	1
asked	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Whose	1
daughter	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Bethuel,	1
Nahor's	1
son,	1
whom	1
Milcah	1
bare	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
earring	1
upon	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
the	1
bracelets	1
upon	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
24:48	1
And	1
I	1
bowed	1
down	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
blessed	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
had	1
led	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
master's	1
brother's	1
daughter	1
unto	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
24:49	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
deal	1
kindly	1
and	1
truly	1
with	1
my	1
master,	1
tell	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
tell	1
me;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
24:50	1
Then	1
Laban	1
and	1
Bethuel	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
thing	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
LORD:	1
we	1
cannot	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee	1
bad	1
or	1
good.	1
	1
24:51	1
Behold,	1
Rebekah	1
is	1
before	1
thee,	1
take	1
her,	1
and	1
go,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
thy	1
master's	1
son's	1
wife,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken.	1
	1
24:52	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Abraham's	1
servant	1
heard	1
their	1
words,	1
he	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD,	1
bowing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
24:53	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
brought	1
forth	1
jewels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
raiment,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
Rebekah:	1
he	1
gave	1
also	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
precious	1
things.	1
	1
24:54	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
tarried	1
all	1
night;	1
and	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Send	1
me	1
away	1
unto	1
my	1
master.	1
	1
24:55	1
And	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
damsel	1
abide	1
with	1
us	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
ten;	1
after	1
that	1
she	1
shall	1
go.	1
	1
24:56	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hinder	1
me	1
not,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
prospered	1
my	1
way;	1
send	1
me	1
away	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
master.	1
	1
24:57	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
call	1
the	1
damsel,	1
and	1
enquire	1
at	1
her	1
mouth.	1
	1
24:58	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
Rebekah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
with	1
this	1
man?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go.	1
	1
24:59	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
away	1
Rebekah	1
their	1
sister,	1
and	1
her	1
nurse,	1
and	1
Abraham's	1
servant,	1
and	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
24:60	1
And	1
they	1
blessed	1
Rebekah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
art	1
our	1
sister,	1
be	1
thou	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
millions,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
seed	1
possess	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
hate	1
them.	1
	1
24:61	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
arose,	1
and	1
her	1
damsels,	1
and	1
they	1
rode	1
upon	1
the	1
camels,	1
and	1
followed	1
the	1
man:	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
took	1
Rebekah,	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
24:62	1
And	1
Isaac	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
well	1
Lahairoi;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
country.	1
	1
24:63	1
And	1
Isaac	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meditate	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
the	1
eventide:	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
camels	1
were	1
coming.	1
	1
24:64	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Isaac,	1
she	1
lighted	1
off	1
the	1
camel.	1
	1
24:65	1
For	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
meet	1
us?	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
had	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
master:	1
therefore	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
vail,	1
and	1
covered	1
herself.	1
	1
24:66	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
told	1
Isaac	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
24:67	1
And	1
Isaac	1
brought	1
her	1
into	1
his	1
mother	1
Sarah's	1
tent,	1
and	1
took	1
Rebekah,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
her:	1
and	1
Isaac	1
was	1
comforted	1
after	1
his	1
mother's	1
death.	1
	1
25:1	1
Then	1
again	1
Abraham	1
took	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
her	1
name	1
was	1
Keturah.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
she	1
bare	1
him	1
Zimran,	1
and	1
Jokshan,	1
and	1
Medan,	1
and	1
Midian,	1
and	1
Ishbak,	1
and	1
Shuah.	1
	1
25:3	1
And	1
Jokshan	1
begat	1
Sheba,	1
and	1
Dedan.	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Dedan	1
were	1
Asshurim,	1
and	1
Letushim,	1
and	1
Leummim.	1
	1
25:4	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Midian;	1
Ephah,	1
and	1
Epher,	1
and	1
Hanoch,	1
and	1
Abidah,	1
and	1
Eldaah.	1
All	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Keturah.	1
	1
25:5	1
And	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
unto	1
Isaac.	1
	1
25:6	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
concubines,	1
which	1
Abraham	1
had,	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
gifts,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
away	1
from	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son,	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
lived,	1
eastward,	1
unto	1
the	1
east	1
country.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
Abraham's	1
life	1
which	1
he	1
lived,	1
an	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
fifteen	1
years.	1
	1
25:8	1
Then	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
and	1
died	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
old	1
age,	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
years;	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
to	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
25:9	1
And	1
his	1
sons	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Ishmael	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Machpelah,	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Ephron	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zohar	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Mamre;	1
25:10	1
The	1
field	1
which	1
Abraham	1
purchased	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heth:	1
there	1
was	1
Abraham	1
buried,	1
and	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
that	1
God	1
blessed	1
his	1
son	1
Isaac;	1
and	1
Isaac	1
dwelt	1
by	1
the	1
well	1
Lahairoi.	1
	1
25:12	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
Abraham's	1
son,	1
whom	1
Hagar	1
the	1
Egyptian,	1
Sarah's	1
handmaid,	1
bare	1
unto	1
Abraham:	1
25:13	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
by	1
their	1
names,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
generations:	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
Nebajoth;	1
and	1
Kedar,	1
and	1
Adbeel,	1
and	1
Mibsam,	1
25:14	1
And	1
Mishma,	1
and	1
Dumah,	1
and	1
Massa,	1
25:15	1
Hadar,	1
and	1
Tema,	1
Jetur,	1
Naphish,	1
and	1
Kedemah:	1
25:16	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
their	1
names,	1
by	1
their	1
towns,	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
castles;	1
twelve	1
princes	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
nations.	1
	1
25:17	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
and	1
seven	1
years:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost	1
and	1
died;	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
25:18	1
And	1
they	1
dwelt	1
from	1
Havilah	1
unto	1
Shur,	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
Egypt,	1
as	1
thou	1
goest	1
toward	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
25:19	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
Abraham's	1
son:	1
Abraham	1
begat	1
Isaac:	1
25:20	1
And	1
Isaac	1
was	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
Rebekah	1
to	1
wife,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Bethuel	1
the	1
Syrian	1
of	1
Padanaram,	1
the	1
sister	1
to	1
Laban	1
the	1
Syrian.	1
	1
25:21	1
And	1
Isaac	1
intreated	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
his	1
wife,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
barren:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
intreated	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
wife	1
conceived.	1
	1
25:22	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
struggled	1
together	1
within	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
thus?	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Two	1
nations	1
are	1
in	1
thy	1
womb,	1
and	1
two	1
manner	1
of	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
separated	1
from	1
thy	1
bowels;	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
people;	1
and	1
the	1
elder	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
younger.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
when	1
her	1
days	1
to	1
be	1
delivered	1
were	1
fulfilled,	1
behold,	1
there	1
were	1
twins	1
in	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
25:25	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
came	1
out	1
red,	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
an	1
hairy	1
garment;	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Esau.	1
	1
25:26	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
came	1
his	1
brother	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
took	1
hold	1
on	1
Esau's	1
heel;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Jacob:	1
and	1
Isaac	1
was	1
threescore	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
she	1
bare	1
them.	1
	1
25:27	1
And	1
the	1
boys	1
grew:	1
and	1
Esau	1
was	1
a	1
cunning	1
hunter,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
was	1
a	1
plain	1
man,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
tents.	1
	1
25:28	1
And	1
Isaac	1
loved	1
Esau,	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
venison:	1
but	1
Rebekah	1
loved	1
Jacob.	1
	1
25:29	1
And	1
Jacob	1
sod	1
pottage:	1
and	1
Esau	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
faint:	1
25:30	1
And	1
Esau	1
said	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
Feed	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
with	1
that	1
same	1
red	1
pottage;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
faint:	1
therefore	1
was	1
his	1
name	1
called	1
Edom.	1
	1
25:31	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
Sell	1
me	1
this	1
day	1
thy	1
birthright.	1
	1
25:32	1
And	1
Esau	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
to	1
die:	1
and	1
what	1
profit	1
shall	1
this	1
birthright	1
do	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
25:33	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
Swear	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
day;	1
and	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
sold	1
his	1
birthright	1
unto	1
Jacob.	1
	1
25:34	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
gave	1
Esau	1
bread	1
and	1
pottage	1
of	1
lentiles;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way:	1
thus	1
Esau	1
despised	1
his	1
birthright.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
beside	1
the	1
first	1
famine	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
And	1
Isaac	1
went	1
unto	1
Abimelech	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
unto	1
Gerar.	1
	1
26:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
not	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
of:	1
26:3	1
Sojourn	1
in	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
bless	1
thee;	1
for	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
all	1
these	1
countries,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
perform	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
thy	1
father;	1
26:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
seed	1
to	1
multiply	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
all	1
these	1
countries;	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed;	1
26:5	1
Because	1
that	1
Abraham	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
kept	1
my	1
charge,	1
my	1
commandments,	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
my	1
laws.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
Isaac	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Gerar:	1
26:7	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
asked	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister:	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
to	1
say,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
wife;	1
lest,	1
said	1
he,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
should	1
kill	1
me	1
for	1
Rebekah;	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
fair	1
to	1
look	1
upon.	1
	1
26:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
that	1
Abimelech	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Isaac	1
was	1
sporting	1
with	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
26:9	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
called	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
she	1
is	1
thy	1
wife;	1
and	1
how	1
saidst	1
thou,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister?	1
And	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
I	1
said,	1
Lest	1
I	1
die	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
26:10	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
us?	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
might	1
lightly	1
have	1
lien	1
with	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
have	1
brought	1
guiltiness	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
26:11	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
charged	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
saying,	1
He	1
that	1
toucheth	1
this	1
man	1
or	1
his	1
wife	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
26:12	1
Then	1
Isaac	1
sowed	1
in	1
that	1
land,	1
and	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
an	1
hundredfold:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
26:13	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
waxed	1
great,	1
and	1
went	1
forward,	1
and	1
grew	1
until	1
he	1
became	1
very	1
great:	1
26:14	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
possession	1
of	1
flocks,	1
and	1
possession	1
of	1
herds,	1
and	1
great	1
store	1
of	1
servants:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
envied	1
him.	1
	1
26:15	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
wells	1
which	1
his	1
father's	1
servants	1
had	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham	1
his	1
father,	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
stopped	1
them,	1
and	1
filled	1
them	1
with	1
earth.	1
	1
26:16	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said	1
unto	1
Isaac,	1
Go	1
from	1
us;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
much	1
mightier	1
than	1
we.	1
	1
26:17	1
And	1
Isaac	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gerar,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
there.	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
Isaac	1
digged	1
again	1
the	1
wells	1
of	1
water,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham	1
his	1
father;	1
for	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
stopped	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Abraham:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
their	1
names	1
after	1
the	1
names	1
by	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
26:19	1
And	1
Isaac's	1
servants	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
found	1
there	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
springing	1
water.	1
	1
26:20	1
And	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Gerar	1
did	1
strive	1
with	1
Isaac's	1
herdmen,	1
saying,	1
The	1
water	1
is	1
ours:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
well	1
Esek;	1
because	1
they	1
strove	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
they	1
digged	1
another	1
well,	1
and	1
strove	1
for	1
that	1
also:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Sitnah.	1
	1
26:22	1
And	1
he	1
removed	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
digged	1
another	1
well;	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
they	1
strove	1
not:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Rehoboth;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
For	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
room	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
fruitful	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
26:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
thy	1
father:	1
fear	1
not,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
my	1
servant	1
Abraham's	1
sake.	1
	1
26:25	1
And	1
he	1
builded	1
an	1
altar	1
there,	1
and	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
there:	1
and	1
there	1
Isaac's	1
servants	1
digged	1
a	1
well.	1
	1
26:26	1
Then	1
Abimelech	1
went	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
Gerar,	1
and	1
Ahuzzath	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
Phichol	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
26:27	1
And	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wherefore	1
come	1
ye	1
to	1
me,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
hate	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
sent	1
me	1
away	1
from	1
you?	1
	1
26:28	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
saw	1
certainly	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
thee:	1
and	1
we	1
said,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
now	1
an	1
oath	1
betwixt	1
us,	1
even	1
betwixt	1
us	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee;	1
26:29	1
That	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
us	1
no	1
hurt,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
touched	1
thee,	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
thee	1
nothing	1
but	1
good,	1
and	1
have	1
sent	1
thee	1
away	1
in	1
peace:	1
thou	1
art	1
now	1
the	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
26:31	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
betimes	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
sware	1
one	1
to	1
another:	1
and	1
Isaac	1
sent	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
26:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
that	1
Isaac's	1
servants	1
came,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
well	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
digged,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
water.	1
	1
26:33	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
Shebah:	1
therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
Beersheba	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
26:34	1
And	1
Esau	1
was	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
to	1
wife	1
Judith	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Beeri	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
Bashemath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Elon	1
the	1
Hittite:	1
26:35	1
Which	1
were	1
a	1
grief	1
of	1
mind	1
unto	1
Isaac	1
and	1
to	1
Rebekah.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Isaac	1
was	1
old,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
dim,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see,	1
he	1
called	1
Esau	1
his	1
eldest	1
son,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
son:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
am	1
old,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
death:	1
27:3	1
Now	1
therefore	1
take,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
weapons,	1
thy	1
quiver	1
and	1
thy	1
bow,	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
take	1
me	1
some	1
venison;	1
27:4	1
And	1
make	1
me	1
savoury	1
meat,	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
love,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat;	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
may	1
bless	1
thee	1
before	1
I	1
die.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
heard	1
when	1
Isaac	1
spake	1
to	1
Esau	1
his	1
son.	1
And	1
Esau	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
hunt	1
for	1
venison,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
it.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
spake	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
her	1
son,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
heard	1
thy	1
father	1
speak	1
unto	1
Esau	1
thy	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
27:7	1
Bring	1
me	1
venison,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
savoury	1
meat,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat,	1
and	1
bless	1
thee	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
my	1
death.	1
	1
27:8	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
my	1
son,	1
obey	1
my	1
voice	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee.	1
	1
27:9	1
Go	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
fetch	1
me	1
from	1
thence	1
two	1
good	1
kids	1
of	1
the	1
goats;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
savoury	1
meat	1
for	1
thy	1
father,	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
loveth:	1
27:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
father,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
bless	1
thee	1
before	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
to	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
mother,	1
Behold,	1
Esau	1
my	1
brother	1
is	1
a	1
hairy	1
man,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
smooth	1
man:	1
27:12	1
My	1
father	1
peradventure	1
will	1
feel	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
deceiver;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
blessing.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
his	1
mother	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Upon	1
me	1
be	1
thy	1
curse,	1
my	1
son:	1
only	1
obey	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
go	1
fetch	1
me	1
them.	1
	1
27:14	1
And	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
fetched,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
mother:	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
made	1
savoury	1
meat,	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
loved.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
took	1
goodly	1
raiment	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
son	1
Esau,	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
Jacob	1
her	1
younger	1
son:	1
27:16	1
And	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
skins	1
of	1
the	1
kids	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
upon	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
smooth	1
of	1
his	1
neck:	1
27:17	1
And	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
savoury	1
meat	1
and	1
the	1
bread,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
prepared,	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
Jacob.	1
	1
27:18	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
father:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
who	1
art	1
thou,	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
27:19	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
I	1
am	1
Esau	1
thy	1
first	1
born;	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
according	1
as	1
thou	1
badest	1
me:	1
arise,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
sit	1
and	1
eat	1
of	1
my	1
venison,	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
may	1
bless	1
me.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
son,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
it	1
so	1
quickly,	1
my	1
son?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
27:21	1
And	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Come	1
near,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
feel	1
thee,	1
my	1
son,	1
whether	1
thou	1
be	1
my	1
very	1
son	1
Esau	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
Jacob	1
went	1
near	1
unto	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father;	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
voice	1
is	1
Jacob's	1
voice,	1
but	1
the	1
hands	1
are	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Esau.	1
	1
27:23	1
And	1
he	1
discerned	1
him	1
not,	1
because	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
hairy,	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
Esau's	1
hands:	1
so	1
he	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
27:24	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Art	1
thou	1
my	1
very	1
son	1
Esau?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
27:25	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
it	1
near	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
eat	1
of	1
my	1
son's	1
venison,	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
may	1
bless	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
it	1
near	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat:	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
wine	1
and	1
he	1
drank.	1
	1
27:26	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
near	1
now,	1
and	1
kiss	1
me,	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
27:27	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
smelled	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
See,	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
a	1
field	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed:	1
27:28	1
Therefore	1
God	1
give	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
fatness	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
plenty	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
wine:	1
27:29	1
Let	1
people	1
serve	1
thee,	1
and	1
nations	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
thee:	1
be	1
lord	1
over	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
mother's	1
sons	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
thee:	1
cursed	1
be	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
curseth	1
thee,	1
and	1
blessed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
blesseth	1
thee.	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Isaac	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
blessing	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
Jacob	1
was	1
yet	1
scarce	1
gone	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father,	1
that	1
Esau	1
his	1
brother	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
his	1
hunting.	1
	1
27:31	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
had	1
made	1
savoury	1
meat,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Let	1
my	1
father	1
arise,	1
and	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
venison,	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
may	1
bless	1
me.	1
	1
27:32	1
And	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
son,	1
thy	1
firstborn	1
Esau.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
Isaac	1
trembled	1
very	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who?	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
taken	1
venison,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
of	1
all	1
before	1
thou	1
camest,	1
and	1
have	1
blessed	1
him?	1
yea,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
27:34	1
And	1
when	1
Esau	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
exceeding	1
bitter	1
cry,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Bless	1
me,	1
even	1
me	1
also,	1
O	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
came	1
with	1
subtilty,	1
and	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
thy	1
blessing.	1
	1
27:36	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
he	1
rightly	1
named	1
Jacob?	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
supplanted	1
me	1
these	1
two	1
times:	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
my	1
birthright;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
now	1
he	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
blessing.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
reserved	1
a	1
blessing	1
for	1
me?	1
	1
27:37	1
And	1
Isaac	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Esau,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
thy	1
lord,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
brethren	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
servants;	1
and	1
with	1
corn	1
and	1
wine	1
have	1
I	1
sustained	1
him:	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
now	1
unto	1
thee,	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
27:38	1
And	1
Esau	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
but	1
one	1
blessing,	1
my	1
father?	1
bless	1
me,	1
even	1
me	1
also,	1
O	1
my	1
father.	1
And	1
Esau	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
fatness	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
above;	1
27:40	1
And	1
by	1
thy	1
sword	1
shalt	1
thou	1
live,	1
and	1
shalt	1
serve	1
thy	1
brother;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
the	1
dominion,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
break	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
neck.	1
	1
27:41	1
And	1
Esau	1
hated	1
Jacob	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
blessing	1
wherewith	1
his	1
father	1
blessed	1
him:	1
and	1
Esau	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
mourning	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
are	1
at	1
hand;	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
slay	1
my	1
brother	1
Jacob.	1
	1
27:42	1
And	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
Esau	1
her	1
elder	1
son	1
were	1
told	1
to	1
Rebekah:	1
and	1
she	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
Jacob	1
her	1
younger	1
son,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
brother	1
Esau,	1
as	1
touching	1
thee,	1
doth	1
comfort	1
himself,	1
purposing	1
to	1
kill	1
thee.	1
	1
27:43	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
my	1
son,	1
obey	1
my	1
voice;	1
arise,	1
flee	1
thou	1
to	1
Laban	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
Haran;	1
27:44	1
And	1
tarry	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
until	1
thy	1
brother's	1
fury	1
turn	1
away;	1
27:45	1
Until	1
thy	1
brother's	1
anger	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
he	1
forget	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
to	1
him:	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
send,	1
and	1
fetch	1
thee	1
from	1
thence:	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
be	1
deprived	1
also	1
of	1
you	1
both	1
in	1
one	1
day?	1
	1
27:46	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
said	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Heth:	1
if	1
Jacob	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Heth,	1
such	1
as	1
these	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
what	1
good	1
shall	1
my	1
life	1
do	1
me?	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
Isaac	1
called	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
charged	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
28:2	1
Arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Padanaram,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Bethuel	1
thy	1
mother's	1
father;	1
and	1
take	1
thee	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
thence	1
of	1
the	1
daughers	1
of	1
Laban	1
thy	1
mother's	1
brother.	1
	1
28:3	1
And	1
God	1
Almighty	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
people;	1
28:4	1
And	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
with	1
thee;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stranger,	1
which	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
Abraham.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
Isaac	1
sent	1
away	1
Jacob:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Padanaram	1
unto	1
Laban,	1
son	1
of	1
Bethuel	1
the	1
Syrian,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Rebekah,	1
Jacob's	1
and	1
Esau's	1
mother.	1
	1
28:6	1
When	1
Esau	1
saw	1
that	1
Isaac	1
had	1
blessed	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Padanaram,	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
thence;	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
blessed	1
him	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
charge,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
daughers	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
28:7	1
And	1
that	1
Jacob	1
obeyed	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
Padanaram;	1
28:8	1
And	1
Esau	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Canaan	1
pleased	1
not	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father;	1
28:9	1
Then	1
went	1
Esau	1
unto	1
Ishmael,	1
and	1
took	1
unto	1
the	1
wives	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
Mahalath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
Abraham's	1
son,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Nebajoth,	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
28:10	1
And	1
Jacob	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Beersheba,	1
and	1
went	1
toward	1
Haran.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
he	1
lighted	1
upon	1
a	1
certain	1
place,	1
and	1
tarried	1
there	1
all	1
night,	1
because	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
set;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
for	1
his	1
pillows,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
to	1
sleep.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
he	1
dreamed,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
ladder	1
set	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
reached	1
to	1
heaven:	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
ascending	1
and	1
descending	1
on	1
it.	1
	1
28:13	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
above	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac:	1
the	1
land	1
whereon	1
thou	1
liest,	1
to	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed;	1
28:14	1
And	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
spread	1
abroad	1
to	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
south:	1
and	1
in	1
thee	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
28:15	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
again	1
into	1
this	1
land;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
thee,	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
thee	1
of.	1
	1
28:16	1
And	1
Jacob	1
awaked	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Surely	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
place;	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said,	1
How	1
dreadful	1
is	1
this	1
place!	1
this	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
but	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
28:18	1
And	1
Jacob	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
stone	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
for	1
his	1
pillows,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
pillar,	1
and	1
poured	1
oil	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
28:19	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Bethel:	1
but	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
was	1
called	1
Luz	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
28:20	1
And	1
Jacob	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow,	1
saying,	1
If	1
God	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
go,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
bread	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
raiment	1
to	1
put	1
on,	1
28:21	1
So	1
that	1
I	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
in	1
peace;	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
my	1
God:	1
28:22	1
And	1
this	1
stone,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
for	1
a	1
pillar,	1
shall	1
be	1
God's	1
house:	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
give	1
the	1
tenth	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
29:1	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
journey,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
29:2	1
And	1
he	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep	1
lying	1
by	1
it;	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
well	1
they	1
watered	1
the	1
flocks:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
stone	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth.	1
	1
29:3	1
And	1
thither	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
flocks	1
gathered:	1
and	1
they	1
rolled	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth,	1
and	1
watered	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
stone	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
29:4	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
brethren,	1
whence	1
be	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Of	1
Haran	1
are	1
we.	1
	1
29:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
Laban	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nahor?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
29:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
he	1
well?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
well:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Rachel	1
his	1
daughter	1
cometh	1
with	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
29:7	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
high	1
day,	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
cattle	1
should	1
be	1
gathered	1
together:	1
water	1
ye	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
go	1
and	1
feed	1
them.	1
	1
29:8	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
cannot,	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
flocks	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
till	1
they	1
roll	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth;	1
then	1
we	1
water	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
29:9	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake	1
with	1
them,	1
Rachel	1
came	1
with	1
her	1
father's	1
sheep;	1
for	1
she	1
kept	1
them.	1
	1
29:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jacob	1
saw	1
Rachel	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Laban	1
his	1
mother's	1
brother,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
Laban	1
his	1
mother's	1
brother,	1
that	1
Jacob	1
went	1
near,	1
and	1
rolled	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth,	1
and	1
watered	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
Laban	1
his	1
mother's	1
brother.	1
	1
29:11	1
And	1
Jacob	1
kissed	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
29:12	1
And	1
Jacob	1
told	1
Rachel	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
her	1
father's	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Rebekah's	1
son:	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
father.	1
	1
29:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Laban	1
heard	1
the	1
tidings	1
of	1
Jacob	1
his	1
sister's	1
son,	1
that	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
And	1
he	1
told	1
Laban	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
29:14	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
bone	1
and	1
my	1
flesh.	1
And	1
he	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
month.	1
	1
29:15	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Because	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
brother,	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
therefore	1
serve	1
me	1
for	1
nought?	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
shall	1
thy	1
wages	1
be?	1
	1
29:16	1
And	1
Laban	1
had	1
two	1
daughters:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
elder	1
was	1
Leah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
was	1
Rachel.	1
	1
29:17	1
Leah	1
was	1
tender	1
eyed;	1
but	1
Rachel	1
was	1
beautiful	1
and	1
well	1
favoured.	1
	1
29:18	1
And	1
Jacob	1
loved	1
Rachel;	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
serve	1
thee	1
seven	1
years	1
for	1
Rachel	1
thy	1
younger	1
daughter.	1
	1
29:19	1
And	1
Laban	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
I	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
thee,	1
than	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
another	1
man:	1
abide	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
29:20	1
And	1
Jacob	1
served	1
seven	1
years	1
for	1
Rachel;	1
and	1
they	1
seemed	1
unto	1
him	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
29:21	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
Laban,	1
Give	1
me	1
my	1
wife,	1
for	1
my	1
days	1
are	1
fulfilled,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
29:22	1
And	1
Laban	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
feast.	1
	1
29:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
Leah	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
29:24	1
And	1
Laban	1
gave	1
unto	1
his	1
daughter	1
Leah	1
Zilpah	1
his	1
maid	1
for	1
an	1
handmaid.	1
	1
29:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
Leah:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Laban,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
me?	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
serve	1
with	1
thee	1
for	1
Rachel?	1
wherefore	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
beguiled	1
me?	1
29:26	1
And	1
Laban	1
said,	1
It	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
done	1
in	1
our	1
country,	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
younger	1
before	1
the	1
firstborn.	1
	1
29:27	1
Fulfil	1
her	1
week,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
this	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
serve	1
with	1
me	1
yet	1
seven	1
other	1
years.	1
	1
29:28	1
And	1
Jacob	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
fulfilled	1
her	1
week:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
Rachel	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife	1
also.	1
	1
29:29	1
And	1
Laban	1
gave	1
to	1
Rachel	1
his	1
daughter	1
Bilhah	1
his	1
handmaid	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
maid.	1
	1
29:30	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
also	1
unto	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
also	1
Rachel	1
more	1
than	1
Leah,	1
and	1
served	1
with	1
him	1
yet	1
seven	1
other	1
years.	1
	1
29:31	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
that	1
Leah	1
was	1
hated,	1
he	1
opened	1
her	1
womb:	1
but	1
Rachel	1
was	1
barren.	1
	1
29:32	1
And	1
Leah	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Reuben:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
Surely	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
looked	1
upon	1
my	1
affliction;	1
now	1
therefore	1
my	1
husband	1
will	1
love	1
me.	1
	1
29:33	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
heard	1
I	1
was	1
hated,	1
he	1
hath	1
therefore	1
given	1
me	1
this	1
son	1
also:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Simeon.	1
	1
29:34	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
said,	1
Now	1
this	1
time	1
will	1
my	1
husband	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
three	1
sons:	1
therefore	1
was	1
his	1
name	1
called	1
Levi.	1
	1
29:35	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son:	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
Now	1
will	1
I	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Judah;	1
and	1
left	1
bearing.	1
	1
30:1	1
And	1
when	1
Rachel	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
no	1
children,	1
Rachel	1
envied	1
her	1
sister;	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Give	1
me	1
children,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
die.	1
	1
30:2	1
And	1
Jacob's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Rachel:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Am	1
I	1
in	1
God's	1
stead,	1
who	1
hath	1
withheld	1
from	1
thee	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
womb?	1
30:3	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Behold	1
my	1
maid	1
Bilhah,	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
bear	1
upon	1
my	1
knees,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
also	1
have	1
children	1
by	1
her.	1
	1
30:4	1
And	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
Bilhah	1
her	1
handmaid	1
to	1
wife:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
30:5	1
And	1
Bilhah	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
Rachel	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
judged	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
also	1
heard	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
son:	1
therefore	1
called	1
she	1
his	1
name	1
Dan.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
Bilhah	1
Rachel's	1
maid	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
a	1
second	1
son.	1
	1
30:8	1
And	1
Rachel	1
said,	1
With	1
great	1
wrestlings	1
have	1
I	1
wrestled	1
with	1
my	1
sister,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
prevailed:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Naphtali.	1
	1
30:9	1
When	1
Leah	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
bearing,	1
she	1
took	1
Zilpah	1
her	1
maid,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
Jacob	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
30:10	1
And	1
Zilpah	1
Leah's	1
maid	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
30:11	1
And	1
Leah	1
said,	1
A	1
troop	1
cometh:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Gad.	1
	1
30:12	1
And	1
Zilpah	1
Leah's	1
maid	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
a	1
second	1
son.	1
	1
30:13	1
And	1
Leah	1
said,	1
Happy	1
am	1
I,	1
for	1
the	1
daughters	1
will	1
call	1
me	1
blessed:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Asher.	1
	1
30:14	1
And	1
Reuben	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
wheat	1
harvest,	1
and	1
found	1
mandrakes	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
his	1
mother	1
Leah.	1
Then	1
Rachel	1
said	1
to	1
Leah,	1
Give	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
thy	1
son's	1
mandrakes.	1
	1
30:15	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
small	1
matter	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
my	1
husband?	1
and	1
wouldest	1
thou	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
son's	1
mandrakes	1
also?	1
And	1
Rachel	1
said,	1
Therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
night	1
for	1
thy	1
son's	1
mandrakes.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
Jacob	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
and	1
Leah	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
must	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
me;	1
for	1
surely	1
I	1
have	1
hired	1
thee	1
with	1
my	1
son's	1
mandrakes.	1
And	1
he	1
lay	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
30:17	1
And	1
God	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
Leah,	1
and	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
the	1
fifth	1
son.	1
	1
30:18	1
And	1
Leah	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
my	1
hire,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
my	1
maiden	1
to	1
my	1
husband:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Issachar.	1
	1
30:19	1
And	1
Leah	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
the	1
sixth	1
son.	1
	1
30:20	1
And	1
Leah	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
endued	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
dowry;	1
now	1
will	1
my	1
husband	1
dwell	1
with	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
six	1
sons:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Zebulun.	1
	1
30:21	1
And	1
afterwards	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
daughter,	1
and	1
called	1
her	1
name	1
Dinah.	1
	1
30:22	1
And	1
God	1
remembered	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
God	1
hearkened	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
opened	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
30:23	1
And	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
reproach:	1
30:24	1
And	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Joseph;	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
add	1
to	1
me	1
another	1
son.	1
	1
30:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Rachel	1
had	1
born	1
Joseph,	1
that	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
Laban,	1
Send	1
me	1
away,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
place,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
country.	1
	1
30:26	1
Give	1
me	1
my	1
wives	1
and	1
my	1
children,	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
thee,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
go:	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
my	1
service	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
thee.	1
	1
30:27	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
tarry:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
sake.	1
	1
30:28	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Appoint	1
me	1
thy	1
wages,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it.	1
	1
30:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
thee,	1
and	1
how	1
thy	1
cattle	1
was	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
30:30	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
little	1
which	1
thou	1
hadst	1
before	1
I	1
came,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
increased	1
unto	1
a	1
multitude;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thee	1
since	1
my	1
coming:	1
and	1
now	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
provide	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
house	1
also?	1
	1
30:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
thee?	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
give	1
me	1
any	1
thing:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
again	1
feed	1
and	1
keep	1
thy	1
flock.	1
	1
30:32	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
all	1
thy	1
flock	1
to	1
day,	1
removing	1
from	1
thence	1
all	1
the	1
speckled	1
and	1
spotted	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brown	1
cattle	1
among	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
spotted	1
and	1
speckled	1
among	1
the	1
goats:	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
hire.	1
	1
30:33	1
So	1
shall	1
my	1
righteousness	1
answer	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
for	1
my	1
hire	1
before	1
thy	1
face:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
speckled	1
and	1
spotted	1
among	1
the	1
goats,	1
and	1
brown	1
among	1
the	1
sheep,	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
stolen	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
30:34	1
And	1
Laban	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
would	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
30:35	1
And	1
he	1
removed	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
he	1
goats	1
that	1
were	1
ringstraked	1
and	1
spotted,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
she	1
goats	1
that	1
were	1
speckled	1
and	1
spotted,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
some	1
white	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brown	1
among	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
30:36	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
betwixt	1
himself	1
and	1
Jacob:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
fed	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Laban's	1
flocks.	1
	1
30:37	1
And	1
Jacob	1
took	1
him	1
rods	1
of	1
green	1
poplar,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
hazel	1
and	1
chesnut	1
tree;	1
and	1
pilled	1
white	1
strakes	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
white	1
appear	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
rods.	1
	1
30:38	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
rods	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
pilled	1
before	1
the	1
flocks	1
in	1
the	1
gutters	1
in	1
the	1
watering	1
troughs	1
when	1
the	1
flocks	1
came	1
to	1
drink,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
conceive	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
30:39	1
And	1
the	1
flocks	1
conceived	1
before	1
the	1
rods,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
cattle	1
ringstraked,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
spotted.	1
	1
30:40	1
And	1
Jacob	1
did	1
separate	1
the	1
lambs,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
flocks	1
toward	1
the	1
ringstraked,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brown	1
in	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
Laban;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
own	1
flocks	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
not	1
unto	1
Laban's	1
cattle.	1
	1
30:41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
whensoever	1
the	1
stronger	1
cattle	1
did	1
conceive,	1
that	1
Jacob	1
laid	1
the	1
rods	1
before	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
gutters,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
conceive	1
among	1
the	1
rods.	1
	1
30:42	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
cattle	1
were	1
feeble,	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
not	1
in:	1
so	1
the	1
feebler	1
were	1
Laban's,	1
and	1
the	1
stronger	1
Jacob's.	1
	1
30:43	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
increased	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
had	1
much	1
cattle,	1
and	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
camels,	1
and	1
asses.	1
	1
31:1	1
And	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Laban's	1
sons,	1
saying,	1
Jacob	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
our	1
father's;	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
father's	1
hath	1
he	1
gotten	1
all	1
this	1
glory.	1
	1
31:2	1
And	1
Jacob	1
beheld	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
Laban,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
toward	1
him	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
31:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
kindred;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
31:4	1
And	1
Jacob	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
Rachel	1
and	1
Leah	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
unto	1
his	1
flock,	1
31:5	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
father's	1
countenance,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
toward	1
me	1
as	1
before;	1
but	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
31:6	1
And	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
power	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
31:7	1
And	1
your	1
father	1
hath	1
deceived	1
me,	1
and	1
changed	1
my	1
wages	1
ten	1
times;	1
but	1
God	1
suffered	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
hurt	1
me.	1
	1
31:8	1
If	1
he	1
said	1
thus,	1
The	1
speckled	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
wages;	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
bare	1
speckled:	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
said	1
thus,	1
The	1
ringstraked	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
hire;	1
then	1
bare	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
ringstraked.	1
	1
31:9	1
Thus	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
your	1
father,	1
and	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
31:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
cattle	1
conceived,	1
that	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
rams	1
which	1
leaped	1
upon	1
the	1
cattle	1
were	1
ringstraked,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
grisled.	1
	1
31:11	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
Jacob:	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
31:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lift	1
up	1
now	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
see,	1
all	1
the	1
rams	1
which	1
leap	1
upon	1
the	1
cattle	1
are	1
ringstraked,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
grisled:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
that	1
Laban	1
doeth	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
31:13	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Bethel,	1
where	1
thou	1
anointedst	1
the	1
pillar,	1
and	1
where	1
thou	1
vowedst	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
me:	1
now	1
arise,	1
get	1
thee	1
out	1
from	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
kindred.	1
	1
31:14	1
And	1
Rachel	1
and	1
Leah	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
portion	1
or	1
inheritance	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
father's	1
house?	1
	1
31:15	1
Are	1
we	1
not	1
counted	1
of	1
him	1
strangers?	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
sold	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
quite	1
devoured	1
also	1
our	1
money.	1
	1
31:16	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
riches	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
from	1
our	1
father,	1
that	1
is	1
ours,	1
and	1
our	1
children's:	1
now	1
then,	1
whatsoever	1
God	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
do.	1
	1
31:17	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
wives	1
upon	1
camels;	1
31:18	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
all	1
his	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
goods	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gotten,	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
his	1
getting,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gotten	1
in	1
Padanaram,	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
31:19	1
And	1
Laban	1
went	1
to	1
shear	1
his	1
sheep:	1
and	1
Rachel	1
had	1
stolen	1
the	1
images	1
that	1
were	1
her	1
father's.	1
	1
31:20	1
And	1
Jacob	1
stole	1
away	1
unawares	1
to	1
Laban	1
the	1
Syrian,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
fled.	1
	1
31:21	1
So	1
he	1
fled	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had;	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
mount	1
Gilead.	1
	1
31:22	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Laban	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
that	1
Jacob	1
was	1
fled.	1
	1
31:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
brethren	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
pursued	1
after	1
him	1
seven	1
days'	1
journey;	1
and	1
they	1
overtook	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
Gilead.	1
	1
31:24	1
And	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
Laban	1
the	1
Syrian	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
thou	1
speak	1
not	1
to	1
Jacob	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
	1
31:25	1
Then	1
Laban	1
overtook	1
Jacob.	1
Now	1
Jacob	1
had	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
in	1
the	1
mount:	1
and	1
Laban	1
with	1
his	1
brethren	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
31:26	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
stolen	1
away	1
unawares	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
my	1
daughters,	1
as	1
captives	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
sword?	1
	1
31:27	1
Wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
flee	1
away	1
secretly,	1
and	1
steal	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
and	1
didst	1
not	1
tell	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
sent	1
thee	1
away	1
with	1
mirth,	1
and	1
with	1
songs,	1
with	1
tabret,	1
and	1
with	1
harp?	1
31:28	1
And	1
hast	1
not	1
suffered	1
me	1
to	1
kiss	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
my	1
daughters?	1
thou	1
hast	1
now	1
done	1
foolishly	1
in	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
31:29	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
hurt:	1
but	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
yesternight,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
thou	1
heed	1
that	1
thou	1
speak	1
not	1
to	1
Jacob	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
	1
31:30	1
And	1
now,	1
though	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
needs	1
be	1
gone,	1
because	1
thou	1
sore	1
longedst	1
after	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
yet	1
wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
stolen	1
my	1
gods?	1
	1
31:31	1
And	1
Jacob	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Laban,	1
Because	1
I	1
was	1
afraid:	1
for	1
I	1
said,	1
Peradventure	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
take	1
by	1
force	1
thy	1
daughters	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
31:32	1
With	1
whomsoever	1
thou	1
findest	1
thy	1
gods,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
live:	1
before	1
our	1
brethren	1
discern	1
thou	1
what	1
is	1
thine	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
thee.	1
For	1
Jacob	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
Rachel	1
had	1
stolen	1
them.	1
	1
31:33	1
And	1
Laban	1
went	1
into	1
Jacob's	1
tent,	1
and	1
into	1
Leah's	1
tent,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
two	1
maidservants'	1
tents;	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
not.	1
Then	1
went	1
he	1
out	1
of	1
Leah's	1
tent,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
Rachel's	1
tent.	1
	1
31:34	1
Now	1
Rachel	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
images,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
camel's	1
furniture,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
them.	1
And	1
Laban	1
searched	1
all	1
the	1
tent,	1
but	1
found	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
31:35	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
father,	1
Let	1
it	1
not	1
displease	1
my	1
lord	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
rise	1
up	1
before	1
thee;	1
for	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
women	1
is	1
upon	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
searched	1
but	1
found	1
not	1
the	1
images.	1
	1
31:36	1
And	1
Jacob	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
chode	1
with	1
Laban:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Laban,	1
What	1
is	1
my	1
trespass?	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
sin,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
so	1
hotly	1
pursued	1
after	1
me?	1
	1
31:37	1
Whereas	1
thou	1
hast	1
searched	1
all	1
my	1
stuff,	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
found	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
household	1
stuff?	1
set	1
it	1
here	1
before	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
judge	1
betwixt	1
us	1
both.	1
	1
31:38	1
This	1
twenty	1
years	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
with	1
thee;	1
thy	1
ewes	1
and	1
thy	1
she	1
goats	1
have	1
not	1
cast	1
their	1
young,	1
and	1
the	1
rams	1
of	1
thy	1
flock	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
eaten.	1
	1
31:39	1
That	1
which	1
was	1
torn	1
of	1
beasts	1
I	1
brought	1
not	1
unto	1
thee;	1
I	1
bare	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
it;	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
didst	1
thou	1
require	1
it,	1
whether	1
stolen	1
by	1
day,	1
or	1
stolen	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
31:40	1
Thus	1
I	1
was;	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
drought	1
consumed	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
frost	1
by	1
night;	1
and	1
my	1
sleep	1
departed	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
31:41	1
Thus	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
twenty	1
years	1
in	1
thy	1
house;	1
I	1
served	1
thee	1
fourteen	1
years	1
for	1
thy	1
two	1
daughters,	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
for	1
thy	1
cattle:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
changed	1
my	1
wages	1
ten	1
times.	1
	1
31:42	1
Except	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
me,	1
surely	1
thou	1
hadst	1
sent	1
me	1
away	1
now	1
empty.	1
God	1
hath	1
seen	1
mine	1
affliction	1
and	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
thee	1
yesternight.	1
	1
31:43	1
And	1
Laban	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
These	1
daughters	1
are	1
my	1
daughters,	1
and	1
these	1
children	1
are	1
my	1
children,	1
and	1
these	1
cattle	1
are	1
my	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
seest	1
is	1
mine:	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
these	1
my	1
daughters,	1
or	1
unto	1
their	1
children	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
born?	1
31:44	1
Now	1
therefore	1
come	1
thou,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
covenant,	1
I	1
and	1
thou;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
31:45	1
And	1
Jacob	1
took	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
pillar.	1
	1
31:46	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
Gather	1
stones;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
stones,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
heap:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
there	1
upon	1
the	1
heap.	1
	1
31:47	1
And	1
Laban	1
called	1
it	1
Jegarsahadutha:	1
but	1
Jacob	1
called	1
it	1
Galeed.	1
	1
31:48	1
And	1
Laban	1
said,	1
This	1
heap	1
is	1
a	1
witness	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
Therefore	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
called	1
Galeed;	1
31:49	1
And	1
Mizpah;	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
watch	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
absent	1
one	1
from	1
another.	1
	1
31:50	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
afflict	1
my	1
daughters,	1
or	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
other	1
wives	1
beside	1
my	1
daughters,	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
with	1
us;	1
see,	1
God	1
is	1
witness	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
31:51	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
Behold	1
this	1
heap,	1
and	1
behold	1
this	1
pillar,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
cast	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
thee:	1
31:52	1
This	1
heap	1
be	1
witness,	1
and	1
this	1
pillar	1
be	1
witness,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
this	1
heap	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
this	1
heap	1
and	1
this	1
pillar	1
unto	1
me,	1
for	1
harm.	1
	1
31:53	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Nahor,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
father,	1
judge	1
betwixt	1
us.	1
And	1
Jacob	1
sware	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Isaac.	1
	1
31:54	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
offered	1
sacrifice	1
upon	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
brethren	1
to	1
eat	1
bread:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
bread,	1
and	1
tarried	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
31:55	1
And	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Laban	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them:	1
and	1
Laban	1
departed,	1
and	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
32:1	1
And	1
Jacob	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
32:2	1
And	1
when	1
Jacob	1
saw	1
them,	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
God's	1
host:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Mahanaim.	1
	1
32:3	1
And	1
Jacob	1
sent	1
messengers	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
Esau	1
his	1
brother	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Seir,	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Edom.	1
	1
32:4	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
speak	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
Esau;	1
Thy	1
servant	1
Jacob	1
saith	1
thus,	1
I	1
have	1
sojourned	1
with	1
Laban,	1
and	1
stayed	1
there	1
until	1
now:	1
32:5	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
oxen,	1
and	1
asses,	1
flocks,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
womenservants:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
tell	1
my	1
lord,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
the	1
messengers	1
returned	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
saying,	1
We	1
came	1
to	1
thy	1
brother	1
Esau,	1
and	1
also	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
meet	1
thee,	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
men	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
32:7	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
was	1
greatly	1
afraid	1
and	1
distressed:	1
and	1
he	1
divided	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
flocks,	1
and	1
herds,	1
and	1
the	1
camels,	1
into	1
two	1
bands;	1
32:8	1
And	1
said,	1
If	1
Esau	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
company,	1
and	1
smite	1
it,	1
then	1
the	1
other	1
company	1
which	1
is	1
left	1
shall	1
escape.	1
	1
32:9	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
Isaac,	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
saidst	1
unto	1
me,	1
Return	1
unto	1
thy	1
country,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deal	1
well	1
with	1
thee:	1
32:10	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mercies,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
truth,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant;	1
for	1
with	1
my	1
staff	1
I	1
passed	1
over	1
this	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
two	1
bands.	1
	1
32:11	1
Deliver	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
brother,	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Esau:	1
for	1
I	1
fear	1
him,	1
lest	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
smite	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
with	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
32:12	1
And	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
do	1
thee	1
good,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
seed	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
numbered	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
32:13	1
And	1
he	1
lodged	1
there	1
that	1
same	1
night;	1
and	1
took	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
present	1
for	1
Esau	1
his	1
brother;	1
32:14	1
Two	1
hundred	1
she	1
goats,	1
and	1
twenty	1
he	1
goats,	1
two	1
hundred	1
ewes,	1
and	1
twenty	1
rams,	1
32:15	1
Thirty	1
milch	1
camels	1
with	1
their	1
colts,	1
forty	1
kine,	1
and	1
ten	1
bulls,	1
twenty	1
she	1
asses,	1
and	1
ten	1
foals.	1
	1
32:16	1
And	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
every	1
drove	1
by	1
themselves;	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Pass	1
over	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
space	1
betwixt	1
drove	1
and	1
drove.	1
	1
32:17	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
foremost,	1
saying,	1
When	1
Esau	1
my	1
brother	1
meeteth	1
thee,	1
and	1
asketh	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Whose	1
art	1
thou?	1
and	1
whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
and	1
whose	1
are	1
these	1
before	1
thee?	1
	1
32:18	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
They	1
be	1
thy	1
servant	1
Jacob's;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
present	1
sent	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
Esau:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
also	1
he	1
is	1
behind	1
us.	1
	1
32:19	1
And	1
so	1
commanded	1
he	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
droves,	1
saying,	1
On	1
this	1
manner	1
shall	1
ye	1
speak	1
unto	1
Esau,	1
when	1
ye	1
find	1
him.	1
	1
32:20	1
And	1
say	1
ye	1
moreover,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
servant	1
Jacob	1
is	1
behind	1
us.	1
For	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
appease	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
present	1
that	1
goeth	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
afterward	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
his	1
face;	1
peradventure	1
he	1
will	1
accept	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
32:21	1
So	1
went	1
the	1
present	1
over	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
himself	1
lodged	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
company.	1
	1
32:22	1
And	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
two	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
womenservants,	1
and	1
his	1
eleven	1
sons,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
ford	1
Jabbok.	1
	1
32:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
brook,	1
and	1
sent	1
over	1
that	1
he	1
had.	1
	1
32:24	1
And	1
Jacob	1
was	1
left	1
alone;	1
and	1
there	1
wrestled	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
him	1
until	1
the	1
breaking	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
32:25	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
prevailed	1
not	1
against	1
him,	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
thigh;	1
and	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
Jacob's	1
thigh	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
joint,	1
as	1
he	1
wrestled	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
32:26	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
go,	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
breaketh.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
thee	1
go,	1
except	1
thou	1
bless	1
me.	1
	1
32:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Jacob.	1
	1
32:28	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
no	1
more	1
Jacob,	1
but	1
Israel:	1
for	1
as	1
a	1
prince	1
hast	1
thou	1
power	1
with	1
God	1
and	1
with	1
men,	1
and	1
hast	1
prevailed.	1
	1
32:29	1
And	1
Jacob	1
asked	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
name.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
dost	1
ask	1
after	1
my	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
blessed	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
32:30	1
And	1
Jacob	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Peniel:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
God	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
preserved.	1
	1
32:31	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
Penuel	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
halted	1
upon	1
his	1
thigh.	1
	1
32:32	1
Therefore	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
eat	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
sinew	1
which	1
shrank,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
the	1
thigh,	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
because	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
Jacob's	1
thigh	1
in	1
the	1
sinew	1
that	1
shrank.	1
	1
33:1	1
And	1
Jacob	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Esau	1
came,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
four	1
hundred	1
men.	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
the	1
children	1
unto	1
Leah,	1
and	1
unto	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
two	1
handmaids.	1
	1
33:2	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
handmaids	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
foremost,	1
and	1
Leah	1
and	1
her	1
children	1
after,	1
and	1
Rachel	1
and	1
Joseph	1
hindermost.	1
	1
33:3	1
And	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
seven	1
times,	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
33:4	1
And	1
Esau	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
wept.	1
	1
33:5	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
the	1
children;	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
are	1
those	1
with	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
children	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
graciously	1
given	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
33:6	1
Then	1
the	1
handmaidens	1
came	1
near,	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
themselves.	1
	1
33:7	1
And	1
Leah	1
also	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
bowed	1
themselves:	1
and	1
after	1
came	1
Joseph	1
near	1
and	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
themselves.	1
	1
33:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
meanest	1
thou	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
drove	1
which	1
I	1
met?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
to	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
33:9	1
And	1
Esau	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
enough,	1
my	1
brother;	1
keep	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
unto	1
thyself.	1
	1
33:10	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
Nay,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
if	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
then	1
receive	1
my	1
present	1
at	1
my	1
hand:	1
for	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
face,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
pleased	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
33:11	1
Take,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
my	1
blessing	1
that	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
thee;	1
because	1
God	1
hath	1
dealt	1
graciously	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
enough.	1
And	1
he	1
urged	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
it.	1
	1
33:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
take	1
our	1
journey,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
33:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
lord	1
knoweth	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
tender,	1
and	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
with	1
young	1
are	1
with	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
men	1
should	1
overdrive	1
them	1
one	1
day,	1
all	1
the	1
flock	1
will	1
die.	1
	1
33:14	1
Let	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
pass	1
over	1
before	1
his	1
servant:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
lead	1
on	1
softly,	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
cattle	1
that	1
goeth	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
endure,	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
unto	1
Seir.	1
	1
33:15	1
And	1
Esau	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
leave	1
with	1
thee	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
folk	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
needeth	1
it?	1
let	1
me	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
33:16	1
So	1
Esau	1
returned	1
that	1
day	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
unto	1
Seir.	1
	1
33:17	1
And	1
Jacob	1
journeyed	1
to	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
built	1
him	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
made	1
booths	1
for	1
his	1
cattle:	1
therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
is	1
called	1
Succoth.	1
	1
33:18	1
And	1
Jacob	1
came	1
to	1
Shalem,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
from	1
Padanaram;	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
before	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
33:19	1
And	1
he	1
bought	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
a	1
field,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
spread	1
his	1
tent,	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Hamor,	1
Shechem's	1
father,	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
pieces	1
of	1
money.	1
	1
33:20	1
And	1
he	1
erected	1
there	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
EleloheIsrael.	1
	1
34:1	1
And	1
Dinah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Leah,	1
which	1
she	1
bare	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
34:2	1
And	1
when	1
Shechem	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hamor	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
defiled	1
her.	1
	1
34:3	1
And	1
his	1
soul	1
clave	1
unto	1
Dinah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
damsel,	1
and	1
spake	1
kindly	1
unto	1
the	1
damsel.	1
	1
34:4	1
And	1
Shechem	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
Hamor,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
me	1
this	1
damsel	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
34:5	1
And	1
Jacob	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
defiled	1
Dinah	1
his	1
daughter:	1
now	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
with	1
his	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
come.	1
	1
34:6	1
And	1
Hamor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Shechem	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
to	1
commune	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
34:7	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
grieved,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
wroth,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
wrought	1
folly	1
in	1
Israel	1
in	1
lying	1
with	1
Jacob's	1
daughter:	1
which	1
thing	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
34:8	1
And	1
Hamor	1
communed	1
with	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
soul	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
Shechem	1
longeth	1
for	1
your	1
daughter:	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
give	1
her	1
him	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
34:9	1
And	1
make	1
ye	1
marriages	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
give	1
your	1
daughters	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
take	1
our	1
daughters	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
34:10	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
us:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
before	1
you;	1
dwell	1
and	1
trade	1
ye	1
therein,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
possessions	1
therein.	1
	1
34:11	1
And	1
Shechem	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
unto	1
her	1
brethren,	1
Let	1
me	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
give.	1
	1
34:12	1
Ask	1
me	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
dowry	1
and	1
gift,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
according	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
me:	1
but	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
damsel	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
34:13	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
answered	1
Shechem	1
and	1
Hamor	1
his	1
father	1
deceitfully,	1
and	1
said,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
defiled	1
Dinah	1
their	1
sister:	1
34:14	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
We	1
cannot	1
do	1
this	1
thing,	1
to	1
give	1
our	1
sister	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
uncircumcised;	1
for	1
that	1
were	1
a	1
reproach	1
unto	1
us:	1
34:15	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
will	1
we	1
consent	1
unto	1
you:	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
we	1
be,	1
that	1
every	1
male	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
circumcised;	1
34:16	1
Then	1
will	1
we	1
give	1
our	1
daughters	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
daughters	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
dwell	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
become	1
one	1
people.	1
	1
34:17	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
us,	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised;	1
then	1
will	1
we	1
take	1
our	1
daughter,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
gone.	1
	1
34:18	1
And	1
their	1
words	1
pleased	1
Hamor,	1
and	1
Shechem	1
Hamor's	1
son.	1
	1
34:19	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
deferred	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
thing,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
delight	1
in	1
Jacob's	1
daughter:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
honourable	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
34:20	1
And	1
Hamor	1
and	1
Shechem	1
his	1
son	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
their	1
city,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
their	1
city,	1
saying,	1
34:21	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
peaceable	1
with	1
us;	1
therefore	1
let	1
them	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
trade	1
therein;	1
for	1
the	1
land,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
large	1
enough	1
for	1
them;	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
their	1
daughters	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
wives,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
give	1
them	1
our	1
daughters.	1
	1
34:22	1
Only	1
herein	1
will	1
the	1
men	1
consent	1
unto	1
us	1
for	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
us,	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
people,	1
if	1
every	1
male	1
among	1
us	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
circumcised.	1
	1
34:23	1
Shall	1
not	1
their	1
cattle	1
and	1
their	1
substance	1
and	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
their's	1
be	1
our's?	1
only	1
let	1
us	1
consent	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
dwell	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
34:24	1
And	1
unto	1
Hamor	1
and	1
unto	1
Shechem	1
his	1
son	1
hearkened	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
city;	1
and	1
every	1
male	1
was	1
circumcised,	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
city.	1
	1
34:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
sore,	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Simeon	1
and	1
Levi,	1
Dinah's	1
brethren,	1
took	1
each	1
man	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
city	1
boldly,	1
and	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
males.	1
	1
34:26	1
And	1
they	1
slew	1
Hamor	1
and	1
Shechem	1
his	1
son	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
took	1
Dinah	1
out	1
of	1
Shechem's	1
house,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
34:27	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
slain,	1
and	1
spoiled	1
the	1
city,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
defiled	1
their	1
sister.	1
	1
34:28	1
They	1
took	1
their	1
sheep,	1
and	1
their	1
oxen,	1
and	1
their	1
asses,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
34:29	1
And	1
all	1
their	1
wealth,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
took	1
they	1
captive,	1
and	1
spoiled	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
34:30	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
to	1
Simeon	1
and	1
Levi,	1
Ye	1
have	1
troubled	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
stink	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
among	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites:	1
and	1
I	1
being	1
few	1
in	1
number,	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
slay	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
house.	1
	1
34:31	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Should	1
he	1
deal	1
with	1
our	1
sister	1
as	1
with	1
an	1
harlot?	1
35:1	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
and	1
make	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
God,	1
that	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
when	1
thou	1
fleddest	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Esau	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
35:2	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
household,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
Put	1
away	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
that	1
are	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
be	1
clean,	1
and	1
change	1
your	1
garments:	1
35:3	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
arise,	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Bethel;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
God,	1
who	1
answered	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
distress,	1
and	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
went.	1
	1
35:4	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
all	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
earrings	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
ears;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
hid	1
them	1
under	1
the	1
oak	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
Shechem.	1
	1
35:5	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed:	1
and	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
were	1
round	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
pursue	1
after	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
35:6	1
So	1
Jacob	1
came	1
to	1
Luz,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
that	1
is,	1
Bethel,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
35:7	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
place	1
Elbethel:	1
because	1
there	1
God	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
35:8	1
But	1
Deborah	1
Rebekah's	1
nurse	1
died,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
buried	1
beneath	1
Bethel	1
under	1
an	1
oak:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
Allonbachuth.	1
	1
35:9	1
And	1
God	1
appeared	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
again,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Padanaram,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
35:10	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
name	1
is	1
Jacob:	1
thy	1
name	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
any	1
more	1
Jacob,	1
but	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
name:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Israel.	1
	1
35:11	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
God	1
Almighty:	1
be	1
fruitful	1
and	1
multiply;	1
a	1
nation	1
and	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
kings	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
loins;	1
35:12	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac,	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
35:13	1
And	1
God	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
35:14	1
And	1
Jacob	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
pillar	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
stone:	1
and	1
he	1
poured	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
thereon,	1
and	1
he	1
poured	1
oil	1
thereon.	1
	1
35:15	1
And	1
Jacob	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
God	1
spake	1
with	1
him,	1
Bethel.	1
	1
35:16	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Bethel;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Ephrath:	1
and	1
Rachel	1
travailed,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
hard	1
labour.	1
	1
35:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
hard	1
labour,	1
that	1
the	1
midwife	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
this	1
son	1
also.	1
	1
35:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
her	1
soul	1
was	1
in	1
departing,	1
(for	1
she	1
died)	1
that	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Benoni:	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
called	1
him	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
35:19	1
And	1
Rachel	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Ephrath,	1
which	1
is	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
35:20	1
And	1
Jacob	1
set	1
a	1
pillar	1
upon	1
her	1
grave:	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
Rachel's	1
grave	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
35:21	1
And	1
Israel	1
journeyed,	1
and	1
spread	1
his	1
tent	1
beyond	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Edar.	1
	1
35:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
that	1
land,	1
that	1
Reuben	1
went	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
Bilhah	1
his	1
father's	1
concubine:	1
and	1
Israel	1
heard	1
it.	1
Now	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
were	1
twelve:	1
35:23	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Leah;	1
Reuben,	1
Jacob's	1
firstborn,	1
and	1
Simeon,	1
and	1
Levi,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Issachar,	1
and	1
Zebulun:	1
35:24	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Rachel;	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
Benjamin:	1
35:25	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Bilhah,	1
Rachel's	1
handmaid;	1
Dan,	1
and	1
Naphtali:	1
35:26	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zilpah,	1
Leah's	1
handmaid:	1
Gad,	1
and	1
Asher:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
which	1
were	1
born	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
Padanaram.	1
	1
35:27	1
And	1
Jacob	1
came	1
unto	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father	1
unto	1
Mamre,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Arbah,	1
which	1
is	1
Hebron,	1
where	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac	1
sojourned.	1
	1
35:28	1
And	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Isaac	1
were	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
years.	1
	1
35:29	1
And	1
Isaac	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
and	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
being	1
old	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
days:	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
Esau	1
and	1
Jacob	1
buried	1
him.	1
	1
36:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Esau,	1
who	1
is	1
Edom.	1
	1
36:2	1
Esau	1
took	1
his	1
wives	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
Adah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Elon	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
Aholibamah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Anah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zibeon	1
the	1
Hivite;	1
36:3	1
And	1
Bashemath	1
Ishmael's	1
daughter,	1
sister	1
of	1
Nebajoth.	1
	1
36:4	1
And	1
Adah	1
bare	1
to	1
Esau	1
Eliphaz;	1
and	1
Bashemath	1
bare	1
Reuel;	1
36:5	1
And	1
Aholibamah	1
bare	1
Jeush,	1
and	1
Jaalam,	1
and	1
Korah:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Esau,	1
which	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
36:6	1
And	1
Esau	1
took	1
his	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
daughters,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
his	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
beasts,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
substance,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
Jacob.	1
	1
36:7	1
For	1
their	1
riches	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
dwell	1
together;	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
they	1
were	1
strangers	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
cattle.	1
	1
36:8	1
Thus	1
dwelt	1
Esau	1
in	1
mount	1
Seir:	1
Esau	1
is	1
Edom.	1
	1
36:9	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Esau	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
Edomites	1
in	1
mount	1
Seir:	1
36:10	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Esau's	1
sons;	1
Eliphaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Adah	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Esau,	1
Reuel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bashemath	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Esau.	1
	1
36:11	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliphaz	1
were	1
Teman,	1
Omar,	1
Zepho,	1
and	1
Gatam,	1
and	1
Kenaz.	1
	1
36:12	1
And	1
Timna	1
was	1
concubine	1
to	1
Eliphaz	1
Esau's	1
son;	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
to	1
Eliphaz	1
Amalek:	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Adah	1
Esau's	1
wife.	1
	1
36:13	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Reuel;	1
Nahath,	1
and	1
Zerah,	1
Shammah,	1
and	1
Mizzah:	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Bashemath	1
Esau's	1
wife.	1
	1
36:14	1
And	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aholibamah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Anah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zibeon,	1
Esau's	1
wife:	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
to	1
Esau	1
Jeush,	1
and	1
Jaalam,	1
and	1
Korah.	1
	1
36:15	1
These	1
were	1
dukes	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Esau:	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliphaz	1
the	1
firstborn	1
son	1
of	1
Esau;	1
duke	1
Teman,	1

duke	1
Zepho,	1
duke	1
Kenaz,	1
36:16	1
Duke	1
Korah,	1
duke	1
Gatam,	1
and	1
duke	1
Amalek:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
dukes	1
that	1
came	1
of	1
Eliphaz	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom;	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Adah.	1
	1
36:17	1
And	1
these	1
are	1

in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom;	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Bashemath	1
Esau's	1
wife.	1
	1
36:18	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aholibamah	1
Esau's	1

of	1
Aholibamah	1
the	1

	1
36:19	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Esau,	1
who	1
is	1
Edom,	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
their	1
dukes.	1
	1
36:20	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1

the	1

who	1
inhabited	1
the	1
land;	1
Lotan,	1

and	1
Zibeon,	1
and	1
Anah,	1
36:21	1
And	1
Dishon,	1

these	1

of	1
the	1
Horites,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Seir	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom.	1
	1
36:22	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Lotan	1
were	1
Hori	1
and	1
Hemam;	1
and	1
Lotan's	1
sister	1
was	1
Timna.	1
	1
36:23	1
And	1
the	1

as	1
he	1

the	1

of	1
Zibeon	1
his	1

	1
36:25	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Anah	1
were	1
these;	1
Dishon,	1
and	1
Aholibamah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Anah.	1
	1
36:26	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dishon;	1
Hemdan,	1
and	1
Eshban,	1
and	1
Ithran,	1

	1
36:27	1
The	1
children	1

Ezer	1
are	1
these;	1
Bilhan,	1
and	1
Zaavan,	1
and	1
Akan.	1
	1
36:28	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
Dishan	1
are	1
these;	1
Uz,	1
and	1
Aran.	1
	1
36:29	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
dukes	1
that	1
came	1
of	1
the	1
Horites;	1
duke	1
Lotan,	1
duke	1

36:30	1
Duke	1

that	1

Hori,	1
among	1
their	1
dukes	1
in	1
the	1
land	1

	1
36:31	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
reigned	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom,	1
before	1
there	1
reigned	1
any	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
36:32	1
And	1

the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
reigned	1
in	1
Edom:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1

	1
36:33	1
And	1

And	1

and	1
Hadad	1
the	1

of	1
Bedad,	1
who	1
smote	1
Midian	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Moab,	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1

was	1

	1
36:36	1
And	1
Hadad	1
died,	1
and	1
Samlah	1
of	1
Masrekah	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1

	1
36:37	1
And	1
Samlah	1
died,	1
and	1
Saul	1
of	1
Rehoboth	1
by	1
the	1

	1
36:38	1
And	1

and	1

and	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

was	1
Pau;	1
and	1
his	1
wife's	1
name	1
was	1
Mehetabel,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Matred,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Mezahab.	1
	1
36:40	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
dukes	1
that	1
came	1
of	1
Esau,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families,	1
after	1
their	1
places,	1
by	1
their	1
names;	1

36:43	1
Duke	1
Magdiel,	1

Iram:	1
these	1
be	1
the	1
dukes	1
of	1
Edom,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
habitations	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
possession:	1
he	1
is	1
Esau	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
Edomites.	1
	1
37:1	1
And	1
Jacob	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
37:2	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
Joseph,	1
being	1
seventeen	1
years	1
old,	1
was	1
feeding	1
the	1
flock	1
with	1
his	1
brethren;	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Bilhah,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zilpah,	1
his	1
father's	1
wives:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
their	1
evil	1
report.	1
	1
37:3	1
Now	1
Israel	1
loved	1
Joseph	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
his	1
children,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
age:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
many	1
colours.	1
	1
37:4	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
brethren	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
father	1
loved	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
his	1
brethren,	1
they	1
hated	1
him,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
peaceably	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
37:5	1
And	1
Joseph	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
it	1
his	1
brethren:	1
and	1
they	1
hated	1
him	1
yet	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
37:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
this	1
dream	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed:	1
37:7	1
For,	1
behold,	1
we	1
were	1
binding	1
sheaves	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
my	1
sheaf	1
arose,	1
and	1
also	1
stood	1
upright;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
your	1
sheaves	1
stood	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
made	1
obeisance	1
to	1
my	1
sheaf.	1
	1
37:8	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Shalt	1
thou	1
indeed	1
reign	1
over	1
us?	1
or	1
shalt	1
thou	1
indeed	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
hated	1
him	1
yet	1
the	1
more	1
for	1
his	1
dreams,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
37:9	1
And	1
he	1
dreamed	1
yet	1
another	1
dream,	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream	1
more;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
the	1
eleven	1
stars	1
made	1
obeisance	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
37:10	1
And	1
he	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
brethren:	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
dream	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
dreamed?	1
	1
Shall	1
I	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
indeed	1
come	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
ourselves	1
to	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
37:11	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
envied	1
him;	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
observed	1
the	1
saying.	1
	1
37:12	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
went	1
to	1
feed	1
their	1
father's	1
flock	1
in	1
Shechem.	1
	1
37:13	1
And	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Do	1
not	1
thy	1
brethren	1
feed	1
the	1
flock	1
in	1
Shechem?	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
unto	1
them.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
37:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Go,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
flocks;	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
word	1
again.	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Shechem.	1
	1
37:15	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
found	1
him,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
was	1
wandering	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
	1
37:16	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
seek	1
my	1
brethren:	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
where	1
they	1
feed	1
their	1
flocks.	1
	1
37:17	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said,	1
They	1
are	1
departed	1
hence;	1
for	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
say,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
Dothan.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
went	1
after	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
in	1
Dothan.	1
	1
37:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
before	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
them,	1
they	1
conspired	1
against	1
him	1
to	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
37:19	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
dreamer	1
cometh.	1
	1
37:20	1
Come	1
now	1
therefore,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
slay	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
some	1
pit,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
say,	1
Some	1
evil	1
beast	1
hath	1
devoured	1
him:	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
his	1
dreams.	1
	1
37:21	1
And	1
Reuben	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
37:22	1
And	1
Reuben	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Shed	1
no	1
blood,	1
but	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
this	1
pit	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
lay	1
no	1
hand	1
upon	1
him;	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
rid	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
again.	1
	1
37:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Joseph	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
stript	1
Joseph	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
coat,	1
his	1
coat	1
of	1
many	1
colours	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
him;	1
37:24	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
pit:	1
and	1
the	1
pit	1
was	1
empty,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
37:25	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
bread:	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
Ishmeelites	1
came	1
from	1
Gilead	1
with	1
their	1
camels	1
bearing	1
spicery	1
and	1
balm	1
and	1
myrrh,	1
going	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
Egypt.	1
	1
37:26	1
And	1
Judah	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
What	1
profit	1
is	1
it	1
if	1
we	1
slay	1
our	1
brother,	1
and	1
conceal	1
his	1
blood?	1
	1
37:27	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
sell	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Ishmeelites,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
our	1
hand	1
be	1
upon	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
brother	1
and	1
our	1
flesh.	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
content.	1
	1
37:28	1
Then	1
there	1
passed	1
by	1
Midianites	1
merchantmen;	1
and	1
they	1
drew	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
Joseph	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
sold	1
Joseph	1
to	1
the	1
Ishmeelites	1
for	1
twenty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
Joseph	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
37:29	1
And	1
Reuben	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
pit;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Joseph	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
pit;	1
and	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes.	1
	1
37:30	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
child	1
is	1
not;	1
and	1
I,	1
whither	1
shall	1
I	1
go?	1
	1
37:31	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Joseph's	1
coat,	1
and	1
killed	1
a	1
kid	1
of	1
the	1
goats,	1
and	1
dipped	1
the	1
coat	1
in	1
the	1
blood;	1
37:32	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
the	1
coat	1
of	1
many	1
colours,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
father;	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
have	1
we	1
found:	1
know	1
now	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
thy	1
son's	1
coat	1
or	1
no.	1
	1
37:33	1
And	1
he	1
knew	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
son's	1
coat;	1
an	1
evil	1
beast	1
hath	1
devoured	1
him;	1
Joseph	1
is	1
without	1
doubt	1
rent	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
37:34	1
And	1
Jacob	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
put	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
his	1
loins,	1
and	1
mourned	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
37:35	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
daughters	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
comfort	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
comforted;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
grave	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
mourning.	1
Thus	1
his	1
father	1
wept	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
37:36	1
And	1
the	1
Midianites	1
sold	1
him	1
into	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
Potiphar,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
Pharaoh's,	1
and	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard.	1
	1
38:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
that	1
Judah	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
turned	1
in	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
Adullamite,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Hirah.	1
	1
38:2	1
And	1
Judah	1
saw	1
there	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
Canaanite,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Shuah;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
38:3	1
And	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Er.	1
	1
38:4	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Onan.	1
	1
38:5	1
And	1
she	1
yet	1
again	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Shelah:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
Chezib,	1
when	1
she	1
bare	1
him.	1
	1
38:6	1
And	1
Judah	1
took	1
a	1
wife	1
for	1
Er	1
his	1
firstborn,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Tamar.	1
	1
38:7	1
And	1
Er,	1
Judah's	1
firstborn,	1
was	1
wicked	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
38:8	1
And	1
Judah	1
said	1
unto	1
Onan,	1
Go	1
in	1
unto	1
thy	1
brother's	1
wife,	1
and	1
marry	1
her,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
to	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
38:9	1
And	1
Onan	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
his;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
his	1
brother's	1
wife,	1
that	1
he	1
spilled	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
lest	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
seed	1
to	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
38:10	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
displeased	1
the	1
LORD:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
slew	1
him	1
also.	1
	1
38:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Judah	1
to	1
Tamar	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
Remain	1
a	1
widow	1
at	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
till	1
Shelah	1
my	1
son	1
be	1
grown:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
Lest	1
peradventure	1
he	1
die	1
also,	1
as	1
his	1
brethren	1
did.	1
And	1
Tamar	1
went	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
38:12	1
And	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Shuah	1
Judah's	1
wife	1
died;	1
and	1
Judah	1
was	1
comforted,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
his	1
sheepshearers	1
to	1
Timnath,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
Hirah	1
the	1
Adullamite.	1
	1
38:13	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Tamar,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
thy	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
goeth	1
up	1
to	1
Timnath	1
to	1
shear	1
his	1
sheep.	1
	1
38:14	1
And	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
widow's	1
garments	1
off	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
covered	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
vail,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
herself,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
an	1
open	1
place,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Timnath;	1
for	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
Shelah	1
was	1
grown,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
38:15	1
When	1
Judah	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
harlot;	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
covered	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
38:16	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
unto	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
to,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
me	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
thee;	1
(for	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law.)	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
give	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
38:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
a	1
kid	1
from	1
the	1
flock.	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
pledge,	1
till	1
thou	1
send	1
it?	1
	1
38:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
pledge	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
thee?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Thy	1
signet,	1
and	1
thy	1
bracelets,	1
and	1
thy	1
staff	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
her,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
conceived	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
38:19	1
And	1
she	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
laid	1
by	1
her	1
vail	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
her	1
widowhood.	1
	1
38:20	1
And	1
Judah	1
sent	1
the	1
kid	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
Adullamite,	1
to	1
receive	1
his	1
pledge	1
from	1
the	1
woman's	1
hand:	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
not.	1
	1
38:21	1
Then	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
harlot,	1
that	1
was	1
openly	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
harlot	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
38:22	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Judah,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
her;	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
said,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
harlot	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
38:23	1
And	1
Judah	1
said,	1
Let	1
her	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
lest	1
we	1
be	1
shamed:	1
behold,	1
I	1
sent	1
this	1
kid,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
found	1
her.	1
	1
38:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
three	1
months	1
after,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Tamar	1
thy	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
hath	1
played	1
the	1
harlot;	1
and	1
also,	1
behold,	1
she	1
is	1
with	1
child	1
by	1
whoredom.	1
And	1
Judah	1
said,	1
Bring	1
her	1
forth,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
burnt.	1
	1
38:25	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
brought	1
forth,	1
she	1
sent	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
saying,	1
By	1
the	1
man,	1
whose	1
these	1
are,	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
child:	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
Discern,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
whose	1
are	1
these,	1
the	1
signet,	1
and	1
bracelets,	1
and	1
staff.	1
	1
38:26	1
And	1
Judah	1
acknowledged	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
She	1
hath	1
been	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
I;	1
because	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
Shelah	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
again	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
38:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
travail,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
twins	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
38:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
travailed,	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
the	1
midwife	1
took	1
and	1
bound	1
upon	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
scarlet	1
thread,	1
saying,	1
This	1
came	1
out	1
first.	1
	1
38:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
back	1
his	1
hand,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
his	1
brother	1
came	1
out:	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
How	1
hast	1
thou	1
broken	1
forth?	1
this	1
breach	1
be	1
upon	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Pharez.	1
	1
38:30	1
And	1
afterward	1
came	1
out	1
his	1
brother,	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
scarlet	1
thread	1
upon	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Zarah.	1
	1
39:1	1
And	1
Joseph	1
was	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
Potiphar,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
an	1
Egyptian,	1
bought	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Ishmeelites,	1
which	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
thither.	1
	1
39:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
prosperous	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
the	1
Egyptian.	1
	1
39:3	1
And	1
his	1
master	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
39:4	1
And	1
Joseph	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
he	1
served	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
overseer	1
over	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
he	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
39:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
overseer	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
the	1
Egyptian's	1
house	1
for	1
Joseph's	1
sake;	1
and	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
39:6	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
Joseph's	1
hand;	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
ought	1
he	1
had,	1
save	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
eat.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
was	1
a	1
goodly	1
person,	1
and	1
well	1
favoured.	1
	1
39:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
his	1
master's	1
wife	1
cast	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Joseph;	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
Lie	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
39:8	1
But	1
he	1
refused,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
master's	1
wife,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
master	1
wotteth	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
committed	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
to	1
my	1
hand;	1
39:9	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
greater	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
than	1
I;	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
kept	1
back	1
any	1
thing	1
from	1
me	1
but	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
his	1
wife:	1
how	1
then	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
great	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
sin	1
against	1
God?	1
	1
39:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
she	1
spake	1
to	1
Joseph	1
day	1
by	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
her,	1
to	1
lie	1
by	1
her,	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
39:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
this	1
time,	1
that	1
Joseph	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
business;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
there	1
within.	1
	1
39:12	1
And	1
she	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
garment,	1
saying,	1
Lie	1
with	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
garment	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
got	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
39:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
garment	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
was	1
fled	1
forth,	1
39:14	1
That	1
she	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
her	1
house,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
See,	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
in	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
unto	1
us	1
to	1
mock	1
us;	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
lie	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice:	1
39:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
my	1
voice	1
and	1
cried,	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
garment	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
got	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
39:16	1
And	1
she	1
laid	1
up	1
his	1
garment	1
by	1
her,	1
until	1
his	1
lord	1
came	1
home.	1
	1
39:17	1
And	1
she	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
these	1
words,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Hebrew	1
servant,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
unto	1
us,	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
mock	1
me:	1
39:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
my	1
voice	1
and	1
cried,	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
garment	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
fled	1
out.	1
	1
39:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
which	1
she	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
After	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
thy	1
servant	1
to	1
me;	1
that	1
his	1
wrath	1
was	1
kindled.	1
	1
39:20	1
And	1
Joseph's	1
master	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
prison,	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
king's	1
prisoners	1
were	1
bound:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
39:21	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
shewed	1
him	1
mercy,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
39:22	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
committed	1
to	1
Joseph's	1
hand	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
prison;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
did	1
there,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
doer	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
39:23	1
The	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
looked	1
not	1
to	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
hand;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
it	1
to	1
prosper.	1
	1
40:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
the	1
butler	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
his	1
baker	1
had	1
offended	1
their	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
40:2	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
was	1
wroth	1
against	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
officers,	1
against	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
butlers,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
bakers.	1
	1
40:3	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
ward	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
into	1
the	1
prison,	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Joseph	1
was	1
bound.	1
	1
40:4	1
And	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
charged	1
Joseph	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
served	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
a	1
season	1
in	1
ward.	1
	1
40:5	1
And	1
they	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
each	1
man	1
his	1
dream	1
in	1
one	1
night,	1
each	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
his	1
dream,	1
the	1
butler	1
and	1
the	1
baker	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
40:6	1
And	1
Joseph	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
them,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
sad.	1
	1
40:7	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
Pharaoh's	1
officers	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ward	1
of	1
his	1
lord's	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Wherefore	1
look	1
ye	1
so	1
sadly	1
to	1
day?	1
	1
40:8	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
interpreter	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
not	1
interpretations	1
belong	1
to	1
God?	1
tell	1
me	1
them,	1
I	1
pray	1
you.	1
	1
40:9	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
told	1
his	1
dream	1
to	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
In	1
my	1
dream,	1
behold,	1
a	1
vine	1
was	1
before	1
me;	1
40:10	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
vine	1
were	1
three	1
branches:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
budded,	1
and	1
her	1
blossoms	1
shot	1
forth;	1
and	1
the	1
clusters	1
thereof	1
brought	1
forth	1
ripe	1
grapes:	1
40:11	1
And	1
Pharaoh's	1
cup	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
hand:	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
grapes,	1
and	1
pressed	1
them	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
cup,	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
cup	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
hand.	1
	1
40:12	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
it:	1
The	1
three	1
branches	1
are	1
three	1
days:	1
40:13	1
Yet	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
lift	1
up	1
thine	1
head,	1
and	1
restore	1
thee	1
unto	1
thy	1
place:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deliver	1
Pharaoh's	1
cup	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
after	1
the	1
former	1
manner	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
his	1
butler.	1
	1
40:14	1
But	1
think	1
on	1
me	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
shew	1
kindness,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
me	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house:	1
40:15	1
For	1
indeed	1
I	1
was	1
stolen	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews:	1
and	1
here	1
also	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
nothing	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
put	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
dungeon.	1
	1
40:16	1
When	1
the	1
chief	1
baker	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
interpretation	1
was	1
good,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
dream,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
had	1
three	1
white	1
baskets	1
on	1
my	1
head:	1
40:17	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
uppermost	1
basket	1
there	1
was	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
bakemeats	1
for	1
Pharaoh;	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
did	1
eat	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
basket	1
upon	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
40:18	1
And	1
Joseph	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof:	1
The	1
three	1
baskets	1
are	1
three	1
days:	1
40:19	1
Yet	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
head	1
from	1
off	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
hang	1
thee	1
on	1
a	1
tree;	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
shall	1
eat	1
thy	1
flesh	1
from	1
off	1
thee.	1
	1
40:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
which	1
was	1
Pharaoh's	1
birthday,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
servants:	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
baker	1
among	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
40:21	1
And	1
he	1
restored	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
unto	1
his	1
butlership	1
again;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
cup	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
hand:	1
40:22	1
But	1
he	1
hanged	1
the	1
chief	1
baker:	1
as	1
Joseph	1
had	1
interpreted	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
40:23	1
Yet	1
did	1
not	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
remember	1
Joseph,	1
but	1
forgat	1
him.	1
	1
41:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
full	1
years,	1
that	1
Pharaoh	1
dreamed:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
41:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
seven	1
well	1
favoured	1
kine	1
and	1
fatfleshed;	1
and	1
they	1
fed	1
in	1
a	1
meadow.	1
	1
41:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
other	1
kine	1
came	1
up	1
after	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
ill	1
favoured	1
and	1
leanfleshed;	1
and	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
kine	1
upon	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
41:4	1
And	1
the	1
ill	1
favoured	1
and	1
leanfleshed	1
kine	1
did	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
seven	1
well	1
favoured	1
and	1
fat	1
kine.	1
So	1
Pharaoh	1
awoke.	1
	1
41:5	1
And	1
he	1
slept	1
and	1
dreamed	1
the	1
second	1
time:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
ears	1
of	1
corn	1
came	1
up	1
upon	1
one	1
stalk,	1
rank	1
and	1
good.	1
	1
41:6	1
And,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
thin	1
ears	1
and	1
blasted	1
with	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
sprung	1
up	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
41:7	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
thin	1
ears	1
devoured	1
the	1
seven	1
rank	1
and	1
full	1
ears.	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
awoke,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
41:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
that	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
troubled;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
magicians	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
thereof:	1
and	1
Pharaoh	1
told	1
them	1
his	1
dream;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
could	1
interpret	1
them	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
41:9	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
I	1
do	1
remember	1
my	1
faults	1
this	1
day:	1
41:10	1
Pharaoh	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
ward	1
in	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard's	1
house,	1
both	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
baker:	1
41:11	1
And	1
we	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream	1
in	1
one	1
night,	1
I	1
and	1
he;	1
we	1
dreamed	1
each	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
his	1
dream.	1
	1
41:12	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
with	1
us	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
an	1
Hebrew,	1
servant	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard;	1
and	1
we	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
interpreted	1
to	1
us	1
our	1
dreams;	1
to	1
each	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
dream	1
he	1
did	1
interpret.	1
	1
41:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
interpreted	1
to	1
us,	1
so	1
it	1
was;	1
me	1
he	1
restored	1
unto	1
mine	1
office,	1
and	1
him	1
he	1
hanged.	1
	1
41:14	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
hastily	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dungeon:	1
and	1
he	1
shaved	1
himself,	1
and	1
changed	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
41:15	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
can	1
interpret	1
it:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
understand	1
a	1
dream	1
to	1
interpret	1
it.	1
	1
41:16	1
And	1
Joseph	1
answered	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
me:	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
Pharaoh	1
an	1
answer	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
41:17	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
In	1
my	1
dream,	1
behold,	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river:	1
41:18	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
seven	1
kine,	1
fatfleshed	1
and	1
well	1
favoured;	1
and	1
they	1
fed	1
in	1
a	1
meadow:	1
41:19	1
And,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
other	1
kine	1
came	1
up	1
after	1
them,	1
poor	1
and	1
very	1
ill	1
favoured	1
and	1
leanfleshed,	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
badness:	1
41:20	1
And	1
the	1
lean	1
and	1
the	1
ill	1
favoured	1
kine	1
did	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
first	1
seven	1
fat	1
kine:	1
41:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
them	1
up,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
ill	1
favoured,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
So	1
I	1
awoke.	1
	1
41:22	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
dream,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
ears	1
came	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
stalk,	1
full	1
and	1
good:	1
41:23	1
And,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
ears,	1
withered,	1
thin,	1
and	1
blasted	1
with	1
the	1
east	1
wind,	1
sprung	1
up	1
after	1
them:	1
41:24	1
And	1
the	1
thin	1
ears	1
devoured	1
the	1
seven	1
good	1
ears:	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
this	1
unto	1
the	1
magicians;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
could	1
declare	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
41:25	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
The	1
dream	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
is	1
one:	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
Pharaoh	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
41:26	1
The	1
seven	1
good	1
kine	1
are	1
seven	1
years;	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
good	1
ears	1
are	1
seven	1
years:	1
the	1
dream	1
is	1
one.	1
	1
41:27	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
thin	1
and	1
ill	1
favoured	1
kine	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
after	1
them	1
are	1
seven	1
years;	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
empty	1
ears	1
blasted	1
with	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
famine.	1
	1
41:28	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
Pharaoh:	1
What	1
God	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
sheweth	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
41:29	1
Behold,	1
there	1
come	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
great	1
plenty	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
41:30	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
arise	1
after	1
them	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
famine;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
plenty	1
shall	1
be	1
forgotten	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
the	1
famine	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
land;	1
41:31	1
And	1
the	1
plenty	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
that	1
famine	1
following;	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
grievous.	1
	1
41:32	1
And	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
dream	1
was	1
doubled	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
twice;	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
established	1
by	1
God,	1
and	1
God	1
will	1
shortly	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
41:33	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
Pharaoh	1
look	1
out	1
a	1
man	1
discreet	1
and	1
wise,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:34	1
Let	1
Pharaoh	1
do	1
this,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
appoint	1
officers	1
over	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
plenteous	1
years.	1
	1
41:35	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
gather	1
all	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
those	1
good	1
years	1
that	1
come,	1
and	1
lay	1
up	1
corn	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
keep	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
cities.	1
	1
41:36	1
And	1
that	1
food	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
store	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
against	1
the	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
famine,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
perish	1
not	1
through	1
the	1
famine.	1
	1
41:37	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
41:38	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Can	1
we	1
find	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
this	1
is,	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
is?	1
	1
41:39	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
thee	1
all	1
this,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
so	1
discreet	1
and	1
wise	1
as	1
thou	1
art:	1
41:40	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
over	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
according	1
unto	1
thy	1
word	1
shall	1
all	1
my	1
people	1
be	1
ruled:	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
throne	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
thou.	1
	1
41:41	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:42	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
ring	1
from	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
Joseph's	1
hand,	1
and	1
arrayed	1
him	1
in	1
vestures	1
of	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
gold	1
chain	1
about	1
his	1
neck;	1
41:43	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
ride	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
chariot	1
which	1
he	1
had;	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
before	1
him,	1
Bow	1
the	1
knee:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:44	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
I	1
am	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
without	1
thee	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
or	1
foot	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:45	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
Joseph's	1
name	1
Zaphnathpaaneah;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
wife	1
Asenath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Potipherah	1
priest	1
of	1
On.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
went	1
out	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:46	1
And	1
Joseph	1
was	1
thirty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
went	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:47	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
plenteous	1
years	1
the	1
earth	1
brought	1
forth	1
by	1
handfuls.	1
	1
41:48	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
years,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
laid	1
up	1
the	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
cities:	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
which	1
was	1
round	1
about	1
every	1
city,	1
laid	1
he	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
41:49	1
And	1
Joseph	1
gathered	1
corn	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
very	1
much,	1
until	1
he	1
left	1
numbering;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
number.	1
	1
41:50	1
And	1
unto	1
Joseph	1
were	1
born	1
two	1
sons	1
before	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
famine	1
came,	1
which	1
Asenath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Potipherah	1
priest	1
of	1
On	1
bare	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
41:51	1
And	1
Joseph	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn	1
Manasseh:	1
For	1
God,	1
said	1
he,	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
forget	1
all	1
my	1
toil,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
41:52	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
called	1
he	1
Ephraim:	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
fruitful	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
affliction.	1
	1
41:53	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
plenteousness,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
were	1
ended.	1
	1
41:54	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
dearth	1
began	1
to	1
come,	1
according	1
as	1
Joseph	1
had	1
said:	1
and	1
the	1
dearth	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
lands;	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
there	1
was	1
bread.	1
	1
41:55	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
was	1
famished,	1
the	1
people	1
cried	1
to	1
Pharaoh	1
for	1
bread:	1
and	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
Go	1
unto	1
Joseph;	1
what	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
you,	1
do.	1
	1
41:56	1
And	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
opened	1
all	1
the	1
storehouses,	1
and	1
sold	1
unto	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
and	1
the	1
famine	1
waxed	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:57	1
And	1
all	1
countries	1
came	1
into	1
Egypt	1
to	1
Joseph	1
for	1
to	1
buy	1
corn;	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
so	1
sore	1
in	1
all	1
lands.	1
	1
42:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Jacob	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
sons,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
look	1
one	1
upon	1
another?	1
	1
42:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
get	1
you	1
down	1
thither,	1
and	1
buy	1
for	1
us	1
from	1
thence;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
42:3	1
And	1
Joseph's	1
ten	1
brethren	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
buy	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt.	1
	1
42:4	1
But	1
Benjamin,	1
Joseph's	1
brother,	1
Jacob	1
sent	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
brethren;	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
Lest	1
peradventure	1
mischief	1
befall	1
him.	1
	1
42:5	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
to	1
buy	1
corn	1
among	1
those	1
that	1
came:	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
42:6	1
And	1
Joseph	1
was	1
the	1
governor	1
over	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
sold	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
Joseph's	1
brethren	1
came,	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
themselves	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
42:7	1
And	1
Joseph	1
saw	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
them,	1
but	1
made	1
himself	1
strange	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
spake	1
roughly	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whence	1
come	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
From	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
to	1
buy	1
food.	1
	1
42:8	1
And	1
Joseph	1
knew	1
his	1
brethren,	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
him.	1
	1
42:9	1
And	1
Joseph	1
remembered	1
the	1
dreams	1
which	1
he	1
dreamed	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
spies;	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
ye	1
are	1
come.	1
	1
42:10	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
lord,	1
but	1
to	1
buy	1
food	1
are	1
thy	1
servants	1
come.	1
	1
42:11	1
We	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
man's	1
sons;	1
we	1
are	1
true	1
men,	1
thy	1
servants	1
are	1
no	1
spies.	1
	1
42:12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Nay,	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
ye	1
are	1
come.	1
	1
42:13	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servants	1
are	1
twelve	1
brethren,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
youngest	1
is	1
this	1
day	1
with	1
our	1
father,	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
not.	1
	1
42:14	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
That	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
are	1
spies:	1
42:15	1
Hereby	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
proved:	1
By	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
forth	1
hence,	1
except	1
your	1
youngest	1
brother	1
come	1
hither.	1
	1
42:16	1
Send	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
fetch	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
prison,	1
that	1
your	1
words	1
may	1
be	1
proved,	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
truth	1
in	1
you:	1
or	1
else	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
surely	1
ye	1
are	1
spies.	1
	1
42:17	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
together	1
into	1
ward	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
42:18	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
This	1
do,	1
and	1
live;	1
for	1
I	1
fear	1
God:	1
42:19	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
true	1
men,	1
let	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
your	1
prison:	1
go	1
ye,	1
carry	1
corn	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
of	1
your	1
houses:	1
42:20	1
But	1
bring	1
your	1
youngest	1
brother	1
unto	1
me;	1
so	1
shall	1
your	1
words	1
be	1
verified,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
42:21	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
We	1
are	1
verily	1
guilty	1
concerning	1
our	1
brother,	1
in	1
that	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
when	1
he	1
besought	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
hear;	1
therefore	1
is	1
this	1
distress	1
come	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
42:22	1
And	1
Reuben	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Spake	1
I	1
not	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Do	1
not	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
hear?	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
also	1
his	1
blood	1
is	1
required.	1
	1
42:23	1
And	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
Joseph	1
understood	1
them;	1
for	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
an	1
interpreter.	1
	1
42:24	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
himself	1
about	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
wept;	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
from	1
them	1
Simeon,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
42:25	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
commanded	1
to	1
fill	1
their	1
sacks	1
with	1
corn,	1
and	1
to	1
restore	1
every	1
man's	1
money	1
into	1
his	1
sack,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
way:	1
and	1
thus	1
did	1
he	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
42:26	1
And	1
they	1
laded	1
their	1
asses	1
with	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
departed	1
thence.	1
	1
42:27	1
And	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
opened	1
his	1
sack	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
ass	1
provender	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
he	1
espied	1
his	1
money;	1
for,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
sack's	1
mouth.	1
	1
42:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
My	1
money	1
is	1
restored;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
sack:	1
and	1
their	1
heart	1
failed	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
done	1
unto	1
us?	1
	1
42:29	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
befell	1
unto	1
them;	1
saying,	1
42:30	1
The	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
spake	1
roughly	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
took	1
us	1
for	1
spies	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
42:31	1
And	1
we	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
true	1
men;	1
we	1
are	1
no	1
spies:	1
42:32	1
We	1
be	1
twelve	1
brethren,	1
sons	1
of	1
our	1
father;	1
one	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
youngest	1
is	1
this	1
day	1
with	1
our	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
42:33	1
And	1
the	1
man,	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
said	1
unto	1
us,	1
Hereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
true	1
men;	1
leave	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
here	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
take	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
of	1
your	1
households,	1
and	1
be	1
gone:	1
42:34	1
And	1
bring	1
your	1
youngest	1
brother	1
unto	1
me:	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
no	1
spies,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
true	1
men:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
you	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
traffick	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
42:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
they	1
emptied	1
their	1
sacks,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
every	1
man's	1
bundle	1
of	1
money	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
sack:	1
and	1
when	1
both	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
father	1
saw	1
the	1
bundles	1
of	1
money,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
42:36	1
And	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Me	1
have	1
ye	1
bereaved	1
of	1
my	1
children:	1
Joseph	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
Simeon	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
will	1
take	1
Benjamin	1
away:	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
42:37	1
And	1
Reuben	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
saying,	1
Slay	1
my	1
two	1
sons,	1
if	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
thee:	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
thee	1
again.	1
	1
42:38	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
My	1
son	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
you;	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
left	1
alone:	1
if	1
mischief	1
befall	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
go,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
bring	1
down	1
my	1
gray	1
hairs	1
with	1
sorrow	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
43:1	1
And	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
43:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
up	1
the	1
corn	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
their	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
again,	1
buy	1
us	1
a	1
little	1
food.	1
	1
43:3	1
And	1
Judah	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
The	1
man	1
did	1
solemnly	1
protest	1
unto	1
us,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face,	1
except	1
your	1
brother	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
43:4	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
send	1
our	1
brother	1
with	1
us,	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
buy	1
thee	1
food:	1
43:5	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
send	1
him,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
down:	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
us,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face,	1
except	1
your	1
brother	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
43:6	1
And	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
dealt	1
ye	1
so	1
ill	1
with	1
me,	1
as	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
man	1
whether	1
ye	1
had	1
yet	1
a	1
brother?	1
	1
43:7	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
man	1
asked	1
us	1
straitly	1
of	1
our	1
state,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
kindred,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
your	1
father	1
yet	1
alive?	1
have	1
ye	1
another	1
brother?	1
and	1
we	1
told	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
tenor	1
of	1
these	1
words:	1
could	1
we	1
certainly	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
say,	1
Bring	1
your	1
brother	1
down?	1
	1
43:8	1
And	1
Judah	1
said	1
unto	1
Israel	1
his	1
father,	1
Send	1
the	1
lad	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
go;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
not	1
die,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
thou,	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
43:9	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
surety	1
for	1
him;	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
shalt	1
thou	1
require	1
him:	1
if	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
thee,	1
then	1
let	1
me	1
bear	1
the	1
blame	1
for	1
ever:	1
43:10	1
For	1
except	1
we	1
had	1
lingered,	1
surely	1
now	1
we	1
had	1
returned	1
this	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
43:11	1
And	1
their	1
father	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
now,	1
do	1
this;	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
fruits	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
your	1
vessels,	1
and	1
carry	1
down	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
present,	1
a	1
little	1
balm,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
honey,	1
spices,	1
and	1
myrrh,	1
nuts,	1
and	1
almonds:	1
43:12	1
And	1
take	1
double	1
money	1
in	1
your	1
hand;	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
brought	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
your	1
sacks,	1
carry	1
it	1
again	1
in	1
your	1
hand;	1
peradventure	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
oversight:	1
43:13	1
Take	1
also	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
arise,	1
go	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
man:	1
43:14	1
And	1
God	1
Almighty	1
give	1
you	1
mercy	1
before	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
send	1
away	1
your	1
other	1
brother,	1
and	1
Benjamin.	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
bereaved	1
of	1
my	1
children,	1
I	1
am	1
bereaved.	1
	1
43:15	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
took	1
that	1
present,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
double	1
money	1
in	1
their	1
hand	1
and	1
Benjamin;	1
and	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
Joseph.	1
	1
43:16	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
saw	1
Benjamin	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
Bring	1
these	1
men	1
home,	1
and	1
slay,	1
and	1
make	1
ready;	1
for	1
these	1
men	1
shall	1
dine	1
with	1
me	1
at	1
noon.	1
	1
43:17	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
did	1
as	1
Joseph	1
bade;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
brought	1
the	1
men	1
into	1
Joseph's	1
house.	1
	1
43:18	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
afraid,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
into	1
Joseph's	1
house;	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
returned	1
in	1
our	1
sacks	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
are	1
we	1
brought	1
in;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
seek	1
occasion	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
take	1
us	1
for	1
bondmen,	1
and	1
our	1
asses.	1
	1
43:19	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
Joseph's	1
house,	1
and	1
they	1
communed	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
43:20	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
sir,	1
we	1
came	1
indeed	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
to	1
buy	1
food:	1
43:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
inn,	1
that	1
we	1
opened	1
our	1
sacks,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
every	1
man's	1
money	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
his	1
sack,	1
our	1
money	1
in	1
full	1
weight:	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
it	1
again	1
in	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
43:22	1
And	1
other	1
money	1
have	1
we	1
brought	1
down	1
in	1
our	1
hands	1
to	1
buy	1
food:	1
we	1
cannot	1
tell	1
who	1
put	1
our	1
money	1
in	1
our	1
sacks.	1
	1
43:23	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
you,	1
fear	1
not:	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
father,	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
treasure	1
in	1
your	1
sacks:	1
I	1
had	1
your	1
money.	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
Simeon	1
out	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
43:24	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
brought	1
the	1
men	1
into	1
Joseph's	1
house,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
water,	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
their	1
feet;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
their	1
asses	1
provender.	1
	1
43:25	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
present	1
against	1
Joseph	1
came	1
at	1
noon:	1
for	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
eat	1
bread	1
there.	1
	1
43:26	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
came	1
home,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
the	1
present	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
bowed	1
themselves	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
43:27	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
welfare,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
your	1
father	1
well,	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
spake?	1
Is	1
he	1
yet	1
alive?	1
	1
43:28	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
our	1
father	1
is	1
in	1
good	1
health,	1
he	1
is	1
yet	1
alive.	1
And	1
they	1
bowed	1
down	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
made	1
obeisance.	1
	1
43:29	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
brother	1
Benjamin,	1
his	1
mother's	1
son,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
younger	1
brother,	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
spake	1
unto	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
God	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
thee,	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
43:30	1
And	1
Joseph	1
made	1
haste;	1
for	1
his	1
bowels	1
did	1
yearn	1
upon	1
his	1
brother:	1
and	1
he	1
sought	1
where	1
to	1
weep;	1
and	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
chamber,	1
and	1
wept	1
there.	1
	1
43:31	1
And	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
refrained	1
himself,	1
and	1
said,	1
Set	1
on	1
bread.	1
	1
43:32	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
on	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
which	1
did	1
eat	1
with	1
him,	1
by	1
themselves:	1
because	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
might	1
not	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
the	1
Hebrews;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
43:33	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
before	1
him,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
birthright,	1
and	1
the	1
youngest	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
youth:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
marvelled	1
one	1
at	1
another.	1
	1
43:34	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
and	1
sent	1
messes	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
before	1
him:	1
but	1
Benjamin's	1
mess	1
was	1
five	1
times	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
their's.	1
And	1
they	1
drank,	1
and	1
were	1
merry	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
44:1	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Fill	1
the	1
men's	1
sacks	1
with	1
food,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
carry,	1
and	1
put	1
every	1
man's	1
money	1
in	1
his	1
sack's	1
mouth.	1
	1
44:2	1
And	1
put	1
my	1
cup,	1
the	1
silver	1
cup,	1
in	1
the	1
sack's	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
youngest,	1
and	1
his	1
corn	1
money.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
Joseph	1
had	1
spoken.	1
	1
44:3	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
light,	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
sent	1
away,	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
asses.	1
	1
44:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
not	1
yet	1
far	1
off,	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
steward,	1
Up,	1
follow	1
after	1
the	1
men;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
dost	1
overtake	1
them,	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
rewarded	1
evil	1
for	1
good?	1
	1
44:5	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
it	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
lord	1
drinketh,	1
and	1
whereby	1
indeed	1
he	1
divineth?	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
evil	1
in	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
44:6	1
And	1
he	1
overtook	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
these	1
same	1
words.	1
	1
44:7	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
saith	1
my	1
lord	1
these	1
words?	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
thy	1
servants	1
should	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
thing:	1
44:8	1
Behold,	1
the	1
money,	1
which	1
we	1
found	1
in	1
our	1
sacks'	1
mouths,	1
we	1
brought	1
again	1
unto	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan:	1
how	1
then	1
should	1
we	1
steal	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
lord's	1
house	1
silver	1
or	1
gold?	1
	1
44:9	1
With	1
whomsoever	1
of	1
thy	1
servants	1
it	1
be	1
found,	1
both	1
let	1
him	1
die,	1
and	1
we	1
also	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
lord's	1
bondmen.	1
	1
44:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Now	1
also	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
according	1
unto	1
your	1
words:	1
he	1
with	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
found	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
blameless.	1
	1
44:11	1
Then	1
they	1
speedily	1
took	1
down	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sack	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
opened	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sack.	1
	1
44:12	1
And	1
he	1
searched,	1
and	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
eldest,	1
and	1
left	1
at	1
the	1
youngest:	1
and	1
the	1
cup	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
Benjamin's	1
sack.	1
	1
44:13	1
Then	1
they	1
rent	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
laded	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
44:14	1
And	1
Judah	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
came	1
to	1
Joseph's	1
house;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
before	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
44:15	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
deed	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
done?	1
wot	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
certainly	1
divine?	1
	1
44:16	1
And	1
Judah	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
unto	1
my	1
lord?	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
speak?	1
	1
or	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
clear	1
ourselves?	1
God	1
hath	1
found	1
out	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
thy	1
servants:	1
behold,	1
we	1
are	1
my	1
lord's	1
servants,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
cup	1
is	1
found.	1
	1
44:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
so:	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
whose	1
hand	1
the	1
cup	1
is	1
found,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
get	1
you	1
up	1
in	1
peace	1
unto	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
44:18	1
Then	1
Judah	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Oh	1
my	1
lord,	1
let	1
thy	1
servant,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
my	1
lord's	1
ears,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
thine	1
anger	1
burn	1
against	1
thy	1
servant:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
even	1
as	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
44:19	1
My	1
lord	1
asked	1
his	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
ye	1
a	1
father,	1
or	1
a	1
brother?	1
	1
44:20	1
And	1
we	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
lord,	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
father,	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
age,	1
a	1
little	1
one;	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
he	1
alone	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
loveth	1
him.	1
	1
44:21	1
And	1
thou	1
saidst	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
Bring	1
him	1
down	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
set	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
44:22	1
And	1
we	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
lord,	1
The	1
lad	1
cannot	1
leave	1
his	1
father:	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
leave	1
his	1
father,	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
die.	1
	1
44:23	1
And	1
thou	1
saidst	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
Except	1
your	1
youngest	1
brother	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
44:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant	1
my	1
father,	1
we	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
44:25	1
And	1
our	1
father	1
said,	1
Go	1
again,	1
and	1
buy	1
us	1
a	1
little	1
food.	1
	1
44:26	1
And	1
we	1
said,	1
We	1
cannot	1
go	1
down:	1
if	1
our	1
youngest	1
brother	1
be	1
with	1
us,	1
then	1
will	1
we	1
go	1
down:	1
for	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
man's	1
face,	1
except	1
our	1
youngest	1
brother	1
be	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
44:27	1
And	1
thy	1
servant	1
my	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
us,	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
bare	1
me	1
two	1
sons:	1
44:28	1
And	1
the	1
one	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
said,	1
Surely	1
he	1
is	1
torn	1
in	1
pieces;	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
not	1
since:	1
44:29	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
take	1
this	1
also	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
mischief	1
befall	1
him,	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
my	1
gray	1
hairs	1
with	1
sorrow	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
44:30	1
Now	1
therefore	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thy	1
servant	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
be	1
not	1
with	1
us;	1
seeing	1
that	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
bound	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
lad's	1
life;	1
44:31	1
It	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
that	1
the	1
lad	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
die:	1
and	1
thy	1
servants	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
gray	1
hairs	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
our	1
father	1
with	1
sorrow	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
44:32	1
For	1
thy	1
servant	1
became	1
surety	1
for	1
the	1
lad	1
unto	1
my	1
father,	1
saying,	1
If	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
blame	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
44:33	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
thy	1
servant	1
abide	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
lad	1
a	1
bondman	1
to	1
my	1
lord;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
lad	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
44:34	1
For	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
be	1
not	1
with	1
me?	1
lest	1
peradventure	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
on	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
45:1	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
himself	1
before	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
cried,	1
Cause	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
me.	1
And	1
there	1
stood	1
no	1
man	1
with	1
him,	1
while	1
Joseph	1
made	1
himself	1
known	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
45:2	1
And	1
he	1
wept	1
aloud:	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
heard.	1
	1
45:3	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
I	1
am	1
Joseph;	1
doth	1
my	1
father	1
yet	1
live?	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
him;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
troubled	1
at	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
45:4	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
Come	1
near	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
near.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Joseph	1
your	1
brother,	1
whom	1
ye	1
sold	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
45:5	1
Now	1
therefore	1
be	1
not	1
grieved,	1
nor	1
angry	1
with	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
ye	1
sold	1
me	1
hither:	1
for	1
God	1
did	1
send	1
me	1
before	1
you	1
to	1
preserve	1
life.	1
	1
45:6	1
For	1
these	1
two	1
years	1
hath	1
the	1
famine	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
five	1
years,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
there	1
shall	1
neither	1
be	1
earing	1
nor	1
harvest.	1
	1
45:7	1
And	1
God	1
sent	1
me	1
before	1
you	1
to	1
preserve	1
you	1
a	1
posterity	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
your	1
lives	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
deliverance.	1
	1
45:8	1
So	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
you	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
hither,	1
but	1
God:	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
lord	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
a	1
ruler	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
45:9	1
Haste	1
ye,	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
thy	1
son	1
Joseph,	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
lord	1
of	1
all	1
Egypt:	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
me,	1
tarry	1
not:	1
45:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
near	1
unto	1
me,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
children,	1
and	1
thy	1
children's	1
children,	1
and	1
thy	1
flocks,	1
and	1
thy	1
herds,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast:	1
45:11	1
And	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
nourish	1
thee;	1
for	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
five	1
years	1
of	1
famine;	1
lest	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
household,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast,	1
come	1
to	1
poverty.	1
	1
45:12	1
And,	1
behold,	1
your	1
eyes	1
see,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
Benjamin,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
mouth	1
that	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
45:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
tell	1
my	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
glory	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
seen;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
haste	1
and	1
bring	1
down	1
my	1
father	1
hither.	1
	1
45:14	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
brother	1
Benjamin's	1
neck,	1
and	1
wept;	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
wept	1
upon	1
his	1
neck.	1
	1
45:15	1
Moreover	1
he	1
kissed	1
all	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
wept	1
upon	1
them:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
his	1
brethren	1
talked	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
45:16	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
thereof	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
Pharaoh's	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Joseph's	1
brethren	1
are	1
come:	1
and	1
it	1
pleased	1
Pharaoh	1
well,	1
and	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
45:17	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Say	1
unto	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
This	1
do	1
ye;	1
lade	1
your	1
beasts,	1
and	1
go,	1
get	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
45:18	1
And	1
take	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
your	1
households,	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
45:19	1
Now	1
thou	1
art	1
commanded,	1
this	1
do	1
ye;	1
take	1
you	1
wagons	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
your	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
bring	1
your	1
father,	1
and	1
come.	1
	1
45:20	1
Also	1
regard	1
not	1
your	1
stuff;	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
is	1
your's.	1
	1
45:21	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
so:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
gave	1
them	1
wagons,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
45:22	1
To	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
gave	1
each	1
man	1
changes	1
of	1
raiment;	1
but	1
to	1
Benjamin	1
he	1
gave	1
three	1
hundred	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
five	1
changes	1
of	1
raiment.	1
	1
45:23	1
And	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
sent	1
after	1
this	1
manner;	1
ten	1
asses	1
laden	1
with	1
the	1
good	1
things	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
ten	1
she	1
asses	1
laden	1
with	1
corn	1
and	1
bread	1
and	1
meat	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
45:24	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
brethren	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
departed:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
fall	1
not	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
45:25	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father,	1
45:26	1
And	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Joseph	1
is	1
yet	1
alive,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
governor	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
And	1
Jacob's	1
heart	1
fainted,	1
for	1
he	1
believed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
45:27	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
wagons	1
which	1
Joseph	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
carry	1
him,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father	1
revived:	1
45:28	1
And	1
Israel	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
enough;	1
Joseph	1
my	1
son	1
is	1
yet	1
alive:	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
before	1
I	1
die.	1
	1
46:1	1
And	1
Israel	1
took	1
his	1
journey	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
and	1
offered	1
sacrifices	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Isaac.	1
	1
46:2	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
said,	1
Jacob,	1
Jacob.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
46:3	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father:	1
fear	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
there	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
nation:	1
46:4	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
surely	1
bring	1
thee	1
up	1
again:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
shall	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
46:5	1
And	1
Jacob	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
Beersheba:	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Israel	1
carried	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father,	1
and	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
their	1
wives,	1
in	1
the	1
wagons	1
which	1
Pharaoh	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
carry	1
him.	1
	1
46:6	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
cattle,	1
and	1
their	1
goods,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
gotten	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
seed	1
with	1
him:	1
46:7	1
His	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
sons	1
with	1
him,	1
his	1
daughters,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
daughters,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
seed	1
brought	1
he	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
46:8	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
came	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
Jacob	1
and	1
his	1
sons:	1
Reuben,	1
Jacob's	1
firstborn.	1
	1
46:9	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Reuben;	1
Hanoch,	1
and	1
Phallu,	1
and	1
Hezron,	1
and	1
Carmi.	1
	1
46:10	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Simeon;	1
Jemuel,	1
and	1
Jamin,	1
and	1
Ohad,	1
and	1
Jachin,	1
and	1
Zohar,	1
and	1
Shaul	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
Canaanitish	1
woman.	1
	1
46:11	1
And	1
the	1

	1
46:29	1
And	1

meet	1
Israel	1

father,	1
to	1

and	1
presented	1
himself	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
wept	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
a	1
good	1
while.	1
	1
46:30	1
And	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Now	1
let	1
me	1
die,	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
face,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
yet	1
alive.	1
	1
46:31	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
unto	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
up,	1
and	1
shew	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
brethren,	1
and	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
me;	1
46:32	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
shepherds,	1
for	1
their	1
trade	1
hath	1
been	1
to	1
feed	1
cattle;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
their	1
flocks,	1
and	1
their	1
herds,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have.	1
	1
46:33	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
call	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
say,	1
What	1
is	1
your	1
occupation?	1
	1
46:34	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thy	1
servants'	1
trade	1
hath	1
been	1
about	1
cattle	1
from	1
our	1
youth	1
even	1
until	1
now,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
fathers:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen;	1
for	1
every	1
shepherd	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
47:1	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
their	1
flocks,	1
and	1
their	1
herds,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have,	1
are	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen.	1
	1
47:2	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
brethren,	1
even	1
five	1
men,	1
and	1
presented	1
them	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
47:3	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
What	1
is	1
your	1
occupation?	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Thy	1
servants	1
are	1
shepherds,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
47:4	1
They	1
said	1
morever	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
For	1
to	1
sojourn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
are	1
we	1
come;	1
for	1
thy	1
servants	1
have	1
no	1
pasture	1
for	1
their	1
flocks;	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
is	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan:	1
now	1
therefore,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
thy	1
servants	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen.	1
	1
47:5	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
spake	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
47:6	1
The	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
is	1
before	1
thee;	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
make	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
brethren	1
to	1
dwell;	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen	1
let	1
them	1
dwell:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest	1
any	1
men	1
of	1
activity	1
among	1
them,	1
then	1
make	1
them	1
rulers	1
over	1
my	1
cattle.	1
	1
47:7	1
And	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
in	1
Jacob	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
blessed	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
47:8	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
How	1
old	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
47:9	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
pilgrimage	1
are	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years:	1
few	1
and	1
evil	1
have	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
been,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
attained	1
unto	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
pilgrimage.	1
	1
47:10	1
And	1
Jacob	1
blessed	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
47:11	1
And	1
Joseph	1
placed	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
possession	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Rameses,	1
as	1
Pharaoh	1
had	1
commanded.	1
	1
47:12	1
And	1
Joseph	1
nourished	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
household,	1
with	1
bread,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
47:13	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
bread	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land;	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
very	1
sore,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
fainted	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
famine.	1
	1
47:14	1
And	1
Joseph	1
gathered	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
which	1
they	1
bought:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
the	1
money	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
house.	1
	1
47:15	1
And	1
when	1
money	1
failed	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
came	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
said,	1
Give	1
us	1
bread:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
we	1
die	1
in	1
thy	1
presence?	1
for	1
the	1
money	1
faileth.	1
	1
47:16	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said,	1
Give	1
your	1
cattle;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
cattle,	1
if	1
money	1
fail.	1
	1
47:17	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
their	1
cattle	1
unto	1
Joseph:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
gave	1
them	1
bread	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
horses,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
flocks,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
the	1
herds,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
asses:	1
and	1
he	1
fed	1
them	1
with	1
bread	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
cattle	1
for	1
that	1
year.	1
	1
47:18	1
When	1
that	1
year	1
was	1
ended,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
second	1
year,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
lord,	1
how	1
that	1
our	1
money	1
is	1
spent;	1
my	1
lord	1
also	1
hath	1
our	1
herds	1
of	1
cattle;	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
ought	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
but	1
our	1
bodies,	1
and	1
our	1
lands:	1
47:19	1
Wherefore	1
shall	1
we	1
die	1
before	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
both	1
we	1
and	1
our	1
land?	1
buy	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
land	1
for	1
bread,	1
and	1
we	1
and	1
our	1
land	1
will	1
be	1
servants	1
unto	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
give	1
us	1
seed,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
not	1
die,	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
be	1
not	1
desolate.	1
	1
47:20	1
And	1
Joseph	1
bought	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
Pharaoh;	1
for	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
sold	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
field,	1
because	1
the	1
famine	1
prevailed	1
over	1
them:	1
so	1
the	1
land	1
became	1
Pharaoh's.	1
	1
47:21	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
removed	1
them	1
to	1
cities	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Egypt	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
thereof.	1
	1
47:22	1
Only	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
bought	1
he	1
not;	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
had	1
a	1
portion	1
assigned	1
them	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
their	1
portion	1
which	1
Pharaoh	1
gave	1
them:	1
wherefore	1
they	1
sold	1
not	1
their	1
lands.	1
	1
47:23	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
you	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
your	1
land	1
for	1
Pharaoh:	1
lo,	1
here	1
is	1
seed	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
sow	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
47:24	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
increase,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
four	1
parts	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
own,	1
for	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
food,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
your	1
households,	1
and	1
for	1
food	1
for	1
your	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
47:25	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
saved	1
our	1
lives:	1
let	1
us	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
Pharaoh's	1
servants.	1
	1
47:26	1
And	1
Joseph	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
law	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
Pharaoh	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
fifth	1
part,	1
except	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
only,	1
which	1
became	1
not	1
Pharaoh's.	1
	1
47:27	1
And	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Goshen;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
possessions	1
therein,	1
and	1
grew,	1
and	1
multiplied	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
47:28	1
And	1
Jacob	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
seventeen	1
years:	1
so	1
the	1
whole	1
age	1
of	1
Jacob	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
forty	1
and	1
seven	1
years.	1
	1
47:29	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
drew	1
nigh	1
that	1
Israel	1
must	1
die:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
son	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
put,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
hand	1
under	1
my	1
thigh,	1
and	1
deal	1
kindly	1
and	1
truly	1
with	1
me;	1
bury	1
me	1
not,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
47:30	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
lie	1
with	1
my	1
fathers,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
carry	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
bury	1
me	1
in	1
their	1
buryingplace.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
47:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Swear	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
him.	1
And	1
Israel	1
bowed	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
bed's	1
head.	1
	1
48:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
one	1
told	1
Joseph,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
father	1
is	1
sick:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
his	1
two	1
sons,	1
Manasseh	1
and	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
48:2	1
And	1
one	1
told	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
son	1
Joseph	1
cometh	1
unto	1
thee:	1
and	1
Israel	1
strengthened	1
himself,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
48:3	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
God	1
Almighty	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Luz	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
blessed	1
me,	1
48:4	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
people;	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
land	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
possession.	1
	1
48:5	1
And	1
now	1
thy	1
two	1
sons,	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
which	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
before	1
I	1
came	1
unto	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
are	1
mine;	1
as	1
Reuben	1
and	1
Simeon,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
mine.	1
	1
48:6	1
And	1
thy	1
issue,	1
which	1
thou	1
begettest	1
after	1
them,	1
shall	1
be	1
thine,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
in	1
their	1
inheritance.	1
	1
48:7	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
from	1
Padan,	1
Rachel	1
died	1
by	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
when	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
Ephrath:	1
and	1
I	1
buried	1
her	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Ephrath;	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
48:8	1
And	1
Israel	1
beheld	1
Joseph's	1
sons,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
are	1
these?	1
	1
48:9	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
They	1
are	1
my	1
sons,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
them,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
them.	1
	1
48:10	1
Now	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
dim	1
for	1
age,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
near	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
them,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them.	1
	1
48:11	1
And	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
to	1
see	1
thy	1
face:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
also	1
thy	1
seed.	1
	1
48:12	1
And	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
48:13	1
And	1
Joseph	1
took	1
them	1
both,	1
Ephraim	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
toward	1
Israel's	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
Manasseh	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
toward	1
Israel's	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
near	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
48:14	1
And	1
Israel	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
Ephraim's	1
head,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
younger,	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
upon	1
Manasseh's	1
head,	1
guiding	1
his	1
hands	1
wittingly;	1
for	1
Manasseh	1
was	1
the	1
firstborn.	1
	1
48:15	1
And	1
he	1
blessed	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
said,	1
God,	1
before	1
whom	1
my	1
fathers	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac	1
did	1
walk,	1
the	1
God	1
which	1
fed	1
me	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
long	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
48:16	1
The	1
Angel	1
which	1
redeemed	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
evil,	1
bless	1
the	1
lads;	1
and	1
let	1
my	1
name	1
be	1
named	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
fathers	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
grow	1
into	1
a	1
multitude	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
48:17	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
laid	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
it	1
displeased	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
father's	1
hand,	1
to	1
remove	1
it	1
from	1
Ephraim's	1
head	1
unto	1
Manasseh's	1
head.	1
	1
48:18	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Not	1
so,	1
my	1
father:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
firstborn;	1
put	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
48:19	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
refused,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
it,	1
my	1
son,	1
I	1
know	1
it:	1
he	1
also	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
great:	1
but	1
truly	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
shall	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
nations.	1
	1
48:20	1
And	1
he	1
blessed	1
them	1
that	1
day,	1
saying,	1
In	1
thee	1
shall	1
Israel	1
bless,	1
saying,	1
God	1
make	1
thee	1
as	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
as	1
Manasseh:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
Ephraim	1
before	1
Manasseh.	1
	1
48:21	1
And	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
die:	1
but	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
48:22	1
Moreover	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
thee	1
one	1
portion	1
above	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Amorite	1
with	1
my	1
sword	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
bow.	1
	1
49:1	1
And	1
Jacob	1
called	1
unto	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
said,	1
Gather	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
befall	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days.	1
	1
49:2	1
Gather	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
and	1
hear,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
hearken	1
unto	1
Israel	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
49:3	1
Reuben,	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
firstborn,	1
my	1
might,	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
my	1
strength,	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
dignity,	1
and	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
power:	1
49:4	1
Unstable	1
as	1
water,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
excel;	1
because	1
thou	1
wentest	1
up	1
to	1
thy	1
father's	1
bed;	1
then	1
defiledst	1
thou	1
it:	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
couch.	1
	1
49:5	1
Simeon	1
and	1
Levi	1
are	1
brethren;	1
instruments	1
of	1
cruelty	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
habitations.	1
	1
49:6	1
O	1
my	1
soul,	1
come	1
not	1
thou	1
into	1
their	1
secret;	1
unto	1
their	1
assembly,	1
mine	1
honour,	1
be	1
not	1
thou	1
united:	1
for	1
in	1
their	1
anger	1
they	1
slew	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
selfwill	1
they	1
digged	1
down	1
a	1
wall.	1
	1
49:7	1
Cursed	1
be	1
their	1
anger,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
fierce;	1
and	1
their	1
wrath,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
cruel:	1
I	1
will	1
divide	1
them	1
in	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
scatter	1
them	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
49:8	1
Judah,	1
thou	1
art	1
he	1
whom	1
thy	1
brethren	1
shall	1
praise:	1
thy	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies;	1
thy	1
father's	1
children	1
shall	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
49:9	1
Judah	1
is	1
a	1
lion's	1
whelp:	1
from	1
the	1
prey,	1
my	1
son,	1
thou	1
art	1
gone	1
up:	1
he	1
stooped	1
down,	1
he	1
couched	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
lion;	1
who	1
shall	1
rouse	1
him	1
up?	1
	1
49:10	1
The	1
sceptre	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
Judah,	1
nor	1
a	1
lawgiver	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
feet,	1
until	1
Shiloh	1
come;	1
and	1
unto	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
gathering	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
be.	1
	1
49:11	1
Binding	1
his	1
foal	1
unto	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
his	1
ass's	1
colt	1
unto	1
the	1
choice	1
vine;	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
garments	1
in	1
wine,	1
and	1
his	1
clothes	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
grapes:	1
49:12	1
His	1
eyes	1
shall	1
be	1
red	1
with	1
wine,	1
and	1
his	1
teeth	1
white	1
with	1
milk.	1
	1
49:13	1
Zebulun	1
shall	1
dwell	1
at	1
the	1
haven	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
an	1
haven	1
of	1
ships;	1
and	1
his	1
border	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
Zidon.	1
	1
49:14	1
Issachar	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
ass	1
couching	1
down	1
between	1
two	1
burdens:	1
49:15	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
rest	1
was	1
good,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant;	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
shoulder	1
to	1
bear,	1
and	1
became	1
a	1
servant	1
unto	1
tribute.	1
	1
49:16	1
Dan	1
shall	1
judge	1
his	1
people,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
49:17	1
Dan	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
serpent	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
an	1
adder	1
in	1
the	1
path,	1
that	1
biteth	1
the	1
horse	1
heels,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
rider	1
shall	1
fall	1
backward.	1
	1
49:18	1
I	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
49:19	1
Gad,	1
a	1
troop	1
shall	1
overcome	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
overcome	1
at	1
the	1
last.	1
	1
49:20	1
Out	1
of	1
Asher	1
his	1
bread	1
shall	1
be	1
fat,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
yield	1
royal	1
dainties.	1
	1
49:21	1
Naphtali	1
is	1
a	1
hind	1
let	1
loose:	1
he	1
giveth	1
goodly	1
words.	1
	1
49:22	1
Joseph	1
is	1
a	1
fruitful	1
bough,	1
even	1
a	1
fruitful	1
bough	1
by	1
a	1
well;	1
whose	1
branches	1
run	1
over	1
the	1
wall:	1
49:23	1
The	1
archers	1
have	1
sorely	1
grieved	1
him,	1
and	1
shot	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
hated	1
him:	1
49:24	1
But	1
his	1
bow	1
abode	1
in	1
strength,	1
and	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
made	1
strong	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
(from	1
thence	1
is	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
the	1
stone	1
of	1
Israel:)	1
49:25	1
Even	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
who	1
shall	1
help	1
thee;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
who	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
with	1
blessings	1
of	1
heaven	1
above,	1
blessings	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
that	1
lieth	1
under,	1
blessings	1
of	1
the	1
breasts,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
womb:	1
49:26	1
The	1
blessings	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
have	1
prevailed	1
above	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
my	1
progenitors	1
unto	1
the	1
utmost	1
bound	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
hills:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
separate	1
from	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
49:27	1
Benjamin	1
shall	1
ravin	1
as	1
a	1
wolf:	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
he	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil.	1
	1
49:28	1
All	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
their	1
father	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them;	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
blessing	1
he	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
49:29	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
my	1
people:	1
bury	1
me	1
with	1
my	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Ephron	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
49:30	1
In	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Machpelah,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Mamre,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
which	1
Abraham	1
bought	1
with	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Ephron	1
the	1
Hittite	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace.	1
	1
49:31	1
There	1
they	1
buried	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife;	1
there	1
they	1
buried	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
buried	1
Leah.	1
	1
49:32	1
The	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
therein	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth.	1
	1
49:33	1
And	1
when	1
Jacob	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
commanding	1
his	1
sons,	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
his	1
feet	1
into	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
50:1	1
And	1
Joseph	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
father's	1
face,	1
and	1
wept	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
50:2	1
And	1
Joseph	1
commanded	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
physicians	1
to	1
embalm	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
the	1
physicians	1
embalmed	1
Israel.	1
	1
50:3	1
And	1
forty	1
days	1
were	1
fulfilled	1
for	1
him;	1
for	1
so	1
are	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
embalmed:	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
mourned	1
for	1
him	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
days.	1
	1
50:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
mourning	1
were	1
past,	1
Joseph	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
If	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
speak,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
50:5	1
My	1
father	1
made	1
me	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
die:	1
in	1
my	1
grave	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
digged	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bury	1
me.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
up,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
bury	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
again.	1
	1
50:6	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said,	1
Go	1
up,	1
and	1
bury	1
thy	1
father,	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
made	1
thee	1
swear.	1
	1
50:7	1
And	1
Joseph	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
bury	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
went	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
50:8	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
his	1
father's	1
house:	1
only	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
their	1
flocks,	1
and	1
their	1
herds,	1
they	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen.	1
	1
50:9	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
both	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
company.	1
	1
50:10	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
Atad,	1
which	1
is	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
mourned	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
very	1
sore	1
lamentation:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
mourning	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
50:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
saw	1
the	1
mourning	1
in	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
Atad,	1
they	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
grievous	1
mourning	1
to	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
wherefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
Abelmizraim,	1
which	1
is	1
beyond	1
Jordan.	1
	1
50:12	1
And	1
his	1
sons	1
did	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
commanded	1
them:	1
50:13	1
For	1
his	1
sons	1
carried	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Machpelah,	1
which	1
Abraham	1
bought	1
with	1
the	1
field	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace	1
of	1
Ephron	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
before	1
Mamre.	1
	1
50:14	1
And	1
Joseph	1
returned	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
bury	1
his	1
father,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
buried	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
50:15	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph's	1
brethren	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
father	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
said,	1
Joseph	1
will	1
peradventure	1
hate	1
us,	1
and	1
will	1
certainly	1
requite	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
50:16	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
a	1
messenger	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
father	1
did	1
command	1
before	1
he	1
died,	1
saying,	1
50:17	1
So	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Forgive,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
now,	1
the	1
trespass	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
their	1
sin;	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
unto	1
thee	1
evil:	1
and	1
now,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
forgive	1
the	1
trespass	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
wept	1
when	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
50:18	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
also	1
went	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
his	1
face;	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
be	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
50:19	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
am	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
50:20	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
ye	1
thought	1
evil	1
against	1
me;	1
but	1
God	1
meant	1
it	1
unto	1
good,	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
save	1
much	1
people	1
alive.	1
	1
50:21	1
Now	1
therefore	1
fear	1
ye	1
not:	1
I	1
will	1
nourish	1
you,	1
and	1
your	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
comforted	1
them,	1
and	1
spake	1
kindly	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
50:22	1
And	1
Joseph	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
father's	1
house:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
lived	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
ten	1
years.	1
	1
50:23	1
And	1
Joseph	1
saw	1
Ephraim's	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
generation:	1
the	1
children	1
also	1
of	1
Machir	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
upon	1
Joseph's	1
knees.	1
	1
50:24	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
I	1
die:	1
and	1
God	1
will	1
surely	1
visit	1
you,	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob.	1
	1
50:25	1
And	1
Joseph	1
took	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
God	1
will	1
surely	1
visit	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
carry	1
up	1
my	1
bones	1
from	1
hence.	1
	1
50:26	1
So	1
Joseph	1
died,	1
being	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
ten	1
years	1
old:	1
and	1
they	1
embalmed	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
coffin	1
in	1
Egypt.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Book	1
of	1
Moses:	1
	1
Called	1
Exodus	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
came	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
household	1
came	1
with	1
Jacob.	1
	1
1:2	1
Reuben,	1
Simeon,	1
Levi,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
1:3	1
Issachar,	1
Zebulun,	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
1:4	1
Dan,	1
and	1
Naphtali,	1
Gad,	1
and	1
Asher.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Jacob	1
were	1
seventy	1
souls:	1
for	1
Joseph	1
was	1
in	1
Egypt	1
already.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
Joseph	1
died,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
generation.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
increased	1
abundantly,	1
and	1
multiplied,	1
and	1
waxed	1
exceeding	1
mighty;	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
1:8	1
Now	1
there	1
arose	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
king	1
over	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
knew	1
not	1
Joseph.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
more	1
and	1
mightier	1
than	1
we:	1
1:10	1
Come	1
on,	1
let	1
us	1
deal	1
wisely	1
with	1
them;	1
lest	1
they	1
multiply,	1
and	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
there	1
falleth	1
out	1
any	1
war,	1
they	1
join	1
also	1
unto	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
so	1
get	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
1:11	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
set	1
over	1
them	1
taskmasters	1
to	1
afflict	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
burdens.	1
And	1
they	1
built	1
for	1
Pharaoh	1
treasure	1
cities,	1
Pithom	1
and	1
Raamses.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
afflicted	1
them,	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
multiplied	1
and	1
grew.	1
	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
grieved	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
made	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
serve	1
with	1
rigour:	1
1:14	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
lives	1
bitter	1
with	1
hard	1
bondage,	1
in	1
morter,	1
and	1
in	1
brick,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
all	1
their	1
service,	1
wherein	1
they	1
made	1
them	1
serve,	1
was	1
with	1
rigour.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
midwives,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Shiphrah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Puah:	1
1:16	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
When	1
ye	1
do	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
midwife	1
to	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
women,	1
and	1
see	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
stools;	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
son,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
kill	1
him:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
daughter,	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
1:17	1
But	1
the	1
midwives	1
feared	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
commanded	1
them,	1
but	1
saved	1
the	1
men	1
children	1
alive.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
midwives,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
have	1
saved	1
the	1
men	1
children	1
alive?	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
midwives	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Because	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
women	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
women;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
lively,	1
and	1
are	1
delivered	1
ere	1
the	1
midwives	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:20	1
Therefore	1
God	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
midwives:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
multiplied,	1
and	1
waxed	1
very	1
mighty.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
because	1
the	1
midwives	1
feared	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
houses.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
charged	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Every	1
son	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
ye	1
shall	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
every	1
daughter	1
ye	1
shall	1
save	1
alive.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Levi,	1
and	1
took	1
to	1
wife	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
Levi.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
goodly	1
child,	1
she	1
hid	1
him	1
three	1
months.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
longer	1
hide	1
him,	1
she	1
took	1
for	1
him	1
an	1
ark	1
of	1
bulrushes,	1
and	1
daubed	1
it	1
with	1
slime	1
and	1
with	1
pitch,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
child	1
therein;	1
and	1
she	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
flags	1
by	1
the	1
river's	1
brink.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
his	1
sister	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
to	1
wit	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
wash	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
river;	1
and	1
her	1
maidens	1
walked	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
river's	1
side;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
ark	1
among	1
the	1
flags,	1
she	1
sent	1
her	1
maid	1
to	1
fetch	1
it.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
opened	1
it,	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
child:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
babe	1
wept.	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews'	1
children.	1
	1
2:7	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
sister	1
to	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
call	1
to	1
thee	1
a	1
nurse	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
women,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
nurse	1
the	1
child	1
for	1
thee?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
Go.	1
And	1
the	1
maid	1
went	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
child's	1
mother.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Take	1
this	1
child	1
away,	1
and	1
nurse	1
it	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
thy	1
wages.	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
took	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
nursed	1
it.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
her	1
son.	1
And	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Moses:	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
Because	1
I	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
Moses	1
was	1
grown,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
their	1
burdens:	1
and	1
he	1
spied	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
smiting	1
an	1
Hebrew,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
way,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man,	1
he	1
slew	1
the	1
Egyptian,	1
and	1
hid	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
sand.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
second	1
day,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
strove	1
together:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
wrong,	1
Wherefore	1
smitest	1
thou	1
thy	1
fellow?	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
prince	1
and	1
a	1
judge	1
over	1
us?	1
intendest	1
thou	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
killedst	1
the	1
Egyptian?	1
And	1
Moses	1
feared,	1
and	1
said,	1
Surely	1
this	1
thing	1
is	1
known.	1
	1
2:15	1
Now	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
heard	1
this	1
thing,	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
slay	1
Moses.	1
But	1
Moses	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Midian:	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
well.	1
	1
2:16	1
Now	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Midian	1
had	1
seven	1
daughters:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
drew	1
water,	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
troughs	1
to	1
water	1
their	1
father's	1
flock.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
shepherds	1
came	1
and	1
drove	1
them	1
away:	1
but	1
Moses	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
helped	1
them,	1
and	1
watered	1
their	1
flock.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Reuel	1
their	1
father,	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
day?	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
An	1
Egyptian	1
delivered	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
also	1
drew	1
water	1
enough	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
watered	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
daughters,	1
And	1
where	1
is	1
he?	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
man?	1
call	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
content	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
man:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
Moses	1
Zipporah	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
she	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Gershom:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
died:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
sighed	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
bondage,	1
and	1
they	1
cried,	1
and	1
their	1
cry	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
God	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
God	1
heard	1
their	1
groaning,	1
and	1
God	1
remembered	1
his	1
covenant	1
with	1
Abraham,	1
with	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
with	1
Jacob.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
God	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
God	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
Moses	1
kept	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
Jethro	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Midian:	1
and	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
flock	1
to	1
the	1
backside	1
of	1
the	1
desert,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
Horeb.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
bush:	1
and	1
he	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
bush	1
burned	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
bush	1
was	1
not	1
consumed.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
turn	1
aside,	1
and	1
see	1
this	1
great	1
sight,	1
why	1
the	1
bush	1
is	1
not	1
burnt.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
to	1
see,	1
God	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
bush,	1
and	1
said,	1
Moses,	1
Moses.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Draw	1
not	1
nigh	1
hither:	1
put	1
off	1
thy	1
shoes	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
feet,	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
whereon	1
thou	1
standest	1
is	1
holy	1
ground.	1
	1
3:6	1
Moreover	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
And	1
Moses	1
hid	1
his	1
face;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
God.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
surely	1
seen	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
have	1
heard	1
their	1
cry	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
their	1
taskmasters;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
sorrows;	1
3:8	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
unto	1
a	1
good	1
land	1
and	1
a	1
large,	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey;	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites.	1
	1
3:9	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
seen	1
the	1
oppression	1
wherewith	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
oppress	1
them.	1
	1
3:10	1
Come	1
now	1
therefore,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bring	1
forth	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Who	1
am	1
I,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
3:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Certainly	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
token	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
thee:	1
When	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
ye	1
shall	1
serve	1
God	1
upon	1
this	1
mountain.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Behold,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
What	1
is	1
his	1
name?	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
I	1
AM	1
THAT	1
I	1
AM:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
AM	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
moreover	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
name	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
memorial	1
unto	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
3:16	1
Go,	1
and	1
gather	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
together,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
surely	1
visited	1
you,	1
and	1
seen	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
3:17	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
hearken	1
to	1
thy	1
voice:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come,	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
hath	1
met	1
with	1
us:	1
and	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
go,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
no,	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
smite	1
Egypt	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
wonders	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
people	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
go,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
empty.	1
	1
3:22	1
But	1
every	1
woman	1
shall	1
borrow	1
of	1
her	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
in	1
her	1
house,	1
jewels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
raiment:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
upon	1
your	1
daughters;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
spoil	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
But,	1
behold,	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
me,	1
nor	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
voice:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
thine	1
hand?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
A	1
rod.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Cast	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
serpent;	1
and	1
Moses	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Put	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
tail.	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
caught	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
rod	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
4:5	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
hath	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
furthermore	1
unto	1
him,	1
Put	1
now	1
thine	1
hand	1
into	1
thy	1
bosom.	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
bosom:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
out,	1
behold,	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
leprous	1
as	1
snow.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Put	1
thine	1
hand	1
into	1
thy	1
bosom	1
again.	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
bosom	1
again;	1
and	1
plucked	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
turned	1
again	1
as	1
his	1
other	1
flesh.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
thee,	1
neither	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
sign,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
believe	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
sign.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
also	1
these	1
two	1
signs,	1
neither	1
hearken	1
unto	1
thy	1
voice,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
pour	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land:	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
which	1
thou	1
takest	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
become	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
my	1
LORD,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
eloquent,	1
neither	1
heretofore,	1
nor	1
since	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant:	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
slow	1
of	1
speech,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
slow	1
tongue.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
hath	1
made	1
man's	1
mouth?	1
or	1
who	1
maketh	1
the	1
dumb,	1
or	1
deaf,	1
or	1
the	1
seeing,	1
or	1
the	1
blind?	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
4:12	1
Now	1
therefore	1
go,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
teach	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
LORD,	1
send,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
whom	1
thou	1
wilt	1
send.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Moses,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
Aaron	1
the	1
Levite	1
thy	1
brother?	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
speak	1
well.	1
And	1
also,	1
behold,	1
he	1
cometh	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
thee:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
thee,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
words	1
in	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
do.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
spokesman	1
unto	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be,	1
even	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
thee	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
mouth,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
instead	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
this	1
rod	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
signs.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jethro	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
me	1
go,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
yet	1
alive.	1
And	1
Jethro	1
said	1
to	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
Midian,	1
Go,	1
return	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
dead	1
which	1
sought	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
When	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
see	1
that	1
thou	1
do	1
all	1
those	1
wonders	1
before	1
Pharaoh,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
in	1
thine	1
hand:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
harden	1
his	1
heart,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Israel	1
is	1
my	1
son,	1
even	1
my	1
firstborn:	1
4:23	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Let	1
my	1
son	1
go,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
serve	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
slay	1
thy	1
son,	1
even	1
thy	1
firstborn.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
4:25	1
Then	1
Zipporah	1
took	1
a	1
sharp	1
stone,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
foreskin	1
of	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Surely	1
a	1
bloody	1
husband	1
art	1
thou	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
4:26	1
So	1
he	1
let	1
him	1
go:	1
then	1
she	1
said,	1
A	1
bloody	1
husband	1
thou	1
art,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Aaron,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
meet	1
Moses.	1
And	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
4:28	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
Aaron	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
who	1
had	1
sent	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
4:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
4:30	1
And	1
Aaron	1
spake	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
4:31	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
believed:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
visited	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
upon	1
their	1
affliction,	1
then	1
they	1
bowed	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
worshipped.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
afterward	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
told	1
Pharaoh,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
hold	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
obey	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
let	1
Israel	1
go?	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
let	1
Israel	1
go.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
hath	1
met	1
with	1
us:	1
let	1
us	1
go,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
desert,	1
and	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God;	1
lest	1
he	1
fall	1
upon	1
us	1
with	1
pestilence,	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wherefore	1
do	1
ye,	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
works?	1
get	1
you	1
unto	1
your	1
burdens.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
now	1
are	1
many,	1
and	1
ye	1
make	1
them	1
rest	1
from	1
their	1
burdens.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
commanded	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
the	1
taskmasters	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
their	1
officers,	1
saying,	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
give	1
the	1
people	1
straw	1
to	1
make	1
brick,	1
as	1
heretofore:	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
and	1
gather	1
straw	1
for	1
themselves.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
bricks,	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
make	1
heretofore,	1
ye	1
shall	1
lay	1
upon	1
them;	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
diminish	1
ought	1
thereof:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
idle;	1
therefore	1
they	1
cry,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
5:9	1
Let	1
there	1
more	1
work	1
be	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
labour	1
therein;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
regard	1
vain	1
words.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
the	1
taskmasters	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
their	1
officers,	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Pharaoh,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
you	1
straw.	1
	1
5:11	1
Go	1
ye,	1
get	1
you	1
straw	1
where	1
ye	1
can	1
find	1
it:	1
yet	1
not	1
ought	1
of	1
your	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
diminished.	1
	1
5:12	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
gather	1
stubble	1
instead	1
of	1
straw.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
the	1
taskmasters	1
hasted	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Fulfil	1
your	1
works,	1
your	1
daily	1
tasks,	1
as	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
straw.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
Pharaoh's	1
taskmasters	1
had	1
set	1
over	1
them,	1
were	1
beaten,	1
and	1
demanded,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
fulfilled	1
your	1
task	1
in	1
making	1
brick	1
both	1
yesterday	1
and	1
to	1
day,	1
as	1
heretofore?	1
	1
5:15	1
Then	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
Wherefore	1
dealest	1
thou	1
thus	1
with	1
thy	1
servants?	1
	1
5:16	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
straw	1
given	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
to	1
us,	1
Make	1
brick:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
thy	1
servants	1
are	1
beaten;	1
but	1
the	1
fault	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
people.	1
	1
5:17	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
are	1
idle,	1
ye	1
are	1
idle:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
say,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:18	1
Go	1
therefore	1
now,	1
and	1
work;	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
straw	1
be	1
given	1
you,	1
yet	1
shall	1
ye	1
deliver	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
bricks.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
evil	1
case,	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
minish	1
ought	1
from	1
your	1
bricks	1
of	1
your	1
daily	1
task.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
they	1
met	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
Pharaoh:	1
5:21	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
LORD	1
look	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
judge;	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
our	1
savour	1
to	1
be	1
abhorred	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
sword	1
in	1
their	1
hand	1
to	1
slay	1
us.	1
	1
5:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
so	1
evil	1
entreated	1
this	1
people?	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me?	1
5:23	1
For	1
since	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Pharaoh	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
thy	1
name,	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
evil	1
to	1
this	1
people;	1
neither	1
hast	1
thou	1
delivered	1
thy	1
people	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
6:1	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Now	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
Pharaoh:	1
for	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand	1
shall	1
he	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand	1
shall	1
he	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
6:3	1
And	1
I	1
appeared	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
unto	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
but	1
by	1
my	1
name	1
JEHOVAH	1
was	1
I	1
not	1
known	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
established	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
pilgrimage,	1
wherein	1
they	1
were	1
strangers.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
heard	1
the	1
groaning	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
keep	1
in	1
bondage;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
remembered	1
my	1
covenant.	1
	1
6:6	1
Wherefore	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
burdens	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rid	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
bondage,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
judgments:	1
6:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
God:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
bringeth	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
burdens	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
land,	1
concerning	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
swear	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
heritage:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
so	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
but	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
Moses	1
for	1
anguish	1
of	1
spirit,	1
and	1
for	1
cruel	1
bondage.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:11	1
Go	1
in,	1
speak	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me;	1
how	1
then	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
hear	1
me,	1
who	1
am	1
of	1
uncircumcised	1
lips?	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
charge	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1

Bring	1

land	1

Egypt	1
according	1
to	1

	1
6:27	1
These	1

Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
Egypt:	1
these	1
are	1
that	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron.	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
6:29	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
speak	1
thou	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
uncircumcised	1
lips,	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
god	1
to	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
that	1
he	1
send	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
harden	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
and	1
multiply	1
my	1
signs	1
and	1
my	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:4	1
But	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
lay	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
mine	1
armies,	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
great	1
judgments.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
them,	1
so	1
did	1
they.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
fourscore	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
Aaron	1
fourscore	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
when	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
7:9	1
When	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Shew	1
a	1
miracle	1
for	1
you:	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
thy	1
rod,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
before	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
serpent.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
cast	1
down	1
his	1
rod	1
before	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
serpent.	1
	1
7:11	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
also	1
called	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
sorcerers:	1
now	1
the	1
magicians	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
they	1
also	1
did	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
with	1
their	1
enchantments.	1
	1
7:12	1
For	1
they	1
cast	1
down	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
rod,	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
serpents:	1
but	1
Aaron's	1
rod	1
swallowed	1
up	1
their	1
rods.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
he	1
hardened	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
that	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart	1
is	1
hardened,	1
he	1
refuseth	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go.	1
	1
7:15	1
Get	1
thee	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
in	1
the	1
morning;	1
lo,	1
he	1
goeth	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
water;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
river's	1
brink	1
against	1
he	1
come;	1
and	1
the	1
rod	1
which	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
serpent	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
hitherto	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
7:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
In	1
this	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
to	1
blood.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
die,	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
stink;	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
lothe	1
to	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Say	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
thy	1
rod,	1
and	1
stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
upon	1
their	1
streams,	1
upon	1
their	1
rivers,	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
ponds,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
their	1
pools	1
of	1
water,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
become	1
blood;	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
blood	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
both	1
in	1
vessels	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
in	1
vessels	1
of	1
stone.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
did	1
so,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded;	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
servants;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
were	1
turned	1
to	1
blood.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
died;	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
stank,	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
could	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
river;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
blood	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
the	1
magicians	1
of	1
Egypt	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
their	1
enchantments:	1
and	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened,	1
neither	1
did	1
he	1
hearken	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
neither	1
did	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
this	1
also.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
digged	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
river	1
for	1
water	1
to	1
drink;	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
seven	1
days	1
were	1
fulfilled,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
smitten	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
all	1
thy	1
borders	1
with	1
frogs:	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
frogs	1
abundantly,	1
which	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
into	1
thy	1
bedchamber,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
into	1
thine	1
ovens,	1
and	1
into	1
thy	1
kneadingtroughs:	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
frogs	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
both	1
on	1
thee,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Say	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
with	1
thy	1
rod	1
over	1
the	1
streams,	1
over	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
ponds,	1
and	1
cause	1
frogs	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
Aaron	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
the	1
frogs	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
the	1
magicians	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
their	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
brought	1
up	1
frogs	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:8	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said,	1
Intreat	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
frogs	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
from	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Glory	1
over	1
me:	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
intreat	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
people,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
frogs	1
from	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
houses,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
only?	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
To	1
morrow.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Be	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word:	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
frogs	1
shall	1
depart	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
houses,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
people;	1
they	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
only.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
Moses	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
frogs	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
against	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses;	1
and	1
the	1
frogs	1
died	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fields.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
upon	1
heaps:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
stank.	1
	1
8:15	1
But	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
respite,	1
he	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Say	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
thy	1
rod,	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
become	1
lice	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so;	1
for	1
Aaron	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
rod,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
lice	1
in	1
man,	1
and	1
in	1
beast;	1
all	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
became	1
lice	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
the	1
magicians	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
their	1
enchantments	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
lice,	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not:	1
so	1
there	1
were	1
lice	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
the	1
magicians	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened,	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Rise	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
stand	1
before	1
Pharaoh;	1
lo,	1
he	1
cometh	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
water;	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
8:21	1
Else,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
into	1
thy	1
houses:	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
ground	1
whereon	1
they	1
are.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sever	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
people	1
dwell,	1
that	1
no	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies	1
shall	1
be	1
there;	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
division	1
between	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
thy	1
people:	1
to	1
morrow	1
shall	1
this	1
sign	1
be.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
so;	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
grievous	1
swarm	1
of	1
flies	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
into	1
his	1
servants'	1
houses,	1
and	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
corrupted	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
swarm	1
of	1
flies.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
for	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
ye,	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
your	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
so	1
to	1
do;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God:	1
lo,	1
shall	1
we	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
before	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
stone	1
us?	1
	1
8:27	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
shall	1
command	1
us.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
only	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
very	1
far	1
away:	1
intreat	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
intreat	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
the	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies	1
may	1
depart	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
from	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
morrow:	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
Pharaoh	1
deal	1
deceitfully	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
not	1
letting	1
the	1
people	1
go	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
intreated	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses;	1
and	1
he	1
removed	1
the	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
from	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
people;	1
there	1
remained	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
also,	1
neither	1
would	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
tell	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
9:2	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
and	1
wilt	1
hold	1
them	1
still,	1
9:3	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
thy	1
cattle	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
upon	1
the	1
horses,	1
upon	1
the	1
asses,	1
upon	1
the	1
camels,	1
upon	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
sheep:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
grievous	1
murrain.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
sever	1
between	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
nothing	1
die	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
children's	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appointed	1
a	1
set	1
time,	1
saying,	1
To	1
morrow	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
that	1
thing	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
Egypt	1
died:	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
died	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
sent,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
the	1
Israelites	1
dead.	1
And	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
was	1
hardened,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
to	1
you	1
handfuls	1
of	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
furnace,	1
and	1
let	1
Moses	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
toward	1
the	1
heaven	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
become	1
small	1
dust	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
boil	1
breaking	1
forth	1
with	1
blains	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast,	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
furnace,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
Pharaoh;	1
and	1
Moses	1
sprinkled	1
it	1
up	1
toward	1
heaven;	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
boil	1
breaking	1
forth	1
with	1
blains	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
magicians	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
before	1
Moses	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
boils;	1
for	1
the	1
boil	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
magicians,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
Moses.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Rise	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
stand	1
before	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
9:14	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
send	1
all	1
my	1
plagues	1
upon	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:15	1
For	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
smite	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
with	1
pestilence;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
in	1
very	1
deed	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
I	1
raised	1
thee	1
up,	1
for	1
to	1
shew	1
in	1
thee	1
my	1
power;	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
may	1
be	1
declared	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:17	1
As	1
yet	1
exaltest	1
thou	1
thyself	1
against	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
go?	1
	1
9:18	1
Behold,	1
to	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
a	1
very	1
grievous	1
hail,	1
such	1
as	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
Egypt	1
since	1
the	1
foundation	1
thereof	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
9:19	1
Send	1
therefore	1
now,	1
and	1
gather	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
for	1
upon	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
home,	1
the	1
hail	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
9:20	1
He	1
that	1
feared	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
among	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
made	1
his	1
servants	1
and	1
his	1
cattle	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
houses:	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
regarded	1
not	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
left	1
his	1
servants	1
and	1
his	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
toward	1
heaven,	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
hail	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
rod	1
toward	1
heaven:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
thunder	1
and	1
hail,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
ran	1
along	1
upon	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
rained	1
hail	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:24	1
So	1
there	1
was	1
hail,	1
and	1
fire	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
hail,	1
very	1
grievous,	1
such	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
like	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
since	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
nation.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
the	1
hail	1
smote	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast;	1
and	1
the	1
hail	1
smote	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
brake	1
every	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
9:26	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
where	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were,	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
hail.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
sent,	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
this	1
time:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
righteous,	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
wicked.	1
	1
9:28	1
Intreat	1
the	1
LORD	1
(for	1
it	1
is	1
enough)	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
mighty	1
thunderings	1
and	1
hail;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
stay	1
no	1
longer.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
I	1
will	1
spread	1
abroad	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
thunder	1
shall	1
cease,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
hail;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
9:30	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
servants,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
yet	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
God.	1
	1
9:31	1
And	1
the	1
flax	1
and	1
the	1
barley	1
was	1
smitten:	1
for	1
the	1
barley	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ear,	1
and	1
the	1
flax	1
was	1
bolled.	1
	1
9:32	1
But	1
the	1
wheat	1
and	1
the	1
rie	1
were	1
not	1
smitten:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
grown	1
up.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
spread	1
abroad	1
his	1
hands	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
thunders	1
and	1
hail	1
ceased,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
not	1
poured	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
rain	1
and	1
the	1
hail	1
and	1
the	1
thunders	1
were	1
ceased,	1
he	1
sinned	1
yet	1
more,	1
and	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
was	1
hardened,	1
neither	1
would	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
go;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
by	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
shew	1
these	1
my	1
signs	1
before	1
him:	1
10:2	1
And	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
tell	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
son's	1
son,	1
what	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
wrought	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
my	1
signs	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
among	1
them;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
humble	1
thyself	1
before	1
me?	1
let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
10:4	1
Else,	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
behold,	1
to	1
morrow	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
the	1
locusts	1
into	1
thy	1
coast:	1
10:5	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
cover	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
one	1
cannot	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
escaped,	1
which	1
remaineth	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
hail,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
every	1
tree	1
which	1
groweth	1
for	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
10:6	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fill	1
thy	1
houses,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
which	1
neither	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
nor	1
thy	1
fathers'	1
fathers	1
have	1
seen,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
himself,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
Pharaoh's	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
this	1
man	1
be	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
us?	1
let	1
the	1
men	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God:	1
knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
yet	1
that	1
Egypt	1
is	1
destroyed?	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
were	1
brought	1
again	1
unto	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go,	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
but	1
who	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
go?	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
our	1
young	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
old,	1
with	1
our	1
sons	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
daughters,	1
with	1
our	1
flocks	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
herds	1
will	1
we	1
go;	1
for	1
we	1
must	1
hold	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
and	1
your	1
little	1
ones:	1
look	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
evil	1
is	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
10:11	1
Not	1
so:	1
go	1
now	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
men,	1
and	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
that	1
ye	1
did	1
desire.	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh's	1
presence.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
the	1
locusts,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
eat	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
hail	1
hath	1
left.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
rod	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
an	1
east	1
wind	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
all	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
night;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
morning,	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
brought	1
the	1
locusts.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
the	1
locust	1
went	1
up	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
rested	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
very	1
grievous	1
were	1
they;	1
before	1
them	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
such	1
locusts	1
as	1
they,	1
neither	1
after	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
such.	1
	1
10:15	1
For	1
they	1
covered	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
darkened;	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
which	1
the	1
hail	1
had	1
left:	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
not	1
any	1
green	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
trees,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
herbs	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:16	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
in	1
haste;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
10:17	1
Now	1
therefore	1
forgive,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
my	1
sin	1
only	1
this	1
once,	1
and	1
intreat	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
this	1
death	1
only.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
intreated	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
turned	1
a	1
mighty	1
strong	1
west	1
wind,	1
which	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
locusts,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
Red	1
sea;	1
there	1
remained	1
not	1
one	1
locust	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
go.	1
	1
10:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
toward	1
heaven,	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
darkness	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
darkness	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
felt.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
toward	1
heaven;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
thick	1
darkness	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
three	1
days:	1
10:23	1
They	1
saw	1
not	1
one	1
another,	1
neither	1
rose	1
any	1
from	1
his	1
place	1
for	1
three	1
days:	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
light	1
in	1
their	1
dwellings.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
ye,	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD;	1
only	1
let	1
your	1
flocks	1
and	1
your	1
herds	1
be	1
stayed:	1
let	1
your	1
little	1
ones	1
also	1
go	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Thou	1
must	1
give	1
us	1
also	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
10:26	1
Our	1
cattle	1
also	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
us;	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hoof	1
be	1
left	1
behind;	1
for	1
thereof	1
must	1
we	1
take	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God;	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
must	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD,	1
until	1
we	1
come	1
thither.	1
	1
10:27	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
from	1
me,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself,	1
see	1
my	1
face	1
no	1
more;	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
thou	1
seest	1
my	1
face	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die.	1
	1
10:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
well,	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
thy	1
face	1
again	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
one	1
plague	1
more	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
upon	1
Egypt;	1
afterwards	1
he	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
hence:	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
thrust	1
you	1
out	1
hence	1
altogether.	1
	1
11:2	1
Speak	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
borrow	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
woman	1
of	1
her	1
neighbour,	1
jewels	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
the	1
people	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
Moreover	1
the	1
man	1
Moses	1
was	1
very	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
servants,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
About	1
midnight	1
will	1
I	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
11:5	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
die,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
born	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
his	1
throne,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
maidservant	1
that	1
is	1
behind	1
the	1
mill;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
beasts.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
cry	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
such	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
like	1
it,	1
nor	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
it	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
11:7	1
But	1
against	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
not	1
a	1
dog	1
move	1
his	1
tongue,	1
against	1
man	1
or	1
beast:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
put	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
thy	1
servants	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
bow	1
down	1
themselves	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
follow	1
thee:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
out.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
anger.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you;	1
that	1
my	1
wonders	1
may	1
be	1
multiplied	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
did	1
all	1
these	1
wonders	1
before	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
saying,	1
12:2	1
This	1
month	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
months:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
12:3	1
Speak	1
ye	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
In	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
month	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
to	1
them	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
lamb,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
a	1
lamb	1
for	1
an	1
house:	1
12:4	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
household	1
be	1
too	1
little	1
for	1
the	1
lamb,	1
let	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
neighbour	1
next	1
unto	1
his	1
house	1
take	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
souls;	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
eating	1
shall	1
make	1
your	1
count	1
for	1
the	1
lamb.	1
	1
12:5	1
Your	1
lamb	1
shall	1
be	1
without	1
blemish,	1
a	1
male	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year:	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
sheep,	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
goats:	1
12:6	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
until	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
kill	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
strike	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
side	1
posts	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
door	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
wherein	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
in	1
that	1
night,	1
roast	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
unleavened	1
bread;	1
and	1
with	1
bitter	1
herbs	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
12:9	1
Eat	1
not	1
of	1
it	1
raw,	1
nor	1
sodden	1
at	1
all	1
with	1
water,	1
but	1
roast	1
with	1
fire;	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
legs,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
purtenance	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
let	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
remain	1
until	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
ye	1
shall	1
burn	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
it;	1
with	1
your	1
loins	1
girded,	1
your	1
shoes	1
on	1
your	1
feet,	1
and	1
your	1
staff	1
in	1
your	1
hand;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
haste:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
passover.	1
	1
12:12	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
this	1
night,	1
and	1
will	1
smite	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast;	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Egypt	1
I	1
will	1
execute	1
judgment:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
the	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
upon	1
the	1
houses	1
where	1
ye	1
are:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
blood,	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
upon	1
you	1
to	1
destroy	1
you,	1
when	1
I	1
smite	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
this	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
memorial;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
a	1
feast	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations;	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
a	1
feast	1
by	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
12:15	1
Seven	1
days	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread;	1
even	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
leaven	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
houses:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
eateth	1
leavened	1
bread	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
until	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Israel.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation	1
to	1
you;	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
them,	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
every	1
man	1
must	1
eat,	1
that	1
only	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread;	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
selfsame	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
brought	1
your	1
armies	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
observe	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
your	1
generations	1
by	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
12:18	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
at	1
even,	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
until	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
at	1
even.	1
	1
12:19	1
Seven	1
days	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
leaven	1
found	1
in	1
your	1
houses:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
eateth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
leavened,	1
even	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
stranger,	1
or	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
12:20	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
nothing	1
leavened;	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
habitations	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread.	1
	1
12:21	1
Then	1
Moses	1
called	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Draw	1
out	1
and	1
take	1
you	1
a	1
lamb	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
families,	1
and	1
kill	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
dip	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
bason,	1
and	1
strike	1
the	1
lintel	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
side	1
posts	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
bason;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
12:23	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
lintel,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
side	1
posts,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
destroyer	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
your	1
houses	1
to	1
smite	1
you.	1
	1
12:24	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
this	1
thing	1
for	1
an	1
ordinance	1
to	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
sons	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
give	1
you,	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
promised,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
this	1
service.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
your	1
children	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
by	1
this	1
service?	1
	1
12:27	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
passover,	1
who	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
when	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
delivered	1
our	1
houses.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
bowed	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
worshipped.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
so	1
did	1
they.	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
midnight	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
throne	1
unto	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
captive	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
dungeon;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
cattle.	1
	1
12:30	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
cry	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
dead.	1
	1
12:31	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
forth	1
from	1
among	1
my	1
people,	1
both	1
ye	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
go,	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
said.	1
	1
12:32	1
Also	1
take	1
your	1
flocks	1
and	1
your	1
herds,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
be	1
gone;	1
and	1
bless	1
me	1
also.	1
	1
12:33	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
were	1
urgent	1
upon	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
send	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
haste;	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
be	1
all	1
dead	1
men.	1
	1
12:34	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
their	1
dough	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
leavened,	1
their	1
kneadingtroughs	1
being	1
bound	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
clothes	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders.	1
	1
12:35	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses;	1
and	1
they	1
borrowed	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
jewels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
raiment:	1
12:36	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
the	1
people	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
lent	1
unto	1
them	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
required.	1
And	1
they	1
spoiled	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
12:37	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Rameses	1
to	1
Succoth,	1
about	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
on	1
foot	1
that	1
were	1
men,	1
beside	1
children.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
a	1
mixed	1
multitude	1
went	1
up	1
also	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
flocks,	1
and	1
herds,	1
even	1
very	1
much	1
cattle.	1
	1
12:39	1
And	1
they	1
baked	1
unleavened	1
cakes	1
of	1
the	1
dough	1
which	1
they	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
leavened;	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
thrust	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
tarry,	1
neither	1
had	1
they	1
prepared	1
for	1
themselves	1
any	1
victual.	1
	1
12:40	1
Now	1
the	1
sojourning	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
was	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years.	1
	1
12:41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years,	1
even	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:42	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
night	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
observed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
bringing	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
12:43	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
the	1
passover:	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
stranger	1
eat	1
thereof:	1
12:44	1
But	1
every	1
man's	1
servant	1
that	1
is	1
bought	1
for	1
money,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
circumcised	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:45	1
A	1
foreigner	1
and	1
an	1
hired	1
servant	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:46	1
In	1
one	1
house	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
eaten;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
carry	1
forth	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
abroad	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
break	1
a	1
bone	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:47	1
All	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
12:48	1
And	1
when	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
sojourn	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
let	1
all	1
his	1
males	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
and	1
then	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
near	1
and	1
keep	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
no	1
uncircumcised	1
person	1
shall	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:49	1
One	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
homeborn,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
12:50	1
Thus	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
so	1
did	1
they.	1
	1
12:51	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
bring	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
their	1
armies.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
13:2	1
Sanctify	1
unto	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
whatsoever	1
openeth	1
the	1
womb	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
both	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
of	1
beast:	1
it	1
is	1
mine.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Remember	1
this	1
day,	1
in	1
which	1
ye	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage;	1
for	1
by	1
strength	1
of	1
hand	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
this	1
place:	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
leavened	1
bread	1
be	1
eaten.	1
	1
13:4	1
This	1
day	1
came	1
ye	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Abib.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
thee,	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
this	1
service	1
in	1
this	1
month.	1
	1
13:6	1
Seven	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
feast	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:7	1
Unleavened	1
bread	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
seven	1
days;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
leavened	1
bread	1
be	1
seen	1
with	1
thee,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
leaven	1
seen	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
quarters.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shew	1
thy	1
son	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
done	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
unto	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee	1
upon	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
between	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD's	1
law	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth:	1
for	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
13:10	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
therefore	1
keep	1
this	1
ordinance	1
in	1
his	1
season	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
as	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
it	1
thee,	1
13:12	1
That	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
apart	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix,	1
and	1
every	1
firstling	1
that	1
cometh	1
of	1
a	1
beast	1
which	1
thou	1
hast;	1
the	1
males	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
every	1
firstling	1
of	1
an	1
ass	1
thou	1
shalt	1
redeem	1
with	1
a	1
lamb;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
break	1
his	1
neck:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
man	1
among	1
thy	1
children	1
shalt	1
thou	1
redeem.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
when	1
thy	1
son	1
asketh	1
thee	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
this?	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
By	1
strength	1
of	1
hand	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
us	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage:	1
13:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
would	1
hardly	1
let	1
us	1
go,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
both	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
beast:	1
therefore	1
I	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix,	1
being	1
males;	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
my	1
children	1
I	1
redeem.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
upon	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
for	1
frontlets	1
between	1
thine	1
eyes:	1
for	1
by	1
strength	1
of	1
hand	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
had	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
God	1
led	1
them	1
not	1
through	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
although	1
that	1
was	1
near;	1
for	1
God	1
said,	1
Lest	1
peradventure	1
the	1
people	1
repent	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
war,	1
and	1
they	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt:	1
13:18	1
But	1
God	1
led	1
the	1
people	1
about,	1
through	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
harnessed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Joseph	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
straitly	1
sworn	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
God	1
will	1
surely	1
visit	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
carry	1
up	1
my	1
bones	1
away	1
hence	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
from	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
encamped	1
in	1
Etham,	1
in	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
before	1
them	1
by	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
a	1
cloud,	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
the	1
way;	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
light;	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
night:	1
13:22	1
He	1
took	1
not	1
away	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
by	1
day,	1
nor	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
by	1
night,	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
14:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
turn	1
and	1
encamp	1
before	1
Pihahiroth,	1
between	1
Migdol	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
over	1
against	1
Baalzephon:	1
before	1
it	1
shall	1
ye	1
encamp	1
by	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:3	1
For	1
Pharaoh	1
will	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
They	1
are	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
the	1
wilderness	1
hath	1
shut	1
them	1
in.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
harden	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
follow	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
honoured	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
host;	1
that	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
fled:	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
was	1
turned	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Why	1
have	1
we	1
done	1
this,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
let	1
Israel	1
go	1
from	1
serving	1
us?	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
ready	1
his	1
chariot,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
him:	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
six	1
hundred	1
chosen	1
chariots,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
chariots	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
he	1
pursued	1
after	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
an	1
high	1
hand.	1
	1
14:9	1
But	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
pursued	1
after	1
them,	1
all	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
his	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
his	1
army,	1
and	1
overtook	1
them	1
encamping	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
beside	1
Pihahiroth,	1
before	1
Baalzephon.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
marched	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Because	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
graves	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
hast	1
thou	1
taken	1
us	1
away	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
dealt	1
thus	1
with	1
us,	1
to	1
carry	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
	1
14:12	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
tell	1
thee	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
alone,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
serve	1
the	1
Egyptians?	1
For	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
than	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not,	1
stand	1
still,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
day:	1
for	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
to	1
day,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
no	1
more	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
14:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
fight	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
hold	1
your	1
peace.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Wherefore	1
criest	1
thou	1
unto	1
me?	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
go	1
forward:	1
14:16	1
But	1
lift	1
thou	1
up	1
thy	1
rod,	1
and	1
stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
divide	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
go	1
on	1
dry	1
ground	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
harden	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
follow	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
me	1
honour	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
host,	1
upon	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
gotten	1
me	1
honour	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
upon	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel,	1
removed	1
and	1
went	1
behind	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
went	1
from	1
before	1
their	1
face,	1
and	1
stood	1
behind	1
them:	1
14:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
between	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
darkness	1
to	1
them,	1
but	1
it	1
gave	1
light	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
these:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
came	1
not	1
near	1
the	1
other	1
all	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
caused	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
east	1
wind	1
all	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
dry	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
divided.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
ground:	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
a	1
wall	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
left.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
pursued,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
after	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
even	1
all	1
Pharaoh's	1
horses,	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
watch	1
the	1
LORD	1
looked	1
unto	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
through	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
troubled	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
14:25	1
And	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
chariot	1
wheels,	1
that	1
they	1
drave	1
them	1
heavily:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
fighteth	1
for	1
them	1
against	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
may	1
come	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
upon	1
their	1
chariots,	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
horsemen.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
strength	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
appeared;	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
fled	1
against	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
overthrew	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
returned,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
chariots,	1
and	1
the	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
after	1
them;	1
there	1
remained	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
14:29	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
walked	1
upon	1
dry	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
a	1
wall	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
left.	1
	1
14:30	1
Thus	1
the	1
LORD	1
saved	1
Israel	1
that	1
day	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
and	1
Israel	1
saw	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
dead	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
shore.	1
	1
14:31	1
And	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
great	1
work	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
upon	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
believed	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
servant	1
Moses.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
sang	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
this	1
song	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
triumphed	1
gloriously:	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
his	1
rider	1
hath	1
he	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
15:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
song,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
become	1
my	1
salvation:	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
prepare	1
him	1
an	1
habitation;	1
my	1
father's	1
God,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
exalt	1
him.	1
	1
15:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
15:4	1
Pharaoh's	1
chariots	1
and	1
his	1
host	1
hath	1
he	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
his	1
chosen	1
captains	1
also	1
are	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
15:5	1
The	1
depths	1
have	1
covered	1
them:	1
they	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
bottom	1
as	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
15:6	1
Thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
is	1
become	1
glorious	1
in	1
power:	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
hath	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thine	1
excellency	1
thou	1
hast	1
overthrown	1
them	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
thee:	1
thou	1
sentest	1
forth	1
thy	1
wrath,	1
which	1
consumed	1
them	1
as	1
stubble.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
blast	1
of	1
thy	1
nostrils	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
the	1
floods	1
stood	1
upright	1
as	1
an	1
heap,	1
and	1
the	1
depths	1
were	1
congealed	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
15:9	1
The	1
enemy	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
pursue,	1
I	1
will	1
overtake,	1
I	1
will	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil;	1
my	1
lust	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
upon	1
them;	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
my	1
sword,	1
my	1
hand	1
shall	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
15:10	1
Thou	1
didst	1
blow	1
with	1
thy	1
wind,	1
the	1
sea	1
covered	1
them:	1
they	1
sank	1
as	1
lead	1
in	1
the	1
mighty	1
waters.	1
	1
15:11	1
Who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
among	1
the	1
gods?	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
thee,	1
glorious	1
in	1
holiness,	1
fearful	1
in	1
praises,	1
doing	1
wonders?	1
	1
15:12	1
Thou	1
stretchedst	1
out	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
the	1
earth	1
swallowed	1
them.	1
	1
15:13	1
Thou	1
in	1
thy	1
mercy	1
hast	1
led	1
forth	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed:	1
thou	1
hast	1
guided	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
strength	1
unto	1
thy	1
holy	1
habitation.	1
	1
15:14	1
The	1
people	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
be	1
afraid:	1
sorrow	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Palestina.	1
	1
15:15	1
Then	1
the	1
dukes	1
of	1
Edom	1
shall	1
be	1
amazed;	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
Moab,	1
trembling	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
upon	1
them;	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Canaan	1
shall	1
melt	1
away.	1
	1
15:16	1
Fear	1
and	1
dread	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
them;	1
by	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thine	1
arm	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
still	1
as	1
a	1
stone;	1
till	1
thy	1
people	1
pass	1
over,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
till	1
the	1
people	1
pass	1
over,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
purchased.	1
	1
15:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
them	1
in,	1
and	1
plant	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
in	1
the	1
place,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
dwell	1
in,	1
in	1
the	1
Sanctuary,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
which	1
thy	1
hands	1
have	1
established.	1
	1
15:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
15:19	1
For	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
chariots	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
horsemen	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
again	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
upon	1
them;	1
but	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
on	1
dry	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
Miriam	1
the	1
prophetess,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
took	1
a	1
timbrel	1
in	1
her	1
hand;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
went	1
out	1
after	1
her	1
with	1
timbrels	1
and	1
with	1
dances.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
Miriam	1
answered	1
them,	1
Sing	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
triumphed	1
gloriously;	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
his	1
rider	1
hath	1
he	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
15:22	1
So	1
Moses	1
brought	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Shur;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
found	1
no	1
water.	1
	1
15:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Marah,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Marah,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
bitter:	1
therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
Marah.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
drink?	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
him	1
a	1
tree,	1
which	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
waters,	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
made	1
sweet:	1
there	1
he	1
made	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
statute	1
and	1
an	1
ordinance,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
proved	1
them,	1
15:26	1
And	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
diligently	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
wilt	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
wilt	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
keep	1
all	1
his	1
statutes,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
diseases	1
upon	1
thee,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
upon	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
healeth	1
thee.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Elim,	1
where	1
were	1
twelve	1
wells	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
palm	1
trees:	1
and	1
they	1
encamped	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
from	1
Elim,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sin,	1
which	1
is	1
between	1
Elim	1
and	1
Sinai,	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month	1
after	1
their	1
departing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
16:3	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Would	1
to	1
God	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
when	1
we	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
flesh	1
pots,	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
did	1
eat	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
full;	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
us	1
forth	1
into	1
this	1
wilderness,	1
to	1
kill	1
this	1
whole	1
assembly	1
with	1
hunger.	1
	1
16:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
rain	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven	1
for	1
you;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
gather	1
a	1
certain	1
rate	1
every	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
prove	1
them,	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
law,	1
or	1
no.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
they	1
shall	1
prepare	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
bring	1
in;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
gather	1
daily.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
At	1
even,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
16:7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
heareth	1
your	1
murmurings	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
we,	1
that	1
ye	1
murmur	1
against	1
us?	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
This	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
full;	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
heareth	1
your	1
murmurings	1
which	1
ye	1
murmur	1
against	1
him:	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
we?	1
your	1
murmurings	1
are	1
not	1
against	1
us,	1
but	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Say	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Come	1
near	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
heard	1
your	1
murmurings.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Aaron	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
cloud.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
16:12	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
murmurings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
speak	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
At	1
even	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
bread;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
even	1
the	1
quails	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
camp:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
dew	1
lay	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
dew	1
that	1
lay	1
was	1
gone	1
up,	1
behold,	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
there	1
lay	1
a	1
small	1
round	1
thing,	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
the	1
hoar	1
frost	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
It	1
is	1
manna:	1
for	1
they	1
wist	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
16:16	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
Gather	1
of	1
it	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
eating,	1
an	1
omer	1
for	1
every	1
man,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
persons;	1
take	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
tents.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
gathered,	1
some	1
more,	1
some	1
less.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
did	1
mete	1
it	1
with	1
an	1
omer,	1
he	1
that	1
gathered	1
much	1
had	1
nothing	1
over,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
gathered	1
little	1
had	1
no	1
lack;	1
they	1
gathered	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
eating.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
leave	1
of	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
16:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
Moses;	1
but	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
left	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
it	1
bred	1
worms,	1
and	1
stank:	1
and	1
Moses	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
it	1
every	1
morning,	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
eating:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
waxed	1
hot,	1
it	1
melted.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
they	1
gathered	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
bread,	1
two	1
omers	1
for	1
one	1
man:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
Moses.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said,	1
To	1
morrow	1
is	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
sabbath	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
bake	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
will	1
bake	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
seethe	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
seethe;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
over	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
16:24	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
it	1
up	1
till	1
the	1
morning,	1
as	1
Moses	1
bade:	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
stink,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
worm	1
therein.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Eat	1
that	1
to	1
day;	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
sabbath	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
to	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
16:26	1
Six	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
gather	1
it;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
in	1
it	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
none.	1
	1
16:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
for	1
to	1
gather,	1
and	1
they	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
16:28	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
How	1
long	1
refuse	1
ye	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
and	1
my	1
laws?	1
	1
16:29	1
See,	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
therefore	1
he	1
giveth	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
two	1
days;	1
abide	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day.	1
	1
16:30	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day.	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
thereof	1
Manna:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
coriander	1
seed,	1
white;	1
and	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
wafers	1
made	1
with	1
honey.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commandeth,	1
Fill	1
an	1
omer	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
your	1
generations;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
bread	1
wherewith	1
I	1
have	1
fed	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
when	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
16:33	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
a	1
pot,	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
omer	1
full	1
of	1
manna	1
therein,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
16:34	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
Aaron	1
laid	1
it	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
Testimony,	1
to	1
be	1
kept.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
eat	1
manna	1
forty	1
years,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
inhabited;	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
manna,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
16:36	1
Now	1
an	1
omer	1
is	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
ephah.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sin,	1
after	1
their	1
journeys,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Rephidim:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
17:2	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
chide	1
with	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Give	1
us	1
water	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
drink.	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
chide	1
ye	1
with	1
me?	1
wherefore	1
do	1
ye	1
tempt	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
thirsted	1
there	1
for	1
water;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
kill	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
and	1
our	1
cattle	1
with	1
thirst?	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
this	1
people?	1
they	1
be	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
stone	1
me.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
take	1
with	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
thy	1
rod,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
smotest	1
the	1
river,	1
take	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
go.	1
	1
17:6	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
stand	1
before	1
thee	1
there	1
upon	1
the	1
rock	1
in	1
Horeb;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
drink.	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Massah,	1
and	1
Meribah,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
chiding	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
tempted	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
the	1
LORD	1
among	1
us,	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
17:8	1
Then	1
came	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Israel	1
in	1
Rephidim.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Choose	1
us	1
out	1
men,	1
and	1
go	1
out,	1
fight	1
with	1
Amalek:	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
stand	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
mine	1
hand.	1
	1
17:10	1
So	1
Joshua	1
did	1
as	1
Moses	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Amalek:	1
and	1
Moses,	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
Hur	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Moses	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
hand,	1
that	1
Israel	1
prevailed:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
let	1
down	1
his	1
hand,	1
Amalek	1
prevailed.	1
	1
17:12	1
But	1
Moses	1
hands	1
were	1
heavy;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
thereon;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Hur	1
stayed	1
up	1
his	1
hands,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side;	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
steady	1
until	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
Joshua	1
discomfited	1
Amalek	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Write	1
this	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
rehearse	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Joshua:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
Amalek	1
from	1
under	1
heaven.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
built	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Jehovahnissi:	1
17:16	1
For	1
he	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
have	1
war	1
with	1
Amalek	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
18:1	1
When	1
Jethro,	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
for	1
Israel	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
brought	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
18:2	1
Then	1
Jethro,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
took	1
Zipporah,	1
Moses'	1
wife,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
her	1
back,	1
18:3	1
And	1
her	1
two	1
sons;	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Gershom;	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
alien	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land:	1
18:4	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
Eliezer;	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father,	1
said	1
he,	1
was	1
mine	1
help,	1
and	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Pharaoh:	1
18:5	1
And	1
Jethro,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
Moses	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
where	1
he	1
encamped	1
at	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
God:	1
18:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
I	1
thy	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
Jethro	1
am	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
sons	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
did	1
obeisance,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
asked	1
each	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
welfare;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
for	1
Israel's	1
sake,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
travail	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
Jethro	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
goodness	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
Jethro	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
18:11	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
all	1
gods:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
thing	1
wherein	1
they	1
dealt	1
proudly	1
he	1
was	1
above	1
them.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
Jethro,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
took	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
God:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
came,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Moses	1
sat	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
by	1
Moses	1
from	1
the	1
morning	1
unto	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
when	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
doest	1
to	1
the	1
people?	1
why	1
sittest	1
thou	1
thyself	1
alone,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
stand	1
by	1
thee	1
from	1
morning	1
unto	1
even?	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
Because	1
the	1
people	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
God:	1
18:16	1
When	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
matter,	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
judge	1
between	1
one	1
and	1
another,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
make	1
them	1
know	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
his	1
laws.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
doest	1
is	1
not	1
good.	1
	1
18:18	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
surely	1
wear	1
away,	1
both	1
thou,	1
and	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
is	1
too	1
heavy	1
for	1
thee;	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
perform	1
it	1
thyself	1
alone.	1
	1
18:19	1
Hearken	1
now	1
unto	1
my	1
voice,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
counsel,	1
and	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee:	1
Be	1
thou	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
God-ward,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bring	1
the	1
causes	1
unto	1
God:	1
18:20	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
teach	1
them	1
ordinances	1
and	1
laws,	1
and	1
shalt	1
shew	1
them	1
the	1
way	1
wherein	1
they	1
must	1
walk,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
do.	1
	1
18:21	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
shalt	1
provide	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
able	1
men,	1
such	1
as	1
fear	1
God,	1
men	1
of	1
truth,	1
hating	1
covetousness;	1
and	1
place	1
such	1
over	1
them,	1
to	1
be	1
rulers	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
rulers	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
rulers	1
of	1
fifties,	1
and	1
rulers	1
of	1
tens:	1
18:22	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
judge	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
all	1
seasons:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
every	1
great	1
matter	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
every	1
small	1
matter	1
they	1
shall	1
judge:	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
easier	1
for	1
thyself,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
burden	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
18:23	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
God	1
command	1
thee	1
so,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
endure,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
also	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
place	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
18:24	1
So	1
Moses	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
did	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Moses	1
chose	1
able	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
heads	1
over	1
the	1
people,	1
rulers	1
of	1
thousands,	1
rulers	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
rulers	1
of	1
fifties,	1
and	1
rulers	1
of	1
tens.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
they	1
judged	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
all	1
seasons:	1
the	1
hard	1
causes	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
but	1
every	1
small	1
matter	1
they	1
judged	1
themselves.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
Moses	1
let	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
depart;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
19:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
month,	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gone	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
came	1
they	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai.	1
	1
19:2	1
For	1
they	1
were	1
departed	1
from	1
Rephidim,	1
and	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
desert	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
had	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
there	1
Israel	1
camped	1
before	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
19:4	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
I	1
did	1
unto	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
bare	1
you	1
on	1
eagles'	1
wings,	1
and	1
brought	1
you	1
unto	1
myself.	1
	1
19:5	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
obey	1
my	1
voice	1
indeed,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
covenant,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
peculiar	1
treasure	1
unto	1
me	1
above	1
all	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
mine:	1
19:6	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
me	1
a	1
kingdom	1
of	1
priests,	1
and	1
an	1
holy	1
nation.	1
	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
came	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
laid	1
before	1
their	1
faces	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
together,	1
and	1
said,	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
we	1
will	1
do.	1
And	1
Moses	1
returned	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
hear	1
when	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
believe	1
thee	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
them	1
to	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
wash	1
their	1
clothes,	1
19:11	1
And	1
be	1
ready	1
against	1
the	1
third	1
day:	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
bounds	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
ye	1
go	1
not	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount,	1
or	1
touch	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
it:	1
whosoever	1
toucheth	1
the	1
mount	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
19:13	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hand	1
touch	1
it,	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
stoned,	1
or	1
shot	1
through;	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
beast	1
or	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
live:	1
when	1
the	1
trumpet	1
soundeth	1
long,	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
their	1
clothes.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Be	1
ready	1
against	1
the	1
third	1
day:	1
come	1
not	1
at	1
your	1
wives.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
thunders	1
and	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud	1
upon	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
exceeding	1
loud;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
trembled.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
God;	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
nether	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
was	1
altogether	1
on	1
a	1
smoke,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
descended	1
upon	1
it	1
in	1
fire:	1
and	1
the	1
smoke	1
thereof	1
ascended	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
furnace,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
mount	1
quaked	1
greatly.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
sounded	1
long,	1
and	1
waxed	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
Moses	1
spake,	1
and	1
God	1
answered	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
voice.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
down	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
Moses	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount;	1
and	1
Moses	1
went	1
up.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
down,	1
charge	1
the	1
people,	1
lest	1
they	1
break	1
through	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
gaze,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
perish.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
priests	1
also,	1
which	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
sanctify	1
themselves,	1
lest	1
the	1
LORD	1
break	1
forth	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
people	1
cannot	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
mount	1
Sinai:	1
for	1
thou	1
chargedst	1
us,	1
saying,	1
Set	1
bounds	1
about	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
it.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Away,	1
get	1
thee	1
down,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
up,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Aaron	1
with	1
thee:	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
break	1
through	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
lest	1
he	1
break	1
forth	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
19:25	1
So	1
Moses	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
saying,	1
20:2	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
20:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
gods	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
20:4	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
unto	1
thee	1
any	1
graven	1
image,	1
or	1
any	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
under	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
20:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bow	1
down	1
thyself	1
to	1
them,	1
nor	1
serve	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
am	1
a	1
jealous	1
God,	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
generation	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me;	1
20:6	1
And	1
shewing	1
mercy	1
unto	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
me,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments.	1
	1
20:7	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
vain;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
hold	1
him	1
guiltless	1
that	1
taketh	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
20:8	1
Remember	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
holy.	1
	1
20:9	1
Six	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
labour,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
thy	1
work:	1
20:10	1
But	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
in	1
it	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
do	1
any	1
work,	1
thou,	1
nor	1
thy	1
son,	1
nor	1
thy	1
daughter,	1
thy	1
manservant,	1
nor	1
thy	1
maidservant,	1
nor	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
nor	1
thy	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
thy	1
gates:	1
20:11	1
For	1
in	1
six	1
days	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
them	1
is,	1
and	1
rested	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
hallowed	1
it.	1
	1
20:12	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother:	1
that	1
thy	1
days	1
may	1
be	1
long	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee.	1
	1
20:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill.	1
	1
20:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
20:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal.	1
	1
20:16	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
thy	1
neighbour.	1
	1
20:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
house,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
nor	1
his	1
manservant,	1
nor	1
his	1
maidservant,	1
nor	1
his	1
ox,	1
nor	1
his	1
ass,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
thy	1
neighbour's.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
the	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
the	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
smoking:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
removed,	1
and	1
stood	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Speak	1
thou	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
hear:	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
God	1
speak	1
with	1
us,	1
lest	1
we	1
die.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
prove	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
fear	1
may	1
be	1
before	1
your	1
faces,	1
that	1
ye	1
sin	1
not.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
Moses	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
thick	1
darkness	1
where	1
God	1
was.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Thus	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
talked	1
with	1
you	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
20:23	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
with	1
me	1
gods	1
of	1
silver,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
unto	1
you	1
gods	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
20:24	1
An	1
altar	1
of	1
earth	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
shalt	1
sacrifice	1
thereon	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
thy	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
thy	1
sheep,	1
and	1
thine	1
oxen:	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
where	1
I	1
record	1
my	1
name	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
make	1
me	1
an	1
altar	1
of	1
stone,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
build	1
it	1
of	1
hewn	1
stone:	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
tool	1
upon	1
it,	1
thou	1
hast	1
polluted	1
it.	1
	1
20:26	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go	1
up	1
by	1
steps	1
unto	1
mine	1
altar,	1
that	1
thy	1
nakedness	1
be	1
not	1
discovered	1
thereon.	1
	1
21:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
judgments	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
21:2	1
If	1
thou	1
buy	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
servant,	1
six	1
years	1
he	1
shall	1
serve:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
free	1
for	1
nothing.	1
	1
21:3	1
If	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
by	1
himself,	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
by	1
himself:	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
married,	1
then	1
his	1
wife	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:4	1
If	1
his	1
master	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
she	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
sons	1
or	1
daughters;	1
the	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
children	1
shall	1
be	1
her	1
master's,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
by	1
himself.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
servant	1
shall	1
plainly	1
say,	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
master,	1
my	1
wife,	1
and	1
my	1
children;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
free:	1
21:6	1
Then	1
his	1
master	1
shall	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
judges;	1
he	1
shall	1
also	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
or	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
post;	1
and	1
his	1
master	1
shall	1
bore	1
his	1
ear	1
through	1
with	1
an	1
aul;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
serve	1
him	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
sell	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
maidservant,	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
menservants	1
do.	1
	1
21:8	1
If	1
she	1
please	1
not	1
her	1
master,	1
who	1
hath	1
betrothed	1
her	1
to	1
himself,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
redeemed:	1
to	1
sell	1
her	1
unto	1
a	1
strange	1
nation	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
power,	1
seeing	1
he	1
hath	1
dealt	1
deceitfully	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
betrothed	1
her	1
unto	1
his	1
son,	1
he	1
shall	1
deal	1
with	1
her	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
daughters.	1
	1
21:10	1
If	1
he	1
take	1
him	1
another	1
wife;	1
her	1
food,	1
her	1
raiment,	1
and	1
her	1
duty	1
of	1
marriage,	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
diminish.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
do	1
not	1
these	1
three	1
unto	1
her,	1
then	1
shall	1
she	1
go	1
out	1
free	1
without	1
money.	1
	1
21:12	1
He	1
that	1
smiteth	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
die,	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lie	1
not	1
in	1
wait,	1
but	1
God	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
hand;	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
appoint	1
thee	1
a	1
place	1
whither	1
he	1
shall	1
flee.	1
	1
21:14	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
come	1
presumptuously	1
upon	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
with	1
guile;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
him	1
from	1
mine	1
altar,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
smiteth	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
stealeth	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
selleth	1
him,	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
curseth	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
if	1
men	1
strive	1
together,	1
and	1
one	1
smite	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
stone,	1
or	1
with	1
his	1
fist,	1
and	1
he	1
die	1
not,	1
but	1
keepeth	1
his	1
bed:	1
21:19	1
If	1
he	1
rise	1
again,	1
and	1
walk	1
abroad	1
upon	1
his	1
staff,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
smote	1
him	1
be	1
quit:	1
only	1
he	1
shall	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
time,	1
and	1
shall	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
thoroughly	1
healed.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
smite	1
his	1
servant,	1
or	1
his	1
maid,	1
with	1
a	1
rod,	1
and	1
he	1
die	1
under	1
his	1
hand;	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
punished.	1
	1
21:21	1
Notwithstanding,	1
if	1
he	1
continue	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
punished:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
his	1
money.	1
	1
21:22	1
If	1
men	1
strive,	1
and	1
hurt	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
child,	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
fruit	1
depart	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
yet	1
no	1
mischief	1
follow:	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
punished,	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
woman's	1
husband	1
will	1
lay	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
pay	1
as	1
the	1
judges	1
determine.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
mischief	1
follow,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
life	1
for	1
life,	1
21:24	1
Eye	1
for	1
eye,	1
tooth	1
for	1
tooth,	1
hand	1
for	1
hand,	1
foot	1
for	1
foot,	1
21:25	1
Burning	1
for	1
burning,	1
wound	1
for	1
wound,	1
stripe	1
for	1
stripe.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
smite	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
or	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
his	1
maid,	1
that	1
it	1
perish;	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
free	1
for	1
his	1
eye's	1
sake.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
smite	1
out	1
his	1
manservant's	1
tooth,	1
or	1
his	1
maidservant's	1
tooth;	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
free	1
for	1
his	1
tooth's	1
sake.	1
	1
21:28	1
If	1
an	1
ox	1
gore	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
woman,	1
that	1
they	1
die:	1
then	1
the	1
ox	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
stoned,	1
and	1
his	1
flesh	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten;	1
but	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ox	1
shall	1
be	1
quit.	1
	1
21:29	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
ox	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
push	1
with	1
his	1
horn	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
testified	1
to	1
his	1
owner,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
kept	1
him	1
in,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
killed	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
woman;	1
the	1
ox	1
shall	1
be	1
stoned,	1
and	1
his	1
owner	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:30	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
for	1
the	1
ransom	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
laid	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
21:31	1
Whether	1
he	1
have	1
gored	1
a	1
son,	1
or	1
have	1
gored	1
a	1
daughter,	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
judgment	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
21:32	1
If	1
the	1
ox	1
shall	1
push	1
a	1
manservant	1
or	1
a	1
maidservant;	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
their	1
master	1
thirty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
ox	1
shall	1
be	1
stoned.	1
	1
21:33	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
open	1
a	1
pit,	1
or	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
dig	1
a	1
pit,	1
and	1
not	1
cover	1
it,	1
and	1
an	1
ox	1
or	1
an	1
ass	1
fall	1
therein;	1
21:34	1
The	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
shall	1
make	1
it	1
good,	1
and	1
give	1
money	1
unto	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
beast	1
shall	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
21:35	1
And	1
if	1
one	1
man's	1
ox	1
hurt	1
another's,	1
that	1
he	1
die;	1
then	1
they	1
shall	1
sell	1
the	1
live	1
ox,	1
and	1
divide	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
ox	1
also	1
they	1
shall	1
divide.	1
	1
21:36	1
Or	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
ox	1
hath	1
used	1
to	1
push	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
and	1
his	1
owner	1
hath	1
not	1
kept	1
him	1
in;	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
pay	1
ox	1
for	1
ox;	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
own.	1
	1
22:1	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
steal	1
an	1
ox,	1
or	1
a	1
sheep,	1
and	1
kill	1
it,	1
or	1
sell	1
it;	1
he	1
shall	1
restore	1
five	1
oxen	1
for	1
an	1
ox,	1
and	1
four	1
sheep	1
for	1
a	1
sheep.	1
	1
22:2	1
If	1
a	1
thief	1
be	1
found	1
breaking	1
up,	1
and	1
be	1
smitten	1
that	1
he	1
die,	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
blood	1
be	1
shed	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
22:3	1
If	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
risen	1
upon	1
him,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
blood	1
shed	1
for	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
full	1
restitution;	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
nothing,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
sold	1
for	1
his	1
theft.	1
	1
22:4	1
If	1
the	1
theft	1
be	1
certainly	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
alive,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
ox,	1
or	1
ass,	1
or	1
sheep;	1
he	1
shall	1
restore	1
double.	1
	1
22:5	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
cause	1
a	1
field	1
or	1
vineyard	1
to	1
be	1
eaten,	1
and	1
shall	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
beast,	1
and	1
shall	1
feed	1
in	1
another	1
man's	1
field;	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

field,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
own	1

shall	1
he	1
make	1
restitution.	1
	1
22:6	1
If	1

in	1
thorns,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1

consumed	1
therewith;	1
he	1
that	1
kindled	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
surely	1
make	1
restitution.	1
	1
22:7	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
deliver	1
unto	1
his	1

money	1

double.	1
	1
22:8	1
If	1
the	1
thief	1
be	1
not	1

then	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1

	1
22:9	1
For	1

his,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
both	1
parties	1
shall	1
come	1
before	1
the	1
judges;	1
and	1
whom	1
the	1
judges	1
shall	1
condemn,	1
he	1
shall	1
pay	1
double	1
unto	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
22:10	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
deliver	1
unto	1
his	1
neighbour	1
an	1
ass,	1
or	1
an	1
ox,	1
or	1
a	1
sheep,	1
or	1
any	1
beast,	1
to	1
keep;	1
and	1
it	1
die,	1
or	1
be	1
hurt,	1
or	1
driven	1
away,	1
no	1
man	1
seeing	1
it:	1
22:11	1
Then	1
shall	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
between	1
them	1
both,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
unto	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
goods;	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
accept	1
thereof,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
good.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
stolen	1
from	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
restitution	1
unto	1
the	1
owner	1
thereof.	1
	1
22:13	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
torn	1
in	1
pieces,	1
then	1
let	1
him	1
bring	1
it	1
for	1
witness,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
good	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
torn.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
borrow	1
ought	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
hurt,	1
or	1
die,	1
the	1
owner	1
thereof	1
being	1
not	1
with	1
it,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
make	1
it	1
good.	1
	1
22:15	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
owner	1
thereof	1
be	1
with	1
it,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
good:	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
an	1
hired	1
thing,	1
it	1
came	1
for	1
his	1
hire.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
entice	1
a	1
maid	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
betrothed,	1
and	1
lie	1
with	1
her,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
endow	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
22:17	1
If	1
her	1
father	1
utterly	1
refuse	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
pay	1
money	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
dowry	1
of	1
virgins.	1
	1
22:18	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
suffer	1
a	1
witch	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
22:19	1
Whosoever	1
lieth	1
with	1
a	1
beast	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
22:20	1
He	1
that	1
sacrificeth	1
unto	1
any	1
god,	1
save	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
only,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
destroyed.	1
	1
22:21	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
neither	1
vex	1
a	1
stranger,	1
nor	1
oppress	1
him:	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
22:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
afflict	1
any	1
widow,	1
or	1
fatherless	1
child.	1
	1
22:23	1
If	1
thou	1
afflict	1
them	1
in	1
any	1
wise,	1
and	1
they	1
cry	1
at	1
all	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
hear	1
their	1
cry;	1
22:24	1
And	1
my	1
wrath	1
shall	1
wax	1
hot,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
kill	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
your	1
wives	1
shall	1
be	1
widows,	1
and	1
your	1
children	1
fatherless.	1
	1
22:25	1
If	1
thou	1
lend	1
money	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
poor	1
by	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
usurer,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
lay	1
upon	1
him	1
usury.	1
	1
22:26	1
If	1
thou	1
at	1
all	1
take	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
raiment	1
to	1
pledge,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deliver	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
goeth	1
down:	1
22:27	1
For	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
covering	1
only,	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
raiment	1
for	1
his	1
skin:	1
wherein	1
shall	1
he	1
sleep?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
crieth	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
hear;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
gracious.	1
	1
22:28	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
revile	1
the	1
gods,	1
nor	1
curse	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
22:29	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
thy	1
ripe	1
fruits,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
liquors:	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
shalt	1
thou	1
give	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
22:30	1
Likewise	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
with	1
thine	1
oxen,	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
sheep:	1
seven	1
days	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
his	1
dam;	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
it	1
me.	1
	1
22:31	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
men	1
unto	1
me:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
any	1
flesh	1
that	1
is	1
torn	1
of	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
ye	1
shall	1
cast	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
dogs.	1
	1
23:1	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
raise	1
a	1
false	1
report:	1
put	1
not	1
thine	1
hand	1
with	1
the	1
wicked	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
unrighteous	1
witness.	1
	1
23:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
follow	1
a	1
multitude	1
to	1
do	1
evil;	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
speak	1
in	1
a	1
cause	1
to	1
decline	1
after	1
many	1
to	1
wrest	1
judgment:	1
23:3	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
countenance	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
cause.	1
	1
23:4	1
If	1
thou	1
meet	1
thine	1
enemy's	1
ox	1
or	1
his	1
ass	1
going	1
astray,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
bring	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
23:5	1
If	1
thou	1
see	1
the	1
ass	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hateth	1
thee	1
lying	1
under	1
his	1
burden,	1
and	1
wouldest	1
forbear	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
help	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
23:6	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
wrest	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
thy	1
poor	1
in	1
his	1
cause.	1
	1
23:7	1
Keep	1
thee	1
far	1
from	1
a	1
false	1
matter;	1
and	1
the	1
innocent	1
and	1
righteous	1
slay	1
thou	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
justify	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
no	1
gift:	1
for	1
the	1
gift	1
blindeth	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
perverteth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
23:9	1
Also	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
oppress	1
a	1
stranger:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
stranger,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
were	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
six	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sow	1
thy	1
land,	1
and	1
shalt	1
gather	1
in	1
the	1
fruits	1
thereof:	1
23:11	1
But	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
thou	1
shalt	1
let	1
it	1
rest	1
and	1
lie	1
still;	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
may	1
eat:	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
leave	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
eat.	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deal	1
with	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
oliveyard.	1
	1
23:12	1
Six	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
thy	1
work,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest:	1
that	1
thine	1
ox	1
and	1
thine	1
ass	1
may	1
rest,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
thy	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger,	1
may	1
be	1
refreshed.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
be	1
circumspect:	1
and	1
make	1
no	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
other	1
gods,	1
neither	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:14	1
Three	1
times	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
23:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread:	1
(thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
seven	1
days,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Abib;	1
for	1
in	1
it	1
thou	1
camest	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
appear	1
before	1
me	1
empty:)	1
23:16	1
And	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
harvest,	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
thy	1
labours,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sown	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
ingathering,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
gathered	1
in	1
thy	1
labours	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
23:17	1
Three	1
items	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
all	1
thy	1
males	1
shall	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
God.	1
	1
23:18	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
offer	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
leavened	1
bread;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
remain	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
23:19	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
seethe	1
a	1
kid	1
in	1
his	1
mother's	1
milk.	1
	1
23:20	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
an	1
Angel	1
before	1
thee,	1
to	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
prepared.	1
	1
23:21	1
Beware	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
obey	1
his	1
voice,	1
provoke	1
him	1
not;	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
pardon	1
your	1
transgressions:	1
for	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
23:22	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
indeed	1
obey	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
speak;	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
enemy	1
unto	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
an	1
adversary	1
unto	1
thine	1
adversaries.	1
	1
23:23	1
For	1
mine	1
Angel	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
bring	1
thee	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
them	1
off.	1
	1
23:24	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
gods,	1
nor	1
serve	1
them,	1
nor	1
do	1
after	1
their	1
works:	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
utterly	1
overthrow	1
them,	1
and	1
quite	1
break	1
down	1
their	1
images.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bless	1
thy	1
bread,	1
and	1
thy	1
water;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
sickness	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
23:26	1
There	1
shall	1
nothing	1
cast	1
their	1
young,	1
nor	1
be	1
barren,	1
in	1
thy	1
land:	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thy	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
fulfil.	1
	1
23:27	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
fear	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
turn	1
their	1
backs	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
hornets	1
before	1
thee,	1
which	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
from	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
23:29	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
one	1
year;	1
lest	1
the	1
land	1
become	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
multiply	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
23:30	1
By	1
little	1
and	1
little	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
be	1
increased,	1
and	1
inherit	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:31	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
thy	1
bounds	1
from	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
desert	1
unto	1
the	1
river:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
your	1
hand;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
23:32	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
no	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
nor	1
with	1
their	1
gods.	1
	1
23:33	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
thy	1
land,	1
lest	1
they	1
make	1
thee	1
sin	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
serve	1
their	1
gods,	1
it	1
will	1
surely	1
be	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Come	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
Nadab,	1
and	1
Abihu,	1
and	1
seventy	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
worship	1
ye	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Moses	1
alone	1
shall	1
come	1
near	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
people	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
judgments:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
with	1
one	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
All	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
will	1
we	1
do.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
builded	1
an	1
altar	1
under	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
twelve	1
pillars,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
peace	1
offerings	1
of	1
oxen	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
basons;	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
on	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
24:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
and	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
will	1
we	1
do,	1
and	1
be	1
obedient.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
with	1
you	1
concerning	1
all	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
24:9	1
Then	1
went	1
up	1
Moses,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
Nadab,	1
and	1
Abihu,	1
and	1
seventy	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel:	1
24:10	1
And	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
paved	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
sapphire	1
stone,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
heaven	1
in	1
his	1
clearness.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
he	1
laid	1
not	1
his	1
hand:	1
also	1
they	1
saw	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Come	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
be	1
there:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
and	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
teach	1
them.	1
	1
24:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
minister	1
Joshua:	1
and	1
Moses	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders,	1
Tarry	1
ye	1
here	1
for	1
us,	1
until	1
we	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
you:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Hur	1
are	1
with	1
you:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
any	1
matters	1
to	1
do,	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
a	1
cloud	1
covered	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
abode	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
the	1
cloud	1
covered	1
it	1
six	1
days:	1
and	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
Moses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
cloud.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
like	1
devouring	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
gat	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount:	1
and	1
Moses	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights.	1
	1
25:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
25:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
bring	1
me	1
an	1
offering:	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
giveth	1
it	1
willingly	1
with	1
his	1
heart	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
my	1
offering.	1
	1
25:3	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
offering	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
them;	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
brass,	1
25:4	1
And	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
goats'	1
hair,	1
25:5	1
And	1
rams'	1
skins	1
dyed	1
red,	1
and	1
badgers'	1
skins,	1
and	1
shittim	1
wood,	1
25:6	1
Oil	1
for	1
the	1
light,	1
spices	1
for	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
for	1
sweet	1
incense,	1
25:7	1
Onyx	1
stones,	1
and	1
stones	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
breastplate.	1
	1
25:8	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
sanctuary;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
dwell	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
25:9	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
shew	1
thee,	1
after	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
instruments	1
thereof,	1
even	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
it.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
ark	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood:	1
two	1
cubits	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
a	1

and	1
a	1
half	1
the	1

thereof,	1
and	1
a	1

and	1
a	1
half	1
the	1
height	1
thereof.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
overlay	1
it	1
with	1
pure	1
gold,	1
within	1
and	1
without	1
shalt	1
thou	1
overlay	1
it,	1
and	1
shalt	1
make	1
upon	1
it	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
gold	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
25:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cast	1
four	1
rings	1
of	1
gold	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
thereof;	1
and	1
two	1
rings	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
two	1
rings	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
staves	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood,	1
and	1
overlay	1
them	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
the	1
staves	1
into	1
the	1
rings	1
by	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
that	1
the	1
ark	1
may	1
be	1
borne	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
25:15	1
The	1
staves	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
rings	1
of	1
the	1
ark:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
25:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
ark	1
the	1
testimony	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
25:17	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
a	1

	1
25:18	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
two	1
cherubims	1
of	1
gold,	1
of	1
beaten	1
work	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
them,	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat.	1
	1
25:19	1
And	1
make	1
one	1
cherub	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
end,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
cherub	1
on	1
the	1

even	1
of	1
the	1

shall	1
ye	1
make	1
the	1
cherubims	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
thereof.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
the	1
cherubims	1
shall	1
stretch	1
forth	1
their	1
wings	1
on	1
high,	1
covering	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
with	1
their	1

	1
25:21	1
And	1
thou	1

above	1
upon	1
the	1
